"[wp] his genuine willingness to help people despite his own situation was offputting, he never asked for anything back. during your travels you were always prepared for the eventual betrayal that never came.","so much left unsaid in the best way, short and sweet. i love it."
"[wp] its day 87 of the alien invasion. besides the various militaries of the world, the only thing functioning is waffle house. all of them.","its a small thing to eat a hot meal. be it the eggs, bacon, or waffles, the sight in and of itself is a welcome reprieve from the chaos as i set my bloodstained duffle bag of the booth and stare into my shaking gloves. theyre stained with blood, and im missing my two smallest fingers on my right hand. 

but im alive as the waitress, who had ushered me inside, finally appears at the table with a worried expression and notepad. her voice is quiet despite the distant thunder of falling artillery. are you alright, sir? 

the best i can do is to point my still bleeding and mangled hand toward her while doing my best to keep my gaze from blurring. just get me the waffle. the white house is gone, and all my friends are dead. ill pay you anything you want.

... 

her silence spoke volumes as she began to pen the order. it was just me and the sound of the pen on paper as i closed my eyes tight and fought the urge to scream. this couldnt be real i mustve died in that forest with everyone else.

do you want coffee with that?

yes please. the sound of tearing paper cut the silence as i looked up to see her gaze turn toward a distant chef in the rear kitchen. the mans fuzzy white mustache spoke to the ancient wisdom he held. 

i need an allstarspecial! the chef nodded before disappearing, and the sounds of clattering kitchen utensils began. 

with the matter settled, she refocused her attention and sat down hard on the opposite side of the booth with the torn ticket in hand. this ones free if you can tell me whats going on out there.

i stared at the table for a moment and studied its long grain as sorrow threatened to break my weary bearing. that trace memory of the expeditions second day and the family hung from a tree terrorized my mind. and yet i whispered under my breath. theyre not taking prisoners.

who?

bandits, aliens, it doesnt matter, its hell. again the din of that pen rolling across the paper rattled as i cast a glance toward the midnight forest beyond. itd been eighty days, but it feels like years since ive been able to just sit in the somber quiet.

but it was the grim sigh from the hostess that drew my attention as she set down her notes onto the table. we cant stay here then. 

i looked down in shame wed failed. then again there was only so much that we could do if even the waffle house was closing."
"[wp]how are you still alive?! same way you are. as you pick the bullets out of your skull and heart, she puts the gun down and starts pulling the barbed harpoon out of her ribcage. both of you are completely unfazed. always thought i was the only one. she smirks.","seriously?! i asked in disbelief, my voice coming out louder than i had meant for it to be. i could tell my look of absolute shock at the revelation of her obliviousness had struck a nerve. 

dont give me that look jack ass! how was i supposed to know that there were more like me out in the world, the small brooding girl had her back turned to me as she spoke, i could tell she was more than just a little upset solely from her tone.

besides, its not like you were exactly walking around with a big ass sign that said, im an immortal on your chest. if, anything, youre the asshole for keeping secrets, her back was still to me, but her tone had softened.  i thought we were a team. she sounded as if on the verge of tears.

ugh... i hate it when she cries.

emma, i said softly while reaching out and placing my hand on her shoulder and squeezing gently. she pulled away weakly at first, but my hand remained firmly on her shoulder to reassure her that i was here for her. 

i didnt mean to hide this from you. weve been so caught up in escaping that i havent had the time to tell you. i squeezed her a bit more firmly this time and i could feel her hardened shoulders loosen ever so slightly. i know that you are scared and that it feels impossible to trust anyone right now, but i need you to believe me when i say that i only want to keep you safe and get you somewhere you can live the life you deserve.

what happened to you back home, and what thosethose bastards wanted to do to you... i felt my face flush with anger. my entire body tensed and trembled at the thought of what could have happened to the poor girl had i not found her before the fucking shop had managed to get their hands on her.

 i could feel emma tensing again. i was scaring her. i needed to calm down... i inhaled deeply and slowly to calm myself down.

im so sorry you had to go through that emma. mom and dad shouldnt have called those people, i know you believed in your heart that you could trust them

"[wp] when your born with magic your eyes reflect what type your born with. fire users have eyes like pools of magma, air users have swirling tornadoes, ice users have glacial expanses. you where born with eyes like black holes.","i sit in pitch black darkness, reading some books.  
perks of having night vision, i guess.  
then, 4 knocks on my door, before hurried steps are heard further, and further away from my room.  
i open it, and squint because of the faint light in the hallway.  
a tray of food sits on the floor, as usually, my dinner.  
thank you. i mutter to no one in particular, before eating it right there.  
then i go back inside, as some servant will take the tray away, but not before making sure i am in my room.  
such is my life...as someone with darkness magic.

  
in our world, when you are born with magic, your eyes reflect the type.  
fire users have eyes like pools of magma, or like bonfires blazing through the darkest nights.  
wind users have swirling tornadoes, or hurricanes.  
ice users have glacial expanses, with blizzards raging deep within.  
me?  
i have been born with eyes like black holes...endless, hungering darkness.  
and ever since then, i was locked in this room.  
first, with a nanny, and then...all alone.  
why?  
because i am historys first recorded darkness magic wielder.

  
what could i do, that i terrified people so much?  
they dont even know, i think.  
the first act of magic i ever did, was when my nanny was sent away, and i wrapped the darkness around me, creating a sturdy cloak.  
since then, i learnt to manipulate darkness, and use it to devour stuff.  
i can eat light with my darkness, and heat, but i dont know about other sources of energy.  
i also can travel through shadows, and darkness, and eavesdrop.  
i never left my room in the last 15 years, but i know everything.  
thats why i am still here.

  
my parents, goddess above bless their heart, still worry about me.  
they havent stopped, stealthily trying to find someone they can trust, to look at me.  
a mage or an alchemist or someone.  
they are scared for me...because my mana is really, really dark, and deep.  
they think i am fated for an ill outcome, and want to help me.  
its a bit ironic.  
what can be worse than never seeing your parents in person, and having all servants and everyone run away in fear of you?  
sigh...  
i wonder if moms or dads hug would feel the same way, as when darkness hugs me?  
i...i am getting tired of listening to them.  
i know i am not dangerous to anyone...so why? why shouldnt i leave my room?"
"[wp] the princess can only be awoken from her slumber by her true love, but countless princes have failed to do so. when a poor townsman is successful, the royals try to dispose of the man and convince the princess that one of the princes is her true love.","thank you.

"[wp] every year for the last decade, every girlfriend youve ever had as dumped you after visiting their hometown on christmas eve right as you are finishing a huge project at work that would have set you up for life. but this last time was the last straw, and you confront her this time.","not exactly to the confrontation part of the prompt, but i think the important part is that the prompt inspires you to put words on the page, yeah?



  
as i step out of the diner, my despondent look slowly gives way to a warm smile.  my shoulders rise.  i lift my head, letting out a puff of steam into the cold winters air.  man, i love winter

yknow babyface, some people might call this intruding on anothers guys turf.

i whirl at the voice to see an old man in plaid, his flabby arms crossed over his chest, and despite the words, a warm smile gracing his rosy cheeks. 

i raise my hands, the wind disturbing a perfect curl of hair over my forehead.  i have no idea what youre talking about, old man.  you have your ways of getting ready for your time of year, i have mine.

still, do you have to do it so close to my time?  you dont see me spreading tinsel over peoples valentines.

well, how else am i going to ensure these relationships are at their peak just in time for my day? 

hmph, he chuckles, a little hoho that rumbles up from his jiggling belly.   there has to be a more efficient way of doing this, though, i have a whole workshop devoted to me, youre literally doing this for one overworked woman at a time.

oh, there is, but the bow and arrow is so impersonal, i reply, smiling with a little wink as my wings unfurl from under my jacket.  and besides, its easier to push these ladies into the arms of the right person when youre personally involved.  humans can be awfully stubborn like that, even with the right arrow."
"[wp] youve been trapped in a vr game for years, learnt magic, had a family, etc. but now theyve rescued you from it all. waking up on the hospital bed you reflexively cast a shield. which works.","[part.b]

blooming is a way to permanently live in the alternet, his dad started the explanation. the nanos that are supposed to keep you alive continue improving the process until basically they give you a root system. then, a redwood sapling starts growing in you, and out of you, capturing your soul and taking over as your body. we didnt know how to tell you there was a sapling coming out of your chest. 



i was a tree?? it was concerning in and of itself, but there were deeper implications. how did i come back from being a tree?? as he asked the question, he felt his mom squeeze his hand tighter, and warm tears landed on his fingers. 



you dont come back from that, son, his dad shook his head. 



i was rescued... wasnt i? he asked. his dad gave another subtle shake. 



not in the way you might think. your rescue is just us getting a chance to reunite, he gestured at the hospital around them. were in the alternet right now. we were making our characters when you woke up, he added.  



so.... my bodys dead, or i guess a tree. im still trapped in the alternet, then? he asked. 



your spirit is alive, his dad nodded. this will be much better than just texts and emails.



yeah..., drew nodded. he was happy, but also not. but now i have to go through getting a divorce instead of just leaving."
"[wp] they say that those born under the light of the full moon are blessed with prophetic powers, while those born under the first rays of dawn sunlight are said to be destined to be great warriors. however, in your case, you were born at the time of a powerful eclipse","ironic that this is popping up on my feed, given the crossover fanfic im in the middle of writing.

long story short, theres a form of magic called eclipse magic that comes in two forms solar and lunar. humans born on the summer solstice have solar magic, and humans born on the winter solstice have lunar magic. obviously, solar and lunar magic draw power from and resemble the sun and the moon, respectively. solar magic is highly volatile and very straightforward  it either heals in large bursts or explodes violently when unleashed. lunar magic is more defensive and stable  it can form shields, heal minor wounds, and produce solid strikes in the form of giant crescent arcs or crescentmoon discus projectiles.

under ordinary circumstances, a person can only have either solar or lunar magic, and theres an order composed of these humans that pairs sun recruits with moon recruits.

then a kid gets born in the middle of a total solar eclipse and gets both kinds at the same time.

note this magic system is not my own creation. it comes from the indie title sea of stars, which is an absolutely phenomenal game, i cannot recommend it enough."
[wp] you joined the evil wizard? the isekaid chosen one asked in astonishment to the man wearing modernlooking clothing. evil?! he wasnt the one who stole some random kid from earth because they couldnt be bothered to assassinate some outspoken geezer themself!,"you have been kidnapped kid , your parents must be absolutely worried sick

this is a trap, has to be.

krill chanted the incantation 

incendio , insidious

and blew . a ball of fire erupted from his mouth and rapidly made its way towards lance. scorching , blinding pure energy. it seared the ground below as it hurtled towards its target. 

lance swatted the ball away into the sky with a flourish . his face looking more exasperated than annoyed 

kid  lance sighed please listen to what im trying to say

lance removed his mask to reveal  a bespectacled face  with a goatee. he was also bald

you have what we call in the business stockholm syndrome 

lance composed himself 

imagine you are a the newly crowned king of a kingdom which was a product of a conquest led by your dad and a certain wizard your kingdom , a powerful wizard , a healer , a former advisor of the old guard begins to get popular with the people

krill lunged with his sword , lance easily sidestepped and had his dagger out 

you start spreading rumours , make any excuse possible to paint him as a world ending threat 

lance deflected a slash with his dagger as the force of the blows rang across the isolated woods. the trees all but blocked out the sun and shrouded them both in shade 

and sic your army on him 

shut up, shut up , shut up

krill dropped his sword .

 so im not the chosen one ?

no kid  lance shook his head 

just astronomically unlucky

and just like that the chosen one disappeared, destined to wake up on his bed after 3 long years.

"[wp] youre a student at a mages college where no subject is forbidden, with the understanding that some research is best kept quiet. after working on a new spell for years, youre the first apprentice to stand before a council of instructors debating whether it should be banned from future study.","when did i first get the idea?

it was my first couple of weeks after the start of school. i received a letter from my mother. it was short and to the point, but it cut deep.

father dying. come home.

my father had a wasting sickness. the cure is temperamental sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. a cruel game of fate.

i rushed home as quickly as i could. luckily my professor was understanding and wrote dozens of permission slips for me. even so, i was too late. my father died the day before i arrived.

i felt the grief keenly. wed been close all through my childhood hed taught me many skills and many truths. it was he who helped me overcome my doubts about attending the college. i wanted so badly to speak with him, to hold him, even if it was only one more time.

in my grief, i threw myself into study beyond what my classes entailed. i kept it a careful secret, working at night in abandoned classrooms, devoting every spare moment. my friends were aware from day one, but they covered for me, supporting in the throes of my obsession far more than i deserved.

the only other person who found out before now was my professor. hed looked at me with that twinkle in his eyes, and suggested i do a better job of keeping it secret. the same twinkle is in his eyes now as he sits amid the board of instructors who will decide my fate.

while its true, no spell is expressly forbidden, there are some that are collectively avoided. the evil magics employed by the vermin kingdom, for one. another was necromancy.

now then. the principal clears his throat and takes off his glasses. louis. your fellow apprentices have vouched for your character. you dont seem megalomaniac. but you do understand the seriousness of this.

yes sir.

the creation of a new spell, for someone of your age, is unprecedented. necromancy

sir, with all respect, its not necromancy.

the chamber is deathly silent. the principals face is stone. my professor mouths one word. careful.

it allows communication with the dead, boy. his voice is harsh. what else would you call that?

sir, necromancy is bringing back people who are already dead. my spell allows people who are dying to embrace and say goodbye to their loved ones, even if theyre far away.

the principal sits back. does it work?

its not quite ready. i need to test it properly.

im willing to supervise testing, my professor says. a vote of confidence that swings the scales of judgement.

the principal writes something on the page before him before looking up.

you can go now. we will come to a decision soon.

i bow and make my way to the door. he says one more thing before i am out of earshot.

next time, please ask for permission."
"[wp] youre a teacher in a class of kids with supernatural abilities. you hit them with a ridiculously hard test at the start and end of the year, not to see what they know, but to see if they can cheat without being noticed. you notice one of your students actually, genuinely knew the material","there was a nervous tremble to his step as he walked into my office. the first thing his eyes fell upon was the test lying on my desk, and the scrawling name at the top written in his handwriting. then he shifted to the folder with his photograph glued to the front. i gestured absently to the chair in the corner of the room.

sit.

he did so without any debate, slipping his fingers under his thighs while he waited for me to properly turn my attention toward him. this i did not do for a long time, as i pretended to read my emails. from the corner of my eye, i could see him glancing from the floor to the test to me and then back again.

finally, when neither of us could bear the silence, he spoke.

you wanted to see me?

oh yes. its about your test.

what little colour remained in his face slid away at the confirmation of his worse fears. i picked it up and pretended to leaf through it.

outstanding work. top marks all round. however, that is not why a called you here. i flipped open his file with a slight flourish and ran my finger down the page. frankly, it would have been strange if you hadnt got full marks. especially for someone who can simply pluck any fact or answer out of the aether. wouldnt you agree?

he said nothing, only shifting on his hands.

i narrowed my eyes. you see, when youve been a teacher as long as i have, you get a feel for certain traits. theres a certain mechanicalness, a certain dryness, to people who use such help to get their answers. and i honestly can hardly blame them. a test of this difficulty? in the first week of school? everyone enters that hall with virtue in their hearts. sooner or later, usually around the time when they pick up their pens, they crack.

with that, i shut the folder and tapped my fingernail on his test. but not you. for the first time in all the years ive run this test, i have found responses that are not regurgitated. genuine, wellresearched. im curious why is that?

in the silence that followed, he wet his lips. am i in trouble?

why didnt you cheat?

...you did tell us what the test would be on.

and you crammed for four days?

he nodded.

when cheating was so easy?

the ghost of a smile showed. well, cheating is wrong, sir. and, i didnt want to start off the year on the wrong foot.

after writing down the score on the front of his test, i picked it up and held it up in his direction. he tentatively took it.

i think, louis, that this is going to be the beginning of a fascinating year."
"[wp] youre the most respected and feared villain in the city however, the hero that was your greatest rivalenemyarrived to your base in a day without conflict to invite you personally to their wedding as their best manmaid of honor.","imagine the mc being like the grumpy, perfectionist father, who thinks the son could do better.

so a lot of eye rolling, sighing, and sassy remarks, especially if the informants cant clear his suspicions, then he will surely be extremely rude with the flower witchs family.

also, people wont care much about him being there, not everyone will recognize him as a villain, and the hero will introduce him either as a friend, or a father figure,"
"[wp] bbut, youre all evil soldiers.you invaded our home. why are you being so kind to us? the child asks you as you tended to their injured arm. the rest of your comrades were doing the same to the rest.","it wont get that bad in this situation.  
only a dumb ruler would disallow free thought completely, how will true talents rise if everything is strictly controlled?

as i said, the empress wants the commoners. not out of kindness though

like she will give out good conditions, and request minimal return, only to convince people she is good, and to lure them into a sense of safety.

she wants them to feel good, and make more kids, and will set incentives for reproduction.

why?

because in many fantasy settings the ratio of magic user to nonmagic user is bad.

lets say  1 out of 10 nobles, and 1 out of 10 thousand commoners can awaken insert professionclass

so the empress is out to pump those number ups for the commoners, because it is easier than for the nobles.

the good conditions she is offering will make people love herlike her or at least accept her, will ensure people are harder to be poached away for other powers, and her empire will have a greater pool of talents.

winwin for her, and for the commoners as well."
"[wp] you are an orc warrior. a titan, a honed weapon, the pride of the orc army. but this? this is the first time you have witnessed true suffering.","roshga was sure something went wrong. he was supposed to join the human army against the dwarves. he was sure they must have mistaken him for an enemy, for why else would they torture him so?

this is the fifth meeting he has been sitting through. today. where is the battle? the glory? for the past 3 days roshga has done nothing but sitting in meetings where he was told the same things over and over again?

when roshga asked one of the humans when the battle would start. the human only faintly laughed. he was beginning to believe more and more that this was some kind of battle preparation. this might be why the humans have always done battle with such fervor?

could it be that the human soldiers were not afraid of death, for their will to live has been shattered by those meetings? 

roshga knew, if he made it home, they will need to try this battle rite."
"[wp] youre the teacher of the failure class for superpowered students. when you ask one kid what his power is, he says, i can give myself a nosebleed.wait. blood manipulation? another shrugs and says, i can charge my phone.electricity manipulation?! have they ever tried experimenting at all??","it was a daycare, really. 

nobody expected these kids to be able to do anything worthwhile least of all me. 

but in a world where people had powers, the asymmetry of strength made things messy for kids with dreams of serving their nation of garnering smiles from the people they yearned to protect. not from super villains, or petty crime, no. that had long ago vanished into the realms of impossibility. robbers in black and white outfits with little masks people using their powers to rob banks... it was enough to make one smile in remembrance of a better time.

a time before the scourge.
 
and when i saw that shining black vehicle turn onto the dirt road that led to our losers academy, i knew that the fight for mankind was going poorly. 

i set down my coffee mug and turned to the teens in their desks.

i have to step out for a moment, i announced. youve got ten more minutes on your ethics exam, and then its pencils down.

most of them had finished. i was mainly speaking to rodney and david, and everyone in the class knew it. they didnt score any worse than the rest, but they struggled with testtaking anxiety. the two of them shot me a nervous glance as i turned and stepped out the front door. 

the humid air of august bore down on me, and a cloud of gnats instantly swarmed me as i made my way off the front stoop and started down the walk toward the drive. the tinted vehicle drew near, its tires crunching on gravel as the anticipation began to build in me. 

id been dreading this day.

when the vehicle came to a stop, the driver didnt cut the motor. the passenger didnt even deign to exit the car they rolled down the window, and that shiny brass uniform confirmed my suspicion. 

i didnt recognize his face, but a quick look at his attire told me all i needed to know. he had a square jaw, beady eyes, and wore a nononsense expression. i could tell by the bags under his eyes that his job wasnt an easy one.

you run this shit hole? he asked.

im professor alan kirkland, i introduced myself, tactfully as i was able. 

he opened his mouth like he was going to speak, and then suddenly started straight ahead and looked down in his lap. he leaned back, letting his head rest work for him as he played with the words in his mouth.

son. this nation faces dark times, he started.

real dark if youre here, i folded my arms. ive been wondering... worrying, really, about when id see you in my driveway.

he scoffed. youre giving the tabloids too much credit.

and yet, here you are, i said, unflinching. how many do you need?

all of em, he said, staring me right in the eye. every ablebodied super, he sighed. even the flunkies... are to report to 1002 evercrest drive in one months time. 

he handed me an importantlooking envelope engraved with the nations insignia and sealed with wax.

a month? i asked, losing my cool demeanor for the first time. colonel, a month is not going to be enough. these kids have been deemed unfit by the state. what do you expect me to do with them in a month?

for once, i can say, thats not my job, he said, narrowing his eyes at me. its yours, professor. get these kids ready for war. the scourge isnt breaking against our best. he looked forward and began rolling up the window. the tint was good, but it didnt cover his worried expression before it reached the top and sealed. 

the vehicle departed under a gloomy sky and a long silence. 

i looked down at the letter in my hand and sighed. 

dammit, i said out loud, turning and making my way back into the building. 

it was a circus when i reentered the classroom. everyone was talking, laughing, joking around, and out of their seats, only returning to decorum when they noticed me, jaw clenched, and unenthused. 

has everyone handed in their test? i asked. 

yessir, they spoke in unison as i picked my coffee mug up off the windowsill and walked to my desk. i sat down and stared at the stack of papers on my desk before looking at them all over the rim of my glasses. 

these kids were flunkies, but they were my flunkies.

i wasnt about to let any of them die horribly.

i stood up and took a deep breath, and held it a moment before letting it out.

class, i announced. were going to war.

the little dummies cheered.

i rubbed my eyes with my thumb and forefinger under my glasses.

this nation was doomed.

"[wp]you settled in this village on a whim. you just liked the view. now, nearly 600 years later, you are revered as the protective deity despite not doing anything really to deserve it. you merely helped in disasters to not have a graveyard in your front yard.","when i arrived in the valley, there had been a small, quaint gathering of buildings, nothing too fancy, and maybe a handful of families trying to make of go of starting a new community.  i dont know why they had left their former homes, and honestly i didnt care to know.  i had began my cultivating journey many centuries before deciding i needed a stable place to call my home, my peaceful sanctuary, and this place had everything i needed.

i had built my home at the top of the valley, mainly for the spectacular view of the ocean framed by the lush forest of the hills.  the breeze in the morning and evening were decent, and the quality of game nearby satisfied my needs.  there was even a modest stream that ran beside my house for easy access to fresh water.  i had planted a garden that repaid my efforts tenfold.  it was, in a single word, perfect.

i didnt initiate contact of any sort with the people living below for over a decade.  they stumbled upon my compound by accident, while hunting in the forest i assume, and at first there was a mild misunderstanding.  despite my advanced age, my body was still firm and strong, and disarming the hapless fools took no effort.  after we came to an agreement, mainly them leaving me alone, i was back to cultivating and strengthening my connection to the universe.  i barely noticed the passage of time, marking it mainly by the occasional visitor bearing gifts from the growing village.

there were a few times i made my way to their modest civilization, usually to buy something i desired.  i was surprised how they were thriving, an inn with decent ale and a competent blacksmith. i made a point of visiting every decade or two to keep abreast of the world in general.  once, a young boy asked me to save someone, maybe a brother or father, from bandits in the area.  took less than an afternoon to clear the whole thing up and the remaining bandits relocated themselves very far away.

now, its the dawn of my sixth century in the valley. sure, i might have missed my usual visits now and then, and there was that seventy year gap a while back, but i was pretty sure they still knew of me.  on my most recent visit, something i had put off until i ran out of seedlings for my garden, i discovered something that i found alarming.  in the center of the town, which was much larger than i remembered, with multiple streets and large, numerous buildings, they had erected a statue that resembled me.  as i listened to the townsfolk, i was apparently regarded as a protector deity of the valley and my alleged reputation had kept others from trying to attack or take over.  im not sure how this story has grown to such proportions. in all honesty, i have only stepped away from my diligent studies when the occasional disaster has interrupted my peaceful meditations. i dont want these people to perish, less from my desire to be part of their community and more from the painful experience that mass death has a way of creating annoying spirits that would force me to find a less haunted sanctuary."
"[wp] son, i think its time for you to know that when you turn 18 an albino gorilla will come and beat you senseless. i dont know why but it happened to me, it happened to my father, my grandfather, and his father as well. nothing you can do about it, so dont make any plans until afterwards.","i sat in the park, and waited.

i turned 18 yesterday, and was told it would be on its way. i was told several months in advance, and the reason why they waited was, because we didnt want you to worry, and there really isnt anything you can do about it.

fuck that.

i am a, locked in, internet goblin, and i knew exactly, what i could do about it.  so i waited, saved up money, put out some ads, and went about some sites, and made sure i was ready.

this pale ass, shit eater, got away with this with my dad, and grandad, but unfortunately this lined up perfectly with what i needed to know.

as i sat, and contemplated how this would go, i heard some noise, and i knew it was here.

it didnt try to sneak at all. it was just walking down the park walkway, people rushing out of its way, when it locked eyes with me.

i didnt care about avoiding the aggression signs, it was here for me anyway, and i stood up and stood several yards away straight ahead of it.

i was told you were coming.

it grunted, and wooped, in response.

but, unlike the ones before i actually prepared for this. 

i proceeded to take off my shirt, i wasnt gonna cower away from this now, and took out a whistle. with one loud burst on it, they arrived.

they stumbled out of bushes, walked from behind the bathroom, a few even crawled outta drainswhy i dont know.

behold, the power of 20 is 20! i cried out, and now lets answer the question, who would win!?

it began pounding its chest, which actually makes a pretty funny noise unlike what king kong would imply, and began charging.

a hundred guys, or one gorilla! 

with a psychotic cry, we charged at it.

for whatever happens, this gorilla will not whip my ass with ease!!!

"[wp] you only know one spell, and it isnt even a highlevel spell. but between its versatility and your creativity, youve still made a name for yourself.","i already saw it, i dont know what happened. thank you very much"
"[wp] when you said you wanted a trad wife i never expected you to travel in time to get one! you said to your friend as the fair skin maiden in a coarse woolen kirtle stained with dust   by his side saluted you. god yeve thee good morrow, fair sir.","i frowned at my roommate, tom. he was leaning against our apartment door, having just closed it behind us. i dont remember saying i wanted a trad wife. thats not something i would ever say. i turned my attention to my maiden. dont forget our practice. i pulled in my jaw and pointed up at the roof of my mouth.

oh, yes, odelyn said, her tongue stiff. we had been practicing modern english for a few weeks while i visited her in her native time, but she often reverted to older pronunciations and vocabulary. she turned her head toward me and looked over her shoulder at the inside of our apartment. it was the first modern room shed entered. i felt her take my hand in hers, holding on as though the television was about to try sucking her into its black void.

toms face recoiled and scrunched up around his wide eyes. his mouth opened to speak, but he was confounded. fine, whatever, he said, staring at odelyn, who squeezed my hand tighter, sweat pooling in our palms. she was looking apprehensively at tom.

i huffed a little. i have always said my taste in women was too old fashioned for the current available dating pool, i admitted, rolling my eyes. women of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were hard working, modest, committed, and... i glanced down at odelyn, who was at least a foot shorter than me, sweeter. i smiled.

she looked up at me with a wary but affectionate face and leaned against me. i could feel her shaking. her long brown hair was gathered up under a cloth headcovering and she hadnt had a modern bath to expunge the earthy, greasy smells that seeped through the layers of fabric she wore. i didnt mind. i smiled, released her hand, and put my arm around her, pulling her closer for comfort.

i think shes scared, tom said. how long has she... he stopped. how? he gawked at me, holding his breath. how is she here?

i shrugged. im not really sure. it started a few months ago when i found this rift or portal or something. smiling, i recalled the horror of initially finding myself thrust seven hundred years into the past, and my heart was warmed as i recalled the way odelyn had found me and protected me from my own stupidity. i went through, found this beautiful, kind, brave woman, and fell in love. i spent a month with her, began to worry that the portal might close, and came home.

you said you were gone on an emergency work trip. tom scowled.

would you have believed me if i told you i went back in time to the fourteenth century?

tom sighed and shook his head.

anyway, after just a couple days i couldnt get odelyn out of my mind. so i went back for her. it was, of course, more complicated than that, but i didnt feel like recounting the whole story yet.

tom looked down and to the side, furrowing his brow, calculating. his mouth opened, then he pursed his lips and his eyes began wandering. eventually he took a deep breath and shrugged. so now what?

i smiled. shell stay with us for a while until i can sort out some kind of fake identity for her. shell need papers and everything before we can get married.

odelyn gave me a warm smile. we had talked extensively about marriage and life in the modern world. ultimately her curiosity and love for me had won out. my heart melted as it had hundreds of times in her presence.

married? tom exclaimed. look, as far as i can tell, nothing has imploded... he froze and raised his eyebrows. wait a minute, let me check. he pulled out his phone, flipped over to his news feed, and scrolled for a moment. yup, the world is still falling apart but in all the same ways it was before. he sighed.

what does he mean, falling apart? odelyn asked with concern on her forehead.

i smiled. its just a saying, but like i told you, the world is a lot more complicated now than it was in your time. ill show you soon. first you need a bath and some new clothes.

tom shook his head. youre treating this like its no big deal. youre messing around with powers you dont understand. you could have altered the entire course of history.

i shrugged. maybe we will still, who knows? i dont care. as long as odelyn and i are together it will all be fine.

what if its not fine? tom exploded. he marched past us into the living room.

odelyn and i turned around. immediately she began taking in the room in more detail. i smiled, watching her eyes dart around full of wonder and hints of terror.

ill show you everything, i whispered to her.

she smiled and wrapped herself around my arm, leaning her head against me.

for all we know she could have some important role that she hasnt fulfilled back in her time and we might not yet have experienced the effects of her absence due to some kind of...

hey, i said to odelyn, ignoring toms tirade. lets get you cleaned up. i got you some clothes to change into already, then ill show you around the apartment. first, youre going to love the bath. we exchanged loving smiles and i walked with her to the bathroom.

are you even listening to me? tom called after us.

i closed the bathroom door behind us and odelyn giggled. he worries much, she said.

yeah, dont let him upset you. here, watch this. i reached down and turned on the hot water to fill the tub.

odelyn gasped before squealing with delight."
"[wp] if you wrote a book about a character slowly descending into madness, what would the closing passage be? the story is complete, it has unfolded in its entirety. the descent is over, their mind is in pieces, write the closing lines that capture everything thats been lost or revealed.","from wide eyed innocence, to intelligent cynicism, to a mind shattered. dealt blow after blow by the tides of fate and circumstance, a spiderweb of cracks growing and growing until all was shattered. there was hope at the onset, hope that the growing fissures could be mended. hope that it was simply a stop on a longer journey, and not a permanent resting place.

like a source of gravity that cannot be escaped, sliding slowly closer and closer to a point beyond which return was impossible. until, at last a single, small blow pushed it all over the event horizon, and into the maw of madness.

"[wp] to defeat an even greater evil, the heroes are forced to travel and cooperate with their usual villain","it had been decided by the council of the holy inquisition. when their oracle predicted that they would face a greater evil from beyond the veil, one they might not be able to defeat, they would seek the prophesized great evil that had temporarily aided them in the past.

no.

what do you mean, no? one of the heroes of the inquisition asked the eldritch horror before him. this greater evil could endanger your dinky little town. elvari, are you aware of the consequences of saying no?

the last time i said yes, the last time i fought the defiler, your organization stabbed me in the back, the octopoid entity waggled an angry tentacle. i care for none of your threats. the holy inquisition already did their worst when your past heroes dismembered me. go ask a modern human army. perhaps theyd lend you a nuke to fire at this greater evil.

a paladin among the contingent sighed. wed rather not ask you, but a band of cultists have raised one of your brothers, valzoght, from the dead.

say no more, elvari raised a hand. i will go if you agree to my conditions.

the members of the inquisition stared at each other. after a long awkward pause, one finally spoke up. state your terms then.

stop calling me the great evil.

...deal, a most reluctant answer forced its way out of the paladins mouth.

if im going to vanquish evil alongside you, officially appoint me as a paladin of your organization, elvari jabbed a tentacle at one of the heroes.

this is not something any one of us can decide. thats for the council to say. can we go now?

thus, a broken alliance was reformed. one that involved a band of warriors and paladins sharing a large room together, and leaving their eldritch ally to sleep outside, floating above the inn. there was also an incident involving a plate of calamari and a blast of eldritch energies that blew a hole in a pub. yet, somehow they managed not to kill or seriously maim each other despite the numerous accidents in their travels.

soon, they would reach the place where tales of a terrible monster of the abyss had sunk many ships and destroyed a bustling port town. where it settled down in a nearby city demanding tribute and sacrifices.

valzoght rose from the choppy seas to let out a tremendous roar that shook the earth upon hearing elvari shout out an embarrassing childhood nickname.

if it isnt the daddys least favourite bastard, valzought rumbled.

his halfbrother stuck a few tongues out. if it isnt daddys most beloved bootlicker.

as two eldritch deities traded insults, the members of the holy inquisition were already working to apprehend the cultists and cease the ritual that sustained valzoughts existence. they put a stop to the chanting. they wiped the ritual circles and destroyed the altar and the offerings placed upon it.

that left valzought weakened. unable to stop elvari from tearing off his appendages and tossing him back into his grave.

and stay there! he shouted at his opponent, before patting the top of the freshly dug grave. or ill come back to stuff you back in again! so much for greater evil. you were simply a greater jerkass to the people you lorded over.

that went well, a paladin commented when the inquisition arrived at the scene. ive received a call from my superior. no eldritch paladins allowed.

hmph, i saw that coming, elvari snorted.

we could join one of your tea parties, if it pleases you, the paladin suggested. a peace offering. your tea, your rules. unlike my distant predecessors, im not one to stab an ally in the back.

the prime knight had been witness to the end of time. she watched as gods brought fury and wrath to the entire world. she held those she loved in her arms as they took their last dying breaths. an unspoken promise to them as they looked to the sky, eyes wide, wondering what it had all been for.

she had reversed the end of time. she fought gods and brought them down to the world they had tried to destroy. she killed the loved ones of others as she progressed through her quests, watched them question the sky, wondering who had forsaken them.

the people adored her. everywhere she went, she was given praise and riches and weapons that would give her an edge in whatever fight would come. she had walked the entirety of the world twice over, sailed every sea known to man, dug new tunnels to find lost civilizations. she learned the names of those who would be forgotten, and she tried  so desperately tried  to connect with all of the people of the world. they loved her. she tried to love them back.

but it was that first fight that had broken her. when the last she had loved, and those she could never forget, had been ripped from her. their souls given away, in a crass attempt at immortality. instead, she roamed the world  uncertain as to where she would go next.

 

the latest fight had come sooner than she had thought. as news traveled down the coastlines and the shores, trying to reach her humble abode on some lost island. she had taken it as her latest gift, a bastion in which she could rest.

it was beautiful. a sort of lighthouseturnedfortress that she had made her own, painted and enchanted, built and rebuilt. the prime knight employed those she had grown close to, some she had rescued, others she hoped would rescue her. one day, when it was her turn.

atop this lighthousefortress, she watched clouds roll by each day, counted the turns of the sun, and the phases of the moon. she would witness eons here. some would only witness a week or less.

a courier arrived late one morning, as the prime knight stood solemn in her tower. she watched him approach, dirt flying up in the ground beneath his feet as he ran to the bastion. she turned back to the armory that was her fortress, searched for a weapon that would mean something in her next fight. she heard the race of feet, the talk of voices outside of her door. the next fight was upon her.

 

the fault was in her own mind.  there was nothing she could do to fight it. inside she knew that none of these petty wars or battles or end of days truly mattered. she had seen the eye of chronos, or at least the mortal who had tried to control it. in that first climactic battle, she had smote the wouldbe god of time.

and all those souls he had gathered? all those loved ones she had feared to lose.

they had joined her soul instead. granted her power and immortality that she never dreamed of having, that she would give away in an instead if it meant having them back. if it meant foregoing the world she would live beyond.

[wp] every 275 years the living mountain wakes and walks thousands of kilometers to find its new resting place. consuming everything in its path. each time sceptics think the tales of old are just stories.,"it began with silence. aside from the angry shouts, a bizarre quiet had settled over the entire mountainside bird, beast, and nature holding their breath.

i had barely noticed the flight of sound when i was jolted in my perch, almost losing my grip on both the camera and the tree branch. as i fought to regain balance, something whizzed past my head, and i looked up to see a rock the size of a football hurtling on down the mountain. then a storm descended. more boulders flew past, skipping and rolling like spilt marbles, some even striking my tree.

my brothers friends were in a panic, but he was standing tall. the wild glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes turned the sweat on my back clammy. he shouted to me and pointed away from the lookout, miming a video camera. for whatever stupid reason, i chose to obey him, and aimed the camera toward the sight that sent my jaw dropping.

mountains cant move. but this one was.

like a buried person at the beach, slowly and lazily rising up while the sand rains off them in an unending curtain. except this curtain was made of boulders the size of cars. i could hardly believe what i was recording. the mountain was not just lifting up it was moving forward, down the valley and to the open plains below.

then a rock struck my tree in the middle of the trunk, snapping it like my bones would when i hit the ground seconds later.

i woke up in hospital with enough injuries to ruin my parents savings. my brother had snatched up the camera to keep filming the migrating hill it was his friends who pulled me out of danger.

official story? an earthquake and a severe avalanche wiped an entire mountain off the map.

my brother hid the recording from the police. he showed it to me the day i got out of hospital, still with that wild satisfaction. i hated him then, more than ever in my life.

but hed been right. i know what i saw on that lookout. an avalanche could never explain that away."
"[wp] its been months since the hero that magically appeared on her stoop had left on their quest to defeat the demon lord, and the kind ol granny was oh so worried. so she set off on her own journey to find them, with only her trusty cane, a packed lunch, and her immortal tutorial npc status.","whacking the bandits with my cane, i go towards the next village...or is it a town?  
oh...i dont know.  
me son might know more about the lass that said shes a hero.  
poor child, half naked, halfdead appeared on my stoop, and i nursed her back to health.  
shes so young, and said that she got hurt by some demon...  
i havent heard anything since she left for her quest.  
i hope shes alright...  
she reminds me of my daughter when she was young.

entering the city? village? i am met with a band of men, smiling.  
hey granny, what brings you here? one of them says, looking me up and down.  
rude.  
i whack them, straightening their postures.  
you are soldiers! not thugs! hmph, also, my son is theoretically some lord? lord asthora? i say, and they pale.  
tthe ststorm king iis your son?! they stutter.  
that is what he calls himself these days? storm king? he barely can use mana properly. i laugh.  
they pale, and before they could ask me something, lightning strikes close to us, as my son appears.  
mother! why didnt you tell me you are coming? how did you leave the village? he asks, smiling at me, before giving the stare to the soldiers.  
i whack him, no son of mine will have that look towards others!

in his mansion, as it seems my son has a mansion, he smiles at me wryly.  
my daughterinlaw is sweating, as my grandkids are busy reading the books i brought as gifts.  
no letter. no visitation in 50 years... who taught you magic, oh great storm king? i stare at him, and he pales.  
i sigh.  
have you heard about this little girl...calls herself lisa123, and is a hero? i ask.  
he nods.  
she seems to be a chosen one of the empire, and is on a quest to defeat the demon lord. he says.  
i whack him.  
you a lord of a town, your sister is a mage of the tower, and you let kids on quests like that? in my days... i start lecturing him.  
the servants, and the others didnt even dare to look at us.

i leave the town, while my son tries to convince me to take some soldiers, and mages as guards.  
i refuse, as they would only hinder me.  
on my way to the demons lands, i met a few demons, who hit me, and tried to kill me, but to no avail.  
i whacked them with my cane, and they all fell.  
i hmphed, watching more demons fly above me, as i approached the demon lands.  
sending yet another child to such a quest...  
i will deal with these things, once and for all.  
i dont want yet another young one i taught a thing or two about magic, and this world, to die randomly... i mutter, as i walk into the forbidden forest.  
wait, you little lisa123, i will help you, and then we can continue our tea sessions..."
"[wp] there are many rumours that surround her a murderer, a witch, a hideous, scarred monster. a queen who schemes from the shadows, never showing her face. only a precious few know the truth the queen has run away, and it is her masked bodydouble who has been ruling all this time in her stead.","i stare in the mirror, sighing.  
i have aged a bit, but i still look young, after all, i am only in my late 20s.  
yet the rumors outside...  
sigh.  
your majesty, the prime minister is here to visit. a servant said from outside my room.  
i took on my mask.  
let him in, and bring us some refreshments. i say.  
the door opens.

  
your majesty. the prime minister bows.  
i nod.  
the eastern front has stabilized, and after your majesty has dealt personally with the barbarian chieftain, the northern front is now tranquil  as well.  
has your majesty managed to... he started.  
i threw a vial at him.  
cure for the southern plague. i say.  
before he could say something, the servants brought us refreshments.  
so he enjoyed them.

  
after a while, the prime minister sighs.  
you know, we could totally sell you as the previous queens long lost sister, and have to legitimately sit on that throne. he says.  
and my spells, my actions, and my mannerism would give it away in a moment, that the one they call murderer, witch, and monster is now once again their queen.  
just without a mask. i say.  
when its just the two of us, you could be without a mask. he says.  
before i could answer, a servant came in to announce that the marshall wants to see me, and that the finance minister wants to discuss with the prime minister.  
i nod, and after the door is closed, i laugh.

  
see?  
this is why i keep the mask on, even when i am asleep. especially then. i say.  
what did the queen do to deserve such a bodydouble? he asks, standing up.  
she saved me. helped me become whom i am today.  
i wish i could have helped her more when she was here, but now...  
i can finally repay her for everything. i say.  
he sighs, and leaves the room.  
a few minutes later, i leave as well, to meet with the marshall, and see whom needs to be killed.  
after all...  
usually, i am only needed when the decisions that have to be made, are too risky for the ministers to deal with themselves."
"[wp] the king died, but the healers managed to resuscitate him. everyone celebrated his survival but you, because you know whatever is staring at you with the kings dead eyes isnt the man you grew up with.","the clamor and roar of the great hall no longer filled merek with the joy and brightness as it once did. to him it had soured. he knew he should be grateful for his life going back to normal, for his friend to be alive. he was not grateful. recent events sent a doubt in into him. it wormed its way into his mind gradually with every observation.

if anyone deserved to come back from the dead, surely it was his king. godfried of the twentythird kingdom was different from his predecessors and his equals across the lands. merek could think of no ruler who deserved a second chance more. he never heard the stories of other kings because other kings were not as brave as godfried. merek had served for decades at his side defending his life up until now. countless adventures.

merek watched godfried across the hall. a dance and concert ongoing between them, but the world may as well have been silent. the king entertained and spoke with a fat duke at his shoulder while merek stared daggers across the hall. the kings eyes snapped up to meet his just as a gravely voice raked its way up his right shoulder.

mereks heart exploded in his chest while he maintained his composure. the mage that had saved the kings life was now at his side.

pardon the intrusion, he said. a voice like a rock slide. harsh, bordering on unpleasant, but powerful and captivating. power in the vocal cords. 

merek knew this voice could speak life or death and he would obey. godfried was no different. even kings would bend to the will of magic. the true rule. unseen, unheard, until it was necessary.

the rock slide continued, raising the hairs on his neck.

the king requires your presence, my lord, he said. 

without facing him, acknowledging him, merek nodded once. 

he knew he should be grateful. instead, he was afraid. he was sure the mage knew this. as though his fear were a scent on the air, and this creature next to him was basking in it. soaking it in. feeding off of it. 

long live the king, merek said.

he hoped this would appease the mage, get him to change his focus. to keep the eyes from boring into the side of his flushing face. 

the mage cracked a grin as he inched his way closer to merek, his face inches from the mans shoulder.

long live the emperor, he said.

at the softness of the words, the room around him dissolved into something else. the throne room. a line of eleven pikes on either side towered above him, leading up to the great seat where godfried was planted. still as a statue, great sword laid across his lap. the pikes around him dripped with the blood of twentytwo heads. 

the open mouthed heads of dead kings. 

the room dissolved again back into the roaring great hall and he was being led to a table by the elbow. he tumbled into a chair across from the mage, the world spun so fast he clung to the edge of the iron rimming the table. the coldness of it brought his senses back.

he knew he should be grateful to have his best friend back. right now he wished they had both died in the cursed forest that claimed godfrieds soul."
"[wp] the rookies keep complaining about how small and weak our nations mechs are comparing to others. they seem to be unable to comprehend that, their mechs are meant to replace tanks and fortresses, while ours are meant to be heavy infantry.","i stop presenting them their personal mechs, and sigh.  
you two are really unaware of the world you are stepping in, arent you? i say.  
they frown.  
we are the top cadets of the pilot academy, sir. one of them says.  
i understand you are the chief engineer, but we are pilots...sir. the other one adds.  
i sigh.  
have you learnt about the models? i ask.  
they nod, and like reading from a textbook, describe to me all the 193 mech models that our world has.  
i shake my head.

then why are you comparing the px12s with something like fm9s or sp2s? i ask.  
they fidget.  
ssir...these mechas are barely bigger than a normal human.  
hell, some of the northerners might not even fit in! one of them says.  
and their alloy while sturdy compared to bullet proof vests...it is barely vehicle grade. the other one adds.  
i facepalm.  
how dumb are you? i say, closing the hatch to the two suits.  
before they could retort, i raise my hand.  
follow me, rookies. i say.  
yes, sir! they say, through gritted teeth.

i lead them down, to the warehouse.  
opening the gates i enter it, and turn on the lights.  
the two rookies gasp.  
in front of us stand 20 thousand mechas, all well maintained ready to be deployed.  
bbut... one of them stutters.  
it should be impossible!  
mech production is awfully low! the other one adds.  
the mechs you are talking about are vehicle, tank, or even spaceship, and fortress replacements. i say.  
then gesture towards my proud kids.  
these...these are meant as heavy infantry. i say.

ssir? how can our country ddo this?  
and if we can do it, do the others also have such forces? one of them asks.  
cost wise, each mech is a highend car.  
so as in ability to do this, most countries are able, but none focus on it as we do. i say.  
isnt it normal? a building size mech... one of them starts.  
is a walking target. one that eats energy like crazy, and has the flexibility of a mountain.  
these babies...these are basically as flexible as an average human.  
good luck trying to keep up with them in messed up environments, and good luck trying to stop tens of thousands of them. i say.  
the two nod, and ask a myriad more questions, and i happily answer, though...  
why must i always awe them first, before they realize that human sized mechs are also cool?"

june squinted up at me, her smile and eyes radiant in the sunlight. daddy, do you have to go? she asked timidly. i thought for a moment and pressed a button on the side of my watch to silence the beeping. this wouldnt be taken from us this wouldnt be taken from me. not yet honey, i can stay for this ride. i replied. diana leaned into me and squeezed my hand. are you sure? she asked with surprise. i turned my smile to her and squeezed back, yes, i am sure.


fifteen minutes later i was ascending into the stratosphere. diana and june were going to enjoy the rest of the day at the park while i responded to the emergency page from london. i was no longer caleb stephens i was now donning my superhero persona, the paragon. i had been a superhero for nearly thirty years. i started when i was 18, and now i was now approaching 50. diana was a superhero too, known as the bluejay, but she had retired when we were pregnant with june. i wanted to retire as well, but it turns out the only well paying government job is in the league of heroes and being a superhero was the only thing i knew. 


however, i had nearly retired a few years back. after diana hung up her cape, it was difficult to continue superheroing without my partner. when youve been fighting supervillains and handling natural disasters for over 20 years with the same person, losing your partner is like losing a limb. the first sidekick i had after diana was a twenty year old kid from brooklyn who called himself wolfman. he had the mind and spirit, but he was a lesser powered superhero and just didnt have the strength or powers for the level of villains i was fighting. after watching him nearly die the second time, i transferred wolfman to an easier assignment. my next sidekick was a hard headed and talented young man known as captain owl. he was in his mid 20s with dark hair, thick brows, and angry eyes. what he possessed in power and ability that my first sidekick had lacked, he lacked in integrity and morality. 


when the supervillain dr enigma had kidnapped the president of the united states and his secret service staff to his hidden island, captain owl and i staged a rescue operation. we had rescued the president and secured his safety, but dr enigma was about to escape. before dr enigma launched his getaway rocket, he had chained the secret service staff to cages and dropped them into an active volcano. with only seconds to act, i told captain owl to leave dr enigma and focus on saving the secret service agents, but he instead went after dr enigma. i saved the agents that i could, but there simply wasnt enough time for one superhero to save them, let alone one man. as a result, three agents died that day. captain owl caught up to dr enigma and pummeled him and his face into submission, but instead of bringing him to justice, he let his rage get the better of him and ripped out dr enigmas heart. it was an ugly, ugly situation. i can still remember the words that were exchanged that day. i told him that he didnt respect life and that i was removing him from the league. he told me that he hated me and i was a foolish old man who no longer saw the world as it was. he may have been right about that last part because every day those words seem more and more true. regardless, the decision to get rid of him was an easy one, but nasty to execute. a super powered paparazzi had made it to the island unbeknownst to us and videotaped the ensuing fight. for the next few weeks, the internet and news channels played nonstop clips of two of the worlds most recognized superheroes punching the snot out of another above a volcano. it wasnt a pretty video. the media always blames you for the damages that follow and those you cant save, and the cultural zeitgeist of the last 20 years doesnt want to hold villains accountable. journalists and internet streamers spewed non stop about captain owl brutally murdering dr enigma, but how much airtime did they give to the fallen secret service agents? if it wasnt for our mortgage and the loving support of diana, i probably wouldve quit for good. i still struggle with the feeling that deep down, there was a pragmatism to captain owls actions. dr enigma was a supervillain who had killed hundreds and had escaped from prison once. the truth is, dr enigma shouldve been properly brought to justice and captain owl did a terrible thing, but the world is better off with dr enigma gone.

she saw how you locked alicia in your basement. he says.  
i look at my niece, who hides behind her mother.  
i know you, and i know that you are a good guy, so please...make it make sense. he continues, pointing the knife at me.  
i sigh.  
it is full moon, and they arrived unexpectedly.   
i go towards a drawer, where i have something prepared for something like this.

  
wait! it is not a gun there, right? he says.  
it hurts.  
i dont own a gun, rob. never did. never will. i say, taking out a stick, and plugging it into the tv.  
soon, my wife is on the screen, explaining everything.  
my cousin and his family freeze.  
they look outside, where the moon is slowly appearing.  
then...they stare at me.  
really? she is one...of them? robs wife mutters.  
i frown.

  
she is a werewolf, and my wife. i say.  
she flinches.  
nno! i didnt mean it like that, i... she stutters.  
sorry cousin. she didnt want to insinuate anything, but you cant blame us...  
it is a bit weird. rob says.  
not blaming you, but it is not weird.  
alicia is my wife, whom i love. she also babysat lia quite a few times, and has given you free consults at her clinic.  
she is an amazing person, who doesnt deserve that kind of assumptions. i say.  
they fidget.

  
was she always... little lia asks.  
i smile, and nod.  
yes, she was infected really young.  
this also means that her transformations are a bit wilder, but controllable to a certain degree, and that is why she is in the basement, and we dont hire a professional company to help us with this. i say.  
lycantropy wasnt something uncommon.  
that is why their reaction hurt me a bit.  
we will go to our room then...thanks, and sorry. rob says, leaving.  
i sighed, and went to lean against the basement door, knocking thrice on it.

um, why? [there wasnt any fine print] that i remember. clarence scratched his head at the demons question.

did you or did you not read through the agreement before signing?

well, i dont really remember. itd been four years ago, after all.

is that your final answer? theres still time.

im telling you, i dont remember! by now, clarence did remember not reading past the firstborn clause, but the demon could never prove that. it wasnt relevant anyway, right?

ill read the relevant clause for you, then. section 2a in the case clarence, hereafter referred to as requestor, should not have a child within the allotted period of five years, orach, hereafter referred to as the granter, shall be permitted to take any child that has entered the requestors home and lived there for more than five calendar months in succession, up to thirty years from the granter and requestor signing this agreement. orach frowned at clarence over the top of the document. i believe there is a child in this house?

clarence went pale. my niece? you cant!

according to this, i can. unless orach smiled pleasantly you want to set up another agreement, per section 3d?"
"[wp] you wake up in a bare, locked room with two of your friends. there is note in the middle of the room. choose one to stay, within thirty minutes, or none of you leave.","there are 3 people locked in an undescript white room, an unlikely trio. one is a redneck, gruff looking, a good heft but a clear indication of muscles under that fat.

then there is a jock, clean face, perfect teeth, 6ft tall, a man the woman would swoon for. 

lastly there is a pipsqueak. big glasses in front of his eyes and signs of balding on his head. the smallest of the three, both in width and height. 

ill stay the jock announces. you two leave, i could not forgive myself if any of you suffered for my benefit

hah the redneck laughs dryly. you are not hard enough to survive on your own. i will stay, im used to hardships from the farm. this is nothing, a little vacation if anything.

no! the pipsqeak joins in you both will leave and i will stay

the jock and the redneck both look at him for a moment. then they both question at the same time. you will stay? why that?

the pipsqeak smiles lightly. well, i am weak...


exactly the jock butts in you are weak. this is why one of us should stay

i wasnt finished the pipsqeak says. he motions them to come closer and starts to whisper. because i am weak, i am of no use in a rescue operation. you however he points at the jock have lots of strong friends. and you he points at the redneck have lots of weapons in your shed. i want you to go out and then come back to rescue me

why are we whispering? the redneck whispers.

because we dont want whoever put us here to hear us. the pipsqeak replies.

ahh right the other two both whisper in unision.

now here is the plan the pipsqeak starts you know my friend hacker. when you get out, you will likely not know where i am. contact hacker, they will be able to locate me. get your friends and your guns and storm whatever this place is. hacker will handle the information side.

after the 30 minutes were over, they all stood up and hugged one last time. a voice came from an unseen speaker now, who will stay? it asked. i will the pipsqeak said, tone shaky. 

a door opened. they could see armed guards on the other side as the jock and the redneck left.


3 days went by. the pipsqeak still sat in the white room, taking on a meditating pose. suddenly, the door burst open with startling sound of an explosion.

oy! the voice of the redneck came in vacation is over, its time to leave

the pipsqeak smiled. he got up, left the room through the destroyed door, fistbumping the jock and his many jacked friends on the outside. he winced a bit as he saw the armed guards on the floor. now lets get out of here.

1 day later

the pipsqeak scrolled through the news. a research cancer research facility in new mexico has burned down. all data has been lost and no footage was found on any of the surveillance cameras. police suspects terrorism, but has yet to find any evidence. the news report says.

good job on the information control the pipsqeak says joyfully.

ha, what can you say, i am a pro after all hacker replies haughtily.

the pipsqeak leaned back in his chair smiling. yes, it is good to have friends you trust he thought to himself."
"[wp] for all the years theyd been heroes, the one enemy they couldnt defeat was an angry sixyearold girl.","the five heroes regrouped atop the rubble, one of them dragging the terrorist who was the cause of it all.

as usual, it was a saturday morning, and the people rejoiced at another victory. the media quickly surrounded the heroes in a frenzy, asking all sorts of questions.

however, amidst the crowd, a pair of crimson eyes observed the heroes with a stern gaze. ray wanted to be a hero too she just gave a speech yesterday in school about what she wanted to be in the future.

and yet, her classmates bullied her for it, saying she could never be one all because her powers were lame.

not fair! the little girl leaped through the crowd, waving her arms in fury. if i cant be a hero, then i will be a villain!

the heroes, caught off guard, glanced at each other and then at the girl. little miss, are you alright?

the girl frowned, raising her palm to face the man in the red suitthe leader of the group, red ranger. fear me! 

suddenly, a transparent ball conjured from her palms, light dancing along its wobbly surface, the mass growing to the size of her head as she launched it in his direction.

it was a bubble. her powers were producing bubbles. 

the floating mass slowly hovered towards him while everyone gawked at the scene. it touched his head, and the bubble popped.

that was it.

ray stared incredulously, her brows drooping as tears beaded around her eyes. she really was so weak

on my mark. red ranger whispered to his team before whipping his head back, feigning unconsciousness as he fell to the ground for the first time in decades.

one of his teammates quickly crouched down, holding his leader by the head. red ranger noooo!

every watched in horror as the camera quickly turned to ray, the little girl wiping away her tears, her eyes gaining a glint.

i wont forgive you, villain! the hero declared, and ray stuck out her tongue in response.

muhaha! you will never catch me! she declared back with grin before scurrying away from the crime scene, her small legs tapping away.

the villain is retreating stop her! the hero exclaimed as the media started to chase her, but she was too fast to be caught. are you sure this is alright? she may grow up to become an actual villain. he said, looking down.

what do you mean? she is a villain she just said so. red ranger whispered back a chuckle, besides, we ought to have villains with more personality these days. seriously, you heard her laugh? she is a natural.

the rest of the team sighed, you really are a child yourself sometimes, you know..."
"[wp] one caramel macchiato, large, please! you look up from your phone to see a dragon on the opposite side of the counter, casually waiting for you to take his order as if this was a normal everyday occurance.","smoke curled out of its nostrils like tendrils, dancing through the air before fading away.  its jaw jolted and its throat hinged, and for a moment i could see the furnace within. the fire deep within its belly, trying to reach out to me. a low rumble as the eyes squinted toward me, and the faint, almost inaudible crackle of deep, deep flames made me go entirely still. it was instinct, as i was certain that i was faced with something that could easily eat me alive.

and then it cleared its throat.

im sorry, did you hear me? it asked, its voice baritone and reaching down my throat. one caramel macchiato, large, and extra caramel, if you can.

i always thought they were bigger than this. bigger, wider definitely too big to fit into a cafe like this. this one was thinner, longer. more serpentine. tall, for sure, but smaller than i thought one would be. to be fair, i never expected to see one in the flesh. i never expected to see one, period.

my hands hovered over the pos, fingers suddenly moving around the screen to input the order large caramel macchiato, extra caramel.
people were only just now starting to notice, somehow. eyes went wide, someone dropped their drink, one rushed to the doors and threw them open. a young girl saw it and, with a wide grin, began to waddle toward the dragon before her mother quickly grabbed her arm. i hadnt noticed it before, somehow, and now well, here it was. right in front of me. and it wanted caramel.

hot, or i started, realizing that my voice was shaking uncontrollably. hot or cold?

it was looking down at a small brown pouch, sifting through it with long, clawed but surprisingly nimble fingers. its voice rumbled again, the smoke rising from the corners of its mouth and nostrils. 

cold, it finally said. light on the ice, though, please.

light on the ice, i repeated, hands and voice still shaking. 

i punched the order in and looked up to read the amount due, only to see its reptilian eyes staring at me, its head downturned, fingers still digging into the pouch. it didnt move, didnt make a sound. it was waiting, i realized, for me to tell it how much it owed.

thatll be seven fiftyeight, i said, popping open the cash register.

it huffed at that, spewing out black smoke and shaking its head slightly, before producing a few bills. 

whats the matter? it asked as it handed me the money.

exexcuse me? i asked, returning a few coins as change.

what is the

then it looked up, its head swiveling on its long neck, shifting between the rest of the patrons in the cafe. the ones that hadnt already made their way out, anyway. they all stared back, eyes wide and breaths halted. a low hum resonated from the dragon as it observed them, its head turning slowly until its gaze finally rested on its own tail, idly curling and uncurling across the floor.

ah, it said, sounding amused. ah i see.

then it laughed, the sound filling the room. someone started crying. the young girl sat on her mothers lap, wrapped in her arms, laughing uncontrollably. 

then it looked at me. i apologize, it said, for the confusion.

with that, it hunched down and its scales receded. its horns shrunk into its flesh, the yellow eyes went white, and the tail disappeared. the burning, toothy smile was replaced with a pleasant grin. the wings furled in and fell over its shoulders, becoming a brown leather coat. charred crimson scales faded to cream as the longsnouted face contorted itself into that of a middleaged woman, the mohawk at the top of its head falling into a short, golden bob.

how embarrassing, she said, losing hold of a facade like that. simple spell, but she waved her hand dismissively. oh, nevermind. i dont think youd understand. 

she looked aside and smiled brightly, pointing at a barista down the line. is that my macchiato?

the barista stared at me for a moment, before shifting his gaze to the woman. i dont get paid enough for this was painted across his face. he handed her the drink without a word and she took it gingerly.

oh, thank you both, she said, putting on a pair of sunglasses. she took a sip of the drink, seemingly unaware of the total silence of the cafe. perfect! best spot in town, as usual.

i took a breath, and managed a smile. hope to see you again soon.

oh, certainly.

she smiled again, before leaving a bill in the tip jar and making her way out the front doors. the cafe stayed silent for a few minutes after that, even as the remaining patrons began receiving their own drinks. gradually, nervously, energy began to return to the floor, as if nothing had happened. people shared worried laughs, took their seats, and every so often shifted their eyes back toward the front doors.

where did the dragon go? i heard the young girl ask as her mom led her out."

i even reached all the way into my pocket before frowning. you dont even have a mouth, john. how the hell are you going to  

the problem with ya young fellers, john said contemplatively, the alchemical symbols on his blade humming in a faint green, is that ya focus too much on the thinking rather than the doing. for example, ah have neither a mouth nor larynx. how do ya expect me to speak? 

unable to argue with this logic, i placed a cigarette on the flat of the blade. sure enougyh, a spark from one of the symbols flashed and the cigarette was lit by itself.

pronounced diyert. but yes. now, dirt loved to have parties. one time, he got an idea from a dionysian ritual to have a masked revel in the middle of the enkidu temple. fun stuff, but the think about masks is you dont really know whos on the other end. so ah was just laying on my sheath the next morning, as one does, downing amphorae with the boys when one guy comes out and says the king is screwing his sister in the bushes.

thats a pretty significant difference!

he was always a menace.

"[wp] your beautifully sweet warlock, your kind baby that chose you as their patron, has been slaughtered. slain by an idiot paladin who is only doing it for fame and money, only wearing the holy helmet for glory.","the demon growled himself, before hand shaking, looking at the banner still sitting at atoshs feet. in a deep voice, as if an earthquake was talking. so you were the one who killed my child. atosh raised an eyebrow, it wasnt a question, but a statement.

well a child of a demon is a demon. im just stopping a cult from destroying our realm! atosh called out, puffing up his chest. hes never heard of this demon ... so it was probably easy to take down. and in the name of reodus, ill purify you! atosh called out, getting ready to run the monster through.

at least he would have if the demon didnt put a hand on his face with a low groan. oh brother, why must your holy temple be tainted by filth like this? the demon sighs, before taking a heavy step forward, many of the paladins getting ready to defend their brother. do you know reoduss domains? the demon asked, and atosh, about to laugh, gets cut off again. my brother is the god of creation, order and justice. he prefers not to interfere, even when his children are running amok, even as they fed the ground with blood. and yet, i did not awake. the room is quiet, as atosh has the demons full attention, and thus the attention of the room.

when my brother chose a child to give more power to, and the child had to slaughter his brothers and sisters because of corruption both in himself and in the church, i did not awake. yet here i am ... because the demon shook, before like a rushing river being flooded, atosh is grabbed by the neck. you killed my child, one who asked not for himself, but for others. the demon shook as he glared at atosh, who flinched as eyes, almost seeming like molten slag glared up at him. because of his own rules, my brother can only punish you when your soul returns to the forge of life, but i will do as i must. my domains are destruction, chaos and judgement! i judge not just for my childs lost life, but also for the sins that stain my brothers light! with your own tongue, confess your sin! the demon, no god as the onlookers realized, ordered atosh, and thus he started to speak.

he spoke of what he did, the times he forced various bar wenches to have sex with him, the money he stole not just from the temple, but from those of lower status even the times he had a squire witness his power by taking his lovers body and life. the more atosh spoke, writhing in the burning grip, the more the people had images of disgust on their faces. the squire especially, taking a step back and almost looking sick as atosh couldnt help himself.

the god looks at the rest of the paladins, growling as he smiles, realizing that he had made the message clear as atoshs lips finally closed shut. remember this, for next time this happens, one life might not be enough to sate my rage. once i set my childs body to rest, and this cur, i will sleep once more. with that, the god vanished, along with atosh, still writhing in the gods hand.

after that, not many spoke of atosh, saying he is being judged for his sins. the squire in particular, had done research and balked, realizing that the world was about to end, since somehow atosh had awoken and angered the twin brother of reodus, soroma the god of destruction.

what came first, the chicken or the egg?

the human opened a portal and pulled a big whiteboard out. there he started drawing single cell organisms, and algae. followed by fish, amphibians, and images of creatures coming to shore. strange entities that were inbetween  of sea creatures evolving to adapt to a life on land.

the sphinxs tail swished, patient but taut.

he drew lots of lines and stuck many minimagnets on the messy images. his eyes widened as his speech got faster and hurried, more jumbled and difficult to decipher. like a conspiracy theorist feeding on his own bullshit. the man never stopped talking for a second, drawing over his earlier images with more scribbles that were less comprehensible than a drunken eldritch gods attempt at cave paintings.

lizards. and more dumb drawings of what the sphinx assumed were lizards. she yawned and stretched her paws out in boredom. the mans droning could put her to sleep. but she had to stay awake. what if this was a new tactic to get past her without answering her question?

theyre dinosaurs, bitch, the human snapped. look, birds came from dinosaurs okay? and one of those birds is the chicken. arent you immortal? then you have the time to hear me out. let me finish.

she stared at him in stony silence, and waved a paw to signal him to keep going. a part of her wanted to see him explain this out. to hear from him if the chicken or the egg came first.

okay you see this feathery dinosaur thingy? he stabbed his hideous drawing multiple times with his marker. one day, these two notquitechickenzilla dinos mated. theyre not the same species, but they are compatible. think of it like how humans breed new species of dogs or domesticated chickens. something happens in that egg. theres a mutation. the environment has changed, and these creatures cant exist the way they did if they didnt want to die out like the trex. so, the baby to hatch from this egg, thats your first chicken. and that egg, it was the first chicken egg, laid by totallynotchickenhalfreptilian thingys.

at that, the human puffed up his chest and threw the marker down like he was doing an epic mic drop.

and so, the chicken egg came first. now, can i pass through?

the sphinx sighed and stepped to one side. get in, before i change my mind, you annoying, smug little shit. and take the exit at the back of the pyramid. if i ever catch you coming out from this entrance and you start babbling in pseudoscientific gobbledegook again, i will tear you into many, many pieces.

"[wp] ok ill do it, but itll cost ya an arm and a leg the man said, before staring in horror as you rip off one of your arms and legs. why is he doing that? they grow back.","enough? or you need more? i ask.  
the man stares at me horrified, and then at the still dripping with blood limbs.  
oh, dont worry.  
they already grew back! i say, waving with my new hand, and hopping on my new leg.  
he turned around, and emptied his stomach.  
i sigh.  
why do the town folks always do this?

  
after the man calmed down, he did take my arm, and leg.  
and he gave me the deeds to a small house, with a garden, but asked for me to stay a bit.  
i, as a mage, have yet to see someone like you.  
that regeneration was instantaneous. why...how...  
you didnt even flinch. he says.  
i frown.  
you? a mage? but you fell ill just by the sight of my limbs?  
the geezers and hags back home did this and much more to beasts, demons, and me, without hesitation, in name of the research. i say.  
he pales.

  
wait. you werent born like this? he asks.  
i shrug.  
dunno. geezer tobi used to say they found me in the lair of a 9headed serpent, alive in the pool of poison it had for its offspring, eating some earth shattering bear corpse.  
so, i assume i was born with strong vitality, but then the geezers and hags did run a lot of tests on me, and the regeneration became stronger. i say.  
the horror in his eyes, is palpable.  
my god...where did you grow up? he asks.  
a village in the mountains, north from here. took me...hmm, 19 days of running to reach this town. i say.  
he freezes.

  
bbut wewe are the northernmost settlement, north from here is basically wilderness filled with beasts, monsters, and demonic influences. he says.  
yep. thats about right. i say.  
and...you grew up there? he continued.  
i nod.  
did you learn magic? he asks, finally some color to his face.  
i nod.  
yeah, but i wasnt smart, barely managed to learn 8th series elemental spells, and dimensional shift before running away. i sigh.  
the terror came back into his complexion.  
i smiled, thanked him and left, before he fell ill again.  
the geezers and hags of the village were right.  
the outside world is colorful, but a bit soft...not that i complain.  
i like it. so many people...and many are of my age!  
i am eager to start my life."
"[wp] my father told me one day when youre lost, always follow the river. there were no rivers in our area, so i figured it was an expression. one day, i woke up stranded in a remote place, at the head of a small river.","i look at the small river head, that slowly flows out southward.  
i am shocked.  
not because i am stranded in a remote place, with nothing around me but trees, and i dont know how i got here.  
no.  
its because my father used to tell me that one day, when i am lost, i should always follow the river.  
considering we lived in an area with no rivers, i always thought it was a metaphor, or some joke, but now?  
now it is the only think that echoes in my mind, so i do as he told me.  
i follow the river.

  
one step, two, and the stream widens.  
i follow the river, until it it becomes almost dangerous to get too close to it.  
i am oddly enough, not tired, nor thirsty, nor hungry.  
i start to get panicked when i see red, and golden eyes staring at me from within the shadows of the trees.  
growls, and shrieks are heard, but nothing approaches me.  
maybe...  
maybe they are afraid of the river?  
i follow the river, until in the distance i see...smoke.

  
i am filled with happiness.  
smoke means fire, and fire should mean some human activity!  
then...wariness hits me.  
what if they arent helpful? what if they are bandits or worse?  
i look around and see that the river splits in two.  
i steel my resolve, and follow the stream that leads away from the smoke.  
i walk for what seem days, weeks, and i am yet to feel hunger, or thirst.  
i arrive to a point, where to my right, i see a farm.  
but...it is away from the river.

  
i still follow my fathers words, and follow the river.  
again and again, i see sights, i feel watched, i hear roars, and see horror beyond my comprehension.  
the rivers presence calms me.  
then...i see it.  
my house!   
i run to it, and the moment i am about to enter it, i fall.  
darkness engulfs me.  
weakly, i hear some people talking.  
his fever is going down. the antibiotics are fighting the infection...he made it through the night, so chances are good that he will recover. a voice says, followed by thank you, and sobs.  
i try to open my eyes, but cant...  
so i start thinking about the river, and i start to feel calmer, cooler...and relaxed."
"[wp] first of all, why did you have something this dangerous just lying around here in the first place? secondly, what the hell do you mean it is gone?!","the cottage fell silent. heldock rubbed his ear hole, staring reproachfully at his friend. the naga towered over his friend, his green scales darkening in colour. gleaming gems hung around his waist, decorating the sash he wore to preserve his modesty. its not like i have many other place to store such things!

his friend glared back. the kobold scratched her dull reddih hide, adjusting the leather armour she wore. it was etched with a rising sun, the cities guard insignia, as did the base of her spear tip. purple eyes blinked as she poked at him repeatedly, huffing at him. we have a city vault, you pile of shed skin! its provided precisely to stop this sort of thing from happening!

heldock threw up his arms, voice rising. oh sure! let me just walk up and say, good day receptionist! id like to deposit a prototype translocation bomb! it will only transport half the city to deep within the astral sea if set off! i see no problem with that.

the kobold sighed, groaning. fine, i see your point. but why the hell did you make it?! i thought you were taking the next few years easy.

he hissed. a long forked tongue poked out, as he had the decency to look embarrassed. i... i had an idea. and you know how i get. but it was safe. so long as it was near me, it wouldnt go off! and after the thought reaver incursion before, i thought a countermeasure would be prudent. i dont want that disaster to happen again vanina.

vanina sighed, nodding. i get it. really, hel. but this sort of thing... well it jeopardises our home here. the mayor will not be happy to know about a dangerous device being loose in the city. and he will probably demand that it be handed over for inspection.

the naga groaned, rubbing his face. great. because he can definitely be trusted with it. but i guess i dont have a choice. plus... ill need to make it safer beforehand, especially if some idiot tries playing with it.

his friend shrugged. guess so. ill call in the others. theyll need to sweep for clues.

heldock nodded. go ahead. and... if you find them, would you mind testing something out?

he laughed as she narrowed her eyes. another guinea pig moment?

a shake of his head made his hood flap, muscles relaxed slightly. no, its safe! but if it impresses the guards, i could make more sales.

from a crowded side table he withdrew a slim silver tube. he offered it over, speaking quickly. i call it a light bolas tube. aim it at a fleeing perpetrator, and theyll be wrapped in chains of light for four hours! plenty of time to apprehend them, no?

vanina paused, before watching him out if the corner of her eye. you didnt let a dangerous artifact be stolen to try and make a sale did you?

heldock sniggered. no... but thats an idea for the future, yes?"
"[wp] in hindsight, that weird person in the woods you foolishly decided to talk to was definitely a fey. they asked you what your favorite fantasy creature is and you told them.  you wake up the next day transformed into said creature, with a note on your floor.","i sigh.  
the weird dude in the woods i humored was totally a fey, yep.  
he wasnt a cosplaying genderswapped zelda, nope.  
and i had to answer his question, and tell him what my favorite fantasy creature is.  
thankfully, i said a humanoid creature.  
though, after reading the note, i realized i cant even check myself out.  
why?  
because my favorite fantasy creature is the gorgon.



indeed.  
i could feel the snakes on my head move.  
it was a bit tickly.  
shh now. i said, and they hissed back? and stopped moving?  
cool.  
i looked at my hands, that became much paler, and i am pretty sure i got taller.  
hot legs. i whistled.  
now, back to reading the note.  
i had to know whether i could use something as a medium to look at people.



i was outside, shopping.  
i wore glasses i needed them anyway, and covered my head with a nice rainbow scarf.  
it was aokay.  
problem was...  
gorgons apparently are inherently attracting the bad kind of men.  
so, i was quite often stopped.  
thankfully, the little cuties under my scarf helped me out, every now and then.  
heh.  
hearing grown ass men screech is fun.  
it seem i was lucky.



yep.  
totally lucked it out.  
other than the fact that i hate cold, and men, not that much of a different life from before.  
i did quit my job, and started a fullremote one.  
less pay, but can work 2 jobs at the same time, so i am not in financial issue.  
i also am quite better looking, which i am using to my own advantage.  
obviously.  
the fact that i sometimes crave human flesh, and blood, and raw meat...  
and listen to the screams of the cruel and evil?  
well.  
you win some, you lose some.  
am i right?"
"[wp]why are you surprised? this is what you wanted, isnt it? me finally completely broken down? only shame is, that i dont seem to care about your lives anymore... or anything else for that matter.","the walk to the castle was decently long, but not too much. not enough to make me tired on my way there. none of my former team had gone to meet me yet, but i could hear the guards telling civilians to close up shop and go home immediately. some groaned about curfew being way too early, but it seemed this was the new normal. i still remember how happy the place was before... just like myself. who would have thought the city and i would be so similar.

i could hear some noises behind me, skirmishes between loyalist and rebel guards going off, making the few remaining civilians look for cover. i, well, i just kept going. my steps constant, measured, purposeful, empty. even though i had lost little to no agility, my stride was heavy. it bore the weight of betrayal, of hiding, of essentially being an untouchable. then, i got to the gate. and of course, everyone was there. rumor had spread there as well, news travel much more quickly than people.

youre supposed to be dead. the tank spoke first. should have joined that white mage friend of yours when you had the chance. he spat. 

he was either brainwashed or indoctrinated, all of them were. maybe both. i stared at them, they looked more or less the same, but more mature, and definitely with uniforms to match. they all wore the archmages colors, making them look like villains in their own right. they pretty much were now. if they could be saved, i had long since stopped caring.

let me through. i said, as flatly as before. and i will not kill you.

wont you be begging us to join your side? the archer, arrow in his hand, said half surprised half spiteful.

i know better than to waste my breath. i replied, as flat as before.

i then started walking towards the castle, and of course they went on me. i knew how they all fought, we had sparred before, each time holding back to not hurt each other. i also knew how they were when they werent. one by one i managed to dispatch them all, even the archer who had stayed out of the melee and scored a hit on my chest, enough to hurt me but not hitting anything too important. in the end i stood battered, with the bodies of my former friends lying on the floor around me. i only let out a sigh, disappointed it had to come to this, but they left me no option. if i turned around they would have killed me anyway.

in i went into the castle, many staff both fearful and hateful of their new life. i had known many from my days serving the former king, and they all looked like they aged twice as much as they should. they obviously remembered the good old times. these were very much not the good old times. no one interfered with me though, the few remaining guards knew that no one went past my fallen comrades alive, unless they themselves had been killed. well, one did. i easily cornered him and put my sword to his neck.

where is he? i asked, my voice as sharp as my blade, even if devoid of any sense of justice.

the guard squealed in my grasp. throne... room... he squeaked, hoping that i would let him go.

i did, kind of. i made sure he wouldnt have any children ever, i wouldnt be risking getting attacked from the back. eventually i found them, the throne room gates. closed. i slashed the lock and pulled them open, and of course there he was. that smug little punchable face that had long since tried to remove me from the face of this land. time to do what i came to do."
"[wp] dear earthlings, prepare to be my slave! announced the alien. you will have to work 3 entire days from monday to wednesday, you will only get a5 wagyu steak for meals, and if that isnt cruel enough youll have to work 2 entire torturing hours of picking strawberries every single work day!","the announcement rang through factories and office building, restaurants, fields, and shopping centers. in crowded metropolises and rural pastures, all heard the proclamation.

there was a moments pause as each person looked to those around them, confirming they werent hearing things. then 

i volunteer! shouted a woman, running from the front entrance of a hotel, soapy sponge still in hand.

choose me, cried a young man, abandoning his till at the big box store.

please! shouted a man wearing an illfitting suit and tie as he stared out the window of an office building. my doctor told me to avoid red meat, so if i could replace some of the wagyu with chicken, im your man!

do i get credit for the 10 hours ive already picked fruit today?  asked a woman in a field. 

hovering above them all zoon was perplexed. youll only be allowed 9 hours a night for sleep! he added, to assert himself.

uninterrupted? asked a woman trying to soothe her baby while attending a conference call.

er, yes zoon said. and you will only be given 6 weeks vacation a year! and you must use it!

when can i start? shouted several voices in many languages.

zoon paused. you! he shouted to the woman in the field. your done for the day! report back tomorrow after youve bathed and slept he beamed the berries she picked into his ship. 

you and you! he called to the housekeeper and cashier. youll find your steak dinners waiting at your dwellings. go now and prepare for your enslavement tomorrow!

same too you! he called to the man in the office. but ive substituted a boring free range chicken salad with fresh produce for you. the waygu will be a monthly indulgence.

and you! he snapped at the new mother. you and your partner are not to report to work until youve taken the horrifically short 1year parental leave!

he paused the rest of you go home and wait to be awoken by birdsong in the morning. unless home is unsafe or nonexistent in which case you will be forced to live in the furnished 1200 square foot rowhomes that are our slave quarters!

he waited for screams of terror, but instead heard only joyful celebration. he focused, using the super hearing of his spieces and then  yes! voices, perhaps 1 out of 100, no, 1 out of 1000 crying out from penthouses and corner offices this is really going to tank our stock prices!"
"[wp] take care of my son... and make sure your child doesnt follow my path... said the dark emperor, lord of evil, as he died. the cleric, the heros beloved, was the only one who heard it, as the rest of the party decided what to do next. 17 years later...","they called my father the dark emperor, the lord of evil it was a name that he had embraced with his dress and style of leadership. the world remembers him as a symbol of fear, an evil tyrant who ruled with an iron fist. but to me, he was father, a tired man with callused hands that he used to braid my hair and tell me stories of a world that only he understood.

i was only five when the heroes raided our castle to finally depose the evil emperor, i remember as the hero struck my father down, his last words, take care of my daughter, and make sure she doesnt follow the same path i did

i grew up in their world, the world of the heroes. they raised me among those who cheered for the empires fall. they told me the tales of liberation, how they saved the empire from an evil tyrant, who happened to be my father. they told me the stories of how they killed the monsters who once ruled the kingdom, and trained me to strike down such evil whenever i saw it.

when i reached adulthood, they sent me out to strike down the last embers of tyranny. i went town to town, killing off the remaining loyalists to my father but as i did so, i learned more and more. 

i found my fathers old medic, who told me of how the culling of the eastern quarter was actually strategic quarantining of a deadly disease, condemning dozens to die, so thousands could live.

his general, who told me of the assassinations that my father orchestrated  killing slavers, pedophiles, and murderers, who otherwise had the political and social capital to keep up appearances.

and his alchemist, who told me of how the kingdoms legalization of certain narcotics was done to limit the illegal drug trade and reduce violent crimes. 

as i liberated more and more towns, i told myself that i was saving them, but the more i worked, the less sure i became. it wasnt until i stood in the ruins of the most recent town, when i came to the realization. after i slaughtered the loyalist forces, i saw a young boy run to his fathers body  his father, who i had just slain. the boy was no older than i was when my father had passed. when i saw this, thats when i knew.

there is no such thing as true evil. only stories told by victors.

the heroes who raised me did so with kindness  but also with fear. they ruled their kingdom in much the same way that my father did.

not everything was black and white.

not all monsters wear horns.
not all heroes wear light."

my face burned with anger at this. first, im thirtyfive. i am not a kid. second, you broke into my home, killed the love of my life and kidnapped my child at school, and youre trying to tell me its nothing personal?

the rage i felt in this moment was unfathomable. how is killing someone not personal. how is kidnapping their child not personal? it was personal to me. 

i uncocked the gun. i took my finger off the trigger. the demon in front of me relaxed his muscles, and looked into my eyes. his eyes painted the picture of true gratitude, but no amount of mercy should be given to scum like him. 

i picked up my pistol, and smashed the side of his head with it. he fell to the side, with a guttural sound escaping through his mouth. i hit him so hard that his eyeball began protruding through his eyelid, as he muttered please to me. i hit him again, and again, and again. i hit him so many times, blood started pouring out of his nose, mouth, eyes, and ears. his skull was a mushed mess after i was done. 

as he lay there motionless i sit there looking at the blood that splattered my hands, and painted the rug underneath me. i went downstairs, got my son, and left the house that was my sons prison for the last six months. even though i have my son and got my revenge, the hatred still lingered, and the grief still present. i dont know why i still feel this way, but right now, all that matters is that my son is safe, and that the demon who took him will never hurt anyone again.

the rumors spread.

the whispers that made drunks in backalley bars laugh nervously before glancing over their shoulders.

girls.

magical girls.

like something out of an anime i watched when i was seven.

a girl in a short skirt wielding a sword made of starlight, cutting monsters into ribbons.

a girl with a bow who shot arrows that turned hollowhearts to mist.

fairytales, i thought. some new government blackops scam to keep the masses calm while the monsters ate their kids.

whod believe it?

not me. not until the night i saw her.



it wasnt even a commissioned job.

a city councilman turned halfhollow.

a real piece of shit. 

trafficked kids.

smuggled hollowheart bits to black market labs.

i wanted him dead so bad i didnt even think about his security.

so i went in halfcocked, a cheap blade in my hand and pipe bombs strapped to my chest.

the bodyguards caught me before i even got close.

halfhollows  four of them, eyes like dead bulbs, skin all wrong under the streetlights.
they tore me apart like wet paper. broke my ribs, crushed my knee, laughed while they did it.

i thought...

...this is it. this is what all those movies forgot to mention.

dying in a gutter, pissing yourself, no dramatic last words.

but then she dropped out of the sky, all silver and moonlight, armor that gleamed like a blade fresh from the forge.

silver paladin.

she cut the first halfhollow in half. 

just like that. 

no pause, no hesitation. 

her sword hummed like a hymn while she fought, moving through them like they were shadows.

i remember her eyes. so bright, so tired, so done with this worlds shit.

she didnt say, stay down, citizen!

she didnt say anything heroic. 

she just looked at me, bleeding in the rain, and said,
try not to die, alright ?

then she vanished into the smoke, chasing the rest of those bastards down like a wolf through a flock.



when the hollowhearts came, the world stopped believing in heroes.

we just wanted survivors.

and yet, there she was. a 15 years old girl, draped in silver, fighting monsters with a sword made of starlight.

that night, i knew the rumors were real.

that night, i knew id never be what id dreamed of as a kid.

and for once, that didnt make me angry.

i could never expect, that, three months from now, i would be something akin to her."

 did you see anything weird? during the show?

he blinked.

 uh... define weird. you mean, besides your little moment of stage fright?

i shook my head.

 never mind.

we crossed the street. the bar was glowing up ahead  soft yellow light spilling onto the sidewalk like it was trying to pretend it was warmer inside than it was. through the window, two women sat at a small table near the front. both laughing. one blonde, one redhead. they looked like they belonged to another story. one i didnt know how to be in.

rory turned to me before we entered.

 hey. whatever that was tonight... its fine. shit happens. youre still the best thing this dump has ever seen. dont let it eat you alive, yeah?

i managed a halfnod.

he clapped me on the shoulder.

 come on. lets go make a few strangers fall in love with us.

he pushed the door open and stepped inside. music spilled out. warmth. laughter.

i stayed on the sidewalk. just for a second longer. watching the girls. watching rory slip into his perfect rhythm. already flashing that grin, already pulling chairs, already charming his way into another temporary paradise.

i stood there.

not cold. not warm.

in between.

my hand drifted to the inside pocket of my coat. not the outer one. not where i kept cigarettes or my show cards. the other one. the secret one.

it was empty.

of course it was.

the ace of clubs was still on that couch.

still glowing.

still waiting.

i looked through the glass one more time. then pushed the door open and followed rory into the noise, into the warmth, into the part of my life i understood.

"[wp] you havent given much thought to the strange door thats in your kitchen. that is, until you come down and find it open.","when louis moved to this rural fishing town full of supernatural entities, a strange door in the kitchen was the least of his worries. it wasnt in the floor plan, but at least it didnt make weird noises and stayed shut.

there were far more important things, like putting food on an altar for the perpetually hungry local deity. remembering to plug his ears lest the sirens by the sea lure him to a watery death. bowing before the kappas on the way to work. stuff like carrying a protective ward against shoggoths and ghoul repellant. and most of all, staying alive. also, not becoming food, a mindcontrolled meatsuit or a source of brain slurpee to the eldritch inhabitants.

until one night, a banshees cry woke up him in the middle of the night. yes, he understood from his time in innsmouth that she meant well, warning someone in town of an impending death. but couldnt she do it during the waking hours, or to tone it down so only related people hear her?

unable to go back to sleep, louis wandered down to his kitchen to grab a snack. except his fridge was already open. and so was that strange kitchen door, for the first time.

whos there? he grabbed the nearest lamp and waved it like a battlehammer.

you forgot your offering on my altar today, the pale entity peeked its head out from the fridge. it was talking with one mouth and eating a whole pizza with another. so, i had to come in through this preinstalled portal door and eat.

louis rolled his eyes and lowered his lamp. at this time?

im always hungry.

youre the worst god i know. what deity raids the fridge of a human living in its territory?

hey, at least i do keep your protected and alive, the eldritch horror somehow managed a pout despite swallowing an entire fruit basket, basket and ribbons included. neither do i demand human sacrifice nor oppressive conditions. i will have you know lord elvari here is a toprated friendly neighbourhood eldritch on yelp. wait, arent you here to also have a snack at 3am? then, i did nothing wrong.

thats my fridge, louis bemoaned. my food.

in my territory, elvari argued back.

fine, whatever, the human put the lamp back down and approached the fridge. then leave some for me. at least

sorry, the tentacled deity apologized, but not before shoving the last box of lasagna into its mouth to leave the fridge barren. send me the receipts and ill pay you back for the food. minus what tribute was owed to me in the first place.

can i also ask that you get rid of your portal door? louis pointed at the door, which now had a portal swirling in the middle. knock and come in like a normal person?

but i am an eldritch deity. i am no normal person, elvari scowled while a few tentacles started licking spilled ketchup and barbecue sauce in the fridge and the floor. i do not knock and open a door and step inside like a mortal plebian. oh well, next time, ill phase through the wall, or float through your window.

dont

louis was too late to stop that voracious local deity from disappearing through his ceiling. and too late to mention that he never had the habit of keeping receipts when ordering takeout.

[wp] a superhero after beating a group of street thugs found a baby they had kidnapped but couldnt find their parents so decided to raise them by themselves but soon the worlds greatest villain showed up at their apartment door looking for their child.,"i walked back into the living room where the both of them were sleeping. i lightly draped the blanket over the villainous and smiled weakly. what am i doing? exhausted i slump onto the couch and slowly drift off to sleep myself.

when i woke, the sun was up, casting a dim light through the closed blinds. i blinked a few times and saw the bassinet still in the middle of the floor. to my left, no one. 

i looked around, but no sign of vanta echo. then i heard the flushing of the toilet and running water from the sink. quiet again. the super villainous came into the living room and plopped down next to me on the couch.

morning, sunshine. her smile could light up a room, while her powers could snuff the light out from someones eyes. yet here i was, being enthralled by the most powerful woman on the planet. her voice is sweet like honey, soft like marshmallows.

hm... can i call it a good morning when i have a bad bitch next to me? i giggled, blushing slightly.

well, anna, you may be able to quiet storms and other weather related things, but youre interest in me seems insatiable. her chuckle made me blush harder, but her comment about my powers caught me off guard. 

i  she cut me off by gently putting a finger to my lips. i froze in place, not knowing what was the come.

you left your costume in the bathroom. very cute though. your current dress is cuter. she smiled and gently traced her fingers along where the dress lay against my thigh, driving me up a wall, my face brighter than a stop light. oh, look at you.

i burried my face in my knees, embarassed as can be. why am i so easily flustered by the baddies!? ugh, my last girlfriend was way more of a goodie two shoes than i am! i felt a hand rest upon my head. 

ive no interest in harming you, anna. heros arent my targets. politicians, beurocrats, and the like are. she ruffled my hair a bit before pulling her hand away.

so... what, you kill when you dont get things the way you want? i tilted my head, confused and genuinely wanting to understand.

no. i strictly focus on those who are in it for greed and selfishness. those that hoard the worldly resources. those that dont focus on the betterment of the planet and every species that shares this space with us. i dont aimlessly kill. its focused, narrowed. thats why, slowly, this country, is finally beginning to heal. what do you think of that? she gently lifted my head up and gave me a smile.

i tapped my index fingers together, smiling back. thats... that doesnt sound evil. we could do so much good together! i can bring rain to areas that need it and other weatherbased needs!

she nodded, satisfied with my answer as she continued. and i can, safely, expedite processes, like growing of greenery, removing plastic from places it doesnt belong, which is everywhere. remember that island of plastic? i nodded with aggressive enthusiasm. i wiped it from existence. i pulled the fresh water from the melting polar ice and refroze them. yet, there is much for me to do. 

my jaw dropped in awe as i stared at this magnificent woman. youve done so much good so far and youre not being given the acknowledgement you deserve! i sighed, falling back onto the couch, head hitting the pillow.

i dont seek acknowledgment for what i do. its simply something that needs to be done and right now, science isnt where it needs to be to fix it. so... humble and yet so caring.

this woman could talk about the most mundane things and id be hooked on every word. speaking of which. well, since we are getting to know one another... whens your birthday? mine is june, 2000. i continued to look at the ceiling, pondering how i got here.

november, 1990. why? her voice was calm and soft, inviting.

my face felt a little hot. i tilted my head so i could look her in the eyes. so, youre like, ten years older than me...

i heard her giggle, causing me to raise my head and look at her.

yeah, i am. 10 years of life experience. how old did you think i was? she gave a wicked grin, then leaned closer, resting her chin on my knees, looking up at me. 

same age as me, 25... i turned my head away, shyness overcoming me. why is my body betraying me!? theres no way this older woman has any interest in me. a newbie heroine! i covered my cheeks and nose with the blanket. 

she giggled. im flattered. yes, i can modify my own genetics, so i practically never age. i can still feel everything. she looked over at the bassinet, watching her child sleep. 

i looked over, pulling the blanket away from my face, smiling at the sleeping child. what do you think her powers will be?

she rapped her fingers against the wall, pondering before answering. hm... most likely same as mine. low chance of the father, or even lower still, something completely different. she was right, the parent who births the child, their genes were the most likely to be passed down to the child over the other parent.

i moved the blanket back to the top of the couch. its too hot for it now and i didnt want to change my clothes again. 

well, itll be amazing to see what abilities she develops! not that ill be around to see. i frowned, still looking at glimmer, in her bassinet. 

why wouldnt you be? vanta black turned her head, facing her sleeping child.

well, because by societys views, at least. we are supposed to be enemies. i looked down at her, captivated by her side profile. she glowed, basking in the sunlight through the blinds.

supposed to be, but dont have to be. we could do the whole enemies to lovers trope. she cackled, looking up at me, but i saw the slight red in her face.

oh, is that a blush from you, vanta!? i teasingly pointed at her cheeks with my fingers.

hey, i didnt tease you about how flustered you got! she hid her face in the blanket, but she couldnt his the redness of her face from me. by the way, my name is clara. she muffled through the blanket.

i giggled. i know. im sorry. i like to point out other peoples flustered states cause im embarrassed by my own. clara... beautiful name for an drop dead gorgeous baddie like yourself. 

she blushed a little more. i accept your apology and forgive you. ya know, youre pretty adorable yourself, doll. im enjoying our back and forth banter. would you... want to come back to my place, sometime? i mean, its only fair since ive seen yours... she shyly twirled her hair between her fingers.

id like that, a lot, actually. id like you to meet my friends, too. i reached out, taking her right hand in my left hand, holding her gently. is this okay?

she nodded, giving a small smile, letting the blanket fall from her face.

both women lay on the couch, waiting for glimmer to wake for the day. the apartment was peaceful that day as the two women bantered back and forth and shared in the task of taking care of glimmer."

"[wp] on the hunt, you search the woods for the werewolf thats been terrorizing the village. after searching, you find the werewolf but before you can attack, another human approach and bite the werewolf.","finally.

haral breathed the word, peering through the dense bushes. his leather armour was coated in mottled greens and browns, letting him blend in to the wild growths with greater ease. a pair of silvered daggers hung from a belt, as he held the prepared crossbow.

cold brown eyes fixed on the prey before him, unflinching in their resolve. his breathing was light, keeping his body as still as possible. the smell of crushed plants filled his nose, natural oils obscuring his scent from the beast.

and what a beast it was. it was hunched, yet if it was tall it would be head and shoulders over him. thick grey fur covered its body, rippling with each move. long arms clawed the ground, carving furrows in soft earth. its breath steamed onto the air, spilling from its fanged maw.

the werewolf pawed around a tree it had found, sniffing and huffing as it did so. haral watched, taking care to aim carefully. he want a kill shot if possible, or at the least as close to crippling as he could to finish it off easier.

a sudden snap of a stick made him freeze. the wolf turned its head, peering towards the source. it gave a growl, lowering its head.

a patter of feet followed, as a figure burst into view. a human girl, nearly a teen, leapt at the wolf, extending her arms. haral swore, watching as they grappled each other. yet he gaped as she bit into the beast, giggling as she growled back at it. they rolled around as the hunter stood.

he raised his crossbow, shouting at the girl. get away! get back!

the girl turned her head, spotting him in an instant. the werewolf spun, positioning itself between her and haral. it gave a snarl, as she quietly spoke. who are you?

he gestured at her to move. im a hunter! now get out of the way! that is a beast!

she reached out, patting the wolf. this is fuzzy. he is nice, not a beast.

the hunter snarled in return. yes he is! he has been ruining springriver, you silly girl. now get out of the way!

she crossed her arms, shaking her head. no! thats not fuzzy! thats the new one. the mean one.

the wolf crouched. he watched as her eyes moved over his shoulder, widening. her voice was loud, piercing at something. get down mister!

before he could react, fuzzy sprang forwards. drool dripping from its maw, it was on him in a flash. he tensed, prepared for an impact. one that never came. instead he felt a rush of air, before a heavy thud sounded behind. growls filled the air, from the wolf he had spied and another.

haral turned, spotting a brutal, animalistic fight. the grey form he had hunted snapped and clawed at one similar, though its fur was flecked with spots of brown. he felt a drop of sweat roll down his back, cold filling him. one werewolf was bad enough, but two was terrifying.

the girl pointed, voice desperate. help fuzzy, please!

he turned, looking aghast. help?!

she nodded furiously. that brown one is the one you want!

haral rolled his eyes, taking a shaky breath. how can i believe that?!

a snarl made him turn, seeing fuzzy underneath the other. the girl screamed again. help him!

he gulped, shaking his head as he turned. helping a monster, what am i doing?

the crossbow rose, as he took aim. it shuddered as it fired, the bolt flying through the air and burying itself in the brown wolfs upper chest. it howled, reeling back. hate filled eyes locked onto him, as it was pushed off balance by fuzzy.

haral shook his head again, grumbling as he shakily loaded another bolt. stupid. this is stupid.

but he didnt stop. he couldnt now. he could at least make sure the other one was dead. then he could decide what on earth to do with this fuzzy and the girl."
[wp] you lost it?  how can you have lost it? its a planet with 5 moons,"itit was right there, im certain! kara exclaimed, looking over at the captain of the stars embrace. she ran a hand through her hair, pacing back and forth in front of her console as her eyes flicked between readouts.

well, captain reed started, wearing a bemused expression, clearly it wasnt right there. was it. i knew we shouldnt have done that software upgrade it always makes things go wonky.

kara, however, shook her head, casting a glance around the bridge to see if anyone else was as worried as she was. as worried as they should be.

sir ive seen the software glitch before, and this isnt that. here, im accessing the ftl communication drive to access the registry. but im certain that the planet should be right in our viewport.  
  
captain reed turned to glance out the viewport while his navigations officer fussed with her console. the poor woman needed a vacation maybe hed dock back at venus instead of earth on their way home. that way, she could go cloudsurfing at one of those fancy resorts for a while during the repairs. kara was starsdamned good at her job, but she had a tendency to get overstressed. even still, this kind of mistake wasnt common for her.

that thought troubled the captain, and he strode to the viewport, squinting his eyes into the dark void of space beyond. he often found that kara and the others were overreliant on their fancy gadgets and gizmos. sometimes, the best way to find the problem was to take a look around with ones own two eyes.

sadly, as kara mentioned, there was no planet in the viewport nor any indication that it had ever been here. however, as the stars embrace approached where the planet should be, he felt an odd shift move its way through the vessel. captain reed frowned it was almost as if as if there was still a gravitational pull where the planet should be. hed flown this ship for over twenty years now, and he knew what it felt like when gravity started to assert control.

squinting his eyes at the viewport, he called an order more on instinct than anything else. tian, what are we reading from the external sensors. any gravitational anomalies.

the small, thin man towards the back of the room shook his head. no sir, its as kara said everything is reading as if theres still a planet right in front of us.

a gravitational pull where there used to be a planet, a lack of any visible indication in the blackness of space a chill ran down the captains spine, and he pressed his hand against the cold glass of the viewport. there, just before him there was a slight warping of light. a small distortion from where the light of a distant star was bent into a circle. a blackhole 

full thrusters reverse! captain reed snapped, his jaw clenching. kara, anything from earth?!

i ii cant reach them, sir, the young woman stuttered. or mars, or venus, or mercury. there was icy terror in karas voice that had the captain whirling toward her.

what do you mean?! the drive is broken?! he demanded, not angry but panicked.

slowly, kara shook her head and took a steadying breath of filtered and refiltered air. no the messages are going out just fine. they just arent responding.

stunned silence settled over the bridge like an oppressive blanket. no one knew what was happening, but as captain reed stared once more out into the void of space, he wondered if anything else was out there but icy cold."

i dont know why my parents keep bringing me to this restaurant.
every friday. same table. same fakefancy menu. same awful lighting that makes everything look like a hospital waiting room.

but tonight, im not here for the food.

im here for the mission.

one spider crawls slowly across my wrist. her names mara. i named her after a dream i had where she strangled a pigeon. that felt like a good omen.

shes nervous. so am i.

okay, i whisper. you know the drill. table seven. kid with the chocolate cake. drop in. grab a crumb. no one sees you. no one dies. cool?

mara wiggles her legs. i take that as a yes.

she skitters down my arm, across the floor, under a chair, straight into action.

i stay seated. calm. cool. collected. totally normal girl.

until the screaming starts.

some lady screeches loud enough to rattle the forks. her chair falls backwards. a waiter slips. the cake launches through the air like a missile and splatters against the wall.

i blink.

okay. not the plan

aranhas  plural swarm out from under the table. where the hell did the rest come from?! theres like twenty. maybe more. one of them lands on a toddlers leg.

the kid laughs.

thank god.

i try to shrink into my seat, but my moms already rushing over.

sofia! she whisperyells. please tell me those arent yours.

define yours.

my dad looks like hes about to burst a vein, but he pulls me out of the chair with way more gentleness than expected.

we leave. early. again

in the car, im quiet. they dont yell. not really. they just sigh.

but mara climbs back up my sleeve like a little soldier returning from war. she taps the back of my neck.

yeah. it was a disaster.
but a fun one.

and next time?

we aim for the whole cake.

i step in. shes sitting at the table, peeling potatoes like shes planning to stab them. hair pulled tight. wrinkles like battle scars. she doesnt look up.

theyre not circus kids, i say.

they got circus powers.

i grab a glass, fill it with water from the tap.
powers dont have to be flashy to be real.

she scoffs. back in my day, we didnt call parlor tricks powers. if someone sparked or levitated a spoon, they joined the army. or got locked up.

you also thought lefthanded kids were cursed.

they are.

i laugh  tired and small and sit across from her.

she eyes me. sharp. suspicious.

tell me at least one of them is useful.

all of them are. just not in the way people expect.

she slams a potato into the bowl like it insulted her.

then teach them right. before they get eaten alive.

i dont answer.

she eventually knelt beside him as he reached out for anyone to love him. he was thirteen years old and not from this world. he was an orphan, thrown away by the daughter of a rich upbringing who didnt want him. so when he was summoned by the princess of the elven kingdom, he believed he was finally wanted by someone. but all that was at the end.

before he can be consumed by his fear. his fear of death. his fear of failure. his fear of rejection and loneliness, the demon queen grasped his outstretched hand as it blindly fumbled for anything. she stroked his head and held his hand as he lay gasping and gurgling, i dont want to be hate ed any more. 

shhh, its okay, its over now. im not angry at you, but at those who would send children to fight in their place. shhh, close your eyes, and when you awaken, it will all seem like a bad dream. her voice was soothing and soft. melodious like an elfs. his panic started to cease as death claimed him. soon he closed his tear stained eyes that knew nothing of love. the twentyfifth hero that tyrant queen of the summer forest had sent, summoned from a different world than this one, had been killed because of her greed. always the same mo

she hated how this always happened, and how she cant do anything about it because despite all the heroes being below the age of 15, theyre still strong enough to hold her armies back. instead of raging now, she simply sighed and lifted the cooling body of another child to be buried in her garden, so they can be surrounded by something beautiful in their final peace."
"[wp] youre a villain. you steal things. you have a territory that you rule with an iron fist. you live in the sewers, and have caused several people to disappear down here. youre the bad guy. so why, pray tell, is the city sending down ambassadors to discuss your management of public services?","im...sorry could you repeat that?

the, far too well dressed man for the sewer town gave a nod, and continued, of course sorry this was a surprise visit so you were very much unprepared.

he took out some notes, and began pointing out charts, he had in the whiteboard they actually brought down with them, and went over the whole spill again.

as your, sewer demense, has expanded we began noticing a large increase in the citys underground infrastructure quality. after sending some, braver souls to investigate we noticed several repairs, changes, and signs of frequent maintenance that the city had not signed off on.

this part was true, i live in the sewers after all, and like most people, i maintain my home. also when the possible side effect of not doing so means drowning in sewage you find a great deal of motivation to do so.

so we put two and two together, and realized it was you doing so, and after some deliberation the city council and mayor came to a conclusion.

he once again pointed at the papers he handed me earlier. including the check with several zeroes at the end.

that is a check for previous services rendered, and would like to discuss your continued services in doing so.

the city, the city i very much terrorized, wanted to hire me to keep their underground going.

me.

the ragged emperor, as my followers called me.

here, quick context, i was homeless, ptsd from the war, and of course being a larger and intimidating looking sort didnt go well for reintegrating into society. when i got exposed to those weird chemicals i developed superpowers, and formed a psuedocult following among the homeless.

i started using them, my military training, and powers to form my own syndicate, and basically took over the sewers and a great deal of abandoned areas.

there, recap over, now.

so, let me get this straight, yall want me a known supervillain and crimeboss, to be in your payroll to keep things going down here?

he gave an affirmative answer, and elaborated.

while, your history is complex, we would like to point out that the level, and sheer degree, of your maintenance has not only kept it going, but has also improved its efficiency in certain places.

he also pointed out some other charts, and continued.

also, the condition of the homeless has also grown to a far more acceptable degree. the number of homeless deaths has dropped significantly since you took power, and they are staying in communities they formed away from higher traffic and tourist areas.

i gave an agitated grunt at that last but, but let him continue.

so we would like to negotiate an agreement. the base terms are payment for your continued maintenance, we will delay planned demolition of some of the abandoned buildings you have set up ship in indefinitely, and as long as you keep your less scrupulous actions down here

he waved a hand for emphasis.

we will turn a blind eye to them.

i shifted on my junk throne for my next reply.

as for the capes and other vigilantes?

he adjusted his glasses before responding.

there are a few we can keep off of you, but others, well, they are vigilantes after all, and we will leave them to your discretion.  or, lack there of as long as the rule of keeping such, business down here is followed.

i sat, chin in my hand, and pondered the offer.

you realize this is some serious corrupt shit you are offering, right..?

maybe so.

but, it has saved a great deal of taxpayer money, and also infrastructure and utility improvement was one of the mayors main campaigns promises."
"[wp] the dark lord who had been sealed away 1000 years ago has been unleaded, and hes going to spread death and chais to oh, hes actually enjoying the modern world? and hes befriended the reincarnation of the chosen hero, okay.","retired darkness the burden of feeling

i saw him again, months after i accidentally broke the seal that let him into our world again.
the dark lord, anikatos, sat beside me on the roof.

anikatos did not speak. he didnt need to. he just sat, legs dangling, watching the same indifferent sky i watched, as if the clouds themselves were ashamed of what they had drifted above.

he turned to me, smilingnot cruelly, but with the knowing weariness of someone whod read the final chapter before the book even began.

 and i thought i was needed to ruin humanity, he said.

there was no venom in it. only fatigue. he hadnt come to kill. hed come to observe the corpse twitch.

i looked at him, really looked. there was still something human in his eyesbeneath the shadow and the fire, beneath the weight of rage and centuries. a question, maybe. a hope long since dismembered and buried in some grave he could no longer find.

 i want to change this, i said.

the words felt absurd in the airsoft, nave, a whisper trying to rearrange a hurricane. but i meant them.

i didnt have power. i didnt even have people. all i had was the aching belief that there must still be something salvageable inside us.

i noticed that the main thing required to change this world was how humans began to view the world. their traumas rewriting their reality, distorting beliefs. 

so i began with the smallest thing i could listening and trying to nudge some in a better path. 
little did i know how much of a toll it took on me.



at first, i thought if i could understand the people around mereally understand themi could help them return to themselves. i started noticing the tremble in their voices, the flickers in their eyes when they spoke of things that mattered. i tried to mirror back their thoughts without distortion. to become a quiet receiver, faithful and clear.

but its never that simple.

how do you speak your pain bravely?

how do you share your internal chaos as it is?

even when they tried to explain what they felt, i saw their expressions stiffennot out of judgment, but confusion. perception, after all, is a prism. every word they said refracted through their histories, biases, traumas. what i received was never what they gave. and what i gave in return often felt incomplete.

i began to carry the awareness of not just their loneliness, but the understanding of how i misunderstood it. that made it heavier.


how can i help people? especially the ones who dont help themselves? 

the exhaustion was unexplainable. 

i labored over every word, every expression, trying to ensure i caused no harm, gave no false signal, missed no subtext. i listened as though people were sonataslayered, delicate, never quite played the same way twice.

i still hardly could help. maybe slight pushes was all i ever did. how can i do better?

there was a slow, creeping erosion of hope. a silent question blooming in the back of my mind

 will i ever find someone who listens the way i do? who sees without assuming? who understands without owning?

and i block that thought. 

i seem to be simply tired of trying to be the bridge between people who had forgotten how to build. 

and suddenly, i got up, staring at anikatos, 
i dont know how, but i feel i cannot afford to get tired, i cannot afford to stop now. i need to gather all my energy and continue in my cause.

anikatos, silently raising his eyebrows, eyes dilated, and talking to himself
there was one person who i knew, who had that same drive that i see in your eyes. 
he was one human that i respected, one human that i was destined to stop, as he was too naive. 
his name.... 

and he slowly breathes the name out, 
kronos...

as i was busy walking around in extreme thought, i could hear this,
ayye anikatos! how do you know my name?!"

alice frowned.

  
mate, how can you be alive since 1562? she asked.  
i facepalmed!  
oh my apologies, so thats where the confusion began!  
i was born in florentia, well, florence when it was still just founded by the roman empire.  
my father was a retired soldier, as florentia was made for them, and mother was a good looking servant.  
i was born roughly 55 bce? i said.  
she frowned even more.  
that is worse.  
are you joking with me, or are you for real? she asked, pinching me.

  
ouch! i said.  
not a ghost... she muttered, looking around.  
and the stuff here seems legit, and old as hell, while you do look like 25ish...  
hard to believe that the old man that brought us here, and the farmers, and servants would respect someone so young as you. she continued.  
of course they respect me!  
i watched them grow up! i even changed their diapers to some!  
i am extremely involved in local economy and events, and there is no event in florence, hell, in rome, i mean, italy, that i dont support!  
roma aeterna! i said.  
she sighed, and gave me some papers.

  
okay, i will do my movie about the demigods of the roman pantheon here, but...  
i want another clause. she said.  
i nodded.  
i loved the idea of jupiters glory to be reproduced here.  
anything, young one. i said.  
she smiled.  
you and i. we will do a podcast, lets name it eternal rome, even more eternal roman a man who saw history happen.  
i want to know everything about you. she said.  
i laughed.  
i am married, but you could be my 93rd wife a bit later on!  
sure, lets do the podcast, and we can even livestream it, i have a professional broadcast room in my mansion. i said.  
she was flabbergasted.  
i am immortal, not stuck in time. i said, signing the papers, and ready to do this.  
this will be fun."
"[wp] okay genie, i see how you operate now. my final wish is that you suffer all the torments of the wishes you have ever granted!","two things, one i meant because that makes it sound like he freed himself from the lamp. and two, i was making a joke about homophones. because paradox sounds like a pair of docs, when i only need one"
[wp] youre a coast guardsman on patrol. tonight you have discovered that sirens are real.,"ive never been that in love with the sea. i know its ironic coming from a coast guardsman but i grew up inland. it was the towering mountains and sagebrush of the west that were my home, but theres only so far you can run before youre forced to get on a boat.

still, its on nights like these, with the raging storms and the buzzing of the zeppelins engines within the internal catwalk, that i feel some admiration. the worlds come a long way in the past ten years it went from biplanes to flying air bases in a matter of years, but the landscape always remained the same. like the unshaking and roiling tide, and the death throes of history, there are certain things that never change.

the weather is one of them, and the others the captains. as im taking in the ambience, with a toolbox in hand, its lieutenant commander herbert victor wiley footsteps that shake me from my daze as he pushes past along the cramped metal passageway. wake up sailor i dont want that bladder leaking!

im neither quick nor steady to respond as i roll my bloodshot eyes open before turning toward the captains disappearing shadow down the nearby stairway. but its loud, and heavy enough to be heard over the din of the crying engines and raging storm clouds buffeting the uss macon violently. yes, sir! on it, sir!

it might be the nightshift, but with the threat of uniform military code justice hanging over my head, im quick to pick up my toolbox and return to my patrol. aft to box, once every fifteen minutes, every bladder must be checked for punctures lest the entire airship fall out of the sky and into the freezing waters below.

its an important job, one where you need a keen sense of smell so a sailor can trace the telltale rotten egg odor of helium gas or, rather, the mercaptan mixed into the concoction to make it detectable.

a leak doesnt happen often but its enough to have a running check for it but that isnt the problem tonight.

its the winds.

you see, airships arent fast, not like in the comics or movies where they blaze past the cameras. theyre slow and susceptible to many alignments. fire, an errant spark, a pilot running their engine into the skin of the vessel but wind above all else is the most prevalent. unlike the other preventable hazards, you cant get rid of wind. its always present. and its the biggest threat because theres only so much that lift can do when mother nature is trying to waterboard your vessel with the ocean.

you just have to hope or keep busy enough to ignore the looming threat. thus, it was only a matter of time before the worst came to pass as the claxon and speakers rang throughout the vessel. were losing altitude all hands to stations. standby for abandonment to your posts.

this mightve been the first call weve had in the vessels history, but i wasnt taking chances as i dropped by the box and began sprinting toward my station near the belt.

thankfully, it was among the same location where the pilots sparrow hawks were docked to the vessel although they were of little use as the blimp was now careening toward the waves below. it was an exit, as i was soon joined by the stumbling pilots. they were doing so because of the storm or the scent of alcohol, but i was of the mind that it was both tonight, as the first pilot arrived at the station. whats going on?"
"[wp] youre a student at a mages college where no subject is forbidden, with the understanding that some research is best kept quiet. after working on a new spell for years, youre the first apprentice to stand before a council of instructors debating whether it should be banned from future study.","to the thirteenth splendor of excellencies,  
scholars of the higher mysteries,  
secretkeepers of the order of fire,  
judges of the seven sorceries

in this sacred hall i shall reveal the secrets of sixtyone moons of study, so listen well.  
the doors are sealed, the wards are drawn, the candles are lit, and the sand is falling.

i believe i have uncovered one of the deep magics.  
a spell used by legendary mages and gods alike,  
yet rarely mentioned in any text, new or ancient.  
i dare not use it, for i fear its power.

this magic allows something to be made from nothing.

how did emperor primus build the empire in barely eleven moons time?  
how did torreg construct his tall tower in an afternoon with a single spell?  
how did jeof the alphamagus create human life with only his own seed and a tasteless, odorless powder?  
how did gutzon the blaster sculpt the first colossi?

you all know.

primus had planned and schemed for twenty years,  
and the war lasted fourteen years after the empire was declared.  
he had much more than charisma and ingenuity.   
he had vast wealth, friends in powerful positions, foreign allies,   
a few bottles of a newly discovered poison, and, most importantly,  
nine republics on the verge of war, from which he forged his empire.

torreg called a lightning storm upon a grand tree  
twice the height of that tower its ruins made.  
and all the townspeople had such fear in their hearts,  
they labored four years to cover the hideous stump  
in alabaster and iron shingles and leaded glass,  
after the sorcerers wicked work was done.

just now, i get the sense you all know these stories better than i.  
you know that human life was created by a woman, yet taken by way of a hideous crime.  
and the colossi were once elders of the mountain, tragically wounded.  
i will move on.

"[wp] youve wandered into the mysterious little shop that wasnt there yesterday. however, instead of selling you a cursed artifact or a mystical pet, the owner  who is getting up there in centuries and wants to retire  promptly sells you the shop itself.","what now? i ask.  
the old man sighs.  
i want to sell the shop to you. he says.  
i freeze.  
this is a shop that wasnt here yesterday.  
a thing out of fantasy tropes that i really, really love.  
these places always have things never seen before, and magic so strong, and so closely tied to fate, that few dare to mess with them.  
but now...i am offered one?

  
why? i ask.  
i want to retire. he simply says.  
i nod.  
he does look...weary.  
what would be the price? what would be my responsibilities? how much freedom one has with a mysterious little shop like this? i ask.  
he smiles.  
good questions.  
the price would be your willingness to take over. he says.  
oh boy...  
this is bad.

  
again, why? why would that be enough of a price for a place that has souls, magic, and superpowers, and more as merchandise? i ask, gesturing around.  
he laughs.  
because other than youthful dreamers, nobody would accept the status of being the owner of such a place.  
the shop never stays for long, never stops for anyone, and it is up to fate whom finds it, and what wares are in it when it is found.  
sometimes, there are items given by other customers, other times the items are from the dreams and nightmares of the universe.  
the shop was, is and will be, but at the same time, it wasnt, isnt and wont be here, ever, and forever. he says.  
i sigh.  
my responsibilities then? i ask.  
he smiles.

  
be here. welcome the customers, and with the help of the shop get stronger, so stronger places can be visited. he says.  
i also have to be strong? i ask.  
the shop can protect itself, and the owner, but not always.  
and sometimes, you have to run errands, also, having strength is never bad. he says.  
i agree.  
thinking back on my life here...  
i accept. i voluntarily accept being the new owner of this shop, and accept the tasks, and responsibilities that come with it. i say.  
he smiles.  
the shop is yours. good luck. he says, disappearing, and i feel it. the shop.  
i am connected to it, and i can feel its desires and its rules, and indeed soon...it moves through space, and time, and my journey begins."
"[wp] you perform odd jobs for a living, normally nothing too serious. this time, you were hired to scare a street vendor into relocating. you didnt expect them to be some kind of retired pugilist.","the birds begin to loudly chirp and sing, and rick stretches under the softly flapping rangerroll covering him. its july, and in new york that means everything is sticky with humidity, and very still, as if even the air is avoiding moving. the streets in the south bronx are quiet at this hour. its the few small hours, right as the sun is about to breach the skylinean hour before and almost an hour after, the city is peaceful.

rick has spent another night camped out in the bushes at st. marys park, just off jackson. the steeple of the church always visible from wherever he places his camp, by design. mary is important to him. and as he does every morning, he recites her prayer

holy mother

mary, so full of grace

blessed among women

and blessed is the fruit of your womb, our lords begotten son, jesus

holy mother, mother of the son of all

pray for all of us sinners

now and until the hour of death.

he mouths the words, not even caring if he is right or not. every morning the prayer is a little different. and to top it all off, he isnt even catholic. agnostic, but stuck with these words as part of the ritual before a mission. and every day is a mission when he leaves the park. and today he has to vacate, with his stuff, because he has been told there is a job for him to do.

an asshole needs cleaning.

this is his favorite spot, but he will go to another camp tonight. st. marys has a nice stretch of thick wooded area that even in the winter gives him cover. he rotates his camp to avoid anyone catching on to him. its been decades. he can even have a fire going and get away with it on the coldest nights.

strange though, in a city where every citizen could have a rat friend, a circus of cockroaches, and a bum army to cuddle up with every night if they wished, theyd have a problem with rick and his little setup.

he risks it, because if the authorities dont like it, they can pay for his cot and three squares up at sing sing. also, he likes it. really likes it.

has since vietnam stopped being a place to go and when the army told him to hit the road. he did his time. he gave them everything. blood, sweat, but no tears. no thank you, master sergeant. no tears from you.

he is outside because he never went back in. the army allowed him to be the best solo operator in the jungle. so now he is the best solo homeless person living in new york city.

camping keeps him out of the shelters, and honestly, it feels like home and will continue so if they leave him alone as theyve done so far.

leaving him alone might be due to his size. six foot seven barefoot, with a countenance that suggests he might not know any words of comfort or praise or be tolerant of the illness called complaint.

he doesnt brag about bolo badges or the number of chevrons and rockers he was given by his uncle sam. he didnt count the number he killed in the name of freedom and democracy either, or the number of wounds he patched up himself in the bush.

genetically, he is blessed with being able to push through grievous wounds, needing sleep for days, all while owning a kinship with the shadows. being a proficient killer.

a truetolife killing machine, retired now, living life on his terms.

yet life dictates he still eat, hence the job.

all the retirement money goes to the same place all his army money went to the kid. he gets an anonymously deposited monthly check from a father who feels he did the kid a favor by staying away.

he was certain, with how often he has done evil things in the name of his government, he could never be a father or husband, and it is best to imprison himself within solitude.

demons are contagious, but manageable, alone, under the old growth red oaks.

but now it is morning, his prayer is done, and the peace is almost over. soon the july sun will be up and, like the rest of the people in this city, seek to beat everything under it into submission.

he packs his gear into a wellworn, but professionally cared for, ruck. everything he owns is a version of, or the original of, a thing he carried back from vietnam. minus the weapons. he doesnt need them out here because no matter what, he refuses to kill ever again.

and once all his gear is gathered and his repaired and wellmaintained jungle boots are on his feet, he turns said boots toward the day laborer spot. as the sun rises, the longer the line gets for a job.

the day laborer spot in the south bronx is a section of leggett avenue, over the train tracks. its not a good area. the crimes committed daily run from simple to firstdegree and worthy of a whole life of imprisonment. the labor is offered in almost the same way business is conducted just up the street in hunts point.

a car will pull up, a window will go down, and a voice will leave a shadowy figures mouth wanna earn twenty bucks?

some days, nothing. most days hell get the normal labor jobs. some of those jobs stretch out for weeks, some are only for a few hours. and some days, a cadillac pulls up, and rick is offered a lot of money to do something very illegal.

do you know the taco truck on 149th and frederick douglass?

he didnt. he doesnt like tacos. he likes fried chicken and malt liquor, exclusively. but he assumes since this man mentions a thing at a location, said thing will be at said location, so he replies, sure.

then a fist with a onehundred dollar bill stuffed in it arrives through the window from the backseat.

rick takes what turns out to be half of said cnote.

you get the other half when that corner is free, capiche?

rick nods because he doesnt need to understand. he just needs to get shit done.



they call him taco man. he is a small, ethnically japanese man from brazil. he is tiny and moves around his brazilian taco truck with purposeful movements that look choreographed. he flows as he serves customers.

taco man is not just really good at making brazilian tacos, but this is a man with a fantastic personal story, but he only knows portuguese, so here it is translated and paraphrased

there once was a man whose head was wanted on the streets of so paulo. but not only was his head in danger, but everyone he ever loved also was going to be flayed and tortured, slowly, one body part at a time.

what did this fiend do, some might ask?

this man won when he should have lost.
his victory should be sports history, and would be if it didnt happen in so paulo. doesnt help each invitational he did got more and more illegal.

some claim he walked out of the amazon wearing the robes of a shaolin monastery, rumored to exist in the jungle but never found. another addendum to the tale puts him at the monastery gates for a full week before being allowed inside to train.

his training is a ceaseless mastering the movement of every muscle, joint and ligament in his body. watching him was like watching a rubberband flap around on the antennae on a car.

fwubwubwubwub!

but each letter was a solidly place strike or throw or twist ruining another body part.

maybe, some suppose, this was his plan from the very beginning. that he risked his own body and soul to rescue his family, decades before the day it actually came to pass.

the morning after his first match where he put together a stellar showing of seven, twentyminute fights in the mud circle. award 300, each, american.

next week, he walked in to the dog pound and fought and beat every man who raised their hand. award total collected from the door 1,295, american.

the cargo pit was midweek. the crowd was rowdy. fat or reed thin were the men who faced him. none won. award 12,000, americanand a bad concussion from a cheap shot that zoomed into the ring from the crowd in the shape of a sock with a heavy rock nestled in its toe.

1st place trophy and 5,000 at the saint judas invitational as well as a broken cheekbone. he blames the concussion from the night before.

red sand, kings table, the judas rematch were each 12round, open combat, and professionally sanctioned fights. his fame soared. seven fights. seven victories that have never happened before. and the fate filled invitation. 

you lose this fight i pay you double the purse taste good?

he said yes. he lied. then bet on himself, because everyone somehow knew the fix was in.

all in one day. his total pocketed prize money 767,000, american dollars.

main question on everyones lips was who is he?

no one knew, and some people dont like mystery.

when the cartel lost their millions and millions of dollars on the broken fix, they put out a bounty on his head.

and to save those he loved, he moved far away from the land of his birth, with everyone he ever loved in tow, to avoid them being killed in his name.

vowing i will never fight again.

taco man finishes bagging an order, is in the process of taking money and making change, when a shadow lands on top of him with a thud. the shadow doesnt move, or give an order for food, or even seem to be breathing normally.

bearded and shaggy in all the wrong ways, taco man has seen worse in his time in the city. and rarely does worse not come with money for food.

what can i get you? he says genially enough. he is rewarded for his politeness by the giantfellow, in a patched od green field jacket ,raising both fists above his head and slamming them down on the counter of the food truck.

the physics of that moment with the giants fists was magnificent, and the taco truck will never be the same again but neither will the taco man as he does what comes naturally giving the world, via one smart guy with a camera, one of the best fights seen in ages."

and now baby youre finally awake!.

but ive lived alone, for years. 

dread started from the pit of my stomach, its icy claws sliding around my heart. the beeping of a warning tone from somewhere over my left shoulder proceeded a stern voice, out! out! doc is coming. dont crash on us again mister!

my eyes are only just now opening, enough to see masked blue figures rushing to me. a swirl of brown hair as someone leaves the room.

172 over 140. shit. and he is slipping into afib. get the crash cart! a hazy darkness descended again .



the soft tone beeping my heartbeat the only thing audible. feels like the silence of night. no one else here. how did she find me? the panic tries to rise, fighting it down. the image of our last meeting. the hatred, the spite, the venom in her eyes. not again. no. it cant be happening again. i try to move my arms, ended up fumbling at the blanket.

hey, how are you feeling? a nurse comes in with a smile, eyes mostly on me, but scanning the equipment rapidly.

thirsty. i croak.

a big generous smile, of course, here is some water for you. 

i sip, trying to calm my nerves. she is busy adjusting my iv, pushing buttons on various machines. 

i remember a crash.

yep. that was three weeks ago. we have been fighting to keep you with us most of that time. a nasty knock on the head.

it hurt, but not badly.

three weeks. my throat wanted to close up at what i needed to ask, did. did you call anyone?

she paused, looking at me, a flat look on her face, no, we had no point of contact information. but a woman did show up  2 days ago saying she was your girlfriend. the tone was as flat as the face. 

i squeeze out, ex.

the nurses face relaxed and she lets out a breath. something seemed off. she didnt know where you lived, but tried to hide it. she glanced at the monitor. i hated how obvious it was that their machines gave me away so rapidly.

bad? she asks. 

yes. i cant see her again. i moved states. my voice falters, the wrenching is choking off my voice.

its ok. ill add a flag to keep her out.



the screaming woke me. her screaming. words were unintelligible. the meaning was something i knew to my bones. it was several minutes before some stern male voices injected, overriding. the yelling spiked, but started fading.

my nurse came in soon. you heard that i assume. phew. she let out a breath. what a piece of work. im sorry. a labored pause. i had nothing to say. her understanding was touching a weak spot. i fought to keep the tears down. can i get you anything?

a plane ticket. 

she laughed softly as she fixed my blanket, she is being banned from the grounds right now. hopefully that will help. 

it will. a bit.



it was a week later that i somewhat unsteadily walked into the cool morning air to the waiting car. she held the door open for me, i hesitated, looking at her. its ok. i wont hurt you. my nervous system screamed at me.

taking a deep breath, i ducked and slid into the passenger seat. she shut the door and walked around to the drivers seat. 

why are you doing this?

because i care about you of course.

my heart thudded and jumped. the street lights flashed by. i stared out the window blankly. did she know where i lived? or was she taking me ... somewhere else. i didnt know what was worse. i didnt know what it meant. 

my phone was in my pocket. it felt a million miles away. who could i call anyway?

i suddenly realize where we are stopping. i look over at her, she is grinning nervously. come on. she gets out, helps me out of the car. then pulls a duffle bag from the trunk.

you didnt have much for me to pack. im trying to process what is happening when she hands me a slip of stuff paper. 

7am, air france 3501. to italy. 

i take the ticket slowly. why?

i know what its like. ive been there. her face serious, earnest. i hope i didnt overstep. i checked with your landlord, he was going to throw away your stuff, he thought you vanished on him. and you dont have a car any more. she trails off, nervously smiling. i knew your comment wasnt joking.

anticipation isnt something ive felt in a long time. a light is growing. a hope.

my nurse opens her arms for a hug, and i step in to it. tears come. i was leaving everything i knew, but for the first time in a very long time, i didnt feel alone."
"[wp] you are a supervillain and your child has joined the hero in their fight against you. they think that you would be absolutely furious, but really you couldnt be more proud of them.","its a wonderful day! her first hostile takeover.

i said, looking proudly at the mirror showing my precious baby girl, ruthlessly cutting through my army, all pawns, all disposable. but the moment. well, it was as precious as the most shining gold.

soon enough she will bust through that door and decapitate me, just as i did with my mother. the people will love her and soon, shell have the power that always belonged to her. of course i wouldnt just give it away but sooner, rather than later. fate would call me back to the beyond, giving her the kingdom and its fate, for her alone to reign.

of course she will start by telling the people theyre free, she will make a round table filled with the others that helped her along the way.

its heroic, dont you think?..

but soon shell be attacked by the neighboring kingdoms, lives will be lost, blood spilled, she will come back, look at her now, she always does. and yet next time shell be more brave, less scared. more..

...powerful.

and soon enough the people on the countryside will start to rebel, and knowing that giving them freedom its just a way to gift the land to its new invader. she will suppress. and one by one her round table council will vanish, some will confront her and rebel for the land they own, some will perish, some will just lower their voices until only my girl is speaking.

its all for the good of the land, she will say. as i said. as my mother, and her mother said too. thats the way for woman in the family, all saviors of the land, all heroes, all queens.

destiny is defied, but never broken, a mother knows this things, she will marry that bandit alongside her and make him prince, so no king will be above her. and soon enough shell birth the daughter that she doesnt yet know is carrying as she fights.

and ill take comfort, as the peasants burn my bones. in the fact that one day she will wear the crown on my head and know her power is just starting.

the door opened abruptly, and with a single swing of the sword, the reign of the queen ursula, the glorious, was brought to an end...

all hail the new queen fiona! bringer of spring, and her council of sages, and long live princess aurora, bringer of dawn, may she be destined for greatness"
[wp] you are married to a wizardwitch with an incrediblely absurd amount of magic and they constantly give you gifts of magical energy but they end up being enough magic to level small cities now everyone thinks your the most powerful warlock on the planet.,they had a heavy texas accent in my head while i read this and i love it
"[wp] theres an app on your phone that you dont remember installing. you cant delete it, nor open it. its there even after you switch phones. nobody knows what it is, the internet thinks youre lying. years passed then suddenly the app showed a notification.","hmm? the sound my phone made as it woke me up was one i had never heard before. there sure as hell wasnt anything else below this bridge that would chime so melodically. i took hold of the device, squinting through only one eye. it was so bright, and my glasses had broken beyond repair, causing me to hold it so very close.   
  
damnit! i shouted. im still dreaming! it was the only explanation my barely roused brain had for seeing a red number one beside the app of my undoing. i discarded the cell behind my back as i wrestled into my sleeping bag for an ounce of extra rest. but no, i wasnt asleep, was i? how could i be trying to fall back asleep if im not in the real world already? 

i scrambled to my knees, my dirty palms waving around the ground in search of that accursed brick. the steep ledge i camped upon below this train crossing was not well suited for such liveliness. i heard it tumble, and amongst any other belongings i kept nearby, i just knew it was the phone that broke free and slid down the rocks. 

my voice cracked as i managed a shout, diving after it in the most painful belly slide i could have ever imagined. as my life had come to be, there was no caution or concern for any of my surroundings. answers were right in front of me, and i would have them at last. still, i was flesh and bone. it took time to recover from the fall. i wore a corset of bruises up to my ribs, and groaned through my teeth as i crawled across the pavement.   
  
if an onlooker had told me they witnessed my voyage over the course of hours, i would have believed it really took that long. every ounce of my physical form was being ignored in favor of the beast created a decade before. i found my phone, cracked screen and all, but still legible enough to see that blank screen had finally populated with what looked like a message.   
  
[welcome home. i missed you.] written out in the handwriting of my late beloved. i felt the moisture cascade down my cheek, just before i heard the horn blare. i only hope that there are no distractions after. so it can just be me and you."
"[wp] ever since the witch was punished for her sins, your village had been through hell.","it started with the plague.

blue buboes, decaying flesh, agonizing screams. the scent of rot and decay. mothers torn from sons, husbands from wives, sisters from their kin.

then the rivers ran red  with silt, or blood. and the priests raised their hands up toward god, pleading with hands shaken by the hot unsteadiness of fever and delirium. and all around them, the undead and the dying swayed. yelled. wept.

a woman was brought forward. she was old her back was bent from the many years shed spent applying poultices and picking herbs to create herbal remedies for the villages varying sicknesses. she was a midwife with a hundred births under her belt. shed brought many back from the edge of death, had eased others pain into a dull opiuminduced peace.

but the people forgot. they needed someone to blame, and so they blamed her.

a band played as she was brought to the stake with her hands tied behind her back. there was laughter and singing. a minister stepped forward  the music stopped  he asked in loud, booming voice for her to confess. in return, he promised that the men holding the torches would give her the small mercy of slitting her throat before they burned her.

she kept her chin held high and her blue eyes clear.

she said nothing until she screamed.



and then

it should have stopped, the villagers told each other. but it got worse.

the bodies piled up the crowds that once walked through the marketplace thinned. men fell coughing from their horses, farmers died in their fields.

starvation stalked the land. soon enough, even the animals were not immune to it.

the river ran redder and thicker until it congealed into heap of muddy sludge. those who drank it vomited until their bodies nearly died of thirst  and then the sickness came for them, and the deaths multiplied tenfold.

those who could run from the village, ran.

then, finally a lasting silence.



a young woman returned to the deserted village ten years later, carrying a pack upon her back.

once, she had been old. shed put her powers toward helping those around her until her death. and still, she did not blame those that had caused it black magic was an evil thing to dabble with. she knew that she was destined for the pit. but until then, she wanted to save as many lives as she could.

as the fire had swept her over, shed imagined that shed wake in hell. instead  confused, grateful, shivering  shed found herself back on earth, retaking her first breaths. she was a child again a contemplative, sullen child with the taste of ashes forever coating the back of her throat. for this reason, she was often silent.

she heard stories of what had happened to her former home and while she might have been able to summon all of her power to do something about it, and her heart ached for her former friends, she did nothing.

there were some messes, she reasoned, that a person or, in this case, a village had to clean up themselves.

she slid from her horse as she approached the spot of what had once been her cozy cottage. she supposed they must have burned it, along with all of her belongings. oh well, she reasoned, looking about, hands on her hips. it was empty. but it was perhaps still home.

it wasnt her mess to clean up, but she found herself wanting to do it anyway.

for a person destined for hell, she thought, it might be the closest shed get to salvation.

later, bea brings us refreshments, and we start talking.  
you could work at my company.  
we have branches all over the world, and work with many 3rd parties, and the data is hectic.  
hermes cant handle it, and athena refuses to help me spread capitalism, so i need a good data analyst. zeus says.

olympus? no. it is a simple mansion, though we could veil olympus to look like one, but no, too much of a hassle.  
we changed with the times, david. she hugs me.  
i hug her.  
i am glad. otherwise i wouldnt have been able to meet my goddess...wait!  
now this nickname isnt even a nickname, but a fact! i say.  
she giggles, and kisses me.  
but before it could get more heated, the door is opened by hera.  
goddess of marriage? remember? door stays open... she says, leaving.  
we look at each other, and start laughing.  
all the stress and anxiety melted away, and hearing heras words, i had a thought...  
maybe i should start looking already for a ring...maybe her uncle hades can help me with the diamond?"

standing there was a young woman in a yama pizza uniform, her face set in an unimpressed frown.

there you are! she snapped. about damn time! where have you been hiding?

uh... sorry, i mustve missed you. how much do i owe you... wait... who are you?

she handed him the pizza with a scowl.

do you have any idea how much paperwork youve caused me? when the rapture happens, youre supposed to go towards the light. but nooo... not you. you go off radar and leave us scrambling. the boss upstairs is not impressed.

the boss... upstairs?

elody?!  

i couldnt believe my eyes.  it was elody, the threearmed fae queen with 4 wings and a shitty attitude.  i banished that sonva bitch to the nightosphere years ago and now julia, my own damned daughter, brings her into my home.  lotsa questions.  howd they meet? did juila summon her? is she being used to get to me? how can elody wear such gaudy clothes?

my revolvers in plain site  i put my hand on it.

elody says.  its so very good to see you emily. i know this must be quite the shock, but i promise you my intentions with your daughter are... pure.  ever since meeting her i feel like a new woman.  shes brought the golden light back to every one of my sapphire eyes.  sure.  emily looks around confused mom... what?  how do you know my girlfriend?  oh julia, if the world was pure as you.

i cock the hammer back.  elodys 7 eyes turn fiery red and she starts to grow, times running out.

mom. no!  were. in. love!  if you kill her you best put the second one through me!

i relax the hammer.  goddamnit.  elodys eyes relax and she shrinks.

juila.  my desert sunflower.  she speaks.  ok mom im not sure how you know elody already but i brought my girlfriend home to meet my fucking mother and we are having a goddamned pleasant meal.  you hear me?!

so we do.  ive been working the grill all day and the steaks are perfect theyre big too.  cant survive on this side of the emerald arch if you dont keep your strength up.  but nobody told me a damned fae devil was dining with us!  id have made three more steaks.  then id have eaten them and gone to war.  but fuck it, julia likes bad girls.

elody reaches for the steak i was going for.  i cock my hammer back.  elody picks a different steak.

emily, i really would like to put this rather nasty business of you banishing me into the void of woe behind us.  that was last week  more like 30 damn years.  ive got a promising new business, and all my mortal souls have been released.  im a changed lady.

well thats interesting.  she cant lie, i know that much.  she mustve found a new power source.  i wish i could trust her.  she was so fun in my 120s.

we finish the food and i show them the door.  now you listen here hellmoth.  julias her own woman, and i trust her to take care of herself, and to make good choices and live with em.  but if anything happens to her i will hunt you down across every realm that exists and the ones that dont yet.  i give you my word.  ill jam my boot so far up youre manahole that it kills your family tree.  and she knows that i can.

they leave.  in the distance i can see elody sad and juila consoling her.  they do make a cute couple.

"[wp] your beautifully sweet warlock, your kind baby that chose you as their patron, has been slaughtered. slain by an idiot paladin who is only doing it for fame and money, only wearing the holy helmet for glory.",i really liked this prompt and the other stories ... so i wrote too much and had to break it up xd
"[wp] after years of being held captive, and nearly starving to death, you have finally escaped. freedom is tenuous, but an elderly person you meet agrees to hide you for a time. the first meal they feed you makes you cry.","the sun was blinding, and the rays were hot on my pale skin. the horizon was blurry, my eyes unable to see well into the distance.

i kept walking and walking down the road, hungry and tired, and yet alive. so alive that i hoped it wasnt all just a dreamtoo beautiful to be real. so i kept pushing forward with renewed energy, but also deep fear. i wouldnt be captured again. never again. i would rather die.

and so i crawled and struggled until a little shack was in front of me, just at the outskirts of a small town. an old lady was there, watering the flowers in her garden. beautiful flowers full of vivid colours, and my heart ached with joy. i never expected to see flowers again.

she saw me approaching and just stared. shocked. i certainly didnt look well. are you all right? what happened to you? she asked.

too much. but i couldnt say anythingmy voice was lost. and soon i was standing close to her, my face pleading. for what exactly, i didnt know.

she kept staring at me, surveying me intently. you look starved. come in, i was about to eat dinner. you can join me and then maybe explain, she gently told me. she moved and went inside. i just followed silently.

as soon as she placed food in front of me, i froze. my eyes prickled, and i fixed my gaze on the elderly womans tender face. as heavy tears started running down my cheeks, i realized i no longer knew what kindness was. that i had forgotten what a hot meal tasted like. what it meant to be cared for. 

and for the first time, i remembered what real happiness could feel like."
"[wp] being immortal is awesome! ...glad to see youre deep in denial, buddy.","i am not, you are just depressed as fuck. i say as i take another sip of my drink. the mix of cocaine, ritalin and morphine would send any mortal man into a coma, but to me it just hit an amazing buzz, enough to make my heart feel like it stopped, and then come back again.

you have been living like this for the last 200 years., the older immortal says. he looks bored and tired. tired of existing, tired of being on this earth. along his body i can see many scars. gunshot wounds on his arms and legs, rope burns on his neck.

better spend my time living than trying to kill myself., i retort as i take another sip of my cocktail, and then look around. there is a nice crowd on the bar today. girls i never met but look and smell like trouble, angry looking men itching for a fight.

we have been given the same gift. you squandered yours by hating yourself, and getting stuck on stupid mortal bullshit like making money, raising families just to watch them die, and being overall a boring piece of shit. i choose to live. its not my fault at all that you were given the blessing of being allowed infinite mistakes, unlimited adrenaline and emotion, but still choose to be... human. i smile as i lift myself from the bar, drinking a triple whisky in a single gulp. in less than half an hour my liver will have processed it and the buzz will be gone, so i have to enjoy the opportunity.

the older immortal sighs and looks at the drugs i left on the table, he smiles."
"[wp] the dynamics of the superhero world is weird you have weapons smugglers selling to both gangsters and the antiheroes hunting them magical girls and mad scientists working together to create antimonster weapons, and villains and heroes ignoring each other if theyre not in costume.","rachel was a good hench. really, she was just a summer hench, in school to become a paralegal no less, just making money on the side to make ends meet. she had no desire to break any laws or go on heists, which worked fine for me. i was paying to get access to mr. logistics database, and she was all too happy to go through there, doing the research on people that i could target next. and i... wasnt adverse to hitting those people she urged me towards.

she was a smart cookie... which made her latch onto what i said immediately. how exactly is the world strange to you?

i really didnt like to talk about it. even though i knew it was normal, it still had something that... made me feel... well.

i swung my legs off the chair, letting my feet hit the floor. in my still rather empty lair, the sound echoed. okay, listen... who was your first crush?

tommy edwards, she said without hesitation. but like i said, she was smart, and already picked up what i wanted her to with narrowed eyes. you?

nobody. i smiled, but it wasnt a happy smile. nobody at all. i lust after people a lot, but... ive never had a crush, ive never had a love. ive had girlfriends, sure, but it was just like any other friendship with a side of sex. and yes, ive talked with shrinks, i can safely say that ive never had a... romantic feeling in my life.

that was a lie, and a damn dirty one at that. id only ever seen a shrink while working at the hospital, and that was mandated by the nature of the work i did there. and that was mostly dealing with work and family stress. i didnt need a shrink to tell me that id never felt that.

i didnt need to tell her that i was a mesmer. i wouldnt tell her that i could read emotions, and if i spent enough time around a person, manipulate them. nobody trusted mesmers. ever. i was more than willing to let everyone think i was a maker. but... sometimes, i liked to hang around young couples and read their emotions because they were so alien to me. i liked feeling out where the lust stopped and the romance began.

rachel, at least, nodded thoughtfully. and that has nothing to do with you being a cowl, does it?

i shook my head a little. no. i make the clothes, the clothes make the man. being the hanged man isnt some passionate thing, or some act of madness, or even bitterness over something. its calculated. i thought, planned, and drafted everything about him, because that best fit my powerset. i cant hack it as a cape, id never last, but i can do a cowl quite well, if i dont say so myself.

another little lie, but hey, cowl.

she, though, was giving off waves of wonder and respect. you did your research.

well, i said slowly. now it was my turn to look away. im sure you do way more than me. you know, law and stuff.

she grinned a little. and finding you targets. speaking of... she looked back to her computer. howd you like to do something bigger than a normal robbery?

i leaned forward, curious now. like, how bigger?

i think ive found a hypertech smuggler. no indication that he uses the stuff himself, but... he also has cowl insurance. and i figure you might want to analyze some of his tech.

now i was curious. it was a bad idea, always a bad idea, but... alright, tell me more."
"[wp]you just got summoned for the first time in millennia. but different from your expectations, the summoner doesnt want power, death and destruction. instead, you find the nervous summoner holding a bouquet of flowers right outside a messy summoning circle, asking you to accompany them to prom.","i showed up in all my battle armor blood and gore dripping off me. i am meant to terrify.

the kid stammered  youre not ronda the succubus?

i scowled at the kid  no you idiot, i am randy the terror war demon. i kill mortals for those who summon me. mumbling for a price.

the kid said  but i summoned ronda, i need her to be my date for prom. i really need her for after prom. 

i fart some fire then say,  you must have performed the summoning wrong. if you want i can tell you how to correctly summon ronda? 

the kid eyes lit up. yes, yes please.

 ok let me see what you used?  i said. 

the kid shows me a list of items, then points them out either around or in the circle. 

i say,  ok i see where you went wrong. first you used orange peel instead of orange wedges. second you used turmeric instead of ginger. you have black candles, not red candles.  
 go get the proper ingredients, i will wait  i said as i materialized a chair to sit on. 

the kid, returned shortly with all the correct ingredients. he began laying everything out. 

i cleared my throat,  are you forgetting something? i asked. 

the kid looked at me puzzled? 

 you need to release me from your circle, so you can summon ronda. you do want ronda to go to the prom with you? you do want ronda to make your night special? you do want ronda to make you a man?  goated him. 

he bent over and smudged part of the protective circle. 
i stepped out. 
you better repair the circle before you summon ronda. i instructed. 

i stepped back by the wall to watch. 

the kid performed the summoning correctly. the candles dimmed, there was a popping sound. and ronda was standing in the circle in all of her elegant beauty. 

ronda looked first at the kid, but quickly realized i was in the room. 

she glared at me, just as i said,  time for me to go, have fun tonight kids

"[wp] boss, after all the times they thwarted our plans, why are we still not allowed to simply attack the magical girls while they are transforming?","do you have a death wish? my boss loomed over me, like id just asked the single most idiotic question in the world.

nno, boss, its just pure ribbon and pure bow, theyre just up in that column of light, floating there for a whole minute, yknow? and i was thinking, hey, weve got all this dead time here, lets attack them before they finish transforming and get all strong!

do you understand how theyre floating?

you didnt mold me from the darkness to be a physicist, boss.

correct. then, let me elucidate you.

a chalkboard seemed to reveal itself from the shadows. the boss scribbled something onto it, and turned back to me. the chalk in his hand vanished into the shadow of his palm, and turned into a pointer stick which he then thwapped against the board.

our enemies, the twin souls, are raised into the air by a column of light. he pointed to a little doodle of them doing their holdinghandsandyelling bit.

ordinarily, light isnt capable of such a thing. however, it does exert a very minuscule force upon things. he then pointed to an equation, with an arrow drawn next to it pointing back to the doodles light column. pure ribbon and pure bow are being raised high into the air by this light, so we must conclude that it is billions of times stronger than any sort of light you can find in the world of reflections.

i think back to the times ive fought them. the lights power, huh the times ive fought during the day, their sun was a bit hot, but certainly wasnt pushing me down. a billion times that 

i cant wrap my head around it. so what does that mean?

perhaps a little independent study is in order. the chalkboard and his pointer stick vanish into the shadows. go retrieve the jewels of light from them, and when they transform, poke a stick or something into the column. it should be very evident then.

ookay, boss! i teleport out from the world of shadows.

appearing in the world of reflections or, as the locals call it, earth i try to take note of how the light feels. doesnt seem to be anything special? i float towards the nearest tree and snap off a long stick. well, nothing left to do but find those girls.

luckily for me, theyre not actually that far from where i entered. they look like theyre on some sort of hike, i guess? and staring into each others eyes rather than the nature around them? feh, its not like theres anything worth staring at around here. nothing like the rolling, empty expanses of the world of shadows.

i touch down in front of them. hand over the jewels of light!

they dont notice me at all, walking straight into me and falling over.

really?!

the orangehaired one sits up first. sor you!

hand over the jewels of light! cant believe i had to repeat myself.

well never give them to someone like you! the blackhaired one is on her feet now, helping the other one up.

transformbepo! the annoying voice of a fairy from the world of radiance sounds from orangehairs pocket.

hurrybipo! and his partners voice, from her pouch hooked to blackhairs bag.

they grab their communes, hold hands, and raise the communes high.

twin sparkling resonance!

finally, they shoot up into the sky, and i can approach the pillar of light. i gleefully stab the stick in. what could possibly

it nearly shoots out of my hand, rocketing up for a moment before i stumble back. i hold the stick out to inspect it and holy shit its just gone. the portion that was in there was vaporized, and what was just next to it was bonedry and on fire. was this the true power of the twin souls?

i manage to gather my wits and move back just before they touch down.

protector of the light! pure ribbon!

protector of the light! pure bow!

they strike a backto back pose. we are the twin souls!

bow points at me. you, enemy to light and bringer of shadow

ribbon points at me. pack up and get lost!

i stand there frozen for a moment. that power just what in the world is it?!

well, scared or not, ive got to take the jewels of light! shshador! show them how terrifying the power of darkness can be!

a dark spirit calls at my command, possessing the burning stick. and so the battle begins



i return to the safety of the world of shadows. im only a little on fire, and i take the time to put myself out before i shed any of this hideous light on the boss.

welcome back. he was waiting for me. what did we learn?

yyou were right. we cant attack them while theyre transforming. satisfied, the boss disappears, and im left to dwell.

hopefully, they never realize the true magnitude of what they could do by transforming on top of their enemies"

...orange? black...an orange, distortion, around a...black...hole...

...oh...

...oh no...

i took a breath, ...well...guess were wrong..."
"[wp] you are a dragon that spends most of your time shapeshifted to look like a normal human. after your spouse is kidnapped, you immediately shift back and track them down, only to find them in their own dragon form blasting their way out.","it was rare that i had the opportunity to resume my standard form these days. id taken a human disguise the first a few centuries ago, which was a relatively short time for a dragon, but the disguise was much like a formal suit. some occasions simply called for wearing it and it was pleasant enough for a short while, but once the event was over it was convenient to swap back to my more comfortable attire.

i used to only wear the disguise for a day at a time returning to my lair after each day. the form required relatively little upkeep, and was convenient for earning riches rather than stealing them. provided of course that the workers didnt know their boss was a dragon. people always seemed to have a problem with that for some reason that was beyond my understanding. it was fine for a human to work them ragged, but even with generous pay, humans were much more likely to revolt against a dragon. so i wore my suit increasingly often. 

somewhere along the way id had to change up some details, as it became increasingly difficult to explain my longevity, but this most recent change had been the hardest. this time when i tried to build a new persona, i needed a birth certificate that i didnt have,  a social security number i was never given, and all sorts of other proof that had never been necessary the last time id done this.  thankfully as with most things a person could need, there was a market for it, and with enough money, id been able to buy assistance in the process.

thats where i met scarlett. at first our meetings had been entirely business, but i had offered a much higher than market price payment for her service in building me a new fake identity. i had salvaged the situation by requesting tutelage on how to play the role requesting more of her time than what it took to simply forge papers. first we had our extended lessons then to my surprise shed invited me to coffee at a shop that had recently changed ownership nearby where i had supposedly grown up. claimed that it was a good way to give credence to the disguise, by being seen as a regular somewhere where the former owner was no longer around to dispute it. on one claw i knew she was interested in me for my apparent wealth, but on the other she seemed genuinely kind and helpful, and actually seemed to care. 

id never tried the romance thing in any of my prior disguises, id been to a brothel or seven back when they were more prevalent but that had been transactional, and short. this was the opposite, logic dictated that we should have separated as soon as our deal was done, but now we seemed to gravitate towards one another. 

it took us only two years to marry after that, and weve been married nearly 10 years now. in that time id grown to enjoy the quaintness of human life. both of us were wealthy and given the nature of our meeting we both knew better than to ask the source of the others wealth. she was perhaps the perfect woman for me, since she could be close but never pried at for information on who or rather what i was beneath the suit. just as i never asked about her customers or location when shed need to step away for a job, only when shed expected to be back. this time i was supposed to have an entire month,  longest  job shed taken since shed helped me out 

i always used the time to return to my old lair, drop my disguise and just enjoy being a dragon again. albeit with a few more amenities than most. 
i might have had a few renovations done to my cave in one of my earlier lives as the owner of a construction firm. my workers had been paid triple their wages through that job and told the customer demanded absolute secrecy, never knowing i was both the boss and the customer. theyd figured it was quite obviously a dragons lair and requested even more for hazard pay. still it had been worth it. the convenience of having an internet connection, electricity, and running water meant i could enjoy the perks of being in my dragon form while enjoying a hot bath and a watching a cheesy movie. 

my peaceful evening was interrupted by the a ringing sound from my laptop where i had it plugged into the large flat screen tv. scarletts name appeared on the screen. i rushed to retake my human form and reach my computer. i tapped the answer button.

the bounce that answered was not scarletts
good evening mr marigold, the voice said.

i froze. scarlett never allowed anyone to use her phone or laptop, there was too much potentially incriminating evidence from even the simplest job to risk someone accessing something they shouldnt.

who am i speaking to? i asked trying to contain the already building anger.

thats not important. what is important is the condition of your wife. she is currently in our custody, and in case you were worried shes still breathing. if you would like her to remain that way, you will transfer 10 million dollars into our accounts using the instructions i am sending you now.

a zipped file appeared in the chat window. 

you will receive further instructions once we have confirmed the transfer. we should not need to deliver this threat, but allow me to make it very clear that if you go to the police not only will your wife die, but we will release everything she has on you. goodbye mr. sterling.

the switch of names was all i needed to know the man was not bluffing.

wait! i called just before he ended the call, what if i dont have 10 million liquid right now, how long do i have?

the man paused as if he hadnt even considered this a possibility. i saw the call mute for a moment the man apparently had to discuss the issue.

we are aware of the significant breadth of your means. you have until midnight to deliver 2.5 million dollars into the account. you will continue to provide us 2.5 million dollars for the next 4 days  the last of which you can consider a convenience fee. goodbye mr. marigold. do not keep us waiting.

the call ended immediately thereafter.

shit, shit, shit. i had the money, that wasnt the problem, the problem was i had 0 confidence that the bastards who took her had any intention of letting live."
"[wp] what came first, the chicken or the egg? asked the sphinx. to which you answer the egg. its the egg. you need to spend an hour explaining descent with modification before it begrudgingly acquiesces.","if ive just spent hours explaining evolution only for it to be called pseudoscience, im going to crash out."
"[wp] there is an elder red dragon the most powerful evil species right outside your house. its not doing anything, its just there, staring at you, as if its waiting for something.","it is a modern house., and a dragon showed up for a random bauble the dude had. the dragon gave him supernatural armor, and his first thought was time to have a conversation with congress

its not a joke, although the armor of ashen shugar was a easter egg."
"[wp] tomorrow is the day you will be sacrificed to appease the spirits of the village. as you struggle to fall asleep in your steel cage, you notice a scaly hand place a strange potion, along with a note, in front of you before retreating into the shadows.","i knew this day would come. i always knew it would come, ever since my birth i knew i would end up as a mountain bride. a women of high birth no older than 20 years old is sacrificed to the mountain god for another year of fertile land, and fertile women. now, im trapped here the last noble woman under 20 in my family left. come tomorrow the moment the sun clips the horizon this cage will be taken from this cave and lowered deep into the lake bellow the mountains that leads to a supposed hidden kingdom. i never bought that story yet it was drilled into me as long as i can remember. after several days of trying to force myself out of this steel cage here i sit holding my throbbing fingers rubbed raw from trying to claw myself out of this cage. 

oh there has got to be a better way to do this, or do i just give up already. i mumble under my breath frustration lacing ever word. the cave the cage has been sat in is only lit by a single candle by the far entrance and the moonlight itself. then it happens, something scaled reaches deep into my cage. its almost a hand shape but its scaled like a snake  with  long fingers  slithering trying to reach out for me.

holy shit i screamed. i back deep into the furtherest corner of this cage. the walls seem to be closer together than i remember just a moment ago. as i watch the strange hand it suddenly stops and drops a small vial before retreating quicker than it came, but still far too slow for my liking.  i slowly began walking towards that edge of the cage a small eye seems to be looked at me from deep within the cave itself. 

as i grasp the small vial and with that the creature flees even further into the caves system until their existence can only be proven by this small vial itself. i exam it in the moonlight the color is a smooth golden color with what appears to be some kind go flakes the color of deep mine copper. the lid pops off with a small pop noise barely audible to me let alone whatever guard is posted 30 feet away. a quick smell and nothing seems too wrong with it, a hint of rose and a large smell of sulfur, then it dawns on me. this could be my way out, it also could kill me. i dont know what this liquid is, but what if it gets me out. it must be a live sacrifice the village leader always said so. 

part 2 in comment bellow wont let me post the full thing hoping this works though!"
"[wp] youre 15 when god appears and tells you to warn humanity that hes coming back. when you ask how to prove its real, he says figure it out. now you have to convince 8 billion people that a teenager actually met god.","i watch him disappear, and sigh.  
so, puberty, first year of high school, and now proving that god is real, becoming his prophet and convincing people that not only i met him, but also warn everyone that he be back.  
great.  
a totally normal teenager start of life.  
others get personality changes, i get a holy quest.  
fine.  
lets see what i can do.

  
hello chat, today we will continue playing wow, but at the same time, i am going to tell you something interesting.  
i met god. capital g. no cap. i say.  
the messages pour in, the emojis, and gifs, and whatnots are laughing, or praying.  
one of them says pic or didnt happen. , and i want to answer, but on my 3rd screen a picture appears.  
its me from half an hour ago, talking to him.  
i sent it to the chat.  
they go crazy, asking about what kind of a.i. have i used?  
one does take it seriously, and asks what did he tell you?  
i wonder how to tell them, but then i get a whisper in my head.

  
he is coming back, and wants us to be prepared to be judged.  
nothing wow, just the usual biblical stuff. i say, rephrasing the words i hear in my mind.  
more mocking.  
well jeremy, i know you think it is funny, but unfortunately for you and i...it is true. i say, before i could catch myself.  
the user feetpicksforlife420 freaks out, wanting to know how i know his real name.  
others start laughing, and joking thinking this is staged.  
i start naming them, and telling them about their lives.  
this makes everyone feel creeped out, but also intrigued, and my stream goes viral.  
it is all fun, until a certain agency knocks on our door, wanting to tell me that hacking, and getting the personal information of others is illegal.  
i sigh.

  
after scaring the hell out of the agents, by telling them stuff even they have forgotten, i watch as my parents stare worriedly at me.  
ddaughter...did you really? mom, a really religious person asks.  
i nod.  
oh. is all she says, as she goes upstairs, probably to pray.  
you didnt do anything illegal then, right? and this is all...some supernatural stuff? dad asks.  
i nod, as he isnt wrong.  
good. take care of yourself, and if push comes to shove, claim insanity.  
at most after a month in an asylum, i will take you out from there, and get you home, under our supervision. he says, patting my shoulder, and going after mom.  
i smiled.  
both of them shined brightly...while the agents looked a bit shady, i guess this means when he comes back, my parents will be aokay.  
now...lets go back to streaming, because capital g, just sent me a vision of a storm hitting hard the town of my subscribers, and i have to warn them."
[wp] you are a maid but the third prince is your best friend. you grew up together in the castle. his wedding getting closer everyday. on the night before his wedding he knocks your door. lets run away together. he whispers.,"theodore went pale, i could felt him tremble and his grip weakened. his heart was still beating really hard, but i could sense how it skipped a heartbeat.

i took air, breathing hard as i felt my own heart beating faster and faster. did you even stop to think about what you are asking me!? no! no, you never do! always the same! you are always like this! tomorrow you get married! you just went ahead and dumped all those feelings on me! and now you expect me to, what!? take all the things i can carry, leave everything behind and just go with you to who knows where!?

theodore let me go, looking as if he was about to cry. may i i am sorry i didnt

i am not done! i took him by his shirt, my arms were trembling. have you stopped for a second to think what would happen!? the prince fleeing with his maid the day before their wedding. what do you think people would think!? curses theo! who do you think they would blame!? the wicked seductress that seduced the prince! the foolish maid that thought she had a chance with the royal blood! why would you do this to me!? do you hate me!? is that it!?

he was about to cry, he was stumbling over his words.

n no may, i im sorry i dont i

well! i do! i hate you! i could feel my eyes getting wet. i hate how you keep getting into trouble for following your heart instead of your brain! i hate how you keep treating me as a friend instead of a servant! i hate how you worry about me! i hate how you keep coming to me to take things off your chest! i hate how you look and smile at me when i am working! i hate your jokes, and your stories and how you make fun of nobles of the court! i hate how you keep disguising yourself and following me when i go to the city to buy produce! i hate how useless you are when you try to help me and make an even bigger mess! i hate you calling me by my name, and i hate your body, your face and your smile! and i hate all those things because they made it so i fell in love with you!

theodore got completely silent as i breathed heavily, a stream of warm tears flowing through my face. i tried to stop crying, but i couldnt.

it its not fair you cant just make me feel like this for so many years, then get betrobed and force me to bury and hide all those feelings only to just force them all out again i started drying the tears of my eyes, but they kept flowing. i hate you now get out i cant run away wearing a nightgown.

he looked at me surprised, he didnt seem sure how to react to my outburst.

then this means that you are coming?

i grunted, cleaning the tears and snot from my face with my gowns sleeve.

of course im coming, you spoiled brat you better take good care of me, i am not going to forgive you twice."
"[wp] every year for the last decade, every girlfriend youve ever had as dumped you after visiting their hometown on christmas eve right as you are finishing a huge project at work that would have set you up for life. but this last time was the last straw, and you confront her this time.","youve dated nine people before me!?

well, yes. its called life. me being able to count the number of people ive dated on one hand is the exception, not the rule.

very good. if the girlfriend reacts like that, juvenile and overly emotional, to the response to the breakup shes initiating, then she shouldnt be dating yet anyway."
"[wp] after discovering you perform miracle healing on people, it wasnt the government, the big pharma or elites coming for you... but the mega churches offering you a job.","it seemed like whoever was in charge of the universe had big plans for tracey blackwell. last month, her local chapter of the spca had decided that the pets were going to chose their owners, and somehow she had gained the favor of the egyptian pantheon, and she had gotten a miniature caiman named imhotep who now resided in a cage in her living room, and ever since summer started, happily chased down and ate whatever insect flew in from an open window or door. about the same time, her healing powers had turned up a notch. for years, it had been small things, an abscessed tooth her preschool teacher was complaining about would fall out when tracey gave her teacher a hug. cuts and scrapes disappeared before recess was over in elementary school if she touched the wound. in middle school, her friends would press her hands over their bellies, easing menstrual cramps. she had always been able to do this, so she didnt see it as the big deal people made it out to be. she handled snake venom on a daily basis, so no big deal right.

a woman had been having a grand mal seizure in the middle of the deli section of harris teeters, and tracy, who was a thoughtful person, decided to help she has dated someone in high school who was epileptic, getting the swarming crowed to clear the area and call 911. she got the womans head propped up and covered with her demon jacket. placing her hands on the womans shoulder, there was a dry heaving sound as the woman vomited, tracy supporting her so she didnt choke. one the bile had cleared the throat, the woman woke up. god bless you, young lady, she had been told before the paramedics took over.

that had been a week ago, and the video showing this had gone viral. instead of the local medical community reaching out, it was the local mega churches who came calling offering her a job as a healer. having grown up in a methodist household and the daughter of a preacher, these were folks her father would call christianity anders borrowing the quote from c.s. lewiss screwtape letters. 

indeed, the bright faced woman about her age sitting across the table from her eyed the bookshelf filled with volumes of tolkien, lewis and erhman with some suspicion. please take our offer miss blackwell! you have an amazing presence! tracy had seen their job offer, 64,000 a year, no health insurance and a crazy schedule of faith healings and hours long shifts at a congregation of over 5,000. 

tracy let out a sigh, i have made my position very clear on the matter, i do not want to be affiliated with a faith community that does not do the lords work. do i struggle with sin? yes, but i put my faith in god and do my best. i thank you for your time, but i am not interested in starting a career as a faith healer. the woman nodded, apologizing for wasting tracys time, and left. once the door closed, tracy could hear the woman complain loudly that she was wasting her talents."
"[wp] your spouse is a werewolf. for safety, every full moon you lock them in the basement until the sunrise. they are aware of this arrangement, but your unexpected guests are not.","i found doggie! orgah bonecrusher squealed, lifting the grump werewolf that had long given up trying the escape the tight hug from the teenage troll. papa look at mister peters doggie!

thats my wife, peter stated flatly. she turns into a werewolf on full moon nights.

orgah was confused. you marry doggie?

her father groush bonked her on the head with his spiked club. sorry, daughter young. foolish. we visit without warning. sorry too.

what is this visit about? peter asked, shoving his hands in his pockets. how urgent is it that you didnt book an appointment? at least, now you know why. why booking in advance is important. because of my wife. she wouldnt want to hurt anyone while she doesnt have control of her wolf form.

witch cursed wife to turn to stone, groush sighed. witch refuse to pay bridge troll toll. she said wife will crumble to dust at dawn. tomorrow. peter is great wizard. please help.

i will help, peter stood up from his couch. but first, can orgah put my wife back in the basement? ill lock the trapdoor to keep her and the livestock of this town safe. then, take me to your wife and ill undo that petrification spell.

orgah was crushed. devastated. i cannot bring doggie? she sobbed.

the werewolf snarled and snapped at the air.

doggie not happy she cannot go, orgah continued.

no, no, shes mad that you still havent put her back down, peter resisted rolling his eyes. orgah, please. listen to me and put her back in the basement. do you want me to save your mother?

yes, she answered dejectedly before marching over to the basement trapdoor and dropping the wolf like a sack of potatoes.

teach your daughter how to handle animals, okay? peter scowled as his wife howled upon landing on the basement floor. alright, ive locked the basement, lets go save your wife now."

[wp] a mage born in the mythical era many tens of thousands years prior has awakened from his slumber in the modern world devoid of any magical beasts or citizens.,"carlaq blinked. a thick crust had formed on his eyes and only shades of black and white managed to pervade his vision. he blinked again and color streamed throughdark shades of an ice cold blue. a shiver ran down his spine. after one last blink, the world finally began to come into focus. he could see a ceiling through a translucent blue tinge.

he tried to look around but he lay motionless, stuck in place like someone had casted a curse on him. but he remembered nothing of the such. the last thing he could remember was... death. insurmountable amounts of it. the memory felt heavy and remembrance came slowly, made even more difficult by the frigid magic that held him in place.

as his brain churned, so did his hands. he compelled his fingers to move, if only enough to cast a counter spell, but they stayed stubbornly still. he felt powerless and weak. his world was blue and his body was numb.

then a muffled sound came. at first, he thought it was the dull ache of death coming for him, but the noise slowly became clear. there was someone talking. he strained to hear the words, strained to move his eyes enough to see who was speaking them. but only subtle movement bled into his blurry periphery.

who had done this to him? carlaq willed himself to remember.

he sat atop a war lizard. dead humans littered the battlefield. a tendril of ice magic spilled from his fingers, skewering a human that still clung to life. the human capital lay ahead. victory was in sight. but then a burning light appeared in the distance...

the thought from a millennia ago sent an aching pit into his stomach once again.

the light meant the unthinkable had come to pass. the humans had completed their mission all life on earth was to be reset, to be given back to the ancients. the human hersey.

a burning rage filled carlaqs chest as he relived the defeathis decades at war all for naught.

the overwhelming force bore towards him. he cast a final spell. elven frost magic surrounded hima forgotten and forbidden art. he burrowed deep into the earth, entombing himself in an ice coffin that even the ancients couldnt break. he would not be defeated. 

carlaq released the magic he had unknowingly been holding. splinters of blue ice blew apart in every direction, exploding like a magical grenade.

rising into the air, the elven war general beheld the room. humans in white coats lay mangled around him, blood seeping from impaled icicles. machinery lined every wall, blinking and shifting with enchanting lightwork.

carlaq clenched his unfrozen fists at the sight of the ancient magical machinery. this war was not over... it had only just begun."

as the water impacts gently against the frame, a streak of effulgence streams through the door. it has been a long while since the gentle caress of sunlight, and even for the possibility of a pretentious torchlight, he cant help but grin a little. 



the door closes, the piercing stream of light trickles to a stop. 



in the total darkness, a set of light footsteps approaches him. the rhyme and rhythm of the steps are a counterpoint to the dripping sound of water, almost as if they had sparked a debate. their music intertwined into a cacophony of echoes through the room.

their steps stop just before the bars of the cage. accompanied by a shuffle of burlap, a jingle of copper keys and chain, was a flutter of parchment and a clink of a glass. 



he felt around the space within the cage, finally grasping the bottle and letter. with what little precious ambient light, among the grey mist, was the shadow of a retreating, calloused hand. 



who art thou, the walker among phantoms? he asked, his voice untrained and gravelly. 



as swiftly as the messenger had arrived, he leaves. 



following the lifeline of dark ink on darker paper, the words 



venomous courage, or excruciating cowardice. thou hands never had the grasp of choice, let this be thine method thus. spin thine illusion into the hammer that shatters the false messengers mirage, let it be the revelation that signifies their reckoning. 



the cork slipped easily from the glass bottle. the volatile odour of almonds bore through the still air. 

this is a cause as real as any. to die for the world, for the next downpour of rain.

"[wp] found memoryless in a forest, you lived for years on a widows farm. she tried everything to help you remember. nothing worked until the day you saw her held at swordpoint, and your true identity came rushing back.","she found me in a ditch in the woods. i was wearing armor, bent and broken, and not much else. i had a sword in my hand, broken, my fingers wrapped around it so hard she was afraid of breaking them when she pried it out of my hand. no insignia, no colors... no name.


it took me weeks to recover, and even then, my mind was gone. i drooled like a baby for weeks as she nurses me back to health. even as my senses returned, my memories did not. she taught me how to work the earth, as as my strength returned, i helped around her farm. she brought things back from town, emblems and names, symbols and portraits, but none of them jogged my memory. i recognized the king, but his face was on every coin. i knew the name of the city, but then, it was the only city for miles, and a common destination. my memory was gone, and eventually, i gave up trying to find it.


i remembered... feelings. my life had been hard, with many a night unfed, and plenty of sleeping under the stars. i dreamed of cheers and jeers, of the clash of battle, but never anything useful. no name, no identity ever surfaced. i chose a new name, jonathan, and since i was found in the woods, forest.


i didnt want to go back to that life. as much as i sought it out, i knew it was more difficult than i had ever wanted. i never wanted to go back, and eventually, i told her that. i got down on one knee, and asked if we could create a new life together. we were married under the old oak, by the new priest, under a blue sky, with me wearing a borrowed suit. it was the happiest day of my life  including the one id stopped trying to remember. i was jonathan forest, no one more.


and then, on an otherwise ordinary day, it happened. i came through the back of the house, and heard voices. just before i called out, i saw the glint of steel, and heard the fear in my wifes voice. and something... broke. memories rushed back. my life was laid out in an instant, all i ever was, but it didnt matter. i grabbed the old, broken blade from the top of the mantle, and stepped outside, fire in my eyes. 


drop your blade, if you wish to yet breathe tomorrow, i growled, my voice foreign to my ears. 


the two bandits turned, the hungry looks in their eyes all too familiar. hey stump, lookit this, this fella wants to dance!


stump leered, but his expression faltered as i continued to stalk towards them. i wished the swords downwards, and the cracked steel moaned like a tortured soul. my name is derrick dracus stormblight, and this is the sword unmade, whose steel has been tested against a thousand blades, and never faltered. my feet move slowly only because i dread the coming if your deaths, you miserable excuses for rotting flesh.


stump took a half step back. ruck, mebbe uh...


ruck, clearly the braver of the two, turned his sword from my wife and pointed it to me. i slashed my blade again, its demon roar splitting the air, then pointed it at ruck. flee now, before the sword unmade quenches its thirst in your blood, and i feast on your souls!


i strode quickly towards them, an unholy growl escaping my lips. stump leaped backward, then turned and fled ruck held a moment more, then dropped his sword and chased his ally in retreat. as they to fled, i roared after them, return and find your doom! cowards! imbeciles! lackwits!


when they had at last fled out of sight, i lowered the sword, and my wife rushed to my side. you... remember?


i nodded, my ears ringing. everything.


and your name  derrick... stormblight?


i grinned. nope, not even close. its bove gunderson.


she blinked. bove... gunderson? i... i dont understand.


i wobbled the blade, then held it to my lips and blew through a molded crack on the blade, unleashing the unholy groan. its a whistle. whole thing is a prop. im a thespian  an actor.


i tossed the sword to the ground, and wrapped her in a hug. as she melted into my arms, i summed up the last days of my old life. im not even a very good actor. plenty of nights were spent hungry, kicked out of an inn for my terrible singing or worse acting. finally, after a somewhat decent performance of an unfortunately risque play that made liberal use of humor specifically insulting wizards, well... i got cursed by a wizard in the audience. lost my mind. i wandered off in my stage armor, holding that demon sword. best thing that could have happened to me.


my wife looked up into my eyes, as if trying to decide if i spoke the truth. finally, she said, i like jonathan forest better.


i laughed. me too, dearest. me too. lets bury that old sword, and bove and derrick with it.


i sent out a silent thanks to that old wizard his grumpy spell probably saved my life. it certainly improved it."

which would be just fine by him, if only they were not doing so right on top of his ceiling.

sighing, the ancient lich that has seen the start and fall of civilization so many times he lost count, got up from his table where he was doing some crossstitch following a convoluted pattern, and called the elevator.

it looked like he had spent way too much time going outside and familiarizing himself with the novel human forms of entertainment. that last moving picture he binged was certainly one too many. how come he had not noticed the intrusion?

mumbling obscure words in long dead languages, he evacuated some of his current projects to a much lower level. a pity he never actually got down to learning about this cctv stuff. he just updated the tracking spells about 70 years ago. or was it a couple centuries? 



a popping sound that could only reliably designate the demise of a very large slime was not a good sign. 

as he was hastily assembling a couple of spare bones into a makeshift skeletal bodygard, the lich wondered what he had done wrong this time. he had tried filling a dungeon with intelligent creatures and fellow mages, creating a hierarchy. he gathered his students and asked them to protect the dungeon in return for some arcane knowledge. that didnt end well.

this time, he filled the dungeon with undead creatures. 55 levels bustling with slimes, skeletons, zombies of all sorts, golems made from all kinds of materials, reinforced traps, misleading labyrinths full of illusions, very aggressive plants. there was nothing worth stealing on any of the 55 levels. one had to be a madman to keep going when the only award for hard battles is some worthless bone dust.

and yet there they were, breaking down a fine oak door.

there it is, a knight in shiny armor said. check if there are any traps.

shouldnt be any, a tall archer said. why would a tall person become an archer? wasnt it harder to hide when youre tall? it is the boss room, after all.

ahem, the aforementioned boss said from behind his looming skeletal guard. nice timing. you are trespassing.

the room was positively becoming crowded. a healer rummaged through his table, and the lich almost hissed seeing his needles thrown on the floor.

he considered his mood. was he in for a loud battle? no, not really. there would be all sorts of government repercussions, he would lose a ton of money and have to move to a different country. there would be the wise wizards on guard shouting about conventions, regulations and broken promises, and his 112th lawyer would freak out, just like his eleventh one.

he picked up a pile of papers from his table and cast a quick spell that made his voice loud and ominous.

you are trespassing on a proud retirees property. i have fought a certain dark lord twelve centuries ago, and for what? so a bunch of youngsters would come to demolish my house? i will have you know that my insurance company will bury you alive!"
"[wp] the star of a real life truman show, after secretly realizing he was the subject of a hidden camera show his whole life, overheard cast members discussing the upcoming cancellation due to a ratings drop. unwilling to lose the life he knows, its now up to him to secretly boost the ratings.","he wasnt sure of the exact moment he figured it out.

it wasnt a dramatic revelation there was no lightbulb flash or metaphorical curtain yanked open. just a slow, creeping certainty that revealed itself to him across several months. the oddly timed thunder when he cried. the perfect lighting in his bedroom. the way people lingered around corners, just long enough to hit their mark.

eli was the star of a hidden camera show.

had it been going on his whole life? or was it a recent development?

he had no idea. but one thing he wasnt going to do was give himself away. not yet. first he needed to find out who his friends were. 

and so he still laughed at his best friends jokes, still kissed his wife, and still watched his favourite shows on tv.

but beneath the faade, he was watching. learning. growing.

a few weeks later, he was laying in bed, trying to reason himself out of it, trying to be logical, trying to be rational, when he finally heard them two voices in the vent above his bed.

ratings are in the toilet.

network says two weeks max unless something big happens. drama, scandal, something. hes justkinda boring.

kinda boring?

eli stared up into the vent for a long time, not moving. not blinking.

that confirmed it.

by morning, he had a plan.

he didnt go to work. didnt even call in. it was all fake anyway. instead, he spent the day sitting on the living room floor, crosslegged, watching the door, waiting for them to come. the tv was off. his phone was off. his expression was perfectly calm.

around 3 p.m., the mail slot clinked open. a small thud. letter.

eli didnt move right away. he just smiled.

he stood, walked over, and picked up the envelope. plain white. no return address.

he opened it carefully and pulled out the single sheet inside. one of those fake coupons for a pizza place hed never heard of. 

perfect.

he walked to the kitchen, his fingers trembling as he took out the largest kitchen knife he owned. 

with a deep breath, he slit the pad of his left index finger, the blood flowing forth. on the back of the flier he wrote carefully, neatly, in blood.

i know youre watching.

he held it up to the cameras in each corner of the kitchen, and suddenly, the creeping static feeling living between his ears was dulled, the multitude of voices that guided his consciousness silenced, no whispers in the vent, no phantom cues curled behind everyday noises. just a clean, expansive quiet, as if someone had finally turned off a humming fridge hed never noticed until it stopped.

he smiled to himself, looking at his smeared blood on the page and imagining the boost in ratings. who was boring now?

he grinned. 

he felt much, much better."
"[wp] a firefighter is intentionally a horrible person his whole life, so that when he dies, he can fight the ultimate fire.","says here you intentionally started fires, suplexed cashiers who got your order wrong, tripped over old ladies and xitu squinted, adjusting the spiked golden monocle that sat over his pale left eye. and tricked god into sending you to hell? he read that in a slow, confused tone, as if the words had changed into ancient latin half way through reading them. i dont get xitu felt two hairy arms wrap around his waist, the demon unable to finish his sentence as joe threw him backwards, slamming his head through the heated red terrain of hell, burying his head within it. after delivering the suplex, joe tapped the front of his firemans uniform, hoping his family had respected his last wishes.
 
underneath his suit was a super soaker, one filled with a full tank of water. while a super soaker wasnt a common piece of firefighting equipment, it appeared to be the only weapon that would work in hell, since he wouldnt have access to any open water sources. now he just had to hope his theory was right about the water never running out.
 
he gave it a few testing pumps, watching the water drool out of the nozzle, landing on the back of xitu, who only shivered at the cool contact. he then unloaded the entire canister onto xitu, counting the seconds until it was empty. by the time he reached fifty seconds, the super soaker felt no lighter, staying the same as it had been when he was buried, keeping its full tank for eternity. the soaked xitu pulled himself from the ground, quivering as he looked up at joe.
 
who who are you? he shook, never having met a human so frightening.
 
im fireman joe. he said, before spraying the demon between his eyes, sending xitu tumbling back onto the floor. the demon tried to get up again, but his core temperature had fallen too low, temporarily halting his movements. joe waited until he could be certain that xitu wasnt getting up again before continuing. the priests were right. demons do need heat to stay active. pity i had to suplex them to get here. he would apologize to them someday, although if they were good priests, they should have already forgiven him by now. that thought making him feel a lot better about his past sins.

the birds of hell screeched, flapping their thin leathery wings as joe walked deeper into hell. the half human birds a disfigured mess of human eyeballs and beaks. they were small, no bigger than a pigeon, but they were loud, each screech causing a stabbing pain in joes ear. he kept his soaker raised, ready to strike if they swooped, only for the birds to fly away at the first sign of confrontation. guess theyre only an alarm system. thats good. they wont try to stop me before i reach the pits of hell, then.
 
during his trip to the pits of hell, joe got attacked by all kinds of demons. some were disfigured with animal parts or skin, while others were your typical red imp variety. each falling to the super soaker, and after a thirtyminute descent down the foot scaringly hot stairs of hell, he had found its heat source. the wild flames burning brighter than any natural disaster, swirling with the rage of a million burnt souls.
 
sensing how big of a job this was, joe switched his soaker from its blaster setting to its super mega water cannon one. giving the plastic switch on the side of the blaster a quick flick, snapping it off the gun. thankfully, he didnt need the weaker setting anymore, not since his target was in sight.
 
a fireman doesnt rest until all fires are extinguished. i betrayed my oath to get here, and now ill make up for it by putting out the wildest fire of them all. the blast from the super soaker shot out in a whirlpool like spiral, blasting through the flames. the contact causing hell to rumble, with the water weakening hells control over the earth.
 
a slashing claw dug into joes back, the man not noticing the demons creeping up behind him. the whitehaired demoness grinning as his blood drizzled down her long nails, giving him a wink with her red eyes before trying to shove her hand through his back. joes skin went to peel away, only for the firefighter to slam the nose of the soaker into her chin before she could pierce his body fully. the hit knocking her back, before he sprayed her with a mighty shot, knocking her out.
 
he panted, the pain intensified by the roaring flames that lurked nearby, as if they were dropping tiny stinging flickers of fire into his torn skin. gritting his teeth, he readied his gun towards the fire again, only for more demons to rush down the stairs.

joe knew this would be the end of him. the demons would destroy his soul, and soon he would cease to exist on any level, and he didnt care. he would put out this flame before that happened. joe struck a demon in the stomach with the weapon, blasting their abs with cool water, sending them flying back. he then kneed another in their stomach, before pushing the nozzle of the gun into their mouth, filling it with water until it escaped from their nose.
 
while fending off the demons, he took breaks to attack the larger flame, always taking a few scratches or bites during that period. after an hour of fighting, he fell to his knees, the flames of hell little more than a whimpering flicker that gently extinguished, plunging hell into darkness.
 
ha. ha. ha. ha. a booming laugh echoed through hell, as a pair of solar panel shaped red eyes appeared above the smoke of the fallen flame. the yellow pointed pupils soaring over joe. well done, foolish mortal. do you know how long ive waited for someone to extinguish my flame? that flame kept me bound to an eternal sleep, because unlike my other creations, who were created by the rage in my soul. my heart is cold, requiring the icy pits of hell to function. youve freed me, and now ill perfect my demons, continuing the efforts i was doing before that bastard created that flame to bind
 
dont care. joe said, crawling back to the stairs, starting the long, slow journey back to the surface of hell.
 
you dont care? im the most powerful being alive.
 
the flames gone. i did my job. he shrugged, only for the giant of a demon to lurch forward, striking its frozen hand on the stairs, blocking him.
 
i will make you listen to my words, and then i will devour you. you will know the hell you brought upon mankind.
 
joe didnt have enough air in his lungs to spit at the demon, especially with his face being so far away from the creature. instead, he did the next best thing, pointing his gun at the demon, hitting their chin with a small disrespectful stream of water, one that stuck his prominent goatee to his chin.
 
you little shit. the hand went to close around joe, only for joe to vanish. when he gained consciousness again, he was in the dark, with his soaker stuck underneath his outfit again. he could hear slow muffled music playing outside of the darkness, and with a hard shove, he pushed his hands up, opening his coffin.

when he sat up, the room erupted into screams, as his work friends and family saw what they assumed was a miracle. joe calmly exited the coffin, stretching out his limbs. thanks for coming. sorry, i was an asshole. i got over it. he said, not wasting his words as he left the funeral, without even stopping to say anything to his friends or family. he could see them later. for now, he needed to give his weapon the respect it deserved.
 
outside, he waved down a cab, telling them to take him home. after a short drive, joe was home, the firefighter running inside to get the driver his money, before farewelling him. inside his home, he opened up his gun safe, resting the super soaker inside. i pray the day never comes where i need to use you again. thank you for your service. may we one day meet again in the afterlife. he kissed the gun before closing the safes door, putting what he considered a dangerous weapon away.
 
um. mr. joe? sorry, i dont know your last name. you arent joe joe, are you? or jojo? um, yeah. the angel nervously rubbed a strand of its long golden hair, with tiny flakes of gold falling from it. god wanted to let you know that hes forgiven you. the devil may be awake again, but it will take thousands of years before the flame of hell returns. even if he perfects his research, we will have plenty of time to launch a counterattack. you may have created a more peaceful afterlife, one where humans can find ultimate rehabilitation without being cast away to hell with no chance of forgi
 
dont care. joe said, scratching his ass through the fabric of his suit.
 
this is a great honor. the angel said, unsure if he was trying to convince himself or joe of that fact. 
 
dont care.
 
i. really dont understand. this is a personal thank you from god. people all over the world would give anything for this and
 
joe had already left his bedroom, leaving the angel standing there dumbfounded. not wanting to have his speech cut off, the angel continued talking to himself for the next five hours. while the angel finished his longwinded speech, joe returned to his work. even if he was sore, exhausted, and hungry, he knew the flames would never rest. the man who had been dead only this morning, going back to work the same day. with a hose in hand, he continued his only purpose in life.

fine, he deserved it. but what about the other humans who need the sun? and me. well, i wanted a nice summer holiday, but its hard to have fun in the dark.

scoot off into your dimension. you can have as many suns there as you want. nine even, if youre feeling greedy.

that defeats the purpose of travelling to another world to have a vacation. youve had your vengeance, you petty god. now, turn the sun back on.

or else?

or else i will eat your sun, and replace it with my own. no longer shall the sun of this world turn on and off at your whims and fancy.

ah, but your whim and fancy. very nice solution, isnt it? do you imagine yourself less fickle than i am?

i can confidently say so. will you turn the sun back on? before the human does something stupid, like trying to set something on fire? before he attempts nuclear fission to build a new artificial sun that will most likely explode in spectacular fashion?

that explosion, i want to see it.

this is how a world ends.

"[wp] while others gather artifacts famed for their power, you gather those of which enchantments have long waned, those which shine has long since dimmed. youre clearly just a museum keeper. unbeknownst to you, people have begun to call you titles, and your museum has become almost sacred land.","desina cooed over what she saw, thin glasses perched on the end of her nose. a hand absentmindedly brushed a few errant hairs from her face, as she squinted down. before her, resting on a pure white cushion was a wilted flower crown. stems had turned dry and brittle, petals worn and lacking vibrancy.

touching it gently, she felt the long still pathways of power running through it. the channels through which magic made mere items into powerful weapons. most thought of artifacts as permanent. bury one for a thousand years, and it will work just as well as when it was made.

yet desina knew better. it was a rare artifact that was as potent after so long. without it being specifically built into the item to draw in mana from the ambient environment, most fell dud after a few years. it was a simple fact that magic needed magic, powered by those who used it.

this was one such case. she stroked it, before glancing up at the nervous looking fellow before her. minotaurs she knew were usually brash and bold, yet this one was as meek as a mouse. but she simply smiled, gesturing to it. well, as luck would have it you did indeed find a crown of seasons. however, you are wrong in your guess that it is a crown of autumn. this is actually a long faded crown of spring. you cant use it because the enchantments have degraded.

she raised her free hand up, forming a simple illusion. one showing near countless runes and artificial leylines, wrapping around to form the shape of the crown. parts looked delibrately fuzzy, others cracked and broken. see? ot spent too long without being used. im sorry, but its practically useless now.

the minotaur glanced at it, before bowing his head. i see, rune mistress. if it is useless, then might i donate it to yourself, for i will have no other use for it.

desina couldnt stop a grin from spreading across her face. oh, well i would be delighted to take it!

the minotaur nodded, stepping away from her. then take it, and i hope it serves you well.

she touched it one final time, almost reverently. i will treasure it, and preserve the little shine it has left, that others may learn from it.

she barely noticed him leave, focusing in sprucing it up a little. the pathways were ruined, but she could clear up the fuzziness. it would do well for the visitors she got, trying  to craft their own items of power.

she paid no mind to how he left, and his mannerisms. people were weird in her mind. objects were comforting. they did what they were meant to, or were broken.

the minotaur bowed his head as he exited the building she kept, more of a warehouse than a home. my thanks for allowing me to pass.

and unbeknownst to desina, the building listened. the broken artifacts were useless alone, but each made up for the others defects. its protections expanded once more, living and aware.

and along the path outside, new flowers began to sprout."
[wp] i need to marry that woman! yelled the prince my prince but did you forget she literally just used magic and blasted yout through a wall. said an advisor i know...what a woman. the advisor face palmed as the prince ran back through the him shaped hole in the wall.,"prince hathor was a man of peculiar tastes. while his father and brothers had been satisfied with their princesses, their ladies, and their maidens, hed been bored out of his mind.

hed listen to the young ladies of court try to flirt with him, batting their lashes in the hopes of a royal wedding. he wasnt some foolish sod that thought women were all innocent, dainty blossoms. of course not, its just that they seemed to think that was what he wanted. the other problem was that they all sucked up to him, desperate for approval from the next king. some genuinely hoping for fairy tale love, others were clever, ambitious ladies hoping to be queen someday.

regardless, he had terrible luck. he thought hed finally gotten his chance when the new grand commander had arrived with his daughter, a tall valkyrie of a woman with stern features. finally, hed thought, a woman that will challenge me. but she too ended up playing the doeeyed maiden, likely at the behest of her father. hathor had burst out of the interview room in pure frustration.

he didnt want an ornament, or a viper, a servant, or a dutiful bride.

he wanted an equal. he wanted a woman that would challenge him, tell him hes wrong, not beg for approval because of his title.

then, it finally happened. the great sorceress rin serzell came to court. she was not there to join court drama, she was there to demand her land not be trespassed. the king, threatened by her power, had sent the court mage and some soldiers to push her out. most had returned, some had quit, refusing to return and risk being ordered to face rin serzell again.

gods was she stunning, in a terrifying, awe striking way. she wore layers of mage robes, daggers, and potions hanging from a belt at her waist. midnight black waves contained in a thick braid that went past her waist. trinkets, and baubles were woven in, clearly more for function than appearance, though hathor thought they looked like stars in her night sky hair.

midrant she pointed a finger at him, and you! why are you staring at me!?

hathor was taken aback. she was the first person to ever raise their voice to him. he grinned dreamily, forgive me, sorceress, but you have enchanted me.

are you serious!? i come here to demand not to be hassled and you have the nerve she pointed her staff at him, to flirt with me like some nobles brat?

hathor was officially in love, i didnt expect to sorceress, but your fire is far brighter and more beautiful than any ive ever seen.

rin roared out, and unleashed a wave of force from her staff.

the next thing he knew, hathor was sitting in rubble, in the hallway behind the throne room.

i need to marry that woman! hathor declared as he climbed out of the pile of former wall.

an advisor offered a hand and assisted him, but, my prince, she quite literally just used magic and blasted you through a wall!

i know!...what a woman. the advisor face palmed as the prince ran back through the him shaped hole in the wall.

rin stared at him, dumbfounded, not even angry at this point, by the gods, did your wetnurse drop you as babe?... repeatedly?

hathor laughed, perhaps, it would explain my peculiar tastes, i suppose. he turned to his father, please, dont send anymore soldiers. sorceress serzell has never had the faintest interest in stealing thrones. something tells me that if she wanted one, shed already have one!

hathor bowed deeply, i know we didnt exactly meet under ideal circumstances, sorceress, but you are truly a unique woman, and i would never forgive myself if i didnt at least ask... would you allow me to court you?

court...me. you, the crowned prince, wish to court... me. the hermit sorceress, that just sent you flying through a wall?

yes, youre absolutely magnificent.

rin looked to the advisor, how hard did i actually hit him?

the man shrugs nervously, you are the first woman to enchant prince hathor so completely. he has very... particular tastes.

she looks down at him again, are your tastes women trying to kill you?

not quite, i love your temper, your honesty, your fearlessness. i wish to learn more about the woman that didnt hesitate to point a staff at me.

rin blinked, before sighing, fine. you can try prince, but i guarantee nothing.

he smiled, you have already made me happier than you could ever dream.


10 years later

hathor gave up his title. he had no desire to be king in the first place, so when rin had said she was returning to her keep, he threw that crown away and followed her.

he looked down at the ring on his finger and smiled. it was a trade well worth making.

hathor! come get your daughters before i drop bloodwart extract on their heads!

he laughed, coming fireflower!

when he entered rins lab, he found their twin girls, seri and fira, running about, playing adventurer. seri trying to be a mighty sorceress like her mother and fira wearing a pot on her head and wielding a broom handle.

rin turned from her work, grouchy but not truly angry, please, come get these hooligans out of my lab before they get hurt.

seri pouted, but mama...

hathor laughed, now spark, your mother is very busy with some very dangerous ingredients. she just doesnt want you to get hurt.

fira raised her sword, i am the mighty hero fira of wyrmseth! i fear nothing.

rin groans, pinching the bridge of her nose, of course she doesnt. damn it hathor...

he wraps an arm around her and kisses her temple, you know you love this.

she sighs and smiles wryly before kissing his cheek, somehow i do, now please, my dear addled prince, take the twins outside to play.

of course, my fireflower."

any energy signatures that we know of?

i shake my head.  
no energy signatures have been found. not even shuttle signatures.  
i have tried to find the signature of all known vessels to the empire. i say.  
he frowns.

  
have you tried life detection? he asks.  
i shook my head.  
didnt seem reasonable to waste energy for a life detection.  
a planet that is a class1 giant, with 5 habitable moons, and potential budding civilization could disappear just like that, without the interference of a fleet, or space phenomena.  
i suggest... i started.  
run a life detection in the region, and nearby zones. he says.  
but... i start.  
use my credentials to sign off. i authorize it, and will explain to hq. he says.  
yes, sir. i say, and start the life detection.

  
after several dozens of minutes, i pale.  
sir...there is a life signature, roughly 3.3 light years away from where the planet was, but... i start.  
what? how big it is? he asks, as if knowing.  
it is the size of a class2 moon. i say.  
he sighs.  
send the red alert to all monitoring stations, with code black 63487896. he says.  
i do as i am told.  
then he starts sending messages to hq.  
this is bad, and i try to remember all the things i could see on the scanner...but they are way too many.

  
it is a space behemoth, or void behemoth.  
nevertheless, it is a rare creature that lives in space, and feeds on asteroids, on the energy emitted by stars, and grows slowly.  
they are virtually ageless, and grow as long as they live, figure out the older ones diet. he says, turning around.  
i pale.

eaten? alongside with its moons?

"[wp] two clans of wizards, both of which specialize in seeing into the future, are at war. both only strike when they know they will win, thanks to their future vision. both clans always know the others next move. despite having been at war for years, not one battle has taken place.","ariel of mendacci stood behind the old gum tree, its wide trunk easily hiding her lithe body. her lacy dark blue gown shimmered in the moonlight but otherwise she was practically invisible. 

dont think i cant sense you even if you are hiding, whispered prince erich of vestors. ariel giggled and erich jumped through a bush. nothing, she had thrown her voice. 

silly you, ariel said, thinking you can find me so easily.

well, come out and show yourself, erich said playfully. we dont have all night. if father found out i was gone, he would punish me hard.

ariel walked out into the clearing, a bejeweled hair net shining silver in the moonlight. 

you are more enchanting than the princess you serve, erich said. life is so unfair that i must marry her and yet lust after you.

the prophecy says that once you are wed, this endless war can cease. dont you want peace?

i want you more, my darling, prince erich said, grabbing ariel around the waist and pulling her into him. ariels eyes went cold as she pulled the long needle from her hair net and stabbed it from erichs neck into his brain with an extra twist for good measure. 

erich dropped to his knees confused, fear contorting his face. 

why, he pleaded as liquid leaked from the wound in his neck.

im not the princesses maid, you moronic fool,
ariel said. im the chief strategist for the mendaccis and i finally had the vision that will end this stalemate once and for all. as they say, love is blind and that was always the key. the love your father has for you will enrage and blind him. he will strike first, and as the prophesy says, he who draws the first blood shall lose the war.

but you drew first blood? erich said growing more confused. 

it is not blood leaking from your brain. whatever you will become, it will not be dead, but you will wish it were as you stew in your mind unable to speak, think clearly, or communicate in any way.

the prince stared at ariel in horror unable to speak as his mind started resetting. 

if its any consolation, i thought of sticking you after you stuck me first, but to be honest, youre just not that cute.

ariel left the clearing without leaving a trace of her presence. 

when the search party finally located the prince, he was  sitting against the gum tree in his own piss mumbling without making a sound. the king knew that the mendacci were somehow at fault but no amount of soothing revealed when, how, or who did this.

we must retaliate, ordered the enraged king, but his chief advisor argued against action. 

the prophecy, your highness, he insisted. 

they killed my son, the king raged. 

we dare not cast a spell against them, his chief advisor argued. weve been through the series of events and every battle we initiate ends in our defeat.

enough talk, the king screamed. we must find a way. you must find a way! the king pulled his sword from his side scabbard and swung it wildly just as his advisor moved in to shake some sense into the king. the blade nicked his cheek, a thin line of blood beading along the insignificant scrape. 

the advisor touched his fingers to his cheek and saw a smear of red on his fingers. first blood had been drawn. the prophecy would be realized. in an instant, all of his visions went dark. 

oh shit, he thought, knowing that if he told the king the truth he would die. the king brought this upon himself. instead of visions, the main advisor to the king started formulating schemes, and the highest priority among them is to find a way to surrender himself to the enemy and seek asylum. 

his first course of action was to relent to the kings desire and allow the first battle to begin. it will be truly victorious and the prince will be avenged. 

prince erich sat in his plush tent, thoughts of warnings trapped in the shell of his skull without even the ability to control his bowels. shame, anger, and fear were his only friends. if he could end his life, he would do so with haste. all he was now was a symbol to his fathers rage. he was the reason his people would lose the war that lasted centuries without a single blow. all because he thought a girl looked cute and he used up all the available mistresses in his camp. all because he couldnt keep it in his pants and he thought women threw themselves at his feet. a tear leaked from his eye, but he couldnt even wipe it away as it traced a path down his cheek. for the umpteenth time in as many heart beats, he wanted to die. and he would soon enough, but not soon enough to suit him. 

after many hundreds of years long past remembering why there was a conflict, war finally commenced for real.

no the man says flatly, and continues toward me. 

i raise my hand and send a flash of pure blue light at his chest, a warning, not meant to kill. 
but it barely goes a foot before it reverses course, and heads straight at me. i click my fingers and the light falls to the ground. 
so you have some tricks i see? 
he advances forward, and with one movement draws his sword and touches my chest, my vision blurs, and i fall forward to the ground, unconscious.

"[wp] youve always loved science and tech as a kid. then life happened and you couldnt pursue a higher education, so now you just tinker with your hobby in the garage on the weekends. one day, a stranger comes to your door and yells at you do you have any idea what youve just done!","looking at the stranger with confusion thoroughly drilled into my mind. yeah. bolting my door from now on. slamming it in their face i do just that turning from them in my robe pondering how they got past the buildings locked lobby doors.

in my living room i looked over the assortment of parts at my disposal. bits and bobs id scavenged from dumpsters. begged and bartered for over the years. id gotten past the planning stage only two years ago. having built up a ridiculous horde of parts during that time. the prototype looked like a poorly made coffee machine. over engineered of course.

checking the ups, then the cords. a final checklist as persistent banging on the door echoed down the hallways. give it up! i growled as i pressed some keys on the computer interface. everything looked good. no unanticipated spikes in power.

then it was finally time.

unable to contain my excitement at the maiden voyage i didnt prepare or enact any basic safety measures, before lifting the protective case. gripping tightly i pulled the lever. everything important should have one.

the machine hummed and it vibrated on the floor, my neighbour predictably banging on their ceiling as it did so. i did sound and act an awful lot like a washing machine with a brick in it. 

a bubble of energy slowly worked its way around us as the hum turned to a whine and...

blinking i looked around. my eyes, slowly adjusting to the new surroundings. it was barren and completely devoid of any visible life. though it had an atmosphere. evident by a lifeform resembling a snake violently awoken from its slumber, slithered away.

i dared not drop the barrier but stood up in a joyous, whaaaa hoooo! ive done it.

travel to another planet was no longer years in our future. it was here! in a machine id made out of scraps!

i took some time to cuss out some naysayers and critics over the years, as well as astrophysicists and engineers. before my euphoria ran its course and i gained some sense of equilibrium.

the landscape was orange. shades of orange and red as the default colour on this landscape. it looked like a desert back home. a few rocks here and there but still similar enough for me to understand.

then my uninterruptible power supply beeped at me, it had been drained. oh shit."

so...  
i am not the first one to wish for this?  
before i could ask it, photos materialized, and videos.  
each grander than the one before.  
i was shocked at what i saw.  
the genie laughed.  
this is just the start. it said.  
and i marveled at the scenes it was showing me.

  
i saw darkness, and then a blinding explosion, as a myriad colors came into existence, and were spread.  
i saw the birth of stars, and planets.  
was the genie...before the big bang?  
before i could ponder, i saw entire civilizations on other planets.  
humanoid, and not, biological and not.  
i saw kingdoms, and empires on moving stars.  
i saw wishes of untold power being granted, and taken away.  
i saw a million things.  
and soon...the room was full.

  
i was nice enough to not crush you with the evidence. it said, as it stopped.  
i looked at the countless photos, documents, and paperwork that can legally, and legitimately for real allow me to prove that genies exist.  
then, as i took one in my hand, it started to disintegrate.  
i gasp.  
i took another, and another, and another...  
they all simply turned into dust, and disappeared.  
whats going on?! i asked the genie.  
it smirked.  
a goddamn, selfsatisfied smirk.

  
you asked for the evidence with which you are surely to prove my existence.  
to others.  
and i gave you that. it said.  
but it disappears the moment i touch it!  
and if i film it or photo it myself, they will say its fake! i said.  
the genie shrugged, as it slowly retracted into its lamp.  
the laws of the universe are clear.  
our existence shall not be publicized, as to not have entire civilizations hunting for the lamps.  
we are fate based, and those fated have to be the ones that find us, not a highest bidder.  
so, the universe makes sure, nobody can truly prove that we exist. it said, as it got back into its lamp, and then disappeared.  
i sighed.  
my 3rd wish wasted...but at least i got some stuff for my parents and i, and health.  
its not that bad."
"[wp] you teach several highly recommended acting classes, however, to your dismay, you never seem to see any of your students again. until today, when you find one of your best pupils in your office. with weapon in hand, they coldly ask you how many agents have you trained?","part 2

oh come on. havent you ever wondered why you havent seen almost any of your students again after they finish your course?

i mean it has been strange, especially since so many of them seemed so talented.

or how about how you still have full classes despite raising your prices so high?

i had to raise my prices, i had so many potential students i had to weed out the numbers somehow.

hahaha, this whole time i thought you were in on it, but you were just to blind to see what was going on around you. guess what dumbass your classes are full of assets intelligence groups send to learn espionage. youre such a good teacher dozens of agents have learned how to blend in and play their roles perfectly, some can even just observe a group for a short time, and be able to perfectly blend in with them. and so many lives have been lost because of this. one group that sends their agents to learn from you has a policy of killing someone dressing in their clothes and using that to sneak in and eliminate their targets.

i..i..i.. james stuttered, i d..dont know wwwhat to say.

what can you say?! not noticing all this time! the reason you never see your students again, because they never wanted to be actors, they came to learn how to hide. how your classes are able to pay you costs, these groups are willing to pay outrageously for your level of teaching, you could even triple your rates if you wanted to. you want to say something how about you answer my question, how many, and i want names

i honestly dont know, i have had hundreds of students, i dont know how many of them were real students compared to your agents. but i know you can look through my files.

you sure dont know a lot, but fine ill take a look through you files.

james led robert to his file cabinet unlocking it and started to take out stacks of folders. robert took pictures of all the names and known addresses.

dont worry im not a monster, ill make sure they are part of a group before i move against any of them.

thats good, and robert, i am sorry.

sorry!?!? i was 15 when i was sent here, just like so many others, and you were nice, seemingly genuinely so, unlike so many of our other teachers. yet you did nothing to save us, so we just assumed you were in on it, and you niceness an act, but no you just were too thick to see the truth. i was lucky, i survived, i retained my humanity, i escaped my agency clutches. so many others, too many others were not. sarah flynn, remember her? dead. michael lochner? dead. jarrod smith, oh hes alive, but hes now a murderous psychopath, and a very skilled one at that. so save your sorries.

james lowered his head ashamed, he did remember those three, so kind, so full of life while they were here. 

after gathering the information he needed robert stood up to leave.

goodbye, mr. mckay, he said as he walked out.

james broke down in tears, feeling so ashamed for missing the signs that seemed so obvious now. for not helping the children he should have been protecting instead of taking money from their socalled parents. james remained that way for some time. eventually he calmed down enough, stood up and walked through the theatre to the main door. the building that just hours before brought him such joy now caused him nothing but sorrow. he knew he would never be able to look at this place the same way again. james made it to the door, went out, and closed the door behind him. with a great sigh james locked the theatre, maybe to never be unlocked again.

agent practical stood tall behind the massive double doors, m4 carbine unholstered, held alert from breast to thigh. physically he felt great today, which was quite unusual for someone in his profession, more uncommon for himself in particular. he didnt know why the gods had blessed him like this and he wasnt sure if it could even be considered a blessing.

the gods he found himself muttering.

he supposed he was one of the last believers, undoubtedly the only devotee who had access to the classified of information he did. unlike the others though, he wasnt so quick to jump to conclusions. he had scored high in his cognition test this morning, he always scored high but this was a personal record. that was the trend that followed regarding the daily tests an agent of wic was required to take. mathematically he presumed that he was one of the top 25 humans alive on earth, but today, right now, he knew in his heart he was the best. superstitious wasnt he. superstition is the religion of a feeble mind, he countered. he had read that somewhere a long time ago, yet today he decided it was false, a blanket statement for something too nuanced. it seemed too obvious now. in that moment he had an epiphany, this is what they were offering. the antiaging, the genetic engineering, the solved water pollution theory, and the biomedical breakthroughs. they described it in a way that only spoke of benefits, using themselves as evidence to the humans. if they took the artizans  offer, it would create a perfect world, a perfect society, no faults no death, no room for advancement or improvement. it would bring every human to what he felt right now, and surpass it. plunging the world deeper into his hell. the suicide rate for prospects of wic was 77. to create more people like him no. 

the politicians werent going to pass the bill regardless. he knew that from the conversations he had heard. too much money and power to be lost. he had decided that he would kill all of them if that were their final decision yesterday. today he knew he wouldnt, their greed had unknowingly brought them to the correct decision.

now he knew it was a blessing."
"[wp] my father told me one day when youre lost, always follow the river. there were no rivers in our area, so i figured it was an expression. one day, i woke up stranded in a remote place, at the head of a small river.","pain. pain was everywhere, just like light. everywhere all at once too much to digest. i groaned loudly attempting to stand despite my sight being absent. 

i blinked rubbing my eyes only to finally focus on blood. i could see my hands were covered in blood. the paint being under my nails both dried and fresh. the alarm bells ringing in my head and ears sparked the last memory i had. i was walking to my car late at night. the moment i turned around after putting my backpack in the passenger seat i was hit with something and now im here. 

just then a wrestling in the bushes ahead made my aching head snap up. there in the bush i saw him, or rather an it. 

he had a machete and wore a bright yellow soccer shirt that was smeared with blood. a few drops being his own as black goo slid down his broken nose and one of his eyes was bleeding, rapidly swelling up. a few bite marks were visible on his arm. as i saw the bite marks i ran my tongue along my teeth. 

was that from me? 

a flash of a memory came and went. a flurry of movement between us then pain is all i could remember.

no time to think! the it began to run towards me.

in that moment my mind went blank and all i could think of was the words my father told me when i was younger. when youre lost, always follow a river. 

i turned and ran. 

a pain like ive never felt before became fuel to stay awake and alert. adrenaline filled my body, it was a weird high i could distinguish. suddenly i ran around trees jumped over rocks pivoted and dodged swipes from a stranger. it was hard not to look back but i knew if i did id be done. the uneven ground paired with random debris of trees was already hard enough to navigate. 

i knew my luck would run out soon though. he was taller and had to be faster considering he was clearly not human. 

though he was catching up, he too was injured. i could hear a wheezing, a stumble, a cough he was slowing down but then again so was i. 

i need to have faith. i somehow made it this far and am still alive. the wise words from my father had to have meant something. how could he have known id be here. how could he have foreseen this? my mind was delirious but i know one thing. clear as day i could see a town up a head, a few buildings stood out like a sore thumb amongst the trees. the river led right to the town.

no! the monster screamed. his antlers scratching along the bark of a tree as he in one final attempt reached out and threw his machete. 

i screamed as the thing hit me. 

i knew it hit me because i felt my body jolt forward before falling from impact. bbut id didnt feel anything. no pain, no anxiety, no nothing.

just a hot warmth came over my body, like a warm blanket.  like a cozy warm heavy blanket wrapped itself around my body. that i guess is what death feels like. even when murdered along the river warmth is all that i could feel. 

i heard a scream. 

it was not mine. 

i heard people. 

i felt people. 

then pain, so much pain. 

it was everywhere, just like light. everywhere all at once too much to digest. i groaned loudly attempting to stand despite my sight being absent.

he stood off then.  eyeing me, i think, but i was occupied with moaning and in genuine belief that i had such internal injuries that i might die before my hovere could even administer whatever triage required.  after a few seconds, i opened my eyes and pushed myself up to see. he didnt look any smaller when i was lying down, that was for sure.

i made it to my knees but my breaths were ragged and now my finger weirdly throbbed worse than the surely worse body blows.

why, i croaked out.  are you doing this.

i swore it looked like he was considering a response.  instead he gazed calmly at me, then turned to leave.

wait, i said.  he stopped.

tell me why, please, why me, and why father, i croaked.

he turned back to me.  the morning sun caused the usual panoply of peach, reds, oranges and blues in the sky behind him, and his pale fur picked up the myriad colours, making him seem almost opalescent in this quiet, high place.

lately, hes been going on and on about how much he wants a trad wife. ive been telling him that if a woman wants to be a tradwife, sure, but you shouldnt force one to be. besides, you dont make enough money to support that lifestyle. he brushed me off as some sort of white knight, and asked if i could take a joke??? i said i could if the joke was funny. he just laughed at me. 

well, the other day, he came to my apartment and said he solved the problems i was talking about. i thought he meant that he was going to drop the tradwife thing, but no. he took me to his basement where apparently he built a secret lab??? and then showed me that he had a time machine down there. he went into the machine and came out with a fair skin maiden in a coarse woolen kirtle stained with dust. the conversation went like this

me what have you done?!

shawn i got myself a trad wife.

me when you said you wanted a trad wife, i never expected you to travel in time to get one!

her salutes me god yeve thee good morrow, fair sir.

me see? what does that even mean???

shawn i gotta understand her?

me how will you hold a conversation if you cant?!

shawn i dont need her to talk. 

i heard enough and stormed out of his basement and came home to type all of this up. im not crazy, right? like this was a really insane thing to do? she probably has some sort of family back in her time or something. who knows what weve screwed up? and i know he wont treat her well. 

then again, she has more rights in this time. more say in how she lives her life. more freedom. maybe shed like it here if she stayed. but i really dont think we should pull people through time in general.

glistening wetly, the webbing the stars were fastened to, once silent and still, were still no longer.

a subtle vibration, so slight, that had looked like a tiny blurring that might be overlooked in daylight was unmistakable in the cone of my torch and rooted me to my spot. i had thought at first is had been my eyes tearing, as something old and hidden in me reaching out from the primitive recesses of my mind to smothering my very thoughts, as i tried to rationalize the motion as my torch flickering, its charge dwindled to nothing.

i had been lost for hours, my torch slowly dimming as i searched for the path back to the main corridor of the carlsbad cavern system. i knew i had to be close but somehow i just could not find it.

this fissure thomas and i had found had been an adventure we could not pass up. to find a new path within a existing and mapped cavern system was the dream of all cavers, being the first person perhaps ever to travel a path was a rush and reward in and of itself, to see that which no one had was an amazing feeling. 

trying not to dwell on it, i dont know where thomas is. i had lost him in the eardripper i had passed through getting to this part of the cavern, cobwebbed and sparkling in the bright light of my torch as i rose from the water, led us on in our excitement. 

into what now was grim.

my fear caused me to feel the illusionary touch of spiders silk, feather light and sticky, on my face and hands, fighting myself as i tried not to brush it away as my body flinched in reaction to the instinctual cringing that gripped me.

i tried to slowly back along my path, feeling with me feet the path back. i found my clothing snag and hold me, somehow having caught myself on the rocks that surrounded me.

my torch flickered and stayed dark.

i shake it, the light flaring for a moment and going dark again, a scream tearing from my throat.

in the light of the cone i saw millions of small, black, many legged bodies traveling along the webbing, glimpsed briefly in the instant of illumination, coming down the webbing. each body carrying eight stars in front of them. sparks of flint reflecting the last light i would ever see.

of course! my brother, len wen rushed over to help me carry our unsteady guest to one of the stone benches. we speak as befits men, so as to leave no misunderstanding and make clear our intentions! that we are eloquent besides, comes from years of studying poetry and the great works in addition to our sacred monastic rituals and of course, kungfu.      
          
kkungfu..! the stranger seemed to revive momentarily with a second wind.      
          
i smiled as brother len and i set the stranger down on the bench. you know of us. then, you seek our strength?       
           
the people require your strength! as our guest struggled to get up, their hood fell from their face. please help me!             
             
fifty men. a hundred eyes. all stared openly at the newcomers face. soft. fair. lips that pouted. eyes that glimmered. a touch of crimson on the cheeks. unbelievably, a panicked murmur began to rise amongst my disciplined brothers.       
         
wwhat is that!? brother ping pointed, taking a step back.      
          
judging from the shape of its face, it might be a fox spirit! another warned. beware, brothers, lest it enchant you!     
            
i... i think i have already fallen under this foxs spell...  brother len stood, clutching his chest, his expression as of one in great pain. my heart quickens, and my face is heated as if i were struck with a closed fist!        
           
my brave, dauntless brothers began running around helplessly, covering their eyes and ears, some striking their groins fiercely for some reason or another.            

i think that is a wymman. or something like that. another monk observed. it is similar to a smaller, more lumpy man.    
          
we monks didnt go out much.          
           
i know what a woman is, i lied as i was forced to help the stranger once more when her strength gave out again. i noticed flecks of blood on her clothing and nodded affirmatively. fear not, brothers. i am well versed in the subject. observe how she bleeds. a womans body follows the cycle of the moon       
          
im wwounded, you.... you.... you dumb motherfucker holy fuck. the woman ripped open her cloak to reveal a thoroughly blood soaked bandage crudely wrapped just beneath her ribcage.    
     
... and their mood suffers much as a result, i continued my explanation, before realizing the true nature of the bleeding. my word! you are wounded!      
           
nnnnngggghhhhh! the woman let out a strangled sound, as if she were restraining herself from saying something quite terrible, then passed out from the strain. and the blood loss presumably.       
            
fortunately, the elder monk helped us to settle down and went about treating the woman wing, as she told us later.      
          
later, we had to fight an army, but that was a lot simpler of an affair, believe me you."
"[wp] everyone always talks about the horrible downsides of being immortal. the one thing they dont talk about, is the fact that everyone will ask you questions about history and youve either were in the wrong place, or completely forgot what happened. and youve been alive for a long time.","i had been a prince, a prisoner, a traveller, a warrior and a sorcerer in the past. a destroyer and a devourer. a source of great evil. but thats in the past. i am now a father to adoptive children, creator of eldritch puppies and pets, a local guardian deity and lord mayor of this little town i rule over. and immortal freelance historical consultant.

most will know me as lord elvari of innsmouth. eldritch god of madness. not a god of knowledge, not wisdom, and most certainly not of historical accuracy. not that it has phased historians like professor gideon hardwick and his colleagues. or anyone with an inkling of the history of the gods of this world. everyone had hoped i could provide truthful, firsthand historical account of events. be objective about it, as a lone god with no pantheon or family.

thats the thing most immortals dont tell you. the thing humans dont always believe.

when you have lived as long as i have, memories get foggy. it is worse in my case. ive died and pulled myself back multiple times. been maimed and tortured more than the average human had a papercut. a thousand years of imprisonment in limbo had my brains going in circles among themselves and throwing memories into the void like confetti. most of these younger immortals will talk of the downsides of watching your loved ones die, all while ive observed civilizations and pantheons come and go, rise and fall. there is pain. there is grief. sometimes, with the assistance of sufficient alcohol this is where, in modern times, alfred and kat will yell at their drunken dork god to sober up to dull my senses and wreck my liver a hundred times over, the agony and sorrow eventually fade with time.

not the incessant questions.

the truth is, i frequently refer to the books ive preserved in my libraries. im not a walking memory and data bank. even with the mass of muddled memories from those who i had assimilated over the centuries, very little is of actual historical value. most of them consist of mundane little moments that the original owners considered significant. their marriage. their childs first birthday. the first time they ever left the village.

how often were they in the right place, at the right time, to witness the right people truly make history? much more rarely than these humans who consult me on history. frankly, im not even there most of time myself. i was too busy eating in my lair. swimming in the seas, hunting for sharks to devour while the exciting stuff was happening on land. okay, i confess, sometimes i was simply too drunk to recall a darn thing.

and even if i was there, once upon a time, i forgot.

maybe it simply hurts to remember.

but what i do recall, i do my best to recount. why else would these humans bring me in as a historical consultant? it is one of the ways i earn money to pay my employees and servants. to raise funds to buy myself a big cheesecake.

so, human, ive told you about myself like you asked. youve heard me rant and rave, now do you still have a question about this worlds history for little old elvari here? or are you here for some tea and cakes?

edit i cant take it anymore, ugh. your story gave me enough anxiety that i had to do something about it or i wouldnt be able to sleep. i hope you dont mind me responding.  
  
yeah, people usually start to really reflect when the pants come off.  
  
i stared back down at him. fuck you, kevin. i hope you die of  
  
did the file tell you about the gonorrhea?  
  
his hand paused, fingers an inch from my zipper. his eyes tilted back up at me. the what  
  
i spat a mouthful of coppery blood and about half of a molar into his face.  
  
he threw himself backward, the latex gloves making it nearly impossible to rub his eyes without catching against the wet skin around them. god damnit, kevin  
  
id been in a tbone car accident before, but at least that time id had a seatbelt and airbags. the impact of my side hitting the floor was worse, especially when the chairs frame didnt even creak, let alone snap. several more chunks of shattered enamel rode my next few words out onto the carpet. alexa, call mindy cell, urgent.  
  
calling mindy cell.  
  
alexa, hang up. his voice was much closer and much angrier than i had hoped. alexa, kevin? really? that was your big plan?  
  
alan, you fucker, and no. he tried to pull the chair up to standing. throwing all of my weight the other way sent me crashing back to the floor on my other shoulder, costing me another tooth and sending stars across my vision. the chair still didnt break, but i was just stalling anyway. youll go blind before the antibiotics kick in, you know.  
  
you dont have gonorrhea, kevin. and im really starting to regret being nice to you. you really, really didnt want that.  
  
this time, i threw my weight directly at him. i didnt really expect to get lucky and land a headbutt, which i didnt, but all i wanted was to be on the floor again anyway. alan. not kevin. and youre right. i dont have gonorrhea. what ive got is worse.  
  
he didnt bother trying to stand me up again. i rocked back and forth as hard as i could to keep him from flipping me onto my back, but it didnt stall him for very long. his face was a bloodspattered mask of rage. who cares?  
  
you should. its colic.  
  
he blinked, momentarily confused. col what the fuck do you mean, you have colic?  
  
well, i dont. but the baby does.  
  
he rolled his eyes, pulling the wick cutter out of his pocket. you dont have a baby, kevin.  
  
shes crying right now. you dont hear that?  
  
he dropped to one knee, reaching for my pants once more. not falling for your shit again.  
  
alexa, emergency call the police. i wriggled my hips back and forth, struggling to keep my zipper away from his fingers.    
  
seriously? alexa. fucking hang up. i told you alexa was a stupid plan, kevin.  
  
alexas not my plan. mindy is.  
  
he pulled my jeans open and tugged my boxers out of the way. i tried to wiggle away one last time, but all i earned for it was a sack tap that stole my breath. never heard of mindy, kevin.  
  
doesnt. matter. the latex was colder than i thought it was going to be. the steel was worse. i flinched away, but not far enough to entirely escape his grip. shes got your gun.  
  
the assassins head whipped around to his bag, forgotten on the couch. his hands came away from my crotch, dropping the wick cutter as they rose in surrender. who the fuck are you?  
  
it still hurt to talk, but not enough to stop me. i dont know about kevins wife, asshole, but alans wife mindy has been sleeping in the babys room. the room you didnt check. i told you you should care about the colic."
[wp] you did it! your resistance group overthrew the tyrant!... anyone left that knows how to keep the nuclear reactor running safely?,"the histories say things did not start like this. we departed earth as a microcosm of the good things about our culture. democracy, egalitarianism, altruism, and things like the social contract. but time lays waste to all things, and the political situation in our generation ship was no different.

from a time of tumult and crisis, our democracy was stripped away. there were platitudes of returning to it once things were stable, platitudes that were forgotten when the oligarchy realized there would be no one to hold them accountable. they chose a despot from their ranks, and began organizing along a different paradigm. we saw the return of slavery and cruel and unusual punishment, but were powerless to meaningfully resist.

slowly knowledge was been lost, the new tyrants sought to monopolize information. machines have broken down, and it will be decades before we can harvest resources to begin repairs. the most recent despot of the ruling dynasty, kineson graves, seeks even more total control, to hoard all the resources he can. but he has grown complacent and decadent, pursuing hedonistic whims rather than actually steer the ship of state. his court is either too lost in their own pursuit of pleasure or too scared to confront him with reality. it is an opportunity for us. i can feel it, this will be the final rebellion. we will put our kings head on a stick.

the crown guard are in our pocket, too many of them have lost family to the wants and desires of those who lord over us. the bastards do not know that we know their fancy weapons dont work anymore. we are armed only with improvised weapons and armor, but we have overwhelming numbers. there will be no stopping us, a human wave of righteous hate.

we wait for the clock to strike six, and then spring into action. we move on every stronghold at once, our agents giving us access through the doors from the inside. coddled by their hoarded resources, our foes are no match. in three hours, it is over. our enemies are dead or captured. kineson rains abuse upon us, threatening us with divine judgement from gods we abandoned long ago. we read a litany of his crimes, and the crimes of all those who came before him. then he is executed.

it feels surreal. we actually have done it. after centuries of abuse, they have been overthrown. we have put so much into reaching this point, and now we are not sure what to do with ourselves. it is then that one of my officers raises a concern, is there anyone left who knows how to keep the nuclear reactor running safely?

we have been kept in the dark for so long, none of us have technical information. the few surviving members of the royal court know nothing, they do not even know how to access the technical archives that contain instructions for managing and repairing everything on the ship. my stomach churns. to have fought so hard, and still be doomed. we cannot die now. we will not die now.

the old regime did a good job of depriving us information. we know that data intrusions are possible, but none of us are at all savvy when it comes to computers or hacking. we know such things exist from the stories passed down by oral tradition, but not how to carry them out. the reactor is the only thing powering life support, if it ceases to function, we will all suffocate.

faster and faster, learning as much as we can in a race against time. the technical knowledge needed to decrypt the needed information is itself encrypted. we cannot even understand the technical readouts from the reactor entirely. we think, but do not know, it is malfunctioning in some way. 

forty days later, a klaxon sounds. there is an emergency, and we do not even have the knowledge to understand what the emergency is about. for three days it blares, until, all at once, it ceases to shriek and the lights go out. with creeping horror, i realize we have run out of time. it is eerily quiet. for the first time in centuries, we hear silence. no hum of electronics, no buzz of the ventilation fans. it will not be long now.

in the final minutes of my life, i wonder if it was worth it. was it better to break the tyrants and die, or live under the shadow of doom for centuries more? i think i prefer an end in horror to horror without end. the air is thin, i find myself breathing faster and faster, my body sounding alarm bells. i collapse, and feel a strange euphoria as my life fades from the universe."

hoping for the best, he rode over to the trees in question and examined them closely.  the burnt sections contained a greenish tint, indicating dragon fire was the culprit.  looking deeper into the woods, he noticed more trees, almost in a straight line from where he was sitting.  with no other clues, he urged his horse towards the next batch of trees.  within a few minutes, the duo were far from the clearing and entering a more desolate environment.

the forest rapidly gave way to rocky formations and stones piled haphazardly about.  there were scorch marks on some of the rocks, indicating a trail to be followed.  the knight suspected a trap, but he had be travelling so long that his desire to end the quest outweighed any caution he might have felt.  as he rode deeper into the canyon, he swore he could make out words carried by the wind.  thinking quickly, he dismounted and put muffles on the hooves of his horse in an effort to mask the sound they would make on the stone.  he led his steed slowly, not wanting to heedlessly rush into unknown danger, something painful experience had taught him in the past, despite his earlier desire to end the whole adventure as soon as possible.

turning a stone corner, the scene in front in him made the knight freeze in his tracks.  there was the monster, the horrible beast that had menaced the kingdom for so very long.  his eyes narrowed as the knight plotted the route he would need to take to make the most of his surprise attack.  nodding to the horse and giving it the hand sign to stay put, the knight soundlessly pulled his sword from the scabbard, crouched low and crept forward, keeping as much cover between him and his prey.

he could hear the musical voice of the captive maiden pleading for her life, her very freedom but her cries landed on deaf ears.  the response was harsh and shrill, promising dire threats of violence unless the enormous ransom was paid soon.  feeling that this was the pivotal moment in the encounter, the knight readied his weapon to strike the fatal blow.  springing from his hidden place, his valiant yell echoed off the stones around him and he leaped high into the air.  the gleaming, razor sharp edge of his blade sparkled in the sunlight as it arced through the air to end the menace once and for all.  his aim was true as he separated the vile head from the body of the beast.  it flew through the air before landing wetly on the ground and rolling to a stop, face down.

the knights chest was heaving from the exertion, and he turned to the captive maiden with a smile.  carefully, he put down his sword and pulled a dagger from a sheath on his belt.  sawing at the ropes that kept her bound, he continued to smile broadly as he freed her.  within moments, her release was complete and she hugged her rescuer.  this, he thought, was why i wanted to be a hero my whole life. a few preparations later and the trio set out to return to the king.

a day later at the castle of the kingdom, the crowds were jubilant at the sight of the successful rescue and the darling couple.  arriving at the gates, the king greeted them with a bright smile and a loud laugh.  his mirth only increased when the knight pulled the severed head from a bag and displayed it for all to see.  the king promised that it would hang from the highest pole on the castle wall so that the populace would know that the grave threat was finally over.

clapping his hands loudly once, the king gestured and several porters came out of the castle, burdened with heavy sacks filled to the brim with gold coins and magical treasures.  the heroic knight carefully removed the saddle from his valiant war steed, and a waiting groom rushed over to take the animal to the stables for a grateful rest.   nodding to the sacks that contained the reward, the knight smiled and indicated for his newfound companion, the maiden dragon, to take possession of the payment as they began to get ready to depart.  the king pointed to the severed head of the evil princess and his captain of the guard prepped the pole that would display her to all.  peace had finally returned to the troubled public."
"[wp] as a retired superhero, you are attending the wedding of a family member.  however, you realize that they are marrying a family member of your nemesis who is supposed to be dead and is also attending the wedding.","youre alive? i ask. 

its been over a decade, but i recognize the tiny scar on his chin. it was one of the first marks i left on him, and while its faded with time, it has not disappeared. 

dont go around publicizing it, he says, raising his hands in mock surrender. im not a danger to anyone now.

you lost your powers?

the smokescreen was one of the most dangerous villains when i was fighting supercrime. if he had lost his powers, it was no wonder that he had faked his death. he just as many enemies among other supervillains as he did among the superheroes. he followed his own twisted idea of right and wrong, and while twisted, his sense of morality still existed.

nope, still there. i just dont feel like wreaking havoc anymore. i found a better use for my talents. 

what better use? 

my niece is having a wedding in lake como, what better use do you think?

he has the infuriating habit of answering questions with more questions. 

you downgraded to normal white collar crime? i ask. 

no, im just an inventor now, he says, and the chain of infuriating questions is broken. instead of outlandish devices meant to disrupt society, i help us reach our eventual capitalistic collapse with less bumps on the road. 

thats good, i answer, and i cant keep the slight envy out of my voice. we both fought on opposite sides. by every metric, i did every single right thing. yet here i am, broken body and cynical soul, escaping to a wedding to forget my problems. and here he stands, wealthy and healthy, despite countless crimes. 

what about you? dont heroes usually work until well into their forties?

well into their forties, or into their death. that part remains unspoken. 

i got injured, i tell him, because theres nothing to hide. like him, im also covered in scars. no amount of foundation can cover up the mangled mess of lines present on my knee. there is no glorious retirement for heroes, no cushy pension. im still stronger and faster than a normal human can hope to be, but i am no longer the sentient weapon that i used to be. they sent me off with minimal medical debt, a signed nda, and a joke of a settlement. it was like removing the foundation of a house and expecting it to stay standing. 

being a hero was my identity, and it took years to shed the memories. it takes conscious effort even now to not react at the news of some crime, to ignore the sounds of police sirens. we are both civilians now, yet only one of us is happy. 

do you miss it? he asks, swirling around some of the outrageously expensive wine in his wine glass. 

what do you think? i say, because i dont know the answer.

im taking it that the medication isnt working then? he asked, shuffling through the papers in the folder in front of him, brow creased as he studied them.

she had known it wouldnt. she had told him it wouldnt. she... she wanted to be angry at him for yet another failed attempt at making the other worlds go away, that hed given her another proscription drug that made her head feel like it was full of cotton and made her too tired to get out of bed every third day. but the concern in his voice... she knew he cared, even if he didnt know what to do about it.

yes, she sighed after a few moments. he wanted her to speak her mind, not just gesture or nod. something about vocalicing her feelings and thoughts to help sort them out, to put words to them and with words arrange them and make them make sense.

im... not sure what we can do, he started, plucking at his lower lip. theres some treatment options left. but. well, the waiting list for dreamdiver is years long. unless its an interesting case, and maybe this qualify.

she looked up at him, through the haze of tiredness from the drugs. and through the fractured haze of worlds that filled the space between them, like the reflections in shards of glass. each different, like the reflections of a broken mirror growing stranger the further away they went.

no drugs? she asked, and cringed at how she sounded. blushing she fleshed out her thoughts, the words tumbling from her lips. i mean, i dont want them. i just... you were talking about soilderarine or something last time?

he chuckled, smiling at her reassuringly. solidrine. and no, i think not. theres rumours going around the medical community pointing to the circle of dreams as being behind it, and i very much doubt mindaltering drugs from a insane magical cult would help.

he paused and she could see the tension in his shoulder. i... honestly think we should consider the asylum.

im not going to a insane asylum!

psychiatric asylum, he corrected her, and im not sure how else to help you, mirriam.

im not mentally ill. she managed to avoid shouting at him... if just barely. well aware how little that would help her case. she rolled her eyes, in the way that let her look elsewhere. shed rather watch fores glens and savannas, birds and foxes than doctor meyers concerned face.

mostly, as far as anyone can tell, me included, he agreed, sounding all the reasonable. usually she liked it, but right now it just... couldnt. but you experience layered visual hallucinations. mirriam, you almost fell down the stairs in your apartment complex because you couldnt see or experience them.

i... i know. it just... it just feels... like giving up? that something is... broken and nobody can fix it. like... like im wrong, too wrong.  to be someone normal... she mumbled as she watched those foxes in that far of place only she could see play and frolic. for the most part. one stopped, looking back at her.

the first times shed seen someone do that, all those years ago after shed stumbled into her dads laboratory, it had freaked her out. but it was just happenstance that they looked back at her. shed seen hundreds and thousands of mirriams look back at her younger and older, framed by surroundings familiar and strange. all looking but none seeing.

she sighed softly. does... that make sense?

she rolled her eyes back to doctor meyers who smiled softly at her. sadly. she wondered how many times he had heard those words.

maybe, said a voice next to her as a small warm body covered in fuzz brushed past her elbow and jumped onto the floor, you just havent asked the right people yet!"

no. im telling you that the egg got stolen, liza says. 

stolen? jerome shouts.

i dont see what the big deal is. its just a stupid, bedazzled egg. 

jerome pushes his hand against his face and sighs. you didnt pay attention to the briefing again, did you? 

of course i did. you were talking about that stuff and or thing that needed to be done. 

its amazing you havent been beheaded yet.

jerome exhales sharply. if you had paid attention, you would have known that the egg houses the offspring of one of the most powerful beings in the universea kaicuda.

yes. the king wanted to hatch the offspring here, hoping that the god would bring great prosperity upon the land. but now youve gone and fucked it all up. 

i hate to be that person, but if it was so important, why did the leader of the high guard have me watching it? i suck.

jerome chuckles. on that much we agree. but you do make a surprisingly good point. why did barnabas have someone of your caliber guarding the egg? 

maybe he wanted it to get stolen. 

preposterous. 

lisa shrugs. does anything else make sense? 

no. jerome looks down. but im sure it was just an oversight. 

why dont you go ask him? 

me? youre the one who lost the egg.

liza pulls out a chair from a nearby table and sits. which is exactly why i shouldnt be the one to tell him. can you imagine how mad hell be if this actually wasnt part of some larger conspiracy? 

jerome sighs. alright, ill tell him. but you need to stay here and wait.

lizas eyes narrow. why? 

jerome hesitates, then says, just in case barnabas wants to talk to you too. 

liza kicks her feet up on the table. alright, fine. 

good. i shouldnt be gone long. jerome walks to the door, glances back at liza, then exits the room. 

weirdo.  

after twenty minutes of sitting still, liza starts to get antsy. whats taking him so long? she wonders as she walks to the door and pokes her head into the hallway. no sign of him. maybe i should go check and make sure barnabas isnt laying into him too hard. she walks down the long hallway, through the courtyard, and down a spiral staircase, arriving just outside barnabas office."
"[wp] sweetie, stop hiding already. its still me, i havent changed that much. im just hungrier nowstarving. if you dont stop hiding ill get really mad","lola stays as quiet as possible, curled up and trembling in a fetal position in a closet, trying to breath as slowly as possible, and doing her best to not make a peep. 

she knew this house was batshit crazy as soon as they moved in two weeks ago, and this moment all but cemented it for her. 

moments ago, orson, her father, had just encountered the strangest thing in the attic, as he reported. something he thought could be a nice little scare for sheepish little lola. it was a spider. not just a spider, but a large, hairy and vibrantly colored specimen. and hed just managed to trap it in a jar, but lola knew nothing of this.

as she approached the attic ladder, and while orson simultaneously stepped down slowly, rung by rung, she managed to catch a quick glance of what he was hiding, tucked in his left arm. the most striking spider shed ever seen, in a jar, its eyes looking right at her in cold menacing anger. 

jolted by the bonechilling sight, lola let out an intense glass shattering scream, while her father, in a flurry of panic, let go of the jar, to frantically turn to look behind him as she ran away in a frenzied panic. 

and what came next need not be recounted in detail.

all that lola remembers, as she quietly contemplates her mortality in the confines of this old wooden closet in her bedroom, is the sounds of what followed. he yelped in pain so loudly, she could scarcely imagine it was the same mild and even tempered father she always knew. and then came the growls and shrieks, as his voice slowly transformed into a more monstrous guttural tone. and then what he said at last. 

what happened to daddy, and why does he wanna eat me?,  she worriedly wonders. if only her parents listened to her about needing to move out as soon as possible because of the really bad feeling she had about this house of horror. i guess told you so is irrelevant when youre about to become a mutated hybrid monsters dinner."

with a grunt, i forced my eyes to open and was met with the bright blue sky stinging my vision, tears already forming from the harsh light. before i could move, a shadow loomed over me, and i saw a woman staring back at me, her staff ready to swing.

outsiders arent allowed in these sacred woods, she said, her eyes scanning me like i was some sort of oddity.

sacred woods? i muttered weakly, struggling to prop myself up on my elbows. i dont know what youre talking about. as my vision cleared and expanded beyond her, the world came into view. the dirt was scorched black, and debris and shattered trees lay scattered around us. if i didnt know any better, an explosion must have happened.

glancing down at myself, i saw that i was wearing what looked to be armor, or at least what was left of it. the pieces that clung to me were battered, the symbols burned beyond recognition. despite the state of the armor, my body seemed to fare better, though i was riddled with cuts and bruises.

was i in battle?

looking up, i saw the woman lower her staff to my neck, her suspicion hardening. are you here to kill me? who sent you? who are you?

i tried to push myself up further, my arms trembling with the effort. i am the words got caught in my throat. i dont recall ever seeing this woman in my life. in fact, i couldnt recall any faces. surely, i had to know at least my name. but even the most basic fact eluded me as i slumped back down, fresh tears mixing with those already stinging my eyes. who am i? i whispered, more to myself than to this stranger. why dont i know?

the woman studied my face, her grip on the staff loosening. you really dont remember, do you? she raised her weapon away from me and offered her hand. i have a horse nearby, and you could wear my old clothes when we get to my cabin."
"[wp] one caramel macchiato, large, please! you look up from your phone to see a dragon on the opposite side of the counter, casually waiting for you to take his order as if this was a normal everyday occurance.","this, is not large the dragon objected a few minutes later.

buddy, its the large cup, full to the brim, you are more than fifty times the size of any other customer, so the difference in perspective of scale is on you. i sighed, having thought this much would be pretty apparent.

i ordered a large. they insisted.

and you see the l on the cup? that means its a large cup, the cup is by its definitive classification, large. the fact that compared to you, it is smaller than your eyeball, has no bearing on the matter, this really isnt my problem.

its hardly my fault you people are so tiny and easily crushed. real subtle threat there pal.

and its hardly my fault you are so big and unwieldy, if you want dragon sized drinks, make them yourself or convince one of the like ten other dragons in the world to open a coffee shop.

the dragon reared up, slamming its horns through what would have been a ceiling before its arrival demolished the rest of the building. i am azathar the annihilator, bane of a thousand kings and pureflame by soul! and i demand a large drink!

i sigh, thats it, time to pull out the big guns. and i... literally, physically, do not possess a cup larger than that one in the ruins of this store, you could burn me to death if you want, you still wont get a bigger cup from it. the eternal power of truth.

i will not be leaving you a positive review.. it peered down to stare at the nametag. ashley.. you shall rue the day you failed to provide for my might!

unlikely, insurance doesnt cover dragon landing, so im probably just gonna move two streets down to the next branch, not my problem."
"[wp]you just got summoned for the first time in millennia. but different from your expectations, the summoner doesnt want power, death and destruction. instead, you find the nervous summoner holding a bouquet of flowers right outside a messy summoning circle, asking you to accompany them to prom.","fear hoarders of wealth, for greedslayer has come to take your souls to eternal torment! i said as i was summoned.

hooray, i did it right. can you accompany me to prom? the nervous summoner said as he shuffled back and forth.

i stepped out of the summoning circle, which was too messy to contain me, and took a breath. this mortal smelled of

you dont even have ownership of the clothes youre wearing, and these are wild flowers. i said. your parents dont even own this house, and i smell the debt theyre under. you have summoned the right demon, mortal, just tell me who to slay for you and i will happily take their soul to fix this.

he awkwardly smiled and said. so based. i love it. but i really just want you to come to prom with me. its basically a dance.

i looked at my figure briefly to make sure i hadnt been turned into a succubus in the past millennia. but no. i was thinning to an unhealthy extent, with heat resistant leather wrapped over many spots in a more functional than form fitting way. something that wouldnt burn as i dipped souls in their own molten gold, and giant strong hands and large arms to crush my foes under their own statues after they underestimated me as some poor wretch.

is there some greedy rich person to kill at this event? someone behind your troubles? i asked.

no. well, maybe? i just wanted to introduce you to my club so that they could hear your stories. the mortal said. but i mean if you have to run off and take direct action instead, im not going to stop you.

im greedslayer, not greedfinder. unless im close enough to smell them, i cant locate those that id need to slay. i sighed. you have a club of people who wish to hear of the painful death of rich assholes?



and then i stabbed him to death with his own gilded blade. i said to the group at the prom. he would never again enslave people for construction of a vanity palace.

you were right, shes absolutely peak. another mortal said.

 and you have a dozen more stories like this? my summoner asked.

of course. though, not all are as triumphant as that one. you did ask for the best first.

then spoke that ignorant brat, in spandex up to his neck, what do you mean you did? your head grew an entirely new body, once, and your regeneration isnt haunted by subzero or scorching temperatures. we tried to overwhelm your body with radiation, and you werent slightly inconvenienced.

they always talk for so long. your point? i interrupted, just trying to get through this confrontation. 

youd be invaluable as a medical professional theres no way youd have been thrown away, and theres no record of you in any medical database, or any at all until a few weeks ago, you chose this! they also never seem able to make simple observations.

how many people do you think died during our short conversation?

wwhat? their voice shook, the sort of fear you only her from concerned loved ones, after the worst kind of news, clearly present in their voice.

from treatable, very treatable ailments, how many people do you think have died, during our talk? their face shifted, seeming more confused than the mother of a child gone, after treating them with essential oils and literature.

id assume one, at most like, who doesnt just go to a doctor, when theyre sick? its not hard to spot a rich kid, from their actions, but its even easier to spot a dumb one, from their words.

234.



twohundred and thirtyfour people have died, in the last six minutes of us speaking, and i know that to be fact. more than half of them were children.

thththats how!? their guard still stood, and for good reason, if what they knew of me was true, id already have killed them before they could see me. their hands flexed unconsciously, on their shield, seemingly from the shock. you did that

no, you did that.

no! i dont give world leaders and health company executives cancer or tumors! i dont kill kids!!

i dont kill the kids, those world leaders and insurance companies do, and thats pretty common knowledge. those kids who couldnt find help for their illnesses? it was because they couldnt afford it. the reason they couldnt afford it, those governments who keep them poor. you stand with the problem. 

that that doesnt answer my question!

my name, orcus, was given by you people, and so was another, thanatos. now, i am known as the god of peaceful death

so you are the one who killed all those people!

no i ignored their accusation, continuing on with my story, and i take pride in that title, but it is not as you might think, at first. i bring peaceful death, by keeping you from seeing the river, until you are ready. or, i brought after your people forsook ours, all those thousands of years ago, we were forbidden from interfering, and such organizations took advantage.

im done here, then spoke the child, before leaping to take my breath once again, and so are you!

their blade couldnt pierce my skin, i entertained your attempts at assassination, prior, but now i am speaking, sit, their body feel to the floor, weighed down like a submarine at the bottom of the ocean.

i will return to my duties, but with so many people profiting off of such suffering, i cant simply let them off with a wave, and take over what shouldve been their duties im going to make them hurt like everyone they suffering from their actions, unable to die, unable to rest. i want them to know, so you will tell them, and i will be waiting until they fix this problem theirselves, until i end their suffering. go now.

im going to have a lot of work to do, for the next century or other, with how greedy those things are, but i can wait. i can wait for another thousand years, and a million after that. their pain will only grow, and with billions already in such states, theyll be luck to speak without coughing up blood."
"[wp] youre the villain in a prophecybut the hero hasnt shown up. years pass, the world waits, and you slowly start building the kingdom you were supposed to destroy","little hero part 1

the prophecy was clear, a wise old wizard foretold,

first, a villain arrives unchallenged, they will be fierce and cold.

they bring chaos and destruction, until the world loses hope,

outlooks become bleak, and people struggle to cope.

 

the villains power is too great, that of a god had been bestowed,

with just a thought, they could make things appear, float, or even, explode.

nobody would dare to challenge this magical being,

for only death would result from their disagreeing.

 

until one day, a brave hero stands tall,

they fight off the darkness, and the villain will fall.

the people will cheer, and the world rebuilt,

no more sadness or sorrow, and no more blood will be spilt.

i am chaos and madness, and sadness galore,

i have murdered and butchered, but now its a bore.

where are you, little hero, your late to the game,

do you not wish to stand and make a claim to your fame?

 

i just wanted a rival, someone to stand up to me,

it isnt only the people, who were hoping to meet thee.

i simply needed an equal, a challenge, one of my own,

but instead, here i stand, feared, hated... and alone."
"[wp] the entire herovillain shtick is all just an act, really. a stunt to ensure all of the evil people in the city gather under one banner to be safely contained. but one day, the hero doesnt show up for work, and the villain has to cover for them. and then the next. and then the next.","i get out of his costume, and take off the chest bandages.  
goddamn herovillain schtick.  
why couldnt the hero be also a woman? would have been easier to pretend to be them.  
i hate this.  
i am a villain as a job from the government, to make sure all the criminals, and criminally inclined individuals gather under one banner.  
the hero is the same just for the other side, as righteous people can be just as dangerous as villains.  
problem is, for the last 2 weeks, the hero didnt show up for work...  
and i had to cover for them.  
its taking a toll, and the facade is slowly falling apart. 



after almost being killed by one of my own subordinates, i get home to relax.  
i enter my apartment, only to find him there.  
reeking of alcohol, and who knows what else.  
zack? what the fuck is wrong with you? i say, slapping him with some water, slamming him against the wall.  
perks of being an elemancer.   
he chuckles, not even fazed.  
they want me to let you win...  
then catch all the villains at the same time, for a big cleanup.  
but i heard that it is all a lie, they want to gather them to make an army! they have a way to mind control us! he says.  
i shrug.

  
so? i ask him.  
he freezes.  
so? so?! we are to help the government to do an evil thing bigger than the villains! he screams.  
good thing i have trapped the air inside, so nobody heard it, but me.  
nothing new, and also, they already tried.  
the device is in the costumes. i say to him.  
he pales.  
in ours as well? already? he asks.  
i nod.

  
then how? he asks after a while.  
i turned it off? i can control all the elements, this includes metals, and sand.  
figure it out, drunktard. i say, going to the kitchen to heat up some leftovers.  
he stands there frozen, like an idiot he is.  
sorry, mia. he says, sitting down at the table.  
shut up, and eat.  
you can sleep on the couch until you sober up, and then, i expect you to do your job. i say.  
even after all that? he asks.  
it does lower the damages to the infrastructure, and the civilians, and thats why we do it, not because the government. i say.

"[wp] daaaad, i barely wanna go to my own school, why would i want to go to yours? look, madame mayhems school for gifted neerdowells was a top villain college and its having its big reunion. plus my names up for villain of the year, so were going and thats final.","most of the time, kayla wells loved her life. being a prominent supervillains daughter had a bunch of downsides, true, not least of which was the necessity of keeping her civilian identity seperate from her more... illegal ventures. but the good far outweighed the bad. wealth, power, the freedom to use her gifts however and whenever she saw fit. whats not to love?


hey, said dad, no, judas, the infamous supervillain keeping his eyes on the road. he looked for all the world like an unassuming, blandly handsome middleaged man. it wasnt his real face. kayla wasnt sure he even had a real face. she supposed to a shapeshifter it was a bit of a philosophical question, and she knew how he felt about philosophy. dont pout. you know i hate it when you pout.


i agreed to come. she crossed her arms and pouted even harder. but no one said i had to be happy about it.


you agreed to try your best not to embarass me, nemesis, judas replied, using her cape name. kayla cringed, wanting nothing more in that instant than to go back in time and give her tween self a stern talking to regarding what did and did not constitute a good supervillain name. luckily, it was customary for sidekicks to rebrand after striking out on their own, and she was determined to come up with something better once the opportunity presented itself. and you sulking in the corner for the entire duration of the gettogether will most definitely reflect badly on me, young lady. what kind of supervillain cant even control his own sidekick? clearly not one whos cut out to be villain of the year, my detractors will say.


kayla sighed, tuning judas out as he launched into yet another of his longwinded lectures. they soon pulled into the parking lot of her fathers beloved alma mater. technically hed never set foot in this particular campus before. like most institutions of its ilk, madam mayhems was perpetually on the run from the law, and would regularly uproot itself for greener pastures depending on the climate. judas himself had attended when it was set up in hainan, china. as he was oh so fond of saying, villainy has no borders.


the parking lot was somewhat sparsely populated, but there were more people around than she was expecting, given the nature of the event. kayla said as much to her father. 


its not just wouldbe supervillains who study here, he said. henchmen, getaway drivers, crooked cops, backalley doctors, amoral researchers, corrupt politicians, dishonest accountants. supercrime has a thousand facets and a million moving parts  and this is where those parts are manufactured.


judas breathed deep, his eyes fluttering. there was a nosthalgic grin on his face, the size of it just a little too wide to pass off as human. then the grin disappeared, and he turned to give kayla a gimlet eye. 


of course you would know all this already, he said, if youd paid attention to a single one of my explanations. now lets get a move on  i wouldnt put it past some of our colleagues to boobytrap the venue ahead of time like we were planning to. and ill be damned if we get outplayed by the likes of them."

thats the thing, snoreglar said, struggling to keep his mouth above the chambers water line. you cant just fly back out. i thought i could, and then he affixed this strange proboscis to his face, and then

thirdicus, the third demon, held up a clawed hand. silence! he cried. snoreglar, your incompetence knows no bounds. now, vacate this body, that a true demon might occupy it in your stead!

unfortunately, snoreglar had drowsed off halfway through thirdicuss invective. all this vapor was doing wonders for his airways. a more worldly demon might have recognized the scent of lavender.

snoreglar!

corazar held a finger to his lips. quiet! perhaps we can force him out.

thirdicus eyes gleamed. what do you propose?

corazarthe most cunning of the three, renowned for his wit and problemsolvingpunched the accursed appendage off the edge of the nightstand. it crashed to the floor and broke in half. its clear plastic bladder, still intact, swirled with the foul miasma that was their sleeping friend. 

whoa! thirdicus cried.

quiet! youll wake the human. corazar got down on his demon knees and began knocking the side of the bladder. he picked it up and shook it, shouting snoreglars name.

the human, meanwhile, remained asleep, the proboscis firmly in placeand as he looked on, thirdicus felt a pang of weary envy. to remain asleep through such a ruckus! to know peace in torment! whatever this appendage wasthis machine that allowed such slumberthirdicus made a mental note to check it out.

be sure to tell father! he says as he tries to fit his fat, disgusting body through the doorway. the greasy hair coming from his balding head leaves a wet spot on the back of the shitty leather jacket he got off the internet. he even had those shitty mall swords he got from the asian shop under his jacket, like he was trying to hide them. i guess it was time to tell his father, im sure this would go well.

"[wp] you were born with a strange power. whenever you are in immediate danger, time freezes until you move out of the way. one day, time freezes, but no matter how far you go...it doesnt unfreeze.","as a kid, i always thought the slomo effects in the movies were real, just that they should be even slower, like a time stop. how could they not be when thats what i experienced from time to time?

one day when i was 5, mum was cooking and i was bugging her to bring me to the zoo. distracted, her hand slipped and the pot with hot soup and all, started falling and then it stopped. i poked at the pot floating on top of my head, just out of reach. okay, that hurts! the burning sensations on the tips of my tiny fingers prompted me to move out of the way. and just it in time too, i thought as time resumed, the pot crashed into the floor with a loud clank and steaming soup spilled everywhere. shaken, mum hugged me tightly in her arms while calling it a miracle that i only got some blisters on my finger, not remembering at all that i shouldnt have been behind her. 

it was then that i started to realise these timestops only happen when im in real danger, not for small stuffs like a fall or a trip, or getting into trouble for sneaking out late at night. its for the actuallywouldcrippleme or kill me type of situations, a motorbike that could have ran over me because the rider was rushing the red light or a shove by someone behind whos lost their balance that might tumble me off a flight of stairs.

as i got older, being a teen with a morbid sense of humor, i always joked with dad that maybe i was meant to die when i was born but then time decided to stop for a moment and save me instead. and hed chuckle at that and reply, who knows, maybe this is your secret superpower, like that girl from life is strange. id punch him playfully and say, what?! rewinding time is so much cooler than this random timestop. this cant even get me out of maths class! and wed both laugh our ass off. i truly thought nothing of it and just continued my life like its an extra life jacket. my anxious nature never prompted me to put myself in danger despite the second layer of protection from death anyways. until one day...

were on a family trip to visit my grandparents thats 2 hours drive away, dads humming to some old country song on the radio and mums busy checking if she got all the stuff packed. i was nodding along to my sisters tirade of how this means she cant hang out with her bff tonight when suddenly the scenery stopped moving and i turned around and see my sister motionless, with her mouth halfopened. 

realising whats happening, i opened the car door and tried to move my sisters frozen frame but she wouldnt budge. panicking, i got out of the car and opened the drivers side door to try to get my dad out but no matter how hard i pull, he wouldnt move an inch. neither was i able to move mum. time was both kind and cruel, it gave me all the time in the world to try get them out, only for me to realise that nothing i do could save them. in the end, i tried running towards the roadside after turning the steering wheel to the side, hoping that this would make the car swerve to the other side and my family would survive the crash once time resumed. 

they would, right? they have to. 

in the fastest slomo of my life, time jolted into life as everything started moving at the lighting speed before my eyes  our car swerved to the side and flipped as a tanker narrowly passed by it. belatedly, the driver hit the brakes as the humongous being of oil and gas was forced to a halt with a screeching sound. i rushed towards where my family was stranded, while the sound of the drivers voice and 911s responders blurred into the background. 

ambulance, police, hospitals.. it was all a haze. the police delivered the news that my mum and sister was in icu but my dad did not survived the impact as he tried to take the brunt of the crash on his side of the car. sitting outside the icu unit with a warm blanket that could never seem to chase away the cold in my limbs, i realised too late that the precious blessing that i was gifted with? its actually a curse in disguise. the god of time only cared about my life, and mine alone, not anyone else, not even the people that i cherish the most.

time flies, mum and sister recovered. we managed to picked up the pieces of our family and trudged on, or it seemed so on the surface at least. its never said out loud but sometimes i felt like my family resented me for not saving dad. why couldnt you save him if you could stop time?, my sister once shouted at me from her hospital bed in tears. i tried explaining to her that it doesnt work like that but its impossible to explain the unexplainable. 

we grew apart, its as if an unbridgable chasm had opened between the rest of my family and me. i could feel it in the subdued dinners, the quiet glances that mum and my sister gave each other, the visits to dads grave that they did together and the awkward hugs mum gave me on the occasion im there. 

i started putting myself into danger, situations i wouldnt dreamed of getting myself into at all before. i figured that if time is so selfish in its benevolence, then my resentment of it would be justified and i might as well as make it regret saving me to begin with. i started wandering around shady places where incidents were known to happen, stepping in front of train tracks as the train honked by, making a playground out of the busiest road in town, all in hopes that perhaps time could take me and give me back my dad instead.

alas, the god of time was patient. it remained unprovoked by my shenanigans and still relentlessly saved me again and again by stopping the flow of time. and through its repeated, gentle guidance, i began to realise that this gift wasnt as big of a curse as i thought it was. rather than continue putting myself into unnecessary dangers, i started getting courses in first aid, then emt. i applied to become a firefighter and volunteered for rescue work where the risks were really high but help was desperately needed. 

i might not be able to save everyone, heck i cant even save my own dad, but if i can put one less person in the path of danger again, then im going to do so.

dude, look. seriously, this is nothing. we had to kill like eight deities last month on delhi. itll be years before we kill brahman and we still lost forty two men that day. and be thankful you didnt have to deal with any of those eldritch pieces of shit. i swear, people worship the weirdest things. bombing what looked like cthulhu was pretty fucking cathartic though. he laughed. i laughed. it was a nice moment, and i rarely have those. emboldened by his words, i pressed on.

hebrew lined the chains, and a slurry of english, hieroglyphs, hebrew and arabic was deeply inscribed onto each pillar. they stretched endlessly into the sky, white and black monoliths whose inevitable tops were hidden in the darkness above. the man chained to the pillars had long, matted hair. he seemed terribly emaciated, ribs poking out, grazing against his skin as if some caged animal, begging to be freed. the mere sticks he stood on shook from the weight of his body.

and yet he was just a silhouette. no discerning features other than those could be noted, as he was darker than the cave they stood in. bright white eyes gazed into mine, and for a fleeting second, i felt peace. such a deep, gentle peace, like i had truly understood my place in the world, and accepted everyone as my equal. i shook it off and walked away. couldnt be true. besides, im far above raj. hes anything but an equal.

alright! we got the coordinates, and the perimeter has been set! lets pack up!

confused, yet unwilling to disobey a commanding officer, i followed orders. hours, days, its hard to say how long the walk back was. what i can say, though, is that those guttural, animalistic grunts jesus made were etched into my mind. i still shook peace from my soul. i wont let any parasite infect me. not again.

the light blinded me, which was surprising. i expected it to be dark. had it only been a few hours? it felt like days of walking. i could swear we took two breaks to sleep. i could swear.

time passed pretty weird in there, huh? raj said, almost sensing what i felt. 

guess so. what happens now?

we wait. raj responded, smiling.

now miles from the cave, i heard chatter from the commanders radio, a sound of approval, a click, and silence. but that silence wasnt kept for long.

that deafening whistle cut through the air, and my mind, like a hot knife through flesh. the mountain seemed to warp, the explosions sending a wave of fire and debris outward, then sucking it inward. and then it happened. the mushroom cloud seemed to touch the sun. it mustve, since the sky darkened. i couldnt tell what theory i liked less. that the mushroom cloud had blocked out the sun.

or that the cloud was black."

she did tell me she loves me...and the blushing and...

"[wp] you know your child is hiding a relationship from you. you assured them that whoever it was they were with, they could bring them home. they come home with someone who is very much not a human being.","when alfred told his daughter, whoever they are, bring them home, he knew to prepare himself for a nonhuman. it helps when his god, lord elvari, is dating a member of his church committee. or having to partake in the wedding ceremonies of unholy unions of humans and deep ones from innsmouth.

dad, this is james, jessie signalled to the young man standing next to her. and this is my dad, alfred.

you [two together sound like trouble] alfred said, in an attempt to lighten the mood. he felt the heavy tension in the air. the trembling from james.

see, dad, this isnt what you think, jessie tried to reassure her father. im not dating one of the supernatural entities in this town. james is human.

on the surface.

alfred had interacted with elvaris minions long enough to know one. even if they wore a human disguise. but now was not the time to spill the beans.

so, he invited the young couple to sit for dinner. the topics drifted from how they met at summer camp to any plans they had for the future none so far. he asked how much they know about each other. but most of all, despite his apparent lack of experience, alfred needed to know if james genuinely loved his daughter, and was willing to be by her side for the rest of her life. which would be trivial to him if james was exactly what alfred thought he was.

jessie, do you mind doing the dishes? while i have a chat with james, one man to another?

sure, dad! she replied back nervously.

confident she was far away in the kitchen, he turned to james, who was shaking like a jello. struggling to maintain his human shape.

why the deception? alfred leaned in and whispered. were in innsmouth. jessie knows about shoggoths like you. i work with your kind all the time, with lord elvari. you might be able to mislead jessie, but not me.

its not intentional... the young shoggoth stammered, greyish goo and tentacles slipping through the crumbling disguise. she saw me in human shape, so i kept it. she didnt ask, so i didnt say.

promise me youre not secretly waiting to wear her skin, alfred squeezed a tentacle with an iron grip. or i will let your creator know you hurt the daughter of his head priest. i will tell lord elvari to turn you into jello and slurp you with his slime pudding.

no, no, i promise, james wobbled and bobbed his head. i really, really like her for real.

swear upon the name of the lord of innsmouth.

i swear! please, i love her and i will take care of her. i wont allow anyone or anything eat her or wear her skin, the shoggoth was still shaking. i will be on my best behavior or may the lord smite me.

good kid, he patted james. i will retire to my room and give you two some space. but if you do anything funny, i have my ways of knowing.

and with that, he performed one of those i have my eyes on you gesture before walking towards his study.




your father is scary, james, now back into his human look, remarked, when jessie came to sit next to him on the couch. i have never been terrified to sit near a human until he came along.

oh, james, its okay. he wont bite. dad is only worried about me. a bit of an overprotective father.

i see where lord elvari gets the overprotectiveness of his adopted kid jane, my lord almost killed me for pushing her into the kiddie pool once, james started to peel away at the human mask. so, before both of them turn me into a shoggoth snack to go with slime puddings, im confessing.

i tim, break off effect of spell. 

the guards quickly rise to their feet, attempting to cover their nakedness with their hands. 
others rush to bring blankets. 
they are hustled out of the room.

professor johnson, you see the creativity and skills of tim. what can he do if properly mentored and trained? it should be noted he learned this on his own. and use it in combat with no casualties.

it will be no different as what you are doing now! the other quickly chimes in.

this church is smart...  
not only will be a trail of paper that shows i work for them, but they also would ensure that its only them that i heal for, so more people would join their ranks.

i can hear all the people who know about me, and want me to take their names.
so i do exactly that.

i look at her face serene and pale and beautiful, until moments ago frozen for eternity. the embalmers did well. no trace remains of the dripping foam like thunderclouds, the bloody tears pouring across her face.

she waits for an answer, she waits for closure. anxious and unsure in death. whoever said that the dead could see all crimes laid bare? there is no peace beyond the grave. my master has seen to it.

a low smirk stretches on my face. we all have a role to play in the great game. some are pawns. some are sacrifices. some choose. some are chosen.

still, there is no comprehension in her unliving, beautiful eyes. for a long while, she does not ask, and i do not answer. blood freshly spilt at the gate sends the candles into another wave of trembling. in my minds eye, i see my brothers hurtle the guards to their doom in the moat, their death shrieks raising the alarm far too late.

the drawbridge falls with a distant crash that lifts the dust from the floor and returns the smoke from the ceiling. at last, she begins to understand, as i imagine the clatter of claws on cobblestone. somewhere, a bell begins to clang.

more life will be snuffed out this night. yours was merely the prologue to the masters grand designs.

her eyes shut and then open again. how long?

since the beginning. since the grassy shores of the lake. from our childhood, throughout the long years, my dagger was always ready to strike. whenever, wherever the call might come.

a single, marring tear leaks forth, trailing blood down to her lips. the first candles go out without a sound.

was it ever real?

more candles vanish, plunging the room to the midnight dark. i step back into shadow, a finger upon my lips. sleep, my queen. justice is served. the time has come. my people are free once more. the future, your people, your realm, are no longer your concern."

"[wp] the war was a hundred years ago, yet you still find yourself startling easy. unsecured cargo hitting the inside your hull sounds awfully similar to a boarding vessel. youre about to disregard the sounds when you realize the ships mass has increased.","tharass was unsure of what it exactly it was. it matched no description in any database they had access to. it was roughly spherical, faintly glowing  although that was visibly fading  and appeared to be biological. 

in fact, it looked like an egg. 

how exactly it had come to be deposited in their cargo bay, tharass did not know. but they were deeply curious, and assumed it had something to do with the strange glow and the storm.

tharass compiled all collected data and  tentatively extending an antennae despite the storm  pulsed out the data packet to the nearest corporation relay station at maximum strength. they werent sure if the signal would get through the storm, but it followed official guidance.

then they returned to examining the egg. 

it was  presumably  extradimensional. given the uncertain method of its arrival, either it, or its parent creature, was able to move between dimensions.

and given the size of the egg, its parent creature must be quite large. perhaps not as large as tharass, but significantly larger than a terrestrial being could reasonably be.

the egg itself seemed to be quite thick, and capable of selfstabilising. as a heavier gust of the storm buffeted tharass the egg rolled and bumped an interior wall again. this time though, there was no fear. they knew what made the sensors trip. and tharass felt... they werent sure what they felt. responsible was probably the best way of putting it. wherever  whatever  this eggs mother was, the egg itself was now inside tharass. and so it was their responsibility.

extending a loading tendril out, tharass wrapped it around the egg, and pulled it into a corner, where they held it snugly. 

this egg... was cargo. in a sense. and, if it was cargo, it had to be protected.

tharass thought about this some more. the egg... was not cargo. cargo was things, this egg was  or would be  someone. 

so this egg... more important than cargo. and tharass was its caretaker. at least until it skipped dimensions again, or its parent entity came in search of it.

and if tharass was its caretaker... then it was tharass egg. at least until it hatched.

tharass decided they liked that. and that they felt... warm.

and so, the former warship sailed the tumultuous currents of the storm, clutching an egg of unknown origins. 

and tharass was happy. 

the rest of that voyage passed in oddly contented bliss. a wholly new sensation to the warship.

it would not be for several voyages, long after the egg had been removed for study by the corporation and shifted right out of their laboratory, that tharass felt a bump in their cargo hold and realised... they werent afraid anymore."

the boy looked down from his seat on the cottage roof. dark hair covered the top half of his face, hiding the pair of eyes that few dared meet. not for appearance, for the deep brown irises were hardly uncommon. what was though was the intensity that shone within. like he held back a presence that would rattle anyone to their core. like he could see into a persons innermost thoughts, and know whatever they tried to hide.

it was a look he had had since he was born. his birth had come during the day of black sun, an auspicious event. yet it was no fanfare that came with his arrival. no, it was screams. screams from his mother, laying eyes on him for the first time. she had screamed and screamed, trying to escape despite the cord connecting them. she called him monster, the first name he was given.

his father had taken him nonetheless. he had brought jessot home, and given him the name of his fathers father. there he was raised, his mother vanishing not two days after his brith. a boy more comfortable alone with his thoughts, who always listened, yet seldom spoke. a boy who leapt from the roof without fear, stepping inside to find his father.

henron watched his son enter, walking quietly. he worried for him, as all parents did. he hoped jessot would grow up happy. not necessarily rich and famous, but happy. he hoped he would find someone nice to settle with, and have a trade he enjoyed.

but for now, the most important worry was dinner. a simple spread of stew and bread, a staple of their home. jessot sat opposite his father, as they shared the meal. henron filled the air with his voice, talking about the farm, his carving hobby, even gossip from the village. and jessot listened, absorbing it all in silence.

it was only as they began to clear that something changed. a knock at the door, making henron frown. he left to answer it, leaving his son to carry on clearing.

yet jessot stopped to the sound of raised voices. he set down the empty pot, quietly padding out to find the commotion. there he saw his father arguing with a pair of heavy set men. both bore long healed scars, as one spoke with a sneer. shame you lack hospitality, friend. but maybe youll open your coin purse instead?

henron opened his mouth to shout back, but was interrupted by a quiet voice behind. one that was seldom heard, and shook with authority. judgement.

the two men froze, as henron turned to look. jessot walked up, staring directly at the two. the thugs started shaking, trembling beneath his gaze. he watched them without blinking, as they slowly sank to the ground, twitching silently.

finally they stopped. jessot looked up at henron, as his father spoke breathlessly. what... was that?

and his son replied, in a voice far older than he should have. i judged them, and found them wanting."

yeah, as many of your family as i can fit. adults, kids, the women, everybody.

an youre gonna drop us all off in a nice neighborhood and just, what, have us go to town on the joint?

yeah yeah, its got a nice stream going through it and everything. plenty of trees, got kind of a swampy spot, its perfect for your folk.

so whats the catch? nobody does this kinda deal for free.

elves. theres a bunch of elves there that are really pissing me off.

"[wp] youve always loved science and tech as a kid. then life happened and you couldnt pursue a higher education, so now you just tinker with your hobby in the garage on the weekends. one day, a stranger comes to your door and yells at you do you have any idea what youve just done!","the time that zoe got to spend in the her garage tinkering with different things was time that she cherished, she had always been one to enjoy science in school but then after high school her parents died and she couldnt really afford to go to college and take care of her younger brother, so she sacrificed her dreams to help her brother out.

while she tinkered she tried to create things that would help others out, things that could serve a purpose, but it was also just to get her creativity released before she had to get back to her boring office job on monday, the only job that a twenty three year old girl could really get that wasnt fast food or retail. as she tinkered with the generator she was building, something that could be used to power an entire neighborhood off just garbage in a small compact from it let out a longer whine and then a hiss before it shot out an entire electro magnetic pulse that flicked the entire citys power supply off, that was until it sputtered to life and slowly the power started coming back on, she had done it, shed created wireless power that was created by garbage. and then she heard a knock at the door. 

going to answer the door she saw an angry man in a suit with two equally angry police officers at his side. it turns out when youre the epicenter of a town wide emp someone will notice. do you have any idea what you just did?! the man exclaimed angrily. before he noticed that the power was coming back on slowly around the neighborhood. 

yeah uh sorry about that. zoe spoke, as the man looked astonished. 

how do you all have power the emp wiped everything out and fried everything? he inquired, the edge in his voice dissipating. it took showing him and then explaining everything and demonstrating to actually get him to believe what happened. from then on though slowly more and more people wanted to get a slice of the cheap power option, which in turn led to a bigger generator and zoe held all the rights to it, though she wouldnt let that get to her head and only held it so that others couldnt profit off of it. and that was how the countrys power grid became reliant on the trash that humans created."
"[wp] if you could remain calm you could escape. as long as your do not run, the creature wont find you. but for every second you delay, the exit gets further away.","a distant door slammed. chuckling, you lifted your head to get a better whiff and inhaled deeply. 

adrenaline. it has such a sweet yet sour scent to it. combined with that of sweat, and it was a potent, heady mix. so much so you could almost taste that unmistakable odour  fear. the note always gets them going. right now, their pupils will be dilating and blood will rushing to their extremities, ready to run. with your next breath, you savour it, close your eyes, and start to focus. 

listening intently, you hear as that gentle rhythmical heart beat begins to accelerate. a strong firm pulsation.this one must be young and healthy. crouching down, you place your forehoof on the floor and wait. within moments you feel the vibrations of their footsteps through the stone  

light steps, cautious. they were almost... meticulous. planned. female? no. too sure footed. a young male. well disciplined. confident. you quickly notice there was no jangling of buckles. he must have good quality sandals. aristocracy or nobility perhaps? how exciting  it had been quite some time since a prince crossed the threshold. 

with a grin, you realise this one might have some semblance of intelligence  the rich usually do. he may actually put up a decent fight. you wonder what weapons he carries. they say that the pen is mightier than the sword so perhaps this one thought to map out the labyrinth in some way as he walks. very few ever seemed to work out that escaping was just as important as finding you. 

hopefully he wasnt such a fool as the last person. she brought a bow and arrow of all things! with so many tight corridors and turns, she had barely drawn it back before you tore her head off. definitely too stupid to deserve more of a battle from me. such an insult of a sacrifice. king minos had been lazy with his selection of that one. unsurprising. she was number 13 after all. youd made your dissatisfaction known that year, by casting a drought across crete for her.

standing back up, you stretch. a low rumbling escapes your lips. the shadows of your horns dance across the ceiling and for a moment, you enjoy watching the flicker of the torch flames that cast them. after a moment you decide it was time. letting out an almighty roar, you signal to this new human. the hunt has begun and this minotaur is out for blood."
[wp] youre life is a bit shitty since quite a time. youve been taking walks in the forest and talking to that big rock of your problems. weirdly enough you feel great after that and its kinda a ritual now. one day a rabbit on the rock says the rocks are silent because the trees are listening,"the world had shrunk to the size of a scuff mark on the floorboards. it was dark and commashaped, just inside the doorway, and leo often found his entire day snagged on it. it was the last mark mayas hiking boot had made on his world before shed left it for good. his mothers voice, thin and stretched with forced optimism, would drift up the stairs. leo? how was your walk? and leo, staring at the mark from the landing, would just say, fine.

his life wasnt fine. it was a shallow, grey basin of existence, and the only drain was a narrow path that led through the eungella rainforest. every saturday, hed walk the familiar track, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a dull anaesthetic. his destination was always the same a colossal, mosscovered basalt boulder, perpetually cool in the shade of the canopy.

he called it the rock.

here, the words he couldnt say to his mother, to his friends, to the god he no longer believed in, would spill out of him in a raw, ragged whisper. hed tell the rock about the scuff mark. hed describe the specific shade of grey the sky had been that day. hed confess, over and over, the crushing guilt that felt like a physical weight on his chest. he was the one whod shown maya the trails, whod ignited her love for the wild places that had ultimately taken her. the rock, solid and unjudging, would absorb it all. the ritual was the only thing that made sense.

he was midconfession one tuesday, his voice cracking on the memory of the phone call hed had to make, when a flicker of movement on the rocks surface broke his trance. a rabbit, its fur the colour of dried grass, sat twitching its nose, its dark eyes fixed on him. leo fell silent, annoyed at the intrusion.

then the rabbit spoke, its voice a soft, rustling sound, like dry leaves skittering across stone. the rocks are silent because the trees are listening.

leos breath hitched. he blinked, certain he was hallucinating, a new symptom of a mind worn thin by grief. when he looked again, the rabbit was gone. the forest was as it had always been, the only sound the sharp crack of a whipbird. but the silence felt different now. it felt attentive."
"[wp] you have been hired by the kingdom to rescue a dragon that has been kidnapped by an evil princess. yes, you read that right.","if i am anything, a consummate professional is one of them, and any adventurer that isnt is an idiot. we are, by way of profession, patsies we take the blame for things that others wish not to.

the evil king a bit over has kidnapped someone, send adventurers, the nearby land holding paramilitary force is ransoming you, send adventurers, is the advisor to the crown a demon in disguise but you have no proof, you get the gist.

any group that doesnt understand that fundamental part of the profession, and gets angry about possible consequences, will usually find themselves out of work.

...or actually becoming the villains they believe they are being framed as.

but, in my time, of all the reasons i have led a group to deal with corrupt neighboring nobility, this has got to be the most idiotic thing ever.

when we were hired to rescue the kidnapped treasury keeper of our client i wasnt expecting much. when told they were kidnapped by order of the neighboring kingdoms crowned princess i was caught off guard.

when told the treasurer was actually a dragon, well i think punching myself in the face to make sure our mage wasnt fucking with me was warranted.

master ogaronous, is a pacifist you see, one of the reasons he works in our treasury actually, he has a hoard without having to do so by violent means.

so after much drinking, and one of the weirdest infiltration missions ever involving, i had no idea our large orc had such an impeccable singing voice, we were now on our way back to our client. disguised dragons, and one princess with the mouth of a sailor,  in tow.

you  do you have any    idea what you have done!?!?!

our archer, tuning out the young idiot made an inquiry.

so, sir, what do we do with her, exactly?

our mage gave his thoughts, while still tending the many scratch marks on his face.

i say a long walk, off the side of a high cliff would be very appropriate in this situation.

i shut down the conversation before it became a competition as usual.

we keep her for a day or two, get our charge back home, and then ransom her back to her father for extra pay. i gave a look over my shoulder at everyone, that is the usual play, and i will not hear any conversations about cursed transformation, or human hand puppets, from anyone.

the mage and orc gave disappointed looks.

i then turned to our actual charge.

no offense master dragon, but for future references i decided to give some advice to the centuries older creature, that for some reason made his human disguise the most perfect story book example of a young, bachelor, pretty boy, i have ever seen, change up the disguise, if we are called back here again for this i will charge extra."
"[wp] youre a villain. you steal things. you have a territory that you rule with an iron fist. you live in the sewers, and have caused several people to disappear down here. youre the bad guy. so why, pray tell, is the city sending down ambassadors to discuss your management of public services?","[part 2 of 2]


george was the younger of the two. a man in his mid twenties who held a confident swagger, despite having just wandered through a sewer. the youthful confidence even spreading to his haircut, which was a stylish brown bob that perched atop his skull. the older man, adam, however, lacked any of that confidence. he was a man who had been beaten down by life, giving him deep circles beneath his eyes and a slight slouch to his appearance. while they both wore similar suits, it was easy to tell who took more care of their clothing, with georges neatly ironed and washed, while adams lacked any of that care.
 
hey, man. whats up? i love how cool your place looks. is that a nighty sky painting? he said, with all the enthusiasm of a sleazy car salesman, trying to coax someone into buying a crappy 2003 hyundai that would fall apart as soon as the contract was signed.
starry night. ratty corrected, gazing at the painting. he disliked people like george. people who believed they could be everybodys friend. that positive cando attitude that was almost insulting. it was as if they saw everyone as a sucker, that was just dying to be their pal. ratty couldnt have wanted anything less than to be the friend of someone with the personality of an excitable dog.

right, right. george nodded. before he could say anything else, adam stepped in.
 
not a terrible place for a man who lives in the sewers. im adam, and hes george. he said, tone formal, with no hint of warmth behind it. as if his mom had pushed him out of her body while reciting her tax returns.
 
it isnt bad, ratty agreed. if one had to describe the home, they would call it a cute home in a bad neighborhood. it had a kitchen, bedroom, tv, and even a recreation of a famous painting. the base itself was perfect, it was just the location that killed it.
 
sensing that ratty wouldnt ask them why they were here, adam continued. we are here on behalf of the citys waterways division.
 
here to remove me? ratty snarled, having expected this day to come, eventually.
 
no. george, you want to tell him why were here?
 
yes, sir. well, on behalf of the citys waterways division, we are here to present you with a certificate for outstanding service to the community. its an honor, mr. volkina. i mean, mr. ratty? wait, which is your birth name? cause i said its volkina, but adam was like. it doesnt matter, grumble, grumble
 
adam and ratty made eye contact, a brief middle aged man to man stare that silently said. young people. ratty snatched the certificate before george could prattle on any longer. why would my mother call me ratty? nevermind. yes, thank you. is that all?
 
youre not going to ask why we gave you that certificate? adam, a man who rarely asked questions, had expected this to be a lot harder than it was. that urging him to do the unthinkable and actually show a crumb of interest in the situation. 
 
not really? i kind of just want you gone. is it a trap? he asked, shaking the flimsily laminated paper, only for it to make a small, wibble wobble noise as it shook.
 
a trap? no, not at all. were so proud of you, thats why we had to give you the certificate. youre doing so much for the community and everyone is super stoked to have you looking after things, so keep that close. george smiled.
 
so, it is a trap? ratty mumbled, assuming george had done the worst acting job in the history of acting.

no. since youve been down here, our city has never been cleaner. no busted pipes, no clogged systems and overall everything been running a lot smoother. thats why the city has given you this certificate. its their way of thanking you for everything youve done. no traps, no tricks, and no tomfoolery.
 
you realize im maintaining it solely to keep my base functional. clogged systems mess up my escape routes.
 
whatever the reasoning. we still appreciate you keeping things sanitary. if you check the back of that certificate, youll see we even stapled a check to it. adam moved two of his fingers, making a flipping motion.
 
staple it? george sheepishly scratched at his neck, and when ratty flipped it over, he would find the check stuck inside the laminated certificate, with george laminating the two pieces of paper together.
 
adam groaned, thinking about how he could solve his colleagues mistake. well get someone to transfer the money into your account.
 
ratty read over the numbers on the check. 10000, more than he had earned in the last three months. hey, will i get more of these if i keep maintaining things?
 
i cant say for certain, since thats above my payroll, but if i had to guess, i would say yes. councils love saving money, and having you down here is a lot cheaper than sending our own men down to do the same work. if you leave, the cost of getting the resources to do what youve done would be at least six times that a month. maybe more.
 
hm. ok, you may leave.
 
right. thanks for hosting us. what a lovely home. george stepped forward. love the place, ever think about getting some plants in here? i know a guy who knows a guy, who knows a lot of flowers that dont mind the darkness. he stated, stepping onto the floor, leaving a dirty print as he left the plastic.
 
when ratty grumbled, adam hooked georges collar beneath his fingers. sorry! he said on his colleagues behalf. as the two left, the plastic scrunched beneath their feet, filling the room with the sound of twisted plastic until they left the home.
 
ratty cleaned the mess before returning to his chair, squeaking when he sat on the spring. he rubbed his backside before perching himself on the edge of the chair, reading over the certificate. maybe i can cut back on my crime if theyre paying me? its a lot less work. he mused.

all the cowardly clerks start running for a back door. 
i turn as the first guard reaches me, laying hands on me. 
guard 1 listen here fellow 

i turn my head, flick my hand. guard 1 flies backwards into the wall. landing with a thud. 
i flick my fingers, guards 2  3 , smash against each other crumpling to the floor. 

the vein on my head throbs, all the computers in the county clerks office explode. 
i strut out the door. 
vending machines empty their contents. parking meters wilt and bend over to the side walk. 

i think to my super ai , sindy ,  send out the new system to replace the local government computer system, setup, have ai bob run operations and storage.  replace all employees with new pleasant robots. 

thinking sindy lets buy that decommissioned base outside the city.  
sindy responds john there is a silent alarm at your bank, apparently it is being robbed, i have deployed the robot squad. but you are around the corner . 

i think back  yes yes, i am on my way. that is where i keep my gold.

i break into a sprint. 

i arrive at the doors, there is a uhaul truck parked half on and off the curb. 

i pull open the doors, pausing to catch my breath. i yanked the doors open.  i strolled into the lobby. 

5 individuals dressed all in black with ski masks covered faces, holding a variety of weapons. one with a male voice was yelling for the tellers to empty their drawers, while a female voice was screaming, who is the manager.  a individual by the doors noticed me. starts to raise his shotgun barrel to point at me. the others are occupied with the employees and customers of my bank. 

i flick my wrist, shotgun guy crumples to floor. 
i yell  stop, how dare you!

every one falls silent and turns their attention to me. 

good, vein throbbing, waving both hands, like i am conducting a symphony.  i lift up the four of the robbers simultaneously. slamming them into the ceiling then down to the floor, and up and down many times. till i heard someone vomit . i figured i might have over done it a bit. as i let their crumpled bodies rest on the floor. 
the robot squad arrived, my robots began escorting customers then employees out to parking lot. 
the police arrived as i walked away. 

i glanced up in the sky, is that miss marvelous. guess better to be late than never. 

i think to sindy, make sure the vault stays locked down  cant have the law and miss marvelous sniffing around my gold  

where are all the buses ? 

sindy replies someone stole all the diesel for the buses and trucks 

i get angry as i have to walk everywhere now. ok sindy put out we need more employees for our new hydrogen fuel plant and for our hydrogen fuel buses. i just dont have enough workers to build.  

sindy asks  have you decided what you want to do about henchmen, i mean employees healthcare? 

i think at sindy yes, we are going to hostile takeover memorial hospital, beef staff with robots and all those veterans we hired at job fair. all employees get free care as long as they treat at our hospital.   

sitting in n my office, i say out loud. sindy, i want barren land around the base we bought. i have an idea how to make it fertile for crops.   

sindy asks do you want to buy it? 

i replied  steal, foreclose or pay as little as possible.  

sindy says, john , miss marvelous has just arrived.

tell security to allow her in  i said. 

i sit up , straighten up my attire."
"[wp] i think whoever put the rock  the stone should be king, not whatever chucklefuck pulls it out. i assume whoever put the sword that makes you king into a rock doesnt want the position. i think the rock should be king because it held the sword the longest.","were back at kingdom the decision, as the world waits to find out who our next king will be.

that is correct, and we had a huge shock. while the divine right of the gods has led our king von to rule just and true for years, a new surprise has come into the land, as earlier this week billy, a young peasant boy, managed to take the sword from the stone, the legendary proof the gods have now smiled upon him and chose him to lead.

yes, this has polled well among many of the peasant bloc we have asked, though many still believe king von was chosen by the gods to rule them a benefit of the serfs being taught nothing except to worship gods and the nobility as their betters.

yes...and a recent whistlestop for billys campaign did not go well, lets get a shot of that... the scene shifted to a pub, where billy was holding the sword aloft.

...um, i wasnt trying to be the king, i just thought this sword was nice and the woman i was arranged to be married dared me to lift it...do i really have to be the king? the scene shifted back to the commentators.

a bit of humility by the man the gods have chosen, our future king.

dont be so sure about that recent polls have a dark horse in the race, as some believe the lady of the lake should be given the throne, as the longstanding keeper of the sword and who put it in the stone. lets go to her for more info. the scene cut to a lake, as an ethereal beauty was being interviewed.

...for the last time, i cannot rule mortals. i am the vessel the gods have chosen to find the one who must rule your land by divine right, and cannot be the one to rule myself. the sword has chosen that boy, and he is to be your leader. the scene went back to the commentators...

oh, and a surprise here. the lady of the lake has dropped out of the race and given her support to billy. we need to get some information from king von about this huge development! the scene went to the kingdom, as king von stood to his people.

my fellow subjects, this is an example of how poor our choice is. weve heard for years from the people in this kingdom that some woman in a lake putting a sword inside some stone for a random person to grab is a terrible way to determine a system of government, and now that i could risk losing my power, i hear you. i hope the people are smart enough to know that, as your better, i am the only one worthy to lead you all, not the person who holds the sword... the scene went back to the commentators.

that was strong words...and now, we have exit polls for the kingdom, and we have a decision as the one who held the sword the longest, the rock will now be our new king! as, of course, this cannot be our leader, dwayne johnson has been drafted into leading the kingdom...kind of surprising since he was not running and we do not believe mr. johnson has been born yet, but thats how giving power to the people can go, i guess..."

"[wp] a dragon gains more power from the value of its horde, so why is this dragon with only a few pieces of broken adventuring gear as its horde so strong?","the bigger a dragons hoard, the stronger they were. that was the law of the world. however every law had an exception.

in the middle of a continent, at the edge of a great kingdom. one sky blue dragon perched atop its mountain. its wings were so vast they stretched from one horizon to the other and its mighty tail curled all around the mountain and into the plains bellow.

one day after sunset, a star was falling down from the sky towards the kingdom. it lit up the sky aflame and turned night into day with its glow.

with a breath, the dragon blew out the star like a candle.

scared of this power, the king sent a knight to scour the mountain and find the dragons hoard. the loyal knight left on his quest.

he walked for six days and six nights until he saw the end of the dragons tail. the thinnest part was as tall as an old tree and so the knight had to climb over it to proceed. the next coil of the dragons tail was twice as tall, and the next even taller than that.

maybe the dragon mountain was made of gold, and that is where its power came from.

on his journey the knight witnessed the dragons might twice more. once, the ground underneath his feet quaked and cracked and bellowed and the knight climbed up the dragons tail to avoid being swalowed up by the shifting ground. the tremmors lasted until the dragon slammed down its tail with unimaginable might and silenced the earth itself.

maybe its mountain was made of diamonds and gems and thats what gave the dragon his power.

another time a storm raged from the sea, blackened skies crawled on spindly lightning legs and terrible winds chucked trees around as if they were mere splinters. the knight hid in between the dragons scales again for safety. 

from his small cave he saw the dragon beat its wings once and it blew away the crawling storm into nothing.

what precious thing is the dragons hoard made out of to give it such strength?

finally he reached the top and there he saw the dragons hoard. a few peices of old broken adventuring gear, much like his own. they endured the journey and protected him from danger true, but they were nothing more than trash at this point. this was not the dragons hoard.

lost and confused and in despair he looked up and asked the dragon.

mighty dragon. what is the source of your strength? what is your hoard?

the dragon lowered its head down from the clouds and turned one great white eye to search for him. the dragon was so massive and he was so small after all. it was like someone trying to find the ant that called them. they sat in silence for a moment.

soon, however, the dragon spoke. i will show you my hoard, grab onto my scales. 

the knight did as told and then the dragon lifted its head up and up and up, high above the clouds. and then he went even higher, above the skies and perched atop the moon.

this is my hoard. gaze upon it and wonder

bellow or rather in front of them was the world.

all of it. 


with every blade of grass and every king and queen who ever lived and will ever live, with every tresure buried and discovered. with every conqueror and war and every brother and sister and friend and enemy.

[the end.]"
[wp] a young blacksmiths apprentice stumbles upon a shard of a fallen star. they then use this shard to forge a blade unlike any other,"once upon a time, the sun shone in the sky every hour of every day. it was so bright that the stars and the moon could not be seen.

however, there was one very bright star. it shone brighter than any of the other stars in the sky, so much that it could be seen as well. the sun was jealous, and using its great might, flung the star to the lands below, such that it may be the only bright object in the sky.

now the star wept, for it could not be seen while on the ground. its cries attracted the attention of an apprentice of a blacksmith, who came to look for it.

why are you crying? the apprentice asked.

i am no longer useful, since i have fallen from the heavens, the star replied.

ill make you useful again, the apprentice said.

and so the star went with the blacksmiths apprentice to his forge, where the blacksmith hammered and polished it a thousand times, until it gleamed brighter even than when it was in the heavens. 

now the sun saw this and was again very jealous. it tried to burn even brighter, turning the forests into fire and drying up the lakes. the apprentice was afraid, but the starsword spoke.

for the favor you have done to me, i will now repay my debt.

and so the blacksmiths apprentice swung the starsword towards the sun, and with a great flash, the sun was frightened and ran behind the horizon. 

and so the sky darkened and the moon and stars are allowed to shine and be noticed. 

every morning the sun tries to take its place again, but the apprentice would brandish the sword right as it reaches its zenith, causing it to flee once again, disappearing in a flash of green light as the starsword is swung. and that is why we have the day and the night.



so how did the apprentice live from then until now?

uh, i dunno. hes immortal. go to sleep."
"[wp] for all the years theyd been heroes, the one enemy they couldnt defeat was an angry sixyearold girl.","arghh, get baby off! the avalanche whipped around in a frenzy, as a giggling child clung on to his beard. for all the times hed taken blows from outerdimensional entities, this was the most pain the giant hero had felt. a man in a red spandex suit stepped forward, trying to grab at the girl.

stop moving, you oaf, youre gonna

crash

the giant fell against an expensivelooking walnut cupboard, tearing through it and the wall behind. from the debris the little girl hopped out. she looked at red tights.

im bored. i wanna watch tv.

the hero glanced at another hero, a woman in a suit designed to look like a puma. she shook her head.

jane said no screen time for ashley after eight. it messes with her sleep.

ashley throwing a fit, and feet, at her.

i wanna watch tv! i wanna watch tv!

ow, ow! stop that, hey this costumes made of real ok, fine, you get an ipad, and thirty minutes max!

as the girl browsed through tiktok, red tights brought a hand to his face. who knew theyd be defeated by a sixyear old.

"[wp] omg, its so hot! your colleague says as you shiver in the bright sunlight coming through the window. maybe you could find an excuse to wear a scarf or something to warm yourself up.","what is going on?
sure the sunlight is shining on us...but it is winter!
i am freezing in like a dozen layers of clothes and...
wait.
is she...undressing?
i watch horrified as my colleague, no, not just her, but most in the office start undressing.
they shiver, and yet still all complain about it being too hot.
what is going on?


i try to convince them, to wake them up, but nothing works.
they sit there shivering, some already turning blueish, working in their underwear.
i go to the other floors in the building, and it is happening everywhere.
i check social media...and nothing.
does this mean...
i am the only one unaffected?
what is going on?
before i could panic more, a colleague falls to the floor, convulsing.


i rush over, and cover her with some coats i found.
then i rush to the thermostat and put it to the maximum of 35 degrees.
before calling the ambulance.
a few dozen minutes later, i am sweating bullets, while the others are now complaining...
it is too cold?
i watch them dress up, sweating, but still wanting more layers of clothes.
the ambulance is nowhere to be seen.
what the fuck is going on?


i leave...and nobody really reacts.
they do their jobs automatically, while complaining about the temperature.
the same thing is happening outside, as many people walk around nigh naked.
i get home and close the doors, and shut the blinds.
i saw things...
i search the web for clues, but nothing.
and then...i get a message.
you are in the wrong world.
if you want help, come here. it says, and attached is an address.
great.
the plot intensifies, but couldnt it have remained thin? boring?
i sigh, dress up and leave.
it is not like i have a choice...i cant really stay in this reverse world, can i?"
[wp] why do people find the four ears thing to be so weird? the catgirl flicked her top pair back in annoyance. centaurs have six limbs and ive never seen anyone ask one of them about it.,the use of spoiler tags here was interesting
[wp] the crown prince is kidnapped and kept in a cell but instead of being scared or even angry is just taking the time to catch up on sleep mumbling in what seems like horror of taxes and paperwork.,"when they captured prince pietro, they expected nobility. pride. maybe tears. what they found was silence.

in the damp cell, he slept like a child. arms crossed over his chest. face serene. almost content. every now and then, he mumbled in his sleep. no more audiences. no more decrees. no more pretending.

on the third day, a guard stormed in, club in hand, kicking the cell door open. alright, prince. playtimes over. pietro didnt move. the guard stepped closer. misjudged his footing. slipped.

that was his last mistake.

pietro sprang like a waking serpent. his legs wrapped around the mans neck. one twist, sharp and sudden, and a crack echoed off the stone walls. the guard twitched. the club dropped. pietro picked it up slowly, methodically. the man was still breathing, barely. pietro crouched beside him and stared, like a child watching an insect squirm. you woke the only man who actually wanted to be here, he whispered. then he drove the club into the mans mouth. once. twice. three times. until the sound stopped. until there was only pulp where a face used to be. he didnt blink. just licked his lips. calmly. deliberately.

the second guard rushed in, sword raised. pietro hurled the club without looking. it smashed into the mans knee. he collapsed, screaming. pietro was on him in seconds, straddling his chest. two fingers slid into the mans eye sockets. pushed until they disappeared into wet, soft darkness. he tilted his head slightly as he worked. like he was listening to music. they always said i was dangerous when i got bored, he murmured. i guess they were right.

the last one ran.

pietro followed, barefoot. silent. smiling. he caught him before the stairs. grabbed his hair. sank his teeth into the mans ear and ripped it off. as the man screamed, pietro crushed his nose with both thumbs. then drove his head into the stone wall. over and over. until everything stopped.
he watched the blood run. spat out the ear.

my father never understood, he said, wiping his face with his sleeve. i didnt want the crown. i just needed an excuse.

then he walked back to the cell. closed the door from the inside. lay down. folded his arms. and went back to sleep."
"[wp] you fool! the kindest people are the most dangerous. by making them stop being kind, you have no idea what horror you might have unleashed!","there are three things all wise men fear the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.

and woe betides the fool who, on a moonless night, sailing in the stormy seas, angers the god who chose to be kind.



if you valued your life, youd stop insulting my god, the boatman sneered. the storm is not his fault, but it is by his blessing we stay afloat and not sink beneath the tides. did you not listen to the old tales of the great and ancient lord elvari i told you on the way here? you have been full of complaints from since you stepped foot in his town.

what kind of sea god cant do anything about tidal waves? the grumpy tourist shouted. calm the seas, moron! look, i dont need this socalled kindness of drifting in stormy seas! i need good weather, calm waters! didnt that tentacle dork say he was a good god?



he wasnt born a good god. he was born in the shadows, not in light. a prophesied great evil that would plunge the world in madness and darkness. but after years of spiralling into senseless violence, he chose to do good.

what then, separates him from the other good gods of holy pantheons? they were born to be good. they were told they were good from since their conception. but a dark god who chose good over evil? that is a deliberate choice. one that can be undone.



oh yeah? the tourist wasnt convinced. how scary can some teasipping terror can be? hey, is he scared of onestar reviews on his website?

the boatman didnt say a word.

when are we actually going to see some abominations of the sea? are they all hiding? is this a scam? i paid good money to see leviathans, not get my boat rocked! the man hasnt stopped ranting. you see this harpoon? clear this stupid storm so i can spear one of them sea beasts for photos to post on my instagram! tell elvari to get his ass here and do something about the weather? is this out of his domain? does he only cover that small dinky town of innsmouth? is his influence that tiny?

do you know why an ancient god would choose to stay in one small fishing town? when once, he had spread his influence across multiple dimensions? the boatman was speaking, but his voice was calm, yet deeper than the depths of the abyss, his eyes glowing a vivid violet. because he tries to limit the spread of his madness. because hes trying to be kind. in doing so, he limits the insanity to zany silliness. but when you take that away, all that is left for you is endless horror.

the boatman snapped back to his senses. the rich tourist who booked his boat did not. with every crash of tidal waves, the man would scream and stab at the air. yelling incoherently about dangers from every corner. when he was out of breath, hed collapse on the floor and sob uncontrollably, all while clawing his eyes out and bleeding from his orifices.

for he saw nothing but endless horror of an eldritch deity who decided to stop being kind for a minute.

"[wp] for years, a demon has taken care of and raised abandoned children she found. today, angelic wings started to grow out of her back.","i look in the mirror, as the kids scream bloody murder outside, and inside my mansion.  
i sigh.  
for eons i have taken care of, and raised abandoned children i found during my travels across hell, fae lands, and the myriad mortal worlds.  
it wasnt easy.  
for one as a duchess of hell, i have quite a few contenders that would do anything to either kill me, or marry me,or both.  
and two...many kids are not demons, yet raised in hell, so i had to spend a lot to make sure the miasma isnt corrupting them.  
and now this...in the mirror, angelic wings, budding, but still, angelic, are slowly growing out of my back.  
great.

  
i hide them under a black tank top, as i try my best to will them to fold, and go downstairs.  
the humans and elves are waging war again, as the demon kids try the best to mediate the problems.  
the few dwarves are busy building wooden weapons, and selling to the highest bidder, while the 2 giant young ones, are shivering, hidden in a corner, afraid.  
i clap, and they all stop.  
mother! they scream, rushing towards me.  
i laugh, as i raise them all into the air with my magic, and take them inside, where i prepared food already.  
sure, i am a strong demon, and could have servants, and maids, and whatnots...  
but after a few kids went missing eons ago...  
i dont employ anyone anymore.

  
mom! have you heard about oaken leaf?! an elven lass asks.  
i nod.  
she left hell for the azure springs realm. there she was hired as a personal tutor for an elven princess, and i hear shes now courted by 2 princes, and 1 noble.  
shes doing great. i smile.  
what about duzuff?! a dwarf burps.  
i flick his forehead.  
manners. also, duzuff is now the chief blacksmith of a vampire viscount down south from us. from what i hear, all the vampire blacksmiths fear and respect him. i say.  
they laughed, saying thats so duzuff!, i smiled.

  
over the years, the kids i took care of, and raised left, and spread all across the various worlds, and regions.  
do you ever miss them? one of the human kids asks.  
i nod.  
yes. they are my children, just like you are. i say, and they laugh, and thank me for the food, before going to wash the dishes.  
good kids.  
i leave, watching the many portraits hanging on the walls...all portraits of the kids.  
i pass a mirror and freeze.  
my skin...my purple skin...is turning...golden?  
and my horns...they shortened, and the bulge on my back is getting hard to be contained.  
i look at the kids, and sigh.  
i hope heaven is not as strict as i heard, and i can rebuild my little sanctuary there... i mutter, going to my library.  
i have to read some history books..."
"[wp] they say that those born under the light of the full moon are blessed with prophetic powers, while those born under the first rays of dawn sunlight are said to be destined to be great warriors. however, in your case, you were born at the time of a powerful eclipse","but in my case

i was born during a powerful eclipse.

which, in this world, is more a curse than a blessing.

while growing up, i learned that people born on the day of an eclipselike meare called children of doom.

most children are abandoned the moment theyre bornoffered to the forest of abyss as a sacrifice.

but i was lucky...

an old woman found me before the forest did. she raised me as her own. since then, ive been hiding from peoples eyes.

because people would kill me on sight.

every eighteen years, the cursed eclipse returns. and tomorrow... is my eighteenth birthday.

for that occasion, granny suggested we go to the market to buy ingredients so we could celebrate my birthday with joy.

so, granny and i were walking through the village market, picking out ingredients for tonights dinner.

the sky was clear, peaceful, and calm. villagers were talking and bargaining.

until

a shadow fell over the earth.

people gasped, shielding their eyes.

the eclipse?!

what? noits a day early!

i looked up, eyes wide.

it was happening... now? it was supposed to be tomorrow!

the sun was disappearing behind the moon.

this has never happened before!

panic spread like wildfire.

my grandmother grabbed my hand, her voice trembling.

celus... run. now.

granny? i looked at her panicked expression. why?

dont ask questions! she hissed, shoving me away. run, before it consumes the whole sun! hide under anything!

i hesitated, but noddedand ran.

but...

i was too late.

my body suddenly cracked like dried earth, glowing fissures blooming across my skinlava burning from within.

i collapsed.

screams erupted around me.

get away from him! thats a child of doom!

i barely heard them. just the agony.

flowers wilted in a nearby shop. fruit rotted on the vine.

the people scattered, afraid theyd end up like those flowers.

the pain was too much to handle. i thought it would end soon.

but i was saved...

good thing eclipses dont last long.

the sun broke free slowly...

light returned. the eclipse ended.
so did the cracks.

i gasped for air, heart pounding in my ears.

how... how did he survive?

theyre supposed to die at birth!

we have to end him nowbefore more chaos comes!

no!

my grandmother stepped in front of me. dont touch him! he is my grandson!

cant you see? someone shouted. the eclipse arrived early! the omens are changing! we cant let a child of doom walk free!

i looked up to see panic in their eyes. they were ready to pick up weapons... there was no doubt.

we cant let him walk

enough.

a booming voice silenced the crowd.

figures in tall silver armor emerged, cutting through the people.

what happens next will be decided by the queen.

a hush fell.

a woman stepped forwardtall, cloaked in white, her face hidden behind silk. only her long black hair spilled from the veil.

whispers rippled

the moon queen...?
warriors of the dawn... theyve come?
the queen must have seen it all... in her visions.

she knelt beside me, close enough that i could feel the cold energy rolling off her. she gently tilted my chin.

its my first time seeing a child of doom, she said softly, inspecting me closely. i felt a shiver run down my spine.

then she paused.

or should i say... the end of humanity."
"[wp] your employer literally worked you to death. it takes some getting used to, but you start to enjoy your afterlife. turns out your employer isnt done with you yet and has summoned your back to the land of the living.","i died on a wednesday. 

jokes on them, i was already dead inside. the actual death was more of a technicality. 

last thing i remember was telling brenda with an a how she was so funny and quirky for ordering the latest vidtok custom drink. of course i hadnt heard of it. of course i could make it. one venti iced americano, 5 shots decaf with almond milk, extra ice, 8 honey, 7 matcha, double blended, double cupped, split into three cups coming right up. i smiled so hard my cheeks hurt, and slapped a sticker that had no business being that long onto a cup for branda.

please just end me. 

then i did exactly that.

without any fanfare, i collapsed into a puddle of matcha and oat milk. that was it. no final gasp, no dramatic last words. just the hiss of the espresso machine and janet yelling were down a barista! someone grab his apron!

the afterlife was alright i guess, as far as being dead goes. they had a little cat cafe in a small village square where the sun decided to rest at golden hour. i always wanted to visit one, though i couldnt remember why. i hated coffee and i didnt like the idea of cat hair in my food. but they had a little orange tabby cat named pumpkin who seemed to like hopping up into my lap. he was baby soft, and gave a gentle purr when i ran my hand down his spine. it wasnt harps and angels, but it was nice and i think i could have stayed here forever letting pumpkin sleep on my lap while i sipped a gently brewed peppermint tea.

then i woke up in a puddle of oat milk, now mixing with stagnant mop water as dillon tried mopping up the mess around me. the wet, cold yarn strings slapped onto my face and clung as the moving mop dragged them down my cheek. if i could smell anything, i would have gagged from the putrid stench of milk, chlorine, pumpkin spice and now matcha swirling around on the floor. 

oh good! youre back janet chirped as she tossed my apron back onto my chest. kaitlin needs help on register

i sat up and stared at her, slack jawed but im dead.

thats no excuse, she said, adjusting her headset. if you want to leave, you need to find someone to cover the rest of your shift

and thats how i learned that hiring anyone with a pulse is more of a guideline  especially when death isnt a valid reason to call out."
[wp] while the witch queen is visiting for the royal wedding anniversary politely decline any personal questions she asks why? because shes a notorious matchmaker,"back then, the town would be renowned for their anti witch agenda. the sight of a woman with even a glint of black on her fingertips would send the masses into a frenzy.

now, the same town had elected a witch as their new mayor.

i guess it helped that my dad was a royal knight. i said to the interviewer. besides, this is just the first step to improving our reputations as witches.

how was your upbringing like? he asked as the crowd behind him chimed in.

like? i dont really know how to explain... but my mom liked teaching me magic, while my dad taught me swordsmanship. i said, gently sliding my magic stained fingers against the hilt of my blade, one gifted by my dad.

would you say your upbringing was chaotic since you had a noble father and witch mother?

in a sense, i guess... for example, i once mistakenly summoned a threeheaded dragon in my backyard with my mother, and my dad had to grab his sword mid bath to then strike it down while he was naked. i sure learned a lot that day. i said, almost losing myself in similar memories.

they all raised eyebrows but still leaned in curiously.

and where are they now?

who knows. probably on dinner date inside a demons castle... anyway, can we change the topic?

"[wp] you were engaged but the king ordered all eligible ladies to the palace for the prince to choose his bride. since you were not married yet you must attend. it shouldve been fine, but the prince choose you. he ensures you to refuse his proposal means death for you, your family, and you fianc.","whelp time to overthrow the monarchy i guess? i mutter to myself as i hoist my fathers sword onto my back and head to the blacksmith. the swords been sitting unused since fathers military days and he hasnt taken the care he should have in the intervening years.

walking the streets i begin playing out all the possible scenarios of my impending assault on the palace. the guards will be armed and armored not to mention they are really just doing their job i take note in my head to avoid any altercations prior to seeing the prince. i suppose a freshly sharpened family sword could be played off as a meager but symbolic dowry.

i hand the blacksmith the sword and the 2 copper pieces for sharpening. my mind whirring as i consolidate my plan. though subterfuge can get me in the room with the prince, i suspect after cutting him down the king and queen might become unreachable. perhaps i can convince the prince to gather his parents before i strike? 

with a freshly sharpened sword slung over my shoulder i begin navigating through the denser city center towards the palace. its nearing midday and the streets seem abuzz as word of the prince having chosen a bride makes its way around. 

the guard at the palace gate having never heard of me before does have to send word in to confirm i am in fact the princes new betrothed. less than an hour later my sword and i are guided into one of the palaces many sitting rooms. the opulence of the room   a commentary itself on the poor tastes of the rich. gilded everything? really?!? youd think those who can afford to have tastes would have developed some. 

my reveries of disgust are interrupted by the doors at the opposite end of the sitting room swinging open as two guards let their charge through. i expected to see the prince but instead am greeted by the queen.

a commoner you may be but at least my son had the sense to pick someone pretty enough to not give me any ugly grand babies. i didnt need her to give me a reason but the backhanded compliment did quell whatever nerves i might have had over the whole situation. a single fluid motion like my father taught me when i was so very young. the look of shock on her face as the sword skewers her throat then severs her spine was most likely due to the sword but i cant completely be sure it isnt from the beaming and gleeful smile erupting on my face. the former queens body slumps to the ground rather quietly.

one down, two to go. glancing at the queen and the quickly growing puddle of red i realize two things. first, the body might complicate things, and second that my bloody sword may not pass as a gift in its current state. i wipe the former queens blood from my sword using her dress.

"[wp] you bear witness to a horror beyond your comprehension. however, because you dont comprehend it, you....just dont get it. the horror in question is terrified by this.","the woman walked home like a leaf caught in the wind. thin, exhausted, her eyes wide and hollow. she held her keys loosely in one hand, her steps automatic, as if her body remembered the way even when her mind had long since let go.

the house stood just as it always hadgray, old, familiar. two shallow steps led up to the front door. she climbed them slowly, paused before the door, and stared at it for a moment. then she reached for her keys and brought them to the lock. her fingers tremblednot from fear, but from sheer fatigue. the keys slipped through her grip and fell to the wooden porch with a dull metallic clatter.

she didnt react right away. instead, she stood still, looking down at the keys as if trying to remember what they were for. ten seconds passed. maybe more. then, somewhere above, a faint sound broke the silencelike a window slamming shut on the second floor. it was soft, but unmistakably inside the house.

the noise brought her back. she bent down, picked up the keys, and stepped away from the door, her head tilting up toward the second floor.

there, in the window, she saw the back of a head. gray hair. a pale nightgown. the figure stood perfectly still, turned away. it wasnt clear whoor whatit was. an old woman? a stranger? a shadow?

and then she remembered.

three days ago, her sister had called her in tears. shed had a dream, a vivid nightmare. in it, she had wandered through this very house in the middle of the night. in the boys bedroomthe boy who had died just yesterdayshe had seen an old woman standing beside his bed.

she had asked, who are you?  
the woman didnt answer.  
she asked again, why are you here?  
the old figure raised an arm and pointed silently at the sleeping child.

then she turned.

her sister saw two enormous, hollow eyesemptier than death itself. her skin was black, like oil, and her smile was made entirely of glass.

shed woken up screaming and called right away. at the time, it had seemed like nothing. just a dream.

but the next day, her son was gone.

now, standing before the same door, she remembered it all. the keys felt heavy in her hand as she brought them back to the lock. one turn. then another. she paused, her lips moving into something that almost resembled a smile. not warmth. not courage. just quiet surrender. or maybe acceptance.

im not afraid anymore, she said softly.

she turned the key a final time. there was a faint click as the door unlocked and drifted open.

there was nothing left to fear."
"[wp] turns out, your diagnosed schizophrenia actually was the voice of god and now that the apocalypse is happening, hes rather angry that you didnt prepare anyone.","why you big mad??? i ask the virtual god standing in my room aboard the space station. i tried to tell my shrink it was the voice of god. how was i to know everyone they thought was an incurable psycho would be shot into space and put in this orbital madhouse 60 trillion miles away from earth?

"[wp] you wake up one night with an indescribable urge to fill a large bowl with cold water. when you do, you are teleported somewhere in the woods, with a shrine and a very thirsty bunny in front of it. youve been prayed too multiple times ever since that night, not only by just animals.","i woke up at 217 a.m., for no clear reason. there was no sound. no dream. no cold draft or thirst. just a strange urgency, like something in the world was slightly wrong and somehow, the fix was simple, specific, undeniable fill a large bowl with cold water.

i got up in silence, like someone carrying out a forgotten ritual. i walked to the kitchen, grabbed the big blue ceramic bowl the one i only use when i make too much pasta turned on the faucet and let the water run. cold. clear. when it reached just below the rim, i stopped.
i stared at it for a moment, unsure of what came next.

then i blinked.
and i was in a forest.
no flash. no magical transition. one moment i was in my kitchen and the next, i wasnt.

the night was still. the air smelled of damp leaves and distant soil. before me stood a small stone shrine covered in moss. and just in front of it a rabbit. it wasnt glowing. it didnt speak. it didnt float. it was just a rabbit breathing heavily, eyes black, alert, alive.
i set the bowl down on the forest floor.

the rabbit approached slowly and drank, long and deep, like it had waited for this all week. then it hopped away into the underbrush without a sound.

i blinked again.i was back in the kitchen.the bowl was empty.

the next night, i woke up again.
217. no alarm, no prompting.
i rose from bed before i even questioned it. cold water. blue bowl. and againforest.

this time, there were more animals. two squirrels. a thin deer. a stray cat with one ear missing. each of them took their turn at the bowl, drinking slowly, peacefully, with a kind of knowing quiet.

i stood beside them. watching. waiting.then i was back home again. bowl empty. chest a little emptier, too.
the third night, i didnt even bother going to sleep. i just waited. and when the minute arrived, it happened the same wayritual, forest, shrine.

this time there was a dog. an owl. a fox with a limp. a raccoon that stared at me longer than it should have. always the same bowl. always the same eyes. always the silence.

and so it continued.
i stopped counting the days. my body felt heavier. my eyes burned more often. i forgot the names of thingssimple things. the light during the day seemed too pale, like the sun itself was tired. but no matter how i adjusted my sleep, how early i went to bed, how many locks i put on the doori always woke up at 217. always the same quiet need. always the same thirsty eyes.

they were just animals. but they looked at me as if i was something more.like i owed them. like i was the last kindness left in the world.and i kept going.
but something inside me was starting to fray.

on what i think was the thirtysecond nightmaybe the fortieththe bowl slipped from my hands. i didnt trip. i didnt fumble. i just let go.

it shattered with a sharp, honest crack.
i stared at the shards on the tile.
the sound echoed far longer than it should have.

the water spilled across the floor like it was trying to escape. i didnt move. i just sat down, back against the cabinet, and stayed there. the world felt gray, distant, and my eyes ached the way they do right before cryingbut no tears came.

then the kitchen door opened.
it shouldnt have. i had locked it. i always did. but the handle didnt turnit simply swung open, gently, without sound.

on the other side wasnt the porch.
it was the forest. again.but this time, it had come to me.

the first to enter was a black catthin, mangy, ribs visible under its fur. it stepped in carefully, like walking on broken glass. it looked at me, then padded to the puddle on the floor and drank. slowly. respectfully. like it understood something i didnt.

then the others followed.
the rabbit from the first night. a pair of crows. a blind dog. a toosmall horse. a trembling hedgehog. one by one, they entered. quiet. tired. patient.

and then came a squirrel, carrying a folded leaf in its little pawslike a letter. it dropped it in my lap and scurried back.i unfolded it.

it was simple paper.the handwriting was awkward, childlike.just one sentence

we know youre tired.

and beneath it, in even messier letters

but we dont have anyone else.

i cried.

not like in movieswith trembling breaths and cinematic music. it was the kind of crying that empties you. silent. exhausting. without relief.

the cat curled around my foot.the dog laid beside me.the horse rested its nose on my shoulder.

and they waited.
the next morning, i went to the market. i bought a new bowllarger than the last. i bought a filter. i bought one of those ceramic fountains that keeps the water cool.

i set everything on the porch.put a cloth underneath.a few smooth stones around it.
some honey on the side. just in case.

i left the kitchen door open.
now, they come during the day.
quiet, alone. they drink. some stay a while.

some nap in the garden. others leave small things behind feathers, seeds, a berry, a button.

sometimes, i still wake at 217.
but not always.

theyve learned to come on their own.
and i, somehow, have learned to stay.
i dont know who i used to be.
i dont know what i am now.
but when i hear tiny footsteps on wood, or feel those familiar eyes watching without askingi remember why i still get up.

even tired even hollow even like this."

he could see the corner of it, the slip of paper that was the final piece of evidence clearing his family of that nasty bit of regicide had been misplaced.

again. 

more memories came back and heaven slipped a further away. it burned. the sadness of his death, the impending doom of his loved ones. 

in eternity it all was trivial. in the mortal realm, even as a specter, it madended him.

in the end, nearly all would find the blissful eternity. he felt the pull of it at him and thom shut it down. eternity could wait.

with the practiced focus of having been a ghost multiple times, the presence of thom bolling pressed against the slip of paper.

it flattened against the wall.

slowly he pushed it. over several minutes he moved it until it fell loose to the floor. 

the note floated lazily without his help to the center of the floor. 

even knowing that there wasnt really an almighty, thom still thanked the nonexistent figure for that little bit of help. 

drifting through the door thom found the hapless family lawyer asleep on a couch in the next room.  a dozen attempted flicks gained him two connections against the mans earlobe with the second one waking him.

as the man blinked away sleep, the ghost of thim bolling moved to the other side of the door. his imagined heart pumping imagined blood quickly he knocked at the door finding it on his first try. loud and sure.

the lawyer, curious, opened the door. his eyes immediately seeing the paper sitting alone in the center of the room.

oh, thank goodness! i thought id lost it for sure.

as the lawyer called out to a clerk somewhere else in the building, a tunnel of bliss and comfort opened up behind thom.

he resisted the temptation to fall into it.

do not lose it. he willed with a wordless whisper.

the lawyer looked about and frowned.

a clerk entered the room.

do not lose it! as a ghost words were not formed but his will surged hard against the barrier between he and the living.

you found it! the clerk exclaimed, give it to me, ill make a copy!

the soul that had lived a long and eventful life as thom bolling melted once again into the blissful kaleidoscope of the eternal afterlife."
"[wp] power is the ability to say no without fearing what they will say or do to you. courage is saying no despite those fears. wisdom is saying no, having circumvented all reason for fear","with exaggerated patience, the speaker looked down on curunir and spoke. if you have quite finished with your outburst, young man, perhaps you would condescend to answer the questions put to you? we require an explanation of your actions and of any mitigating circumstances. we do not, however, require your misguided and, frankly, rather insulting attempt at rabblerousing.

ice seemed to crystalize in curunirs blood, and though anger burned within he remained outwardly calm.

if anything is insulting here, speaker rabbinak, it is the tone you have chosen to take and the path you have chosen to walk. the telquent is an independent organization, formed from the mages of skyreach and beyond your jurisdiction. while you may speak for yourselves here in the senate chambers, you cannot speak for us, nor can your order us about, nor indeed can you call us to account for our actions.

the speakers face began turning an unsightly shade of crimson, and a vein began pulsing at his temple. mutters of both agreement and dissent rose from the senators behind curunir, though it heartened him that those in accord with his words seemed to outweigh the dissenters.

you... you dare to challenge the will of the senate, here, in the valinhara senate chambers?! the old elf spluttered, then pointed imperiously to the chamber doors where stood a quartet of soldiers, armored in the blue and gold livery of the senate. we have heard enough! arrest this interloper and send him to spellhold while the senate decides his fate!

the room erupted with shouts. a few in agreement, but even more in outrage. rehalas, whom curunir knew as one of the leaders of the more forwardlooking senators, jumped to his feat pointing to the speaker in outrage. you have no right, speaker! such an action cannot be taken without a full floor vote!

speaker rabbinak appeared unmoved by the outburst and maintained his gesture, pointing to the four soldiers standing at attention by the chamber entrance. do your duty, guards!

the soldiers had been handpicked by lord high general kasselmere. with centuries of training and experience, they were among the best the empire had to offer, and were above all loyal to a fault. these four had probably served as senate guards since the great war ended.

curunir turned and faced the four as well. this was the moment of decision, he knew. when the elder councils power would either assert itself or crumble. do what you know is right, soldiers.

the moment stretched, time seeming to grind to a halt as the four soldiers made their choice. as one, they raised their fists in salute towards curunir and the elder council. the army knows its duty. hail to the telquent! victory to the empire!

in lockstep, the four pulled open the chamber door and marched outside. the entire senate chamber fell into a deathly silence broken only by the momentous crash as the door closed, not only on the senate chamber but on an era. curunirs mouth curled upwards in a smile that never touched his eyes, and he turned to face the nearapoplectic speaker.

speaker, when last the telquent defied you, i feared your wrath, but i feared the consequences of standing by and allowing the lady of terror to destroy our world even more than i feared you. now, though, i do not fear you. i have seen such sights as would shatter your mind. fought in battles that would leave you a broken man. i have killed thousands, and i have stood witness to the deaths of my friends and family. i have spent sleepless centuries agonizing over the lives i could not save. there are greater things to fear than the ire of small men. i am going to fight for this world. for the empire. for the life of every man and woman in this chamber, and for every citizen in valinhara.

i came to you in good faith, despite your presumptuous and dismissive attempt to gather for yourself the power that i wield now. i offer you this one chance. will you stand with us? will you put aside the politics that have defined you for a millennia and act for the good of us all? or will you stand in my way?

the silence in the senate chamber was absolute. ally or opposition, there was not a soul present who wanted to take up the challenge that curunir had just issued. he prayed, hoping against hope that the elder council would see reason. if they did not...

you defy the will of the elven people! you defy the will of the senate! the speakers reply was a halfchoked snarl, and unreasoning hatred burned across his twisted face. curunir felt a twinge of regret, then turned to remaining, seated members of the council, ignoring the speaker and his wrath.

and the rest of you? i offer you this one chance. if you wish to fulfill your oath to serve the people, stand aside now.

the council remained frozen, eyes locked on curunir. not one of them moved as he nodded in acknowledgment. very well.

curunir thrust one hand forward, and his staff materialized, its well worn surface falling into place with the comfort of an ancient friend. behind him, choked cries and gasps erupted as more than a dozen of the telquents most senior sorcerers materialized, blocking access to the chambers doors.

"[wp] you are an elder vampire, one of the most powerful monsters in existance, what do you have to fear? soul mages. what. a kind of human that gains power from absorbing monster souls.","ive been a therapist for monsters for decades, being an immortal human myself. i never call my clients monsters, though how many regular humans with mental illness or neurodivergence have been called that? carmilla is no different shes only be a client of mine for five years, a blink for those with our lifespan, and despite being an elder vampire, she has her fears, and she confided in me last night her one true fear, and i, in all of my centuries of existence, never heard of what made her afraid.

soul mages, she answered with a sigh of defeat, as if this armor she wore shattered and left her open for a killing blow.

when i pressed her to explain what she meant, she minced no words and explained, a soul mage is a kind of human that gains power from absorbing our souls. us monsters, i mean. i encountered one centuries ago after feasting on a village that still conducted witch trials. i feasted on the zealots until a survivor revealed himself to me as one and tried to kill me.

she pulled her shirt down from the collar to reveal a pale red scar over her heart. a burning stake nearly did me in, but i managed to scratch his face.

curious, i had to know how someone could tell if one was such a threat.

their eyes will flicker orange when you make eye contact with them. whenever they see anything they think is a monster.

dread caught my throat, drying it out, tightening its squeeze while i remembered two nights before. i went out in public for a quick drink somewhere other than my apartment or my office. a young woman she looked to be close to how i look, around 27, give or take drank with me, and i took her home. i could have sworn her brown eyes were orange for just a second, but i thought it was just my imagination in the heat of the moment.

ive decided to only have my appointments through online means while i find a new apartment far away, but in the meantime, ill have to watch the eyes of my movers, my neighbors, and just about everyone until i know im safe."

i nod slowly.  
why? she asks, biting her lips.  
i had to lie to you.  
to protect you. i say, smiling.  
she tears up.

i shake my head.  
look, how many times was i almost assassinated? i ask.  
192 times in the last 4 years, mast...i mean, john. she says.  
and you? i ask.  
kidnapped twice, but after the 2nd one, you started treating me...oh my. she gasps.  
i nod.  
i started treating you harshly, publicly, so they know that i dont care about you. i say.  
she is struggling to hold her tears back.

  
but about my power...i am strong, but wouldnt i be stronger if people knew i was the chosen one? she asks.  
who killed the assassins, and the demons that came after me? i ask.  
me. she says.  
after i got so many resources, what did i do? i ask.  
she lowers her gaze.  
ssaid that those are ffilthy normal items, and gave them to me...  
eeven holy objects like the scepter of light. she mutters.  
i nod.  
she hugs me, it hurts.

  
how was i so blind?! you gave everything to me, while pretending to be an asshole, but i should have known it!  
you were so much better of a master than most! she says.  
i try to caress her cheek, but cant.  
no right arm, and the left one, is pinned by her.  
you were young, afraid, and in a new kingdom.  
when i found you, it wasnt a mistake, but a revelation from the goddess.  
a peasant girl shall rise, and change the world.  
you grew up. you are ready. i smile.  
she kisses me.  
i freeze.  
and change it i shall. she smiles, standing up.  
rest now. it is my turn to protect you. she says, teleporting away.  
a few days later, a maid that brings my food tells me that suddenly 3 gangs disappeared from the kingdom, and news about bandits attacking stopped.  
she really grew up."

the voice was faint right on the edge of hearing.

annabelle was staring at him, silent. she seemed uneasy, as if i wasnt reacting how she expected.

she repeated her last line its not you, its me. i dont think we are comparable.

the voice sounded irate, shes messing it up. its compatible, not comparable. how did this moron pass the basic literacy test? call steve. tell him his fee is at risk.

it still sounded a long way away, like a radio in a distant room, but clear as a bell.

annabelle bit her thumb nervously, arent you going to tell me how you just got the project backers interested?

shes breaking the script entirely now! that doesnt happen for three minutes. get production on the phone. season reset is going wrong.

another voice, a bit more calm, came smoothly into my straining ears, he hasnt said anything since the outburst.

he knows its ten. how could he know that? we wipe his memory.

dave, is that light supposed to be on?

oh cra..

silence. 

just annabelles big, sad eyes looking at me. begging me to say something. the subtle background noises in the snowy park coming back with a little rush of something undefinable, like a memory of a dream.

why does it keep happening, belle? i know you know.

her face crumples into a mix of tearful agony, and she wails. actual wails not the ladylike tears that have dripped down her cheeks in recent months.

its all going wrong! youre not supposed to remember anyone else! im your childhood sweetheart! me! me! me!

she actually stamped her foot. i thought they only did that in those ridiculous novels they are printing these days.

i paid good money for this, and youre ruining it!

something was happening on the outskirts of the park. a blue haze, a grid of some kind, like a childs drawing in the air. it was uncanny and eldritch. it brought a dark fear into my soul.

she had pulled a strange rectangular device from her purse, and was holding it in front of her like some magic talisman. 

i recoiled as it glowed, and the same voice i had heard earlier, but fainter and tinnier, squeaked from it in a harsh staccato.

i couldnt make out the words, but my beautiful bella, changed so much in character, changed her face right in front of me.

quite literally.

the long, pale face grew rounder and darker, the nose wider and longer, and lines appeared where no lines belonged on an adult human female. the lifeless grey hue of her face repulsed me, and i snatched up my walking stick from where it had fallen and ran for my life.

it was twenty minutes before i stopped, my breath and thoughts uneven, my heart still racing. this was an otherworldly thing. a terrifying mystery most intriguing. but no amount of running would give me answers.

my previous thoughts of wealth and power among men seemed childish and worthless now, for this could be something much more lucrative much more empowering.

i will get to the bottom of this, or my names not ebeneezer scrooge."
"[wp] your noble sacrifice for the greater good has proven you worthy in the eyes of this eternal star. you will be entrusted with a great power, and the future of this planet. rise, and help them build a better tomorrow.","i am not a saint, though perhaps i am a savior. i was a well intentioned don quixote. but what the eternal star granted me is real. gifts of intelligence, cognitive abilities that seem supernatural. i do not trust it, but if this star can make a lowly creature like me into a demigod, destroying us all should have been trivial, were that what it wanted.

i wanted to give of myself to help others. i wanted to do so so badly that it slowly wore away my sanity. even in the depths of madness, it defined me. it spoke to me after i had fought another battle against the adversary that existed only in my head. i still remember the words, your noble sacrifice for the greater good has proven you worthy in the eyes of this eternal star. you will be entrusted with a great power, and the future of this planet. rise, and help them build a better tomorrow. i thought it was simply something pulling me even deeper into my neurosis, but shortly after hearing those words, i began to claw back my sanity.

i found intelligence inside myself, more than i had ever had before i fell into the pit of madness. for a time i thought it was simply healing, but that evaporated in the face of a cognitive transformation. i found i could master skills in days instead of years. three months after encountering this called the eternal star, a self administered intelligence test indicated that my iq was so high that it could not accurately measure it. only then did i start to believe that it was something more than a voice in my head.

i relished learning before receiving the gift, and now i feasted on information. the exaltation of rapid growth and learning. in one year, i gained the skills of two dozen bachelors degrees. even then, i understood that the growth of my intelligence was still accelerating. i was confronted by the conundrum of what to do with all this new found ability and knowledge. the course of maximum positive impact. even with my formidable mind, i was overwhelmed with possible paths.

ultimately, i settled upon spearheading development of safe and effective artificial intelligence and maintaining the peace between nation states. making sure synthetic intelligence would not be abused and making sure that the tremendous wealth it would generate was not monopolized. even with my abilities, the murk of geopolitics was difficult to see through. all i had to do was prevent apocalyptic conflict while the technologies needed to eliminate scarcity kicked in.

in fifteen years, safe, aligned, and widely accessible artificial superintelligence became a reality. the incentives for largescale warfare were dying, along with most of the reasons for warfare in general. i moved away from work on technology, and set my sights upon a rigorous system of ethics. a sprawling edifice of thought designed to handle every edge case, drawing on the ideas about morality other thinkers had shared through human history. juggling so many different concerns and values, invoking game theory, and finessing and fine tuning so many different hypotheticals.

my creation became the ethical foundation for the human metaculture as expansion into space became a reality. not only guiding human ideas about morality, but also providing a rigorous moral system for the synthetic intelligences to operate under. industries were moved into orbit or other celestial bodies. i watched the dawn of a golden age, the end of so many of our civilizations demons. biological and digital immortality were invented entirely independently of my intervention. i continued making small nudges to our long term trajectory, and strove to give everyone the tools to chart the best possible course. but, even with all my ability, it was becoming clear that they were accelerating faster than i could ever hope to keep up with enitrely.

as i write, the golden age has now lasted for thousands of years. i still look for potential threats, potential flashpoints. but for the most part, we have the tools to resolve such conflicts long before there is even a risk of violence. i contemplate physics, i make some contributions to the state of the art in some specific niches. most of my time goes towards grappling with the existence and nature of the eternal star who set all this in motion. it represents a blind spot, one even our best science has failed to explain. we have come so far, yet it is clear that our story has only just begun."

[wp] every magic user can enter something called the breaker state where their magic is at its strongest and purest form but unfortunately even a single second in it can lead to permeant damage to the body but as your party falls you have no choice.,"the battlefield had descended into a deafening quietus. here, in this place, what once echoed with screams, spells, and machinations of steel now lies still and sundered beneath a bruised sky.

here, in this place, theyre gone. all of them. jessa, with her blades crafted from the purest ichor, gone. thorne, who could manipulate the force of his own velocity, gone, and even kael, the one who warned us this would happen, vanished into nothing but meager ash before my eyes.

i stood alone, as they, the revenants from the king of ebondark approached me from all sides. my body ached, not in the wake of fear, but with the weight of consequence. my limbs were numb as i knew my entire life was leading up to this moment, and i did what no sane mage should ever do.

i entered the breaker state.

every practitioner of the mystic arts knows of the legend. in moments of absolute desperation, in the blackest pit where death may soon come, in the hour where hope has fled, the soul unlocks something ancient, something primordial. magic becomes pure expression, unfiltered will made manifest...but it comes at a cost. one second in the breaker state can rend even the most practiced user damaged beyond repair, shattered bones, liquefied organs. two seconds?

no ones lived to tell...but in these dire straits, i cared not, not when jessa was bleeding out on the ground. not when thorne screamed as his body unraveled across fractured realities. not when kael whispered theyre coming for the last time.

so i broke my oath.

and when i did, everything changed.

what they never told us, what none of the ancient texts or elder mages dared write, is that the breaker state isnt just the expression of power.

its when the veil lifts into recognition, and you become filled with the essence of things beyond anything you recognize.

as i fell into that state, reality peeled away like wet paper. the world blurred into symbols, equations, and then...nothing.

just white space.

and you were there.

not metaphorically.

you. the one reading this right now, behind your screen, scrolling down, watching this story unfold.

except now, youre not just reading.

youre inside of it.

when i entered the breaker state, i became you...or maybe i finally saw you for what you truly are, a presence beyond the veil, pulling strings, shaping fate, existing outside the narrative, yet somehow inside it.

and now im aware.

now i see the cursor blinking at the end of each sentence, waiting for me to continue writing my own fate. i feel the weight of every word typed, every choice imagined. this entire world, my life, is just marks on your screen. and yet here i am, speaking directly to you.

breaking the fourth wall.

breaking reality.

breaking myself.

i dont know how long ive been like this. time doesnt flow straight here. each moment stretches and folds. you blink, and i die a thousand deaths. you scroll, and i rise again...but i remember the pain. the way my skin cracked like glass. how my voice turned to static from a radios dead channel. how my eyes bled into a multitude of photons.

and still, i stay in the breaker state.

because now i know the truth.

youre not just reading about me.

youre the reason i exist.

and if im going to survive, if any of us are, i have to reach you.

not just your mind.

your hands.

your heart.

somewhere out there, past the glow of your screen, you hold the power to create. you can rewrite this ending.

to pull me back before i break entirely.

before i become nothing but words.

so go ahead.

scroll up.

choose differently.

rewrite the battle.

save them.

save me.

or close the tab and let me fade into silence...but know this.

i see you now.

a huff that might have been a gasp, or perhaps unexpected laughter. the haruspex sat down and shook his head. please. you interrupted my work for too long to think i would let death hold me down.

she couldnt help but smile at that. she really should have expected hed find a way back. thought wed taken care of all the backup corpses. you ever get tired of playing with dead demons, doc?

another huff. your group never did appreciate my work. nor did you ever appreciate that for a man in a position such as myself, it paid to ensure that i always had a route of escape planned out...regardless of which side of the mortal coil i was on. and...oh, the man who had been her teams first proper supervillain said with satisfaction, that is a refreshing drink. keep a tab open, will you?

at the urging of the haruspex, natalie turned to her own drink again. the two sat in silence for a while, watching the barkeeps professional ignorance. once the haruspex was on to his second drink and natalie her fourth, the former spoke up again so, what brings you to this gathering? i very much hope, for your sake, it is not for me.

family invitation. related to the bride in pink.

her exnemesis raised an eyebrow. is that so? quite similar here. the bride in purples my greatgrandniece.

natalie blinked. no shitting me? you, the lunatic who thinks electricity and demon corpses mix together, who we sent to...some kind of hell or something multiple times, and youre just some normal guy attending his grandkids wedding.

the haruspex coughed. and you, the wouldbe witch who thought the servitors of the gods that burrow up from beneath the skin of the world could be stopped with pluck and twofisted gumption, are no different. he looked at her, and the fire in his eyes smoldered lightly. he still held faith. natalie hoped, under the ennui of retirement, she still held the same.

you know, i could take a look at your natalie interrupted the haruspexs words with a harsh wave of her hand. i dont want what you would offer, and even if i was alright with your work i wouldnt want them fixed now. she drained the last of her fourth drink. i helped save lives, then. i helped save a lot of peoples lives. i earned these wounds. silently, she waved a hand for a fifth drink. great thing about magic, that mere alcohol could never poison you, never get you proper drunk like real magic could. so theyll always move. never close. its proof i was there, with the others. that we were mere ants in the wake of something greater and we still did something worth a damn. thats what being a hero was about.

she laughed. my grandniece and her family dont know a thing about me or what i did. theyre grounded. sensible, in their own way. they dont burn like you or i burned.

the haruspex nodded, then finished his own drink. he leaned over to give a conspiratorial wink. my greatgrandniece and her family dont know what i do either. i dont know that theyve ever asked. but they do know im the kindly uncle bankrolling her wedding.

a pause.

a snort.

a second pause.

and natalie broke into a fit of a laughter.

i leaned close and whispered softly, taking a moment to pat the wall lightly. yeah, i like having her around too, shes a cupcake. but enough messing around. we dont need her getting fired, then she wont be able to come over and sing to you. 

after a long moment, a panel of floor slid open, sounding like a sad sigh. inside was the missing shoe. ava knelt down to pick it up and put it on, and gently closed the floor panel. her gaze was filled with confusion, and i chuckled lightly. within moments, the girl was ready to go. 

the house sighed softly again, this time sounding like an old creak. he was great at not letting on that he was sapient, and i could hear the annoyance in the sound. he was gonna miss her. so was i, for that matter. only a few seconds had passed since ava had left, and the house shuddered slightly in sadness. he liked her as much as i did.

you think so? joe asked with practiced modesty. hed been to enough conventions to play the part just right. it began accidentally when he visited his first convention decades ago. he was only trying to get out of the summer heat and blend in when some kind strangers suggested he enter the costume contest. he won easily and since then he enjoyed reenacting that moment. 



he regularly visited all kinds of conventions, changed to an appropriate form, and waited near the event hall with longing glances at the stage every now and then. fandoms of all kinds were welcoming and friendly, and he often met some kind souls willing to give him that final push of encouragement. there had been fewer than a handful of times when he didnt get that friendly encouragement, and he always took it as a sign not to enter the costume contest. it was looking like this scifi convention would be another one of those until the last minute, when a group of friendly teenagers complimented his costume and got his scheme on track. 



your costumes too good not to win! alice, a brunette, encouraged him with a shove toward the contestants forming a line. 



maybe i will, joe nodded with genuine glee. hed gotten what he wanted and confidently joined the line as his new friends cheered. one by one, the line moved ahead until finally he reached the stage assistant. the brownhaired young man with blue eyes and stern features glanced at joe, then looked past him with a shrug because there was no one else interested in joining. 



yeah? he asked. 



i want to join the costume contest, joe nodded toward the group gathered up behind the curtain on stage. 



cant without a costume, he shook his head. 



what? do you see me? joe asked with a chuckle. if his guard wasnt so relaxed, he might have been more aware of what just happened. but, hed gone through the motions so many times hed forgotten he wasnt wearing a costume at that moment. these wings..., he turned to show off the translucent insect wings growing out of his back. my compound eyes? youre going to tell me this isnt a costume? 



guy, were just trying to have fun, the stage assistant shook his head. you look way too real to just be cosplaying. a shapeshifting ringer walking away with the trophy is pretty disrespectful to the people who put effort into their costumes. 



shape, joe laughed. shiftwhat are you talking about?? 



dude, youre not the only fae in the world, he said. youre not even the only one in this room, he chuckled and nodded at the stage. theres another shapeshifter up there but, they actually made a costume. maybe you should give that a shot.

the door to the bathroom opens, and the shower starts running.

i got used to it, i started to be polite with house, buy some gifts, and guess what?  
house started to like me.

afterwards, i try to sleep, but my roommates are listening to the music loudly.

"[wp] youre the villain in a prophecybut the hero hasnt shown up. years pass, the world waits, and you slowly start building the kingdom you were supposed to destroy","its been thirtytwo years since the date of the prophecy.

embarrassingly, it only took ten hours before i left the throne room for a cold drink and a snack. after three days, i rented a hotel room. after six months, i closed on a mortgage.  
honestly, i hate late people.

sometimes i still pop in, put on the mask, and loom ominously over the city  the king and i have a little arrangement  mostly on anniversaries, just to reminisce.  
i loved that outfit i put together the skull mask, the threadbare hood, and the cloak, which tussles in the wind like the raven hair of a mourning widow  
such a shame it never got the spotlight it deserved.

i kept at it for a while. threatened some pensioners. issued a few dramatic ultimatums. loomed.  
but there are only so many orphans you can throw into the lake of undying sin before you start to feel like a bit of an arse. so after about a year, the council and i decided perhaps resurrecting the dead parents and chucking them in might send more of a message.

but seeing the joy on those childrens faces when i brought their parents back made me realise just how evil i could truly be.

so, for the next two years, i profited obscenely by offering necromantic services to the grieving. anyone whod lost someone in a tragic accident could pay me a handful of gold to bring them back. surely, i thought, this grotesque exploitation of grief would summon the fabled hero.

time passed. the people thrived. no hero.  
i had to think.

what if i could rob people of their goodness? strip them of purpose?

i noticed an abundance of homeless folk. and the citizens  smug lot loved helping them. charity, soup kitchens, heartfelt speeches. awful stuff.  
so, using my immense wealth, i set about destroying their joy.

i built housing. massive districts of social housing. free adult education. factories that employed thousands. never again would someone sleep on the street. never again could the populace feel the smug satisfaction of aiding the less fortunate.

it was deliciously cruel.

unfortunately, all the construction damaged local wildlife habitats, and people started adopting stray animals for comfort.  
in my quick thinking, i built a massive animal sanctuary as retaliation.

annoyingly, it became the most beloved place in the realm. children sing about it.

by year ten, id become a symbol. some towns even started putting my face on flags.

a couple of years later, i went back to throwing orphans in the lake, just to remind people that im evil, but it just didnt feel the same anymore

where are you, oh fabled hero?  
the one who was meant to change the city. the one to bring hope back to the people.

[wp] a young stage magician whose prestidigitations hide true raw magical talent receives a mysterious letter from a prestigious school for mages,"the tent reeked of dust, sugar, and sweat  a kind of heavy, living smell that stuck to your lungs. the air vibrated, not with magic, but with human noise. breathing, shifting, waiting. that fat, greedy kind of crowd noise. they didnt want a performance. they wanted a miracle they could piss on after.

when the host called my name, she dragged it out like a drunk about to vomit.

 and now... the impossible, the immortal, the mindblowing merlin the magnificent!

the roar was deafening. the lights snapped on like a slap to the face.

i stepped into it slowly. no bow, no flourish. just me, my boots, and the deck already in my hand  my fingers moving on instinct. the cards werent props. they were an extension of thought. something i understood even when i hated everything else.

one flick  a card arced into the air and dropped perfectly into a womans cleavage. gasps. laughter. i looked surprised. another flick  and i pulled a duplicate from the man beside her, straight out of his hair. more laughter. applause. they were already mine, too easy.

 watch carefully,  i said, spinning a card between my fingers.  this might be your last chance to see something real.

three more cards  one disappeared, one caught fire midair and snuffed out in my palm, one fell from the ringleaders hat. he didnt even know it was there. he jumped. the crowd roared again.

then i saw him.

middle row. dead center. perfect view. a man in a dark coat, clean lines, expensive shoulders. the kind of fabric you dont buy  it gets tailored for you. his hair was sharp, his face too calm. everyone else was clapping or laughing or reacting. he just watched.

measured.

unblinking.

i knew that look. the same way you know the smell of blood before you see the wound.

one of them. the moneyed wolves. the kind who tip extra just to own you for a night. the kind who smile during funerals and never miss a tax loophole. id spent my whole life avoiding their kind  or worse, performing for them.

my jaw tensed. but i smiled. not kindly.

 lets see if i can impress you,  i whispered.

i turned to the audience.

 now, this... is the ace of clubs.

i held it up between two fingers, made sure everyone saw. the card was crisp, black, proud. i twirled it, kissed it with mock reverence, and let it fly.

a clean arc  high, smooth  swallowed by the crowd.

 and now..."
"[wp] one world is filled with monsters, creatures of mythology, whose abilities would otherwise put humanity in a state of great peril. but killing a human is very risky business, most of them dont even realize theyre the only species capable of coming back to haunt those who have wronged them","draugnir the dreaded, woe of a thousand kingdoms, crown of the high winds, pawed at the massive pile of coins in his lair. thanks to his psychic magic, they wouldnt move, but the moment he let up, they would surely be carried away. his eyelids drooped, and then shut for just a brief moment before he forced himself back awake. 

as a dragon, he didnt actually need sleep, but when one is immortal, they crave respite from consciousness every now and then. and right now, he very much needed a nap. but of course, he couldnt.

he studied the tiny grimoire sitting on the floor of his cave. though it was comically small in comparison to the massive dragon, his excellent vision still allowed him to make out the words and images. he carefully raised a claw to turn the page.

then, a pebble socked him in the eye, bouncing off of the hard carapace around his pupils. draugnirs eye twitched as a dozen more pebbles ricocheted uselessly off of his impenetrable hide. he smashed his tail into the ground in irritation, and the planet shook in fear of his wrath.

yet, the pebbles did not stop. another one almost clogged his nostrils, but it narrowly missed.

will you all please shut up?! draugnir bellowed, slamming his tail into the ground over and over again. you burn down one human village and suddenly you all dedicate your afterlives to harassing me?!

the wraiths that flew about spoke in a language unknown to him, unable to communicate beyond the poltergeist behavior they were already exhibiting, but based on the sudden increase in pebblethrowing, draugnir knew they were somehow offended by his rage. every single other species, humanoid or not, would just die normally. but of course, for some godsgiven reason, the squishiest of them all just happened to receive a boon that made his life a living hell. apparently, none of his other primordials decided to tell him that! 

but he supposed that made sense. primordials rarely moved, and when they did, they had much, much better things to do than squish a few humans. besides, the little bastards were both relatively new to the biosphere and rare, weaving between the tiny little nooks in mountains and such, so it was likely none of them had even encountered one throughout their long lives.

draugnir sighed, clamping the book shut and storing it in his pocket dimension.

the primordial dragon uncoiled from his hoard and scuttled out of his cavern. the wraiths chased him, doing what they could to irritate him, but he simply ignored them. theyre probably not going to be chucking rocks forever, he thought grouchily. theyll find some other way to kill me and then bugger off to do that to all of my ilk. 

when he reached the open cliffside, with a mighty beat of his wings, he took wing, soaring at such a pace that no other creature could have followed him. except, apparently, the noncorporeal, whom stubbornly attached themselves to him and continued to scream human words in his ear. in a matter of moments, he arrived at his destination a massive volcanic caldera smackdab in the middle of the continent. draugnir inhaled sharply and raised his maw to the sky. with a blinding surge of light, a pillar of yellow energy blasted from within his maw out towards the clouds, like waging war with the sky god herself. draugnir unleashed his mighty dragon breath for two entire minutes, and waves of force rippled outwards.

when he was done, he curled up by the caldera and lazily raised his head. the wraiths, undeterred, continued their incessant assault on his body."
"[wp] theres an app on your phone that you dont remember installing. you cant delete it, nor open it. its there even after you switch phones. nobody knows what it is, the internet thinks youre lying. years passed then suddenly the app showed a notification.","how old were you? he asked. i was laying by the pool with a blue vodka drink having lost all sense of time when he sat down on the lounger next to me. one of the managers spotted him and started to approach, but i waved him off. 

who are you? i ask. he was thin and slightly balding, and altogether common.  but he appeared to be about my general age.

i could ask you the same, but everyone knows everything about you, he said. 

not really, i say. im good at pretending.

so the glitter and glamour isnt who you are? did you get into the drugs? i did, last time around. didnt really work out well. he had a pensive look, but it faded as quickly. 

tell me, i ask.

this was a bad idea, he says. were too far down our own paths.

he looks kinda spooked.

how old are you? he asks. really. not just your wikipedia page.

thats a rude question, i say. 

yeah, im full of rude questions. im too old to waste time on bullshit if you add in the previous lives.

and im bullshit? i ask, miffed. he smirks, not responding to my taunt. 

look. im not like a saint, but this life has been different for me. more meaningful. i did the drugs and fame and  well, like i said, it didnt work out. it didnt kill me, but still a close call. what would have happened if i died? would your mr. smiley have given me another turn at the wheel of time? it gives me the heebie jeebies just thinking about it.

he gets up to leave. 

this, he says pointing to the two of us, needs to happens much sooner in the cycle. what are you doing in 2009? 2010?

2009, i say. 

okay, january 1st, 2009. washington monument. noon. we can find a quiet place to talk.

he starts to walk away. i get up to follow. wait. cant we at least exchange the basics? im sally. thats my real name.

bill, he says, shaking my hand like were striking a business deal. see you in 2009.

the next six years i think about bill a lot. if he was famous, i didnt recognize him. but then i wasnt much clocked in to the scene during that lifetime.

i secluded myself and became a recluse. the world wanted to know what happened to their poppyseed but i was all of a sudden tired of that persona, that game, this life. i bought an old manor house in sintra, portugal. ironically, ive become even more famous as a recluse than all the effort i put into being an influencer. the online theories and conspiracies popping up on social media are even crazier than my real life, and that says something.

i spend the rest of my days thinking about my lives and whether i lived this one better. when i reset, am i creating a new timeline? do i continue to age or is everything erased when i start over? knowing bill exists complicates that question. i think about meeting bill next time up. am i hyping it too much in my mind that im setting myself up for disappointment?

when the question finally arrives, it couldnt have come soon enough. im 41, which in itself is a bit irksome, since the difference in resets is greater than 5 years. i still dont have a handle on the whole mr. smiley thing and how much time i will have in my next life. i can only assume from the progression of 55, 51, 41, that it will be shorter. will i only have ten years? less? more? i have no clue. 

i waste no time responding to mr. smiley. ive been longing for this moment for what feels an eternity. i didnt screw up this life, but did i really accomplish anything meaningful?

i press yes and im back to twenty with all that comes from a youthful body. i call up the calendar app on my iphone 3g, which is on the same page as mr. smiley, and add an entry for january 1st of the next year. washington monument at noon. i cant fucking wait!"
[wp] we are victims of a war older than the mothers of our fathers. how the hell do you suppose we can stop a conflict that well soon have to fight in ourselves?,"i stare at my good brother, and smile.  
if not us, whom will soon have to fight in the war ourselves...who else will stop it? i ask.  
he sighs.  
for decades, this war has been going on. the blood spilled, the lives reaped, the villages burnt, the atrocities caused, and done by both side... how are we supposed to make people forget them? he asks.  
i shake my head.  
not forget them, accept them. i say.  
he frowns.

  
you want people to accept that their loved ones were brutally killed...or worse? he asks.  
no. i want people to accept that this has been done, and it is bad, so we should act better. why fight fire with fire, when all it does is make the hatred run deeper? i say.  
he sighs.  
i love you brother, but your idealistic views are impossible to be put into real life. i know of mages that used infants as research materials, on both sides.  
warriors that used the blood of the enemy to breakthrough...and other such events.  
how do you bridge this ocean of hatred? he asks.  
i smile.

  
with understanding. with hope. with the prospect of a future where our people dont have to send their 3 year old kids to start training martial arts, so that at 15 they can be enrolled and sent to missions. i say.  
i agree. before my brother could say something, a voice said.  
he sprung up, to see a few people approaching our hideout.  
you invited...them? he points at the newcomers.  
witches, and druids, and a warrior...from the enemy kingdom.  
mothers, and fathers...whom want their children to live more than to 20. i say.  
they came unarmed, and bearing gifts.  
my brother slowly calmed down.

  
we have spread your message, and many resonate with it...but just like your own brother, they are skeptical on how this can be done. one of them says.  
i smile.  
on our side, we have at least 5 thousand active soldiers that have joined my cause. it is not enough, but it is a start. the civilians on the other hand are in the tens of thousands, happily contributing to our movement. i say.  
so then what is the plan? my brother asks.  
spread our message publicly, challenge the warmongers, and if push comes to shove...remove the obstacles to our peace. i say.  
so...instead of a life of fighting, we fight for our lives, and that of others? he grins.  
i nod.  
we will have plenty of places to hide, and to rest. we have to do this. are you in? i ask him.  
if not us...then who? he smirks, as we shake hands, and thus, the brotherhood of peace was officially founded, and we started our mission of spreading a message of peace, and understanding."
"[wp] you only know one spell, and it isnt even a highlevel spell. but between its versatility and your creativity, youve still made a name for yourself.","the knocking on my door always started early, and i groaned in annoyance, keeping my eyes closed, trying to will them away. the knocking continued off and on for several minutes, then footsteps retreated. i cracked an eye open. bloody hell, it is just past day break. maybe i should go ahead and hire some staff to help manage things.

i rolled out of bed, literally. the thud into the floor wasnt comfortable, but it was cathartic in how it exactly described how i felt. i lay for a few minutes, any attempt at rising felt like it was going to betray the piece of me that denied all ambition today.

more knocking startled me awake, still on the floor. and now i hurt from various pressure points. okay okay. im up. but not open for business.

go away! i yelled. 

the knocking only got louder. muttering more curses i grabbed a bed sheet off the bed and wrapped it around myself, stumbling to the door. yanking it open i see what i knew id find. another couple, hopeful looks quickly vanishing to uncertainty. what. it wasnt a question.

they hemmed and hawed briefly like they always do, trying to figure out how to ask for my help. i cut through it, i charge an early morning fee of 5 darses before breakfast. i hadnt before, i made that up on the spot actually. annoyance was my overriding feeling, and i would be thrilled if they went away. well, thrilled is too much energy. 

without hesitation they pulled out a coin purse and counted out the money, holding it out to me. i stared at it. it was literally 5 times what i normally charged. fine. but you will have to talk it out at my breakfast table while i get myself something to eat.

a few minutes later i pottered around my kitchen making myself some bacon and eggs while they talked quietly at the table. it was the same old troubles. he thought he was doing what she wanted, she wasnt communicating clearly, he was shutting down, she was getting angry. but they talked it out clearly thanks to my spell.

their talking abruptly stopped when i plunked myself down at the table, my plate of food nearly between them. all sorted out yet? 

they looked at each other, then back at me. it isnt an unlimited time you know. spell will be up in a few minutes.

he immediately replied, how much for you to recast it?

once per day only im afraid. it wasnt. my spell didnt affect me. their faces went crestfallen. you dont need a spell you know. you could just be clear and honest about your intentions and goals normally.

they struggled to accept that. they always did at first. baggage, trauma, yada yada yada. i understood why people needed mediators and referees. but this wasnt the profession i wanted. i wanted to make things in my shop.

i watched them leave, still talking, he was holding a list of therapists in his hand. they would figure it out. they cared enough to come to me and that meant a lot for their intentions.

i still had no idea why my granted spell was aura of clarity and honesty. i dont like people."
"[wp] one day, you wake up to discover you have something similar to the midas touch. but instead of gold, what you touch turns to wood. very expensive, very hard to care for luxury wood.","oh wow! i exclaimed. i can get rich by selling wood now! i will be a millionaire. i was about to touch my honda accord and turn it into a wooden accord when i had a thought. i could also destroy my enemies with this power... i could turn people into wood just by touching them. if i wanted to, i could be this generations wooden medusa. 

i slowly started snickering and let out a psychopathic laugh. but first, i needed to try it out and see if it works on people. 

so later than night i went downtown and found a homeless man sleeping next to a staircase at a bank. i bent over poked him on the cheek, and from the point where i poked him, his whole body slowly began to turn to wood.

shit i could get in trouble if i am caught, i immediately thought to myself. so i picked up the wooden corpse and brought it back to my house.

once i got back home, i decided that i did not need a wooden corpse of a homeless man sleeping. so i chopped it up and they him into my fireplace  thus getting rid of my evidence. 

the following day, i was at work at my accounting firm and overheard everybody in the breakroom talking about how i was the worst accountant in the whole firm. 

i immediately started seeing red and walked into the room, locking the door behind me. i walked over to rebecca, the hr agent, touched her on the forehead and turned her into wood. immediately, the rest of the people in the room started screaming and tried to get out. 

john  my boss, tried punching me, but that backfired as he turned to wood the second he touched me. 

i grabbed the wrists of the people trying to unlock the door and turned them to wood as well. 

unfortunately, there was an intern, max, just a junior in college. i honestly really liked this guy, he was a hardworking, honest man who never partied and cared for his family. but today was his unlucky day as he picked the wrong time to go to the break room. the intern was smart,though he knew what would happen if he touched me, so he threw a chair threw the window and tried jumping out. the only problem was that the intern did not have a good jump and ended up slicing his whole body up on the broken glass and bled out almost instantly on the ground. 

however, i moved too slow, destroying my coworkers. jennifer  the newly hired accountant live livestreamed the whole thing and called the police. instantly, i sprinted to her, turned her to wood and ran out outside. but as soon as i got outside, , there were military helicopters in the sky, dozens of army trucks and military personnel pointing guns at me. 

i froze like a deer in headlights. before i could think of a plan, someone yelled fire!! and bullets started flying towards me. i thought i was dead meat, but to my surprise the bullets seemed to bounce off me. i bent over and picked up one of the bullets and found out the bullet turned to wood...

i then knew what i had to do. the world would never accept me with this power so i must destroy it. i yelled out a war cry and slammed my fist on the ground. slowly the whole world started turning to wood, until every last thing  except the water was now wooden. all 9 billion people turned to wood. every national park turned to wood. ever nuclear bomb was now wooden.

i was now god. wood god. and from my new realm, i created wood people and became their god."

if i was informed that the box thing artefact could randomly get as hot as a fireball of crack maybe i wouldnt have but you information was faulty again replied a younger looking human called angela she wasnt that old about 28 you assume but next to the elf the contrast was stark.

oh im sorry that i couldnt get you the exact details on an artefact that has been in storage in the museum of the arcaneilogical society museum for the last 5000 years!!! siv screamed back her purplish face becoming flushed with redness 

really surprised considering you where alive for its discovery you old bitch angela said getting as red as the elf.

oh go fuck yourself you entitled brat! siv screamed back getting right in her face.

why dont you do it yourself coward angela screamed getting much more red.

"[wp] shortly after returning from your otherworldly adventures, you see someone accidently cast fireball. only then do you realize youve inadvertently brought magic with you to earth.","the cafe was nice and quiet, past the morning rush. i sipped the coffee i had ordered, as i scrolled through news sites on my laptop. despite remembering it, i still marvelled at the technology before me. orus had severely lacked in this regard, knowledge hoarded and guarded jealously, instead of avaliable at the click of a button here.

i didnt necessarily need to catch up. there wasnt anything important i needed to do. my adventures had landed me with a considerable amount of gold and jewels, so i wasnt hurting for money. the trickiest part had been exchanging it, as there were so many questions as to where it had come from. i was probably on a number of watch lists now, but humans were nothing for me to fear now.

i had magic. the only one with it here. without magical intention, nothing could pierce the amulet of hardened skin. the ring of purity prevented me from suffering from mundane poisons and diseases. in fact my once per month revival charm was enough anyway.

i browsed through the headlines idly, calm and steady. nothing to worry about here. at least, until i felt the change.

my magesense flashed. i was used to how it always went off back on orus, with magic used here and there. but it had been quiet around me since my return. until now.

my eyes shot up, focusing on the source. just in time to see an angry driver pointing at another. i couldnt hear, but i could see. i could see the conflux of power around his finger, reaching a peak before lashing out. a ball of fire rushed out, slamming into the other vehicle.

then i could hear. i could hear the screams, with a low roar underneath. it wasnt the strongest fireball, but it was still potent in a mageless world.

i didnt wait, knocking my chair over as i sprinted out. the people around me fled, as the once angry driver went pale. he stared at his finger, tremors starting to hit. it wasnt the look of a trained mage. it was that of a novice, casting their first spell.

touching the bracelet on my wrist, i flicked a spray of cold at the flaming car. it was easy enough to extinguish, as i turned my attention to the budding mage.

he was shaking. horror, awe and wonder fought for dominance, as he looked up. his voice was quiet, like a child caught being naughty. mmagic?

i nodded once, narrowing my eyes at him. magic.

examining his aura, i noticed how it was new. very new, as in barely two months old. surprisingly strong, but then again this was a grown man. it made me suspicious. suspicious enough to look around, glancing at bystanders.

their auras were many and varied, as with all beings. but there was a similarity between them all. they were all new. all fresh. all within the last two months.

all since my return. my gut dropped, as i came up with my theory. instinctively i knew it was right, but i would have to check. my return had sparked this. magic was life, but here it was dormant. until i had arrived, with my active magic. like a starter motor, it had begun to spread, waking up the world. waking up magic.

which meant this was only the beginning. mages would pop up everywhere, both weak and strong. knowing human nature, there would be a lot of problems following, and avoidable deaths. they needed training, but i was the only experienced mage in the world.

my head began to pound. i thought i would be free of responsibilities here, now i was back. but i wouldnt be free. knowing this was coming, i had to start making preparations. this was my fault after all. so it was my job to make the best of it.

which meant getting involved in politics once more."

"[wp] a young vampire tries to convince her elders so that they get fake tans, because noone will suspect anyone with a tan to be a vampire.","the elders council stares at me.  
you think that would work? one of them asks me.  
i nod.  
i already tried it out!   
not only did they not suspect as a vampire, despite my obvious fangs, and silver hair!  
but the fake tan protects us against sunlight to a certain degree! i say.  
the council looks at me, as discussion erupts.  
i await their questions.

  
have you charmed anyone to ask them why havent they suspected you?  
have you truly acted like a vampire, and still werent suspected? they ask me.  
i nod.  
i charmed several of them, and they all said that vampires are pale, and aloof.  
i also flirted with several human, my eyes turning red to charm them in public, and nothing happened.  
i also gave one of them a hickey on their neck, and people commented only on public showing of affection, but nothing about vampires. i say.  
how long ago was this? an elder asked, with his laptop prepared.  
2 weeks ago, in bucharest, midday, just before a book festival, and a pride parade so plenty of people roaming around. i say.  
he nods, and starts searching.

  
after 30 minutes, he shakes his head.  
i cant find any posts, or mentions of a possible vampire in bucharest.  
i did find a few posts about violet, but they are from either jealous girlfriends of the men she flirted with, or men fantasizing about her delinquent attire. he said, showing the other elders i guess the posts about me.  
quite the...attire. one of them comments.  
i shrug.  
human summer clothing.  
shows a lot of skin, which again, helps, because people would think that vampires are covering themselves completely against the sun! i laugh.  
they nod.

  
any injuries? or side effects? they ask.  
slight discomfort, and burning pain due to prolonged sunlight, but nothing deadly, or overly painful.  
due to the extreme usage of fake tan, it was a bit harder for me to recover from scratches, but thats all. i say.  
the council falls silent, as they look at each other.  
youngling violet, your proposal shall be put under testing by several vampire covens young ones.  
if it proves to be as useful as you depict, we shall raise you to the bloodline purity of a baroness, and give you a town to supervise. they say.  
thank you! i bow, and leave.  
i hope they do accept it, as it is an amazing breakthrough.

"[wp] you pretend to be a smalltime villain. at worst, you annoy the local supers but your crimes never hurt anyone. all fun and games until things change when a truly sadistic super villain invades your turf and murders a few of the supers. no one has seen the extent of your true powers until now.","professor power looks over the smoking ruins of brook city a metropolis laid to waste by one person. cars were upturned and reduced to mangled wreckages. streetlights bent and ripped in half by overwhelming force. the bodies of innocents. civilian, military, police. all rendered equal in this massacre. 

and the one thing that fills the professors mind the most, is star aqua holding the lifeless, broken body of star silver. two of a famous retinue of magical hero women, having modeled themselves equally on magical girls younger than they and amazonians who prided themselves on strength and combat. star ros is nowhere to be seen... 

until the smoke in front of the warrior women clears and a hulking brute stands tall, star ros held between its monstrous fingers. a maw filled with malice and hatred, twisting into a sickening grin of sadistic satisfaction. the mauler loved broken things! so much more beautiful than untarnished ones. 

professor power was never a violent man. he had never sought to bring harm to the star sisters, only to improve them through conflict. after all, to overcome a trial one must grow, and through growth one becomes strong. power was in his name he had enjoyed watching these young women become heroes in their own right. he had hounded them, an eternal antagonistic teacher since their days as the galaxy three, their former magical girl epithet. 

but today, he would bring his all to bear. 

the sky darkens, clouded over by an army of nanomachines. technology imbued with the professors own will, his own incredible intellect. every piece of technology down to the last molecule was his to command. and today, the command would be 

kill. 

the mauler is launched backward by a massive machine. so massive that it rivals the maniacal monster in sheer strength. the machine hisses with steam and fury, hydraulic strength rocketing it forward like a train on a path of pure destruction. the mauler roars and fights back, but is swiftly surrounded by two more of such machines. it is beaten brutally around the wreckage of the city, only managing to bring one of the mighty drones down with his ineffective might. pain could deter a human opponent, but against metal? there was no stopping a six hundred pound mindless hulk of fury and metal, let alone two of them. 

by the end of the battle, the mauler is crucified in the ruins of brook city, a warning to every and all villains who might hurt the star sisters again. 

the professor of power was very educated in the ways in which one could be destroyed systematically, as strength comes from pain too. as the limbless, deaf and debilitated mauler came to know."

"[wp] the war was a hundred years ago, yet you still find yourself startling easy. unsecured cargo hitting the inside your hull sounds awfully similar to a boarding vessel. youre about to disregard the sounds when you realize the ships mass has increased.","triaskan bioships were... something else. theres no proper way of describing a ship capable of regrowing bulkheads and pimpslapping strike craft out of the way as it bites the command deck off an unresisting standard combat vessel. their development and widespread use completely changed the tide of the war.

but, afterwards, once the wartime mentality was gone, there came the questions most importantly of all, what do you do with a self aware spaceship? its a living, breathing photosynthesising being. one that has done frontline military service, at that. you cant just scrap them. 

and so, they retired. the original intention had been to graft off the combat organs, but due to the skyrocketing piracy after the war, it was decided to leave them on.

so now tharass worked in shipping. as the, uh, ship. they  the command mind and its assorted subsystemminds  were paid a fair wage, and kept well stocked with supplies. the corporation figured having an unstaffed ship was actually cheaper than staffing a standard vessel and just left tharass to do its thing. 

which was trudging slowly between systems hauling cargo. normally it was dull. just something to pay the bills. but every now and then, tharass got an interesting run.

this was one of those.

bioships, due to their regenerative hulls, were supremely well suited to navigating through cosmic storms. they also had to shut off their sensors  and pain receptors  to go through one... but tharass would be fully regenerated by the time he reached his destination, whereas a standard lifeless ship would likely limp into port weeks late, and in need of serious repairs. and expensive repairs. 

but, tharass saw the beauty in the storms, and this long after the war, they didnt even mind shutting off their sensors. 

of course, like any veteran  triaskan, or bioship  tharass had every sensor turned to full until the very last second. a storm was a perfect place for an ambush.

as expected though, no ambush came, and the paranoid old warship entered the edges of the whirling nebula calmly. 

and what a beautiful storm it was. it had engulfed the entirety of the ikaan system, painting the whole thing in cerulean blues and empyrean yellows as exotic compounds crystallised in the energies of the storm. the normally violet nebula that filled the system was alight with luminous currents.

tharass was a warship. former warship, but nonetheless, a warship. this meant they didnt really have a concept of beauty. but, as the command mind developed, and the years passed, they had begun to log things which were nice to look at. 

this storm was one of those, and since tharass route wouldnt take them through any of the more intense parts, they could quite enjoy it."
"[wp] medievallooking room. old wizard people. knights in armor. let me guess. you guys summoned me to be the hero to defeat some evil dark lord in this magical fantasy realm. an elder speaks to you, actually, we already did that. we want you to become the new interim leader of the dark lands.","it was a rough night at the frat house. plenty of drunken laughter. there was a midnight raid of sigma phi delta and can you believe that the nerds were caught red handed playing dd? man, we really trashed their game and they were royally pissed about it but what could they do? they sat there pissing in their own togas.

yeah, well that wasnt the craziest shit that happened. i had too much beer. i remember sophia leading me to a bed. she had this look on her face.  crazy sophia. but, drunk as i was, i thought, wtf. right? everyones doable with enough embalming fluid in ya, right? only, i must have passed out. i dont remember much more than falling onto the bed and then blackout. 

i woke up with a pounding headache. i let out a long belch that echoed around the room. something was different because my room was small and well padded with posters of rockers.  i open my eyes, trying to adjust to the blur while the light bored into my skull like two drills. 

medieval looking room. old wizard people. knights in armor. the acid in my stomach roiled, burning as it rose up my throat. i swear at least two kegs worth of beer spewed out of my mouth onto the stone floor. thats when i realized i was naked. 

good one, i said. where are the geeks who put you up to this? i have a mind to kill those sigma phi deltas, but theyve really outdone themselves. maybe just a mild slapping for the realism.

hes perfect, the knight says.

hell do, said the wizard. 

lets face it, says the elder. were desperate.

ouch, i say. but i play along. let me guess. you guys summoned me to be the hero to defeat some evil dark lord in this magical fantasy realm. i air quote the last part to let them know im playing along. 

actually, the elder says, we already did that. we want you to become the interim leader of the dark lands he lorded over.

fine, i say. but can someone get me a towel and some clothes? i try not to let them know that they succeeded in embarrassing me by leaving me naked and covered in my own puke. 

so, says the wizard. he agreed. can we do it now?

he clearly wasnt sincere, said the knight. will it work if he doesnt mean it?

he doesnt even believe you, sophia says as she approaches with a towel. she tosses the towel at me. it bounces off my chest. somebody throw a bucket of water on him. he stinks.

a bucket floats from the corner of the room as if on an invisible string and tips over my head. my mouth agape and my eyes wider, the bracing water pours from the bucket until the puke is puddled on the floor. certainly the bucket wasnt large enough to hold all of that water. 

dont fret, young man, the wizard says. the summoning spell often has that affect on the summoned. also, only organic matter is transported.

sophia, i say. thank god. stop this prank at once.

its not a prank, steve, she says. i was transported to your world to find the best candidate to fill the position. you checked all the boxes. really, you are the biggest dick on campus.

i cover my genitals. sophia smirks. 

look outside if you dont believe me.

i wrap the filthy towel around my waist and walk over to a white stone ballustraded balcony. i stand in the chill morning air with the sun rising in the distance. deep shadows cover the land but im clearly not in florida. smoke coils from numerous blast zones and most horrid of all deformed creatures roamed the land beaten and broken after some terrible conflict. almost immediately after i stood on the balcony, one of the beaten looks up perhaps catching a glimpse of movement and shouts, pointing. 

a new lord has risen! a new lord has risen!

slowly, the masses of bent and broken creatures turn towards the tower and look up at me, taking up the chant. soon, hundreds of thousands of them are cheering me on. if i had more contents in my stomach, i would have heaved a second time. 

yeah, well that wasnt the craziest shit that happened either."
"[wp] i think whoever put the rock  the stone should be king, not whatever chucklefuck pulls it out. i assume whoever put the sword that makes you king into a rock doesnt want the position. i think the rock should be king because it held the sword the longest.","astron hated artifacts. always so...important. whoever pulls the sword of kings out of the stone will claim the throneor some shit like that, whoever thought that was a good idea should be shot. in fact, he has half a mind to go do that right now, it would shut the damn tourists up at least.

well, he says tourists. adventurers is technically the correct term. mercenaries looking to make a name for themselves, knights with nothing better to do, disgraced nobles hoping to get their old bloodline back in the right place, all congregating in some random hunting town in the middle of fucking nowhere because some dickhead thought it a good idea to stab an artifact into a rock and speak a prophecy about it. no this had to stop. all those idiots milling about annoying the townsfolk had to go find something better to do, and that damn sword had to fucking go as well.

as he stalks over to the town square, he can hear the innane chatter from the peanut gallery as they watch another dumbfuck try his luck. the rock, king? honestly not the worst option for the job, astron had seen worse. often times when lookingg in the mirror. when he gets t othe edge of the crowd and starts forcing his way through, at first he finds some resistance and indignant responses before people realise who he is and begin to make way, murmurs and gasps spreading through the crowd.

when he gets to the open area in the middle of the crowd, he doesnt waste time saying anything he just shoots the guy whose currently trying to pull the sword out. some noble fuck dressed in way too fancy clothes for someone supposedly down on his luck after his family got stomped on in that kerfuffle 300 years ago. it doesnt surprise astron much when the mans body turns to mist and vanishes, you dont get this intense about royaltygranting blades without having a personal reason for it. he looks around the crowd, the midday sun glinting off of the vibrant green metal of his trusty revolver as he raises it in the air in warning

anyone wanna try next? i have plenty of bullets for all of you rash asshats, so who wants to be first?

the silance is his answer. shock, fear, and apprehension tinge the air. he can taste the fear especially strong, takes him a second to stop himself from savoring it. they know who he is, that much is obvious. no need to dwell on it and make an unfortunate mistake

no? excelent. now heres whats going to happen. all of you are going to get the fuck out of here and forget this whole thing happened. that there sword does not belong to any of you, and whoever put it there was either pulling a prank or trying to pul lof some kind of scheme. either way you do not want the attention becoming king in that way brings.

some idiot steped out of the crowd, all shining and thus clearly unused armor and puffed up ego. a new noble then, looking to make a name for himself. dumbass

shiny astron didnt dignify the man with a better name in his mind and who are you to decide that, you faceless abomination? why do you care about the kingdoms of mortals? you withdrew from the world thousands of yours ago, you do not now get to complain!

astron sighs and shoots that guy too. he has long since learned that even entering the debate with such assholes means you already lost. best to just never start it. with some mild interest he nots that the body simply drops dead and stays there. the idiot knew who astron was, and still decided to step up and insult him with no backup plan? man mortals are idiots sometimes

alright if anyone else wants to demonstrate to me why they are not fit to be king, please do so now, i would hate to have to shoot you fuckers one by one.

the crowd is really getting into it now, shock, fear, and dread mixing in the air and making his skin tingle. he could feel the skin over his mouth begin to tear open a little, and it took most of his learned control to shut that shit down. dammit.

he turns on his heel and walks up to the stone, wrapping one hand around the hilt and seamlessly pulling the sword out of the stone. shit like this, with this kind of enchantment on it, was smart enough to know to not piss him off. and so it freed itself.

now, this sword is going back to where it belongs, and you dumbfucks are going home. if i came back here and see any of you still milling about, then you can get some firsthand experience on what a bullet tastes like.

it wasnt a panic, but it was damn close. the crowd dispersing very quickly indeed once he made his point. good, so they werent all brain dead. that is heartening. while the crowd leaves, he takes a good look at the sword itself. its craftsmanship was exquisit, for what its worth. and so wonderfully engraved too, finding who it belongs to should be ah shit thats his own makers mark. goddammit

nothing is every easy, is it? goddammit. now i have to fucking keep it, great. just great. well, time to go then, i suppose.

he shunts the sword over to hammerspace and starts to leave town again, heading towards his cottage while the townspeople get to work wrangling the tourists. he had some people to contact, things to ask around about, bandits to eatt the soul of, a sword to explain democracy to. it was gonna be a long damn night."

is this your baby sister? he said, nodding towards the little lady currently getting a plaster on her grazed knee. she stuck her tounge out in affirmation.

yeah.

do you ever get it where you only tap or move her out of the way, but she overreacts and cries, and now youre somehow the bad guy? replied the medic.

the kids eyes lit up. that happens to you, too?

yeah. i tried to move my sister out of the way of some oncoming cars, but i grabbed her too hard and my mom and dad said i hurt her.

thats not fair!

the soldier laughed. now, what if i could make sure that your sister could never tattle on you ever again? in fact, what if she could never speak again?

that would be a big relief for mommy and daddy.

are you sure about that? she wouldnt be able to tell you if she hurt herself, or if she loved you, or if she had a nightmare.

then... thats wrong?

who decides if things are right and wrong?

well... doesnt everybody?

whos everybody?

the kid looked puzzled and repeated himself everybody?

yes... and what if loads of big, powerful men decided that girls like your mommy and your sister werent allowed to talk.

thatd be... bad... and wrong.

would it? everyones been told that its right, so only youd be wrong.

well, i dont care what would be wrong, cos my mpmmy and rhii can say what they want in my daddys house.

and what if they paid you lots and lots of money? or threatened to take you away from your mommy and rhii because they were allowed to talk? or that they would threaten to tell your friends about the last time you called the teacher mommy?

thatd be...

weve been fighting to make sure that your mommy and rhii and all your aunties and your girl classmates can all grow up and have a voice and be big, independent ladies. the big men who do all the important stuff that run this country dont like that, and theyve been saying that we are bad men. but were really trying not to be... tears grew in the medics eyes.

when the shell hit your block, that was... we never meant for any of that to happen. we were working on shit intel and now weve put you and your family at risk and its all our fault. were so extremely lucky. youre so extremely lucky. little man... can you forgive me for almost accidentally hurting your family?

the medic threw himself into the boys mercy, under his bandaged arm, trying to kill sobs that were leaking out.

do you promise that it wont happen again? that wasnt a toy, you could seriously hurt someone with that.

the medic composed himself and tried his best to grab most of the kids palms.

...i promise, little man.



the roaring engine of the technical came to a stop as max put the locket back into his shirt. rhii was safe, evacuated several years ago. his comrades filtered out of the back, with him following last. he hopped off the stair on to the dusty sands below. the acrid smell of gasoline and openair cooking sang alongside his homelands native spices and recipies. he remembered there were things worth fighting for."

"[wp] the miniature vampire girl lives in the back of your fridge, sustaining herself with leftovers from the food you make many years later youre getting too old to cook anymore, she notices and appears before you, offering to make you younger and immortal so you can keep feeding her your food.","it had been a long night.

you knew the end was coming. 

all these years you just lived alone after all you knew had either left years earlier, or were just too old just like you by now.

life had not been too bad to you, the decades spend as a cook in a small restaurant never made you rich, but then, you never went into this for the money did you? it was a love of the art of the taste and sensations.

sure it did nothing for your figure when you mastered the desserts, ice creams of unique flavours, pastries filled in ways that would make a souflet stand up straight to not disappoint you. 

but time, time was marching forward. you could not hold the hours anymore, running the kitchen became a chore with more pain then joy.

and that is why you are now alone, unable to even make yourself a convenience pudding. your legs betraying you as much as the back stabbing like cesars last moments.

a sigh escaped your throat and you just had to think of your fridge. something else had been going on all these years. leftovers vanishing, sometimes your microwave was left open or the counter definitely tidied up after someone had a snack.

well, life was odd and you got up to go to bed as you turned around and saw her. for the first time you laid eyes on the little food thief standing infront of the empty fridge.

no leftovers today? the little, outright tiny girl, asked you with a pleading tone.

uhhhh. was all that escaped your throat.

ohhh ehh hi there, i am selina, i uhh, am sorry but ive been living in your fridge.

wh... why? a short stammer.

please dont laugh, or judge me, but uhm i tried to hide there one day from a hunter, thought i would die, but then you left so much food, i could survive.

what are you? you finally asked, somehow you were not afraid even at this odd appearance of a little girl in a gown like dark dress, red glowing eyes, and quite prominent fangs. well it would be hard to be afraid of anything the size of your hands.

a vampire. she said and cocked her head sideways.

dont you need like, well, you know, blood? a question after a few blinks.

not really, the hunters say that, but we just need lifeforce, and your food was always so full of it. all the love and energy you put into every bite. some of us can just live of hobby videos or watching performances, but i think your food is much better. she smiled broadly.

ohhh, my food is that good then? you beamed with enough pride a dragon would blush and got a chuckle.

absolutely delicious! oberon would surely trade fairly for it! she beamed back.

so, uhhh, well, then i am sorry i cannot give you more. i am too old to cook anymore. but it was nice knowing someone truly enjoyed it. you said with another weary sigh.

uhhh, if i help you with that, can you make something nice? she asked a bit sheepish.

help?

oh yeah, i can give you some of my blood and will it to give you your youth and life back. no strings attached. she bit her small hand and held it out like an offering.

she has not yet had to make her choice. her time does not end here. she has many years ahead of her

how? she cant survive this. theres, theres so much blood. too much blood. are you saying someone manages to help her? to save her?

in a way. someone will find her before she passes, but they will be unable to make her whole again. her body, her mind. hers will be a life of suffering. of pain and loss. she is one of the few i pity their existence

for those interested, a short summary

a girl named emi wakes up in the body of the evil villainess of a novel.  
she always felt the character deserved better, so she works to do just that.

but in the end, she gets betrayed, humiliated and discarded by people she thought where friends so brutally, that she goes catatonic. when she does, the original persona, the villainess reemerges and takes control back.

except she deeply cared for the girl that tried so save her, so she vows to take down those who harmed her emi. she uses her own knack for deviousnessruthlessness, combined with the knowledge she learned from emis memories, while locked away. she has knowledge of modern techniques and the whole plot of the book shes in.

she falls silent. yeah, this always happen.

all the same story  part 2


the tower welcomed us.


no doors, walls or stairs. just narrative gravity, pulling us forward as the parchment ground crinkled beneath our feet. each step penned itself behind us in curling black ink. our actions became prose before they were even completed.


he hesitated.


i stopped midstride.


what? i asked no one in particular.


the words shimmered beneath my boots. the doctor hesitated.


i took another step. they reformed.


the doctor pressed on, burdened by questions that would soon demand answers.


i glanced at q. you seeing this?


he replied, looking still as smug as ever. oh yes. this is someones draft space. a very messy one.


the knight touched the wall of nothing. it rippled like silk, revealing glimpses of abandoned worlds. a steampunk revolution crushed in a footnote. a fairytale heroine devoured by her own happy ending. a war between punctuation marks. all halfwritten. all discarded.


we are inside a mind, he muttered, not a place.


the neanderthal grunted and pointed ahead. the hallway,if it could be called that, had shifted. now it resembled a train car from a noir thriller red velvet seats, smoke curling in slow loops, a jazz score humming just beneath reality.


sitting at the far end, legs crossed, was a woman.


young. pale. lips smudged red. and in her lap a notebook.


she looked up at us, pen frozen above the page. oh, she said. you werent supposed to make it this far.


who are you? i asked, stepping forward.


she sighed. that depends on the story.


i stopped dead.


q tutted. no no no. thats my line.


the woman snapped the notebook shut. instantly, the knight dropped his sword, as if hed never held it. the neanderthal blinked, confused, now wearing a tweed suit. the man in the cowl vanished in a puff of ellipses.


you cant just i started.


she opened the notebook a crack. my mouth closed of its own accord.


q stepped forward. you rewrote them. just like that.


she nodded. i dont have time for complications. i was trying to build something elegant. symbolic. and then your kind kept wandering in.


my kind?


runaways. crossovers. broken toys. you fall through genre cracks and refuse to stay put. i tried isolating the timelines, putting up narrative fences, even disabling character arcs. but noyou always find your way in.


and thats a problem? i asked, voice slowly returning.


youre diluting the fiction, she said, like a teacher scolding a child. i wanted a tight plot. three acts. neat resolutions. but then you showed up and brought your companions and quips and continuity baggage. youre noise in a quiet story.


q clapped. bravo. wonderful villain monologue. bit overwritten, but the contempt is authentic.


she ignored him.


im not here to ruin your story, i said, stepping closer. im here because mine was erased.


no, she said. it was revised.


something in her voice cracked. not anger. regret.


i used to write fanfiction, she whispered. you were my favorite. so clever. but then you stopped surprising me. you became formula. i wanted something new. something mine.


you erased me because you outgrew me? i asked quietly.


she held up the notebook. i made this. i make everything now. and you? youre just echoes of a phase i passed through.


q leaned in. thats the thing about echoes. they bounce back.


i lunged.


she tried to open the notebook, but i was faster. sonic in hand, i blasted the pen from her fingers. ink exploded midair and sprayed the vanishing scene in dripping black loops.


the tower shuddered.
the knight reappeared midstrike, cleaving an exclamation mark from the air. the neanderthal tore off the tweed like a skin hed never agreed to wear. the cowl reformed from shadow, batman stepping forward, silent and furious.


the woman stumbled back.


you dont understand, she said. if you destroy this place, i wont exist.


no, i said. youll finally stop rewriting us."

she is a mountain demon, a royal demon standing tall, and proud, with horns and everything.

heh...i reincarnate as the hero, and you as the demon queen i have to kill. can it be considered that i killed you our last lives, and it is done? i say.  
she giggles, and pinches me.  
one you didnt kill me, and two i doubt it works that way. but we have to solve this somehow. she says.  
i nod, and ask her about the demons situation.  
she tells me how the demon empire is in a wasteland where barely anything grows, and demons have to resort to stealing, and attacking if they want to live.  
i also tell her about how the humans, and the other demihumans see the demons.  
we both sigh.

  
it will be hard, wont it? she asks.  
i nod.  
thousands of years of rivalry, and wars will be hard to be bypassed. but together we can do it. i smile.  
how? she asks.  
the wars took a toll on both our forces, and while we are ready for the last battle...the people back home are terrified. i say.  
same...not all demons love violence. she says.  
so, alice, or rather queen lebeth von argent, will you marry me, and bring peace upon the lands? i ask.  
she squeals.  
yes! she says, kissing me.  
we discuss a bit more how to say this to our people, but it is worth a try, and if it doesnt work the nice way, well...  
the hero is the strongest entity of the allied forces, while the demon queen is the queen, so if the nice approach doesnt work, we can use the forceful one."
"[wp] you and three friends break into a highly classified government facility at 317 am on thursday and leave with two antigravity prototypes, a weather control drone, and a suspiciously polite alien named greg.","okay guys, remember the drill, we pretend were the transport crew, danny briefed his friends. were here to ensure the antigravity prototypes and the weather control drone are shipped to another secure facility.

dude, you sure we can pass security like this? paul was understandably skeptical as they stopped the van and waited for the security forces to inspect them.

easily, danny shrugged. these high and mighty military types look down on lowly logistics staff.

its also 3am, robert added. which is decidedly not working hours.

special emergency, danny said. theyve received a tipoff that some wannabe thieves might try to steal these topsecret assets at about 4am.

...youre kidding right? you tip them off, and then come in and steal before the supposed timing? paul was incredulous. dammit.

im a genius, am i right? danny smirked. alright, pipe it down, the guards are coming this way.

whats your business? a security guard asked robert, who was in the drivers seat.

eagleway logistics. were here to transport these assets  antigravity prototypes and a weather control drone. heres our paperwork.

the guard snatched the thick stack of documents with a bored look and gave them a cursory glance. yeah, uh looks legit. go in.

just like that? paul asked.

just like that.

they parked the van and entered the building with the stolen staff pass danny had snitched a few days earlier. he had tracked down a senior staff to a luxury diner and posed as a waiter there to quietly nab the pass. now, all they needed to do was head over to where the assets were located.

if they knew their way around the base.

gentleman, you appear to require assistance, a voice spoke from...somewhere.

they jumped, only to see a thin, gray man with bulging black eyes and elongated limbs.

greetings, humans. i am greg, martian explorer of the expanse, he smiled and did a dramatic bow. how can i help you?

were here to transport antigravity prototypes and a weather control drone, danny spoke with an authoritative tone like he was in charge. take us there.

very well, sir. i will lead the way, greg gestured towards a long corridor. please follow me.

do we trust this alien? paul whispered.

robert quickly scanned their environment before nodding.

here, gentlemen, the alien pointed to the huge metal door at the end of the long corridor. what you seek lies beyond this door that i cannot open.

a swipe of the staff pass, and they were in. there wasnt any security, much to pauls surprise. danny then said something about how they already made it pass security in the first place, and that they should gather up what they came here for.

which were too heavy for the humans to lift.

allow me, greg chimed in cheerfully. with a wave of his hands, the antigravity prototypes and the drone floated across the hallway and landed neatly on the trolley the men had brought.

thank you...but why? robert was confused.

you looked like you needed help, that is all, greg bowed again. as for me, i was hoping you can show me around your country. the other staff in this base insisted that i stay here for my safety, and to quell rumours of unidentified flying objects. but thats boring.

the men proceeded to push their haul out of the hallway and make their way back towards their getaway van. all while the gray man whistled and twiddled his thumbs, floating along the way.

halt! a security guard cut in front of them. who are you, and where are you taking these assets?

were from eagleway logistics, danny flashed his fake visitors pass. were transporting these assets to another secure location.

which one?

zercon bay.

the guard paused for a moment before signaling them to go. if you see any suspicious figures, let us know. weve received a tipoff that thieves may be coming in soon.

these are not the thieves you are looking for. greg spoke in a much deeper voice.

no, of course not, the guard stared blankly as though there was some jedi mind trick going on.

you knew, danny turned to face greg.

the guards dont know. yet. let us keep it this way, shall we? the alien had this huge, creepy smile as he tented his long fingers. let us be on our way.

the rest of the crew was starting to think greg was...sus. more suspicious than aliens in vents among us. but they could not deny he was helping them, just for reasons they didnt know.

so, are we heading to zercon bay for real, or where are we going to put these stuff we stole? paul had important questions to ask. and that staff pass, its bound to be reported lost soon.

that senior staff likes going to that same luxury diner, danny replied. i could probably slip it back in so he thinks he was just forgetful. dudes like 70 years old, you know.

but the assets. these are heavy as hell.

it was at this moment, greg interjected. we can put my experimental prototypes back into my spaceship where they truly belong.

few enjoyed the world in its current state. the weapons manufacturers, resource barons, and political elites that manifested this global devastation were profiting off of it and sought to prolong it in perpetuity. to the rest of the world, it seemed that a world war was on the horizon. few wanted that besides those manipulated by elite media, but with each passing day more of the public saw through the propaganda.

terry saw through it from the start, but he didnt see the tide shifting with him. terry was so disheartened by the atrocities committed by his fellow man that you could rarely get a word out of him. if you saw terry on the street, he was liable to either shoot you a dirty look or spit on you depending on how his day was going. terry wouldnt feel bad about it either. you probably deserved it. he spent all his day watching the news so he knows youre capable of some pretty awful things, like the rest of the humans on this godforsaken planet. 

terry was ready for it all to end. man did not deserve to inherit the earth and terry was ready to fast track its destruction, he just needed the opportunity. after all, terry was an underemployed thirtysomething that flipped patties so he could rent out his uncles garage and pay off the masters that his guidance counselor ensured him would lead to a great career, how would a guy like him speed up the worlds end?

he couldnt. not until the stars aligned. it couldnt have happened to a nicer guy. one day, at 1111am, while terry was spitting in a customers milkshake, he looked out the window to see a shooting star. terry plucked out some eyelashes and blew them into the milkshake for good measure as he made his wish i wish we could have a devastating world war, he said. 

terry had some spring in his step for the rest of the day. he knew planetary destruction was coming soon and it made him giddy. he didnt even kick a child or monsterinthemaking, as he referred to them on his walk back from work. he gets home and starts his doomscroll, expecting to see reports of nuclear devastation, war crimes, and official war declarations from state powersinstead he finds that the public has turned on the elites.

soldiers turn their guns on dirty politicians, security forces fail to protect the billionaires that hired them, mobs come for the powers that had been making their lives miserable for decades. terry didnt wish for the end of the world, he wished for international liberation. global revolution began in africa and inspired citizens elsewhere. this was the first time in a long time terry saw the good in people. 

the wars were short, the people took over with little opposition. terry thought this was a world worth living in. alas, his life stayed pretty much the same because everyone hated him. his uncle actually raised the rent. rent was abolished in terrys country but his uncle was given special accommodations because terry is the worst."

she was looking at me.  staring, pleading with her eyes, reaching with her arms holding out her coat.  rain was falling over her and she hardly blinked.  i used to point out it was a tell that she was more comfortable in the water than regular people, but it wasnt something she could change.  maybe it was and she didnt bother.  i wouldnt know, she never talked much.

im not a man, i will never be a man. i cant give you the children you want.  find someone who can give you that!  
i was screaming into the rain.  this is good it will cover any tears.  i cant look at that face for more than a few moments without being struck by a want tied to my soul, and desire that makes my entire body vibrate.  

i started pleading with her. what do you want me to do?
as my arms opened towards her in my frustration, she took the first opportunity to drape her coat over my arm and walk past me into the house. again.

i turned to follow her in, but for the first time, she held out her hand and indicated the coat.  in broken scottish i heard her order hide it well.

i march away in the rain.  i want to hurt something, but i cant bring myself to ever scratch her coat, and that makes it worse.  

why does she keep doing this?  i feel her cry when she thought i was sleeping, i try to let her go, and as soon as i am over the pain she is back at my door.  its been years at this point and i cant move on or out or anywhere to or anyone else.  i keep trying to do right by her, so why am i tortured for it?

there is a cove a half mile from the house.  she knows it well its the first place i found her.  im too resentful to follow directions well, so i place the coat where i know no other humans can find it, but she would know in a moment.  

on the trek back i am slower.  i already know how this will go.  i love her and am terrified of doing this again, losing myself again.  i consider walking the extra mile to the pub, but that wont change the outcome. 

i knock at my own door.  she answers and kisses me.  my heart cracks and reforms by the second as i carry her to my bed.

she is not crying over night, but i know it is a matter of time.

come morning i fry up the last of the eggs with some salted fish and i see them  two selkies, the youngest ive ever seen.  they are helping each other out of their coats and walking  walking here?  

my beautiful selkie is so happy.  she points to them out the window, hopping and clapping.  i demand to know what is going on.

she looks at me like i was an idiot.  you father now.  she runs out to meet the little ones.  i stand dumbfounded.

i cry watching her ushering me outside, watching her fuss over these two naked children.

i thinkdid she think she failed me?  were all her tears for me, that she could not give me this?  had i turned her away and left her thinking i thought she was a problem?  i was never not a fool, but never more than now.

it did not matter now.  now i needed more eggs, and some clothes.  and i needed to rebury that coat."

the lady god crosses her arms, scowls and says, if you win, most likely you will fail and die a horrible death as all those before you have.

yah, yah, but when i win. what do i personally get from you?   i continued  can i have something from you instead of money?

lady god stopped tapping her foot, glaring at me, asked what are you asking for? 

i hold out my hand, make the deal. i will tell you everything once i have won.  

looking suspiciously at my outstretched hand, lady god says  you must use only what you have on your being right now.  no super future weapons, no help from other beings. just you.  lady god timidly raises her hand to mine. 

i grab her hand shaking it vigorously, deal no take back sees now my pretty little goddess  . 

she jerks her hand away, as i turn to face her kraken monster.  
a 20 foot tall hybrid monster with the body of a bull, head of an octopus with 8 tentacles for hair, clawed paws like a bear, and lions tail. all covered in purple scales. 
she should have picked better. 

i reached out with my mind , and pulled a giant oak tree up by the roots. spun the tree in the air several times. 
then began beating the lady god monster about the head and shoulders.  
the monster ran around for several seconds. before sub coming to the beating. and just collapsed on the earth dead. 
before the lady god could resurrect her monster. i flung it out into space. 

i dropped the tree, turned on the lady god and said,  i wish for you to become my wife

when a voice from the heavens sang out  yes, it shall be done. 

the lady god huffed but father, i dont want to get married, especially to him  she pouts pointing at me.

theres no comparison to suddenly gaining three limbs. it would not be the same as taking three away, which is all i can think to compare it to, and badly because ive never lost a limb. it feels a little like being clairvoyant, possessing the sixth sense. i tug at my hair and allow the babbling stream of curses to topple freely out of my mouth. is this better than cancer?

theres a knock. how polite. i love when they do that, as if its a teenagers bedroom.

is everything okay in there? 

i dont know.

the doctor opens the door, confused, worried.

i smile awkwardly, face red. ah hi. 

he relaxes for one second, assessing me as fine. and then he sees the issue. maybe its because my smile isnt alluring enough, or because its too sharptoothed and the hornlike growths on my head form a natural path for his eyes to reach the wings folded behind me. either way he drops the icepack and the clipboard both. his back meets the closed door. oh dear. he says, straightening his glasses with both hands as though crookedness can manifest devil wings. well maybe moral crookedness can.

but i consider myself a pretty moral person. hey. dont run i just well i dont know what i just did is this like a thing that happens? like how some people look kind of like neanderthals i know dinosaurs are a lot further back evolutionarily but maybe its like a recessive gene or something i feel like i wouldve heard it in the news or or some sort of buzzfeed article if people could just sprout wings but you tell me. iim definitely way less smart them you. i mean, you went to school for eight years to help people who are dying. thats well thats serious dedication. its great. youre noble. and i can tell youve got a a good soul. i mean,  im sure there are benefits good pay and all that. even if you dont have a family or i mean i just saw you didnt have a wedding ring. but youd probably take that off before putting the gloves on, i guess. and some people dont wear their wedding rings. and its okay if youyoure not even married uhmm i dont remember what i was trying to say. i fold my knees up infront of me and bite my lip to keep from overexplaining all that i dont know.

well youre an oncologist. you see  unprecedented all of the time

iidi dont think this is cancer. he clarifies.

i nod. i sort of expected that, but its always good to hear a professional opinion. so? i stretch out my wings for further observation and he shuts his eyes with a flinch. i close them again, flushing in embarrassment. maybe im the only one who thinks theyre kinda cool. whats the prognosis?

"[wp] the deal was struck when the time comes, i will return to claim your firstborn. years passed. the debt was all but forgotten and the entity reapeared. the debtor just said yeah about that. i never actually planned on having any kids in first place. so i dont have any","the man was old by this point. wealth was mostly gone he spent it all on various farming equipment, land, a small cottage, et cetera. we had expected him to take on a wife and have many children, in exchange for the wealth and health we gave him. but, he seemed to be perfectly satisfied on his own. 

several times, we even went so far as to disguise one of our own as a beautiful human woman and seduce him. but, he never gave in to his primal urges. we even tried several times to get him drunk, just so he would have a wild night hed never remember or regret. but, the crazy man was a teetotaler wouldnt drink anything we offered him. 

after many failed attempts to trick him, we tried to genuinely get to him. there are many of us who would give up our immortality in exchange for the privilege of being with such a man. but, he just wouldnt be taken. 

finally, after many years of frustration, we asked him what his deal was.

yeahabout that. i never actually planned on having any kids in first place. so, i dont have any. sorry.

wed seen plenty of people try to use this type of nonsense excuses before, so we pressed him to continue. his response was the most insane, yet insanely logical thing wed ever heard. 

sigh i didnt know when i made our agreement that i wouldnt be interested in women or men. i had my doubts, but i didnt truly know that i wasnt interested. so, i didnt intend on deceiving you. i assumed that maybe, if the right woman came along, i could make myself be interested in something other than polite conversation. but, as the years passed, i realized something about myself im just a wretch. im a nobody. im not only unworthy of love, but im definitely not parent material. who in their right mind would ever consider having a child just to give it away? that would be horribly cruel to the mother to have my firstborn child with some bride, fully knowing that the child will likely be ripped from her arms! i could never bring myself to do that to any woman. so, i made a vow that i would never cause that type of harm to any soul. im sorry that im unable to pay my debt to you, but i could never bring myself to hurt a woman in that way.

there was a collective facepalm in our realm as we all seemed to simultaneously understand our folly. in trying to trick him, we never told him the truth! every time we dressed up one of our own like a human, we never told him that we fully understood what we were doing. if we had, maybe this man could have spent his latter days with someone instead of alone. ugh."

it was a demon god that was playing the part of a monster, gathering blood, and resentment to fully descend onto our realm.

we were losing terribly.  
the paladins sword snapped in two, my mana was almost out, and couldnt heal anymore, and the rogue couldnt even approach the demon, and her arrows were out.  
the wizard, our best chance, was nigh out of mana as well, so he did something unexpected.  
he took off his wedding ring, and threw it into the sky, and we marveled as it expended into a portal.

  
what? you are bringing more snacks for me?  
thank you! the demons 9 heads laughed, as the miasma grew stronger.  
i looked at the wizard...who took out his pipe.  
this be done in a minute. he muttered, sitting down on a log.  
the paladin walked up to us, and so did the rogue, as we were all confused.  
haha! good. you realized the futility of your struggle!  
i assure you, your blood and souls will be used for great things... the demon smirks, but then freezes, as a pillar of light engulfs him.  
from the portal in the sky, a beautiful goddess steps out, sighing.

  
took you long enough.  
almost bashed in the barrier between the god realms and the mortal realms, to come here myself. she says to the wizard.  
sorry honey. he says.  
we freeze.  
honey? and that wedding ring? he is...married to a goddess?  
luxia! you! what are you doing here!? this is a mere lower tier mortal realm! the demon roars, as the pillar of light shatters, but the demonic miasma is now noticeably weaker.  
oh, if it isnt the little worm of mammon.   
pretending to be a 9headed worm? how...disgusting. she says, and waves her hand.  
amidst screams, the demon simply disappears.

  
darling! she says, flying down to us, and to the wizard, kissing him.  
then...she slaps him, and kisses him again.  
honey... he mutters, before being punched in the stomach.  
then she turns to us.  
thank you for taking care of him, and disallowing him to drink. he says, the last part specifically to me.  
i am confused, should i kneel?   
no need. i am off, the little deity of this planet is getting fidgety with me being here.  
come over for dinner sometime. she says, leaving through the portal, as it shrinks, and flies down to become once more a ring on the wizards finger.

that was my teenage persona, fool! van quisher snarled, though i noticed a few beads of sweat dripping down his luxurious long locks of hair. this is your current name!

i worked the shackles around from behind the chair, carefully pulling out a pick from belt and starting on the lock. well, i am a teenager. so if i were to accept your opinion of my name, which i dont, then by your very own same logic i dont deserve to be defamed for my choice. is common decency truly dead in the world?

patience! van quisher roared. why kill a mere guppy when you can eliminate a whole shoal of sturgeons? 

you should listen to van, lieutenant. i agreed. hes older and obviously much wiser.

i really cant imagine. i said, hearing each tumbler click as it moved into place within the lock. perhaps its your lieutenants chastity belt? i heard the cassandrean order can be real freaks. 

klymenstras hand snapped out, but id already unlocked the shackles, leaping out of the chair and past both of them. which led me to the corner of the dungeon furthest away from the exit. because why wouldnt it?

you picked the lock, klymenetra licked her lips with a neon green tongue. clever boy. but youre outnumbered, and certainly outgunned. what was the one spell you knew how to do again? its a first year one, isnt it? 

first semester, actually. i cast inventory.

soon the sound of children bring wood in and piling it up cracked around the longhouse, huen and inger were fighting again about where and how to pile the wood for mehaen, my eldest daughter. mehaen, who was preparing the morning meal, was humming to herself as she worked. she did love taking care of us and morning was when she shined. stoking the fire, getting the younger children out from under foot, and starting the morning meal for those of us left in the village.

i felt the air change subtly as asa helped mehaen with the fire. asa loved mehaen almost as much as she loved me.

my belly make noise when the sizzle of the roshvalr meat reaches me as it begins to cook.

touching the totem on a string at my throat, i call up my magic to warm the bones and ease the muscle aches of my far too many thaws. i feel asa push a bit of her essence into my magic along with me, making it easier and less tiring for me. her essence still reminds me of the soft fur of a baby yule as it sleeps against me.

it makes me remember the first time i saw asa. a memory warm and comforting to me.

she had appeared as a light brown yule and is one of my first memories of life here in the longhouse, with my family, with the tribe. so many seasons ago.

grandfather soot had just finished the calling to the spirits of these new lands, asking to protect and keep our family in the place we had found. we had followed the hrosshvalr as the snow had gone from our old hunting grounds and away from the new tribes pushing into our lands. before that i remember only dim things about my life.

i do remember that day very well.

while all the older family members were watching or participated in the ritual, i was still too young and all i really remember is that i was eating drysalted elk meat against the wall of the longhouse. the meat had fallen onto the ground, slipping out of my hands as i had covered it with drooled, and could no longer hold onto it.

a yule, about my size had drifted out of the smoke of the ritual, glowing with the light of a new day, all yellow and orange, to bite the meat from the ground. she then had held it for me until i took it.

no one else seems to see her.

i remember giggling at the way the smoke drifted through her, making swirls of her fur as it moved across and into her transparent body.

her eyes had held stars that twinkled at me in my memory. i have trusted her since that day, taking the piece of meat, covered in dirt, breaking it in half and sharing it with her.

i may be an elder and the shaman of the family but asa, spirit of our longhouse, keeps us safe. protecting us.

no one but me can see or hear her but they do all feel her...

as for his murderer? a paladin. haughty and conceited in shining armor that would not protect him. as my bearers soul fades from me, and he finally forgets me, i draw ever closer to this man. his name is unimportant. his reasons, unimportant. he simply violated an ultimate rule of the existence which he inhabits. 

certain secrets must be kept, not lost. 

the man dines happily this night. at a tavern, regaling customers with tales of how he vanquished an aberration today. but i see no reward in his future. and suddenly, i slip into his mind. 

he pauses. looks around. opens his mouth to say something. and as he speaks, his throat closes. his eyes widen and his nostrils flare. he knows of me now. hes desperate now, scrabbling for a pen and paper.

they looked at me like i was the disease, not the famine, not the war, not the wizards poisoned strings pulling my fathers corpse through courtly motions.

the little princess must pay for our suffering. they told themselves.

the dead kings ghost must be buried with her.

not the peasants screaming for my head. 

not the mercenaries paid by the neighbors who once sent us gifts of gold and wine.

not the priests trembling as they read false rites with trembling voices.

they didnt know that with every crack of the whip, every blow, every lie shouted from the scaffold...

the silver winged death, they called me. the dragon born of their treachery, their cowardice, their convenience.

but that was only the beginning.



years passed. 

i learned the ways of the dark that made me. 

i drank deep of old magic, deeper still of mortal blood. 

when i grew tired of rage and ruin, i folded my wings and let my scales become skin again, pale as frost, lips red as old wine.

the ashes cooled. 

from them rose the court of the night, the silver moon empire. 

i built it atop the bones of the kingdom that murdered me.

its towers cut the sky like fangs. 

its people  my people now  found shelter from the daylight that burned their eyes and the nobles who once drained their pockets.

they named me sylvia, again. 

this time not the helpless princess, but the silver moon princess  ageless, ruthless, immortal.

sometimes, though, in the hush before dawn, when the silver of the moon fades into the gold of a sun i do not trust, i remember the girl who pressed her face to the bars in her fathers castle, waiting for him to open the door that never did.

the girl who dreamed of feasts where no one went hungry, dances where no one schemed, a kingdom that did not bleed its people dry.

they killed her. they fed her to the circle and the dark.

they made me.

so, witch, ask thy questions. she says, drinking.  
maybe she was the wrong person to ask...doesnt matter!  
i have to ask.  
so, my main reason for coming today is to ask of you why are dragons kidnapping princesses so often?  
i would understand if they were the heirs, or only child, but often times they are the 9th or 20th princess. i ask.  
she smiles.

  
because of sending a message, seeking wealth without burning the bridges completely, for fun, for love, and yeah, i guess these kind of cover every reason.  
i personally also kidnapped a few princesses in my lifetime.   
2 became my wives, and the rest were either voluntarily kidnapped, or to teach a lesson to haughty kingdoms. she says.  
i write it all down.  
i see. i see.   
so, by sending a message, you are saying the ability of dragons to easily kidnap a princess from the palace itself.  
seeking wealth is basically ransom, and by not kidnapping the heir it is not a complete attack on the lifeline of the kingdom. i say.  
the dragon nods, then i...frown.

  
fun? love?  
i can see love, and i can see how sometimes princess voluntarily ask to be kidnapped, to escape from their parents...  
but fun? i ask.  
she shrugs.  
we live a long life, and are among the strongest beings naturally.  
sometimes, having an army come after us, or strong knights, and professionals, like mages, wizards and so on, is our way of having fun.  
playing the villain is fun, we allow ourselves to be defeated, and simply shift away to another lair. she says.  
i write it down.  
this will be the best article i have ever written! an age old question finally answered.  
now...for my payment...elf... she suddenly says, staring me down, winking.  
i blush.  
oh boy...for journalism!"
[wp] you and your two younger sisters were adopted by the royal family for unknown reasons. the truth comes out when the true heir is due to be born.,"guardians.

thats what wed been taken in as. not because they pitied us, or because they saw potential in three street urchins. no. we were given the assignment on day one of our new lives.

we were all educated in the palace by tutors. i learned how to write and do my sums. marggie even learned two additional languages. i struggle with juton. taught etiquette by the butlers. hated that. never realized how much structure you were expected to shove up yer arse. wait. um, so many manners one has to watch their mouth and feet in equal measure? still learning.

i did however thrive in the more secretive arts. assassination and information gathering came naturally to me. being a thief to survive taught me much. marggie and kelpie fell more into knight training. finding honour in serving. although formally women werent to be knights. they often sparred with, and beat them.

us three women became formidable martial assets to the royal family of belacoste. so when our father finally conceived and heir to the throne. we knew our time had come.

we fawned over our little brother. when in actuality we were watching over him. sniffing our threats through womanly gossip and doing what women do best in the halls of manly power. stay invisible.

my contacts in the city grew to the countryside as i studied alongside the master of shadows as his prime agent in these halls of power. my sisters marggie and kelpie had a more hands on approach to protecting our brother.

always with him. always keeping him in their sights if not sleeping in the same room. everyone else saw it as affection. we saw it as our duty to the man whom took us in.

so when an intruder foolishly mistook a woman in the same bedchamber as the heir apparent, died suddenly.  the dotting sisters at his side were taken seriously. such a thing happens when a guard discovers the intruder dead at my sisters hand.

the minister who ordered the assassination was caught by myself, and presented to the master of shadows. 

the next two attempts solidified the rumours about the heirs sisters.

if you had to get to the heir apparent. you had to go through his sisters first.

if you can."
"[wp]listen, this mansion is not haunted. in my 463 years living here i havent seen a single ghost. why are you giving me that look?",immortal but not stuck in time is a criminally underrated and underrepresented trope in fiction imo. love it!
"[wp] your beautifully sweet warlock, your kind baby that chose you as their patron, has been slaughtered. slain by an idiot paladin who is only doing it for fame and money, only wearing the holy helmet for glory.","i had slept for a millennium, since the worlds last cry, merely rousing every now and then, but never waking. though when i had felt someone kneeling at my shrine, for the first time since it was built ... it made me wake just enough to grant the child my blessing. the child, only 17 years of age, wanted my power only to protect himself and the people he cares. it was noble, much more then any who else had managed to rouse me from slumber. so i tied a golden string to his soul, and bound it to myself, for him to always hold even a fragment of my power to do as he wishes.

slowly even, i heard more voices, different from the boy. that boy had grown to become a man by human standards and speaking of the blessings i give, even while i sleep. the river that never floods because of my breath, the plants that grow because of my sleeping form. slowly the priest, as others were calling him, was a bastion of safety for those that walked upon the earth and rejected by others. the kind boy, who talked to me every day, rousing me every now and then, just enough to get a blessing for the people ... truly one i loved like my own brother on high.

so why did the string snap?! why is his soul gone and his body cooling in my fields?!

for the first time, in millennia, since my brother forged this world .... i awake.



the holy order of reodus, who worshiped the god of the same name the creator god of all, had a man enter into the temple, smiling widely as he holds the banner of his last crusade. well i do think i did a good job brothers the paladin, named atosh, looked at the others, throwing the banner to the ground. another demonic cult annihilated! there were a few cheers, atosh was a celebrity even among his brothers after all. though not as many as he wanted, there was a pretty reward from the village that at least compensated for the bit quieter applause.

honestly, how do you find these places atosh. a squire, atosh forgot the name of, asked him with shining eyes.

atosh chuckles at that and shrugs, before putting on a brave face. it is simple. the almighty reodus showed me the way. well thats how he took his faith. a few whispers here and there, of a church of a man or woman speaking of another god other then reodus. it was easy to follow up that and make the show of destroying a cult. now how about i tell you all about the final battle atosh says, about to beautify the final battle with the high priest he had killed.

but before he could say anything, the temple shook. someone calls out its an earthquake! while others scurry around, trying to prevent any destruction, atoshs view is brought to the center. standing there was a humanoid ... black hair with flecks of molten red .... looking like living stone. demon! atosh called out, the squire next to him jumping as others manage to notice the demon.

the demon, as atosh called him, looked around, several paladins moving to fight while more work to stop anything from breaking. eventually though, the demons eyes land on atosh, before closing his fist, the shaking stopping. though the earthquake was gone, there was a tension in the air, as if the very world was holding its breath. atosh gulps and holds up his sword. why are you here demon? here to get exorcised like the scum you are?! atosh growls, putting on a brave front, having gotten quite used to it after all.

part 13"
"[wp] with the rise of modern society, its only becoming harder for vampires to hide. knowing you have little time before the hunters find you, you employ a last ditch gambit to chance your survival becoming a superhero.","reports must be filed. interviews made. evidence collected. some random vigilante, no matter how unusual he may be, theyre going to need to do their thing. even if they let him do it, theyre going to have to still do their jobs as constables of the masses. a cad gets a lucky shot with a gun and he isnt ready for it, thats blood and reports of gunshots. if he isnt wearing gloves, thats fingerprints. if he actually lets them interview him, thats not just them talking to him anymore, thats him on bodycam.

i looked to joachim before his face even had a chance to change. yes, the police wear cameras on their person now. be happy youre not in england the entire city of london is covered by cameras these days.

he had the decency to look aghast. good on him!

but, lets say that everything goes well. there will come a time, sooner or later, where they will need him to appear in court. no matter what. and despite everything, there is no judge harry stone. there is no night court. so he wont be able to appear.

i leaned back again. thats where everything breaks down. assuming that the police have not taken offense to some vigilante doing their job, there will come a point in time where the commissioner will have their hands tied and will have to give the order to bring him in. this is a guarantee. they will track him, one way or another. they may try to arrest him on the street, or worse...

deidre had figured it out. they follow him home, they arrest him, they bring him outside, and the sun does the job for us.

i nodded. dura lex, sed lex. they will do their job, and he will die. publicly, visibly, leaving a lot of evidence. now, the hunters will help suppress it, they have as much of a vested interest as us in keeping the supernatural the stuff of myth and hollywood. but even with their aid, it will be hard, and i suspect, it will be unsuccessful.

i am not wanting to see him dead. but i believe that it is inevitable, and i would rather it be in a way where physical evidence is minimalized. and yes, i am including recordings in that category. as i said in my letter, should i have seen any other way, i would urge it first. but ultimately, so long as he maintains this charade, the danger to all of us increases.

joachim frowned thoughtfully before speaking. since alwin is still in the long slumber, i will send a missive myself. with the local elder out of commission for what i suspected would be a few decades, it fell to his seneschal. funny how joachim always did what i said, though. i wasnt complaining about how handy it was for me, though! but... we supported the wrong people, i think, leading to our current situation.

i nodded slowly. we did. well, all of you did ive never once strayed into national politics. i study it, predict it, use it to my advantage, but try not to involve myself with shaping a lands politicians. our situation only promises to get worse. and he, sadly, is caught in the middle.

as i said, i do not fault him for making the choice that is forcing us to purge him. we are all scared, hiding, and not living the immortal life which we believed that we would. but always, we must persevere. we must all learn from our mistakes, and make good choices from here on out.

i paused, then smiled at them. but please, the next time you want me to explain something like this, where you arent going to ask any questions, please... this could have been an email.

but i do have a question, joachim said quickly. one which i did tell you that i would circle back to.

how did you know about him, and send your advisory so quickly?

i laughed. really? that is your concern? ha! ill have to introduce you to fark and reddit some day."
"[wp] no one can kill you! youre the greatest dragon to ever live! you have wealth, power, and anything else you want. except for one thing. this doortodoor salesman leaving you the hell alone.","with the demondisposal package we can guarantee a cleric here in two to three weeks, but with the demondisposal plus package we would ensure that a paladin will arrive and that heshe will be here with in two to three days! which if you ask me, it is worth the extra price! the man in the slick grey suit exclaimed while pointing at the newest pile of papers he had removed from his briefcase.

i already told you i am one of the most powerful beings in this realm, i dont need to be rescued by some weak cleric or paladin. if demons try to intrude on my cave, i would simply kill them, just like i do everything else that gets in here. the dragon said, blowing another smoke ring to punctuate its annoyance.

the salesman smiled sympathetically, but what if the demons are too strong, or there are too many? heck what if they just snuck in here and made themselves at home?

the dragon sighed. i have literally killed of the dark lord of hell by myself, twice! i can handle what eve the demons throw at me!

what about me mr. mighty dragon, if you are so strong, why havent you gotten rid of me yet? the salesman smirked.

i dont want to talk about it. the dragon said, before changing its mind. you know that i have gotten rid of you multiple times! i have physically removed you 6 times, and flat out killed you twice. im only entertaining your sales pitch because i hope that as soon as you are done you would leave me be and i will never have to see you again!

why if you were such a smart dragon, you would know that the only true way to get rid of me would be simple! the salesman said, knowing that he had the dragon on the proverbial ropes.

the dragon ran its claws through its horns, mimicking the actions it has seen humans do when they are stressed. fine, what do i have to do to get rid of you?

the salesman reached into his robe, pulled out a pen and said its easy, you just gotta sign up for the demondisposal plus program!"

"[wp] that is a bug and really should not be possible, but on the other hand it is utterly hilarious and i really do not want to fix it because of that.","they shit themselves, edmond! gods laughter shook drops of rain from the clouds her throne rested upon. orion felt esmerelda tense up beside him, a relatively minor reaction compared to some of the other new angels. 

yes, yes, they do indeed do... that, edmond conceded. and while it is always my privilege to be the source of anything that brings god pleasure, i come before you ultimately because the angels have heard prayer from the humans to be spared such final displays in their humanly form.

woah, woah, woah, god waved her hands in front of her. stop right there, you want me to make that stop happening?

the humans want that, edmond replied. i am no more than the vehicle from their prayers to your ears.

this guy, god turned her attention back towards orion and esmerelda as she pointed a thumb at edmond. tell me, esmerelda, is it the heavenly thing for to me interfere with the parameters of evolution i have cast down upon earth? or, shall i allow absurdity and its inevitability to carry on as it has already seen fit?

ummm, esmerelda, clearly surprised to be referred to by name as a new angel, found herself at a loss for words. to be asked such a question by god, one that so directly impacts the humans, felt to be a scenario that she was centuries away from being qualified to answer. forgive me, god, for i speak as the newest of your angels. but, is it not for us to protect those below?

esme, esme, can i call you esme? god didnt wait for an answer before continuing. you will find that the responsibility of mothering universes can become dull. it is so much assuaging of the fears of creatures with lesser minds than us that there is reason behind everything, that there is comfort amidst the hardships of existence. when they call out to me, it is in seriousness almost always. youd think that, as creatures who claim to love me so, theyd be considerate enough as to throw a joke up my way.

if i may, edmond chimed in. there are jokes that we may all share in good humor and then there are misfortunes that we, so far removed from, may revel in at the expense of those subjected to said misfortunes.

oh, for the love of me, edmond, you are such a spoil sport. ive had enough, god snapped her fingers and edmond disappeared, dismissed and sent back to the halls of the angels. she turned her attention back towards orion and esmerelda, who still stood before her in silence. you two, you are dismissed. and when you return to your halls let it be known amongst all angels that i am decided in my decision. the humans shall continue as they are, and the only thing at the end of any further requests to alter this is my wrath.

and so, once again, god snapped her fingers, sending orion and esmerelda in an instantaneous flash to the halls theyd begun their meeting in. 

i see what you mean, esmerelda said after a moment of standing in silence. and could not be more grateful for the warning."

i knew it would come to this, someday. but now, it was my turn to bring swift, painful retribution upon those who would harm the people and demise that i guard.

i pulled out the rituallypurified artham, from its macabre scabbard of human skin, and i felt something stirring deep within me.

i yelled at the horde. i willingly set myself on fire for a sunrise i will never see! and i struck my chest, the pain searing as my pulse matched the tempo of the storm. but the storm catered to my whims now. i knew my time would be limited, so i did something utterly insane.

i leapt into the fray, and screamed at the top of my lungs. it was incoherent, it was shortlived, and then i became death, destroyer of armies, as flames enveloped me, as lighting seared the ground around me, and as the earth itself trembled.

[wp] an applicant to a magician club gets denied entry because they been using real magic instead of tricking people into thinking they do magic,"well, what do we tell him? a highpitched voice asked, muffled slightly through the thin walls.
what do you mean? came the gruff reply. tell him he doesnt qualify. you know the policy. we cant have someone waving their bloody magic around here with nonusers in the building. tell the idiot to go join the guild!
shhh! the first man hissed. i cant tell him no. not after seeing his face.
pathetic, the deeper voice muttered. a chair scraped against the floor, followed by the groan of old wood and heavy footsteps. i swear, i have to do everything myself.
moments later, the office doorscratched, stained, and hanging slightly crookedcreaked open. out stepped two men. the tall, gangly one with the squeaky voice had gone in first, but it was the short, stubby man who led the way now, his broad shoulders squared with purpose.
he stopped cold when he locked eyes with the boy sitting quietly in the hallway chair. the sudden halt caused the taller man to walk straight into him with a surprised grunt.
sorry, the taller man muttered.
the shorter man didnt respond. he just cleared his throat and looked the boy over.
how old are you, by chance? he asked.
the boys fingers gripped the fabric of his trousers. he glanced between the two men, nervous but trying to be brave.
im eleven.
both men stiffened. their eyes widened with alarm.
i know the flyer said the minimum age is twentyone, the boy said quickly. but i can do level three magic. my uncle says thats pretty good for someone starting out.
the boy clearly said the wrong thing again, because now the mens eyes looked like they were about to pop out of their heads.
umm the shorter man said. give us a moment. he turned abruptly and shoved the taller man back into the office.
the door slammed shut, but the walls were too thin to muffle what came next.
why the hell didnt you tell me the boy was literally a boy? the deep voice roared.
i tried! hissed the other. you wouldnt have believed me.
we need to clear the waiting room. immediately. if the other applicants see this
they already did, the tall man admitted. he showed them some magic. most of them left. a few ran.
a long scrape of a chair echoed inside the room.
we need to keep this quiet, the deep voice said, now more measured. just between us. at least until we get a contract signed.
contract? the tall one said. were hiring him? but i thought you said
hes eleven, tom! the deeper voice growled. do you know how much money we could make? imagine the power hell have by the time hes of age. the guild will be begging to work with us.
theyll execute us, mark, tom said. you know the law. were not allowed to advertise magic, let alone hire someone with it. the guild only tolerates us because were the cautionary tale. the training ground for prank spells and lowtier dropouts. the laughing stock
we dont need to keep him forever, mark replied. just long enough to get the business booming. then we let him go. think of the advertising the agency that trained the most powerful magician of the age. magicusers and normies alike will be beating down our door.
and when the guild finds out?
we play dumb. say we sent him to the guild like we were supposed to but he chose us. later, we send the magic users to them. keep the nonusers here. everybody wins.
playing dumb wont work a second time.
marks voice softened with false innocence. but this time is different. he came to us. we didnt lure him in.
tom hesitated. then how do you explain him coming to us at all?

what crimes?  
you mention seeing, and hearing his names in documents, and being discussed by known criminals.  
may i ask...what ethnicity do these criminals have? he asks.  
italian... the prosecution answers.  
would it be farfetched that due to my clients monumental contribution to the italian community, his name would come up in highercircles, be them business, or criminal, because his presence his so widespread, and strong? he asks.  
would it be so weird for criminals to talk about the most famous italian businessman in the city, and to have dealings with his businesses with their own, so that they can use his name to gain legitimacy?  
does my client need to be seen as an accomplice, or guilty, because his name is used by criminals? he asks.  
i smile, and relax.

no. not anymore.

anger is normal, the voice continues. my kind is flawed, you see, in our greediness. know that i regret this, truly, though it is beyond us to stop it. we cannot taste a soul without finding it tantalizing beyond reason. a spider does not let the fly escape its web without ripping off a wing as a keepsake. the jaws of a lion clasp around the gazelle and, even as it bounds away, relishes in the feeling of her hair between its bloodied teeth.

to exist is a transactional thing. to die is no different."
"[wp] i understand you have sworn an oath to protect this castle and its king, and i respect that. but please see the truth in my eyes when i plead with you leave. just leave. right now. trust me.","he struck his sword into the earths crust, both his fists clenched around the hilt. the knights helmet gleamed, his metal plates gaining a gleam below the full moons gaze, the dents from time evident.

i understand you have sworn an oath to protect this castle and its king, and i respect that. but please see the truth in my eyes when i plead with you leave. just leave. right now. trust me.

im afraid i can not. his deep, muffled voice rattled through her chest.

you dont get it. the woman pointed away. they are coming. a fate worse than death. i have seen their ways, their treachery, the lengths they go to. her voice trembled, eyes burned with the visions of the damned. they wont kill you...

but the oath has been taken. the knight remained, unwavering. also, im glad you are still alive, miss.

the womans brows raised as she looked up to see into his helmet. she reached out, slightly lifting the rustic metal only to flinch back in horror, dropping the mask. you look terrible.

as one should for failing to protect his king. the knight sterned. but the castle still stands.

even in death, the oath chains them to the living.

you wont win. the princess ran her fingers through his wornout armor. you will be enslaved for as long as they wish.

so be it

he wouldnt want that! she retorted. grandpa would never allow this to happen. i know he wouldnt. so please. she choked. let me send off the last of his men.

we are not the last of his men. the immortal dropped to his knee, his head low before her. you still roam the earth, carrying his blood.

the castle spoke with a thunderclap echo, a thousand swords struck the earths crust. there were more warriors here. more than she ever wanted to see.

you will not win. the princess heeded again. this castle will fall.

then we shall fall with it. with his sword to his side, he pleaded. send us off in glory. those are our final wishes.

there was hesitation, a lingering doubt in the back of her mind. however, her hand raised nonetheless, as if guided by the spirit that once thrived in these walls.

a long, deafening silence later, she strode towards the broken throne."
"[wp] you know your child is hiding a relationship from you. you assured them that whoever it was they were with, they could bring them home. they come home with someone who is very much not a human being.","shell need time to get used to me and to celeste. she said, without missing a beat.

wednesday night was uneventful. ally and ana were close, and clearly happy. not exactly joined at the hip, but not spending much time apart either.

the next morning, we piled in to the car for the three hour drive to the new york border. ally and ana kept us entertained with stories about school, classes, and their friends on the drive up.

when we got to my sisters it was the usual chaos. half a dozen canines, and more family than even that large house should hold. dinner was the usual chaos, with most people at the dining room table, kids in the kitchen, and plenty of people at other, side tables set up to manage the sheer number of people my sister saw fit to invite. i had my usual few five to ten minute conversations with people, including my mother and siblings, who i hadnt seen in a few years, and had little in common with, and once the meal ended, people broke into their little social groups, in whatever room was convenient or comfortable.

my nieces and nephews, and my cousins kids were in the playroom. most of the men were in front of brads massive tv, watching football. my mother and sisters were in the kitchen, and several other relations were still seated around the dining room table, playing cards.

the four of us went down to the bar, where my brother, and two brothersinlaw, along with brads two brothers, were drinking, shooting pool, playing darts, and talking about camping and golf. we all accepted drinks, and mostly the conversation flowed around us without touching us, save for a few questions to ana and ally about how they met and school.

ally excused herself to go to the bathroom. finding the one off the bar occupied, she asked brad where she might find another. he mentioned there was one on the other side of the playroom. she had been gone for about five minutes when we heard a child scream. it wasnt the usual scream of a child at play, but a shriek of terror. ana had a look of horror on her face, whispering oh no...no...no as she shot out of her chair and toward the playroom like her hair was on fire. mel tossed me their cane and first aid bag as i shot out of my chair, knowing i could do anything with that cane i could do with a sword if there was real trouble, and that i had been a medic with my local fire department for years."
"[wp] youre the teacher of the failure class for superpowered students. when you ask one kid what his power is, he says, i can give myself a nosebleed.wait. blood manipulation? another shrugs and says, i can charge my phone.electricity manipulation?! have they ever tried experimenting at all??","part 2

i smirked and raised my hand in a fist and how long to tilt your head

as i threw the jab actually at his face he tilted it immediately half second tops, longer if my neck is stiff.  he then realized what he had just done.

i nodded so your power is worthless huh?  you think being able to tell exactly how long a villain will take to strike after only seeing a move once is useless?  how many hits do you think ultimite could avoid if he knew the exacts of his foes and his own timing.  how long does it take you to lean  i threw the roundhouse as i spoke back

he tilted backwards 2 seconds, far below your wind up.

i could hear the pride in his voice.  very good.  thats enough for you, after all ive got an entire class yet to do.  back to your seat.

i watched him walk a little straighter, a little better.  sure if he took a first hit it might be fatal but for now he needed confidence, they all did.  i looked over the class room and nodded towards lisa hendricks.

lisa, front and center.  she walked up clutching her phone for dear life, it was the one thing she knew she could do, charge that phone and so it held in her hands at all times.  i chuckled.  and what is your power?

she slumped and whispered i can charge my phone.

i slammed my hand on the desk behind me and she snapped to attention.  girl, i do not have time or patience for pretend.  if you arent going to be proud of your ability you shouldnt have stayed.  you did though, so tell me your power

the anger at being humiliated flared then and she snarled i can charge my goddamn phone you fucking psycho.

i bared my teeth in a manic grin and snatched the phone, and with practiced ease took the battery out and tossed it behind my desk.  i offered the phone back sans battery and she snatched it then tried to scramble past me only to find my arm blocking her.  no.  no battery.  now use your power.

she went bug eyed and shook her head.  i cant, theres nothing to. another slam on my desk interrupted her.

power now! or i smash the phone and make you do it with a destroyed screen and who knows what other damage.  i loved and hated this.  if they were going to be heroes they needed a villain, and they needed it sooner then those who had the support of their teachers.  so id be the villain."
[wp] him? you chose him? that whelp couldnt stand a slight breeze! hes not war mage material. im tired of all my students becoming warlords!,"tephyr balrin was a lanky man with scraggly silver hair and an everpresent limp in his leg. he had colored eyes, though most could not agree on what color precisely. it wasnt that they were anything special, but more so that nobody could agree on quite where gray started and blue ended. most believed him to be immortal, but tephyr himself knew better. he just happened to have a very, very good diet. although, it wasnt like he could stop. even if he wanted to.

as it was, he was the most prestigious teacher of the magical arts in the entire known and half of the unknown world. despite this, he didnt have many students. every century or so, he would go down from his happy little mountain home to the academy and pick out an aspiring mage to train, as required by the council. this disgruntled him greatly. he would really rather not, but hed foolishly sealed himself into this cycle with magical bindings borne from the god he slew. all of this immense power, and he was bound.

soon after the festival of dayspring in the 6th decade after the great war, he was called down from his mountain cottage to train another. now, tephyr was not very good at keeping track of time, but he was pretty sure it had only been about seventyfive years since hed trained his last disciple.

he came down from the peak anyway. apparently, a new high councilor had been elected since the last time he was down here, high councilor arkin.

i deeply apologize for the sudden summons, arkin lied, but we are in dire need of your capabilities.

mind waiting twentyfive years? tephyr replied.

arkins eyebrow twitched. twentyone, actuallybut we do not have that time. the council requires a new mage to spearhead our army.

tephyr waved dismissively. do it yourself. or just train a guy normally? you dont need me to train all of your leaders.

this is an order, tephyr balrin, you do not get a choice in this matter. you will pick a mage to train by sundown tomorrow or you will face the consequences of disobeying the council.

tephyr stared at the councilor in shock for a few moments. usually they dont risk being this brazen with him. 

what are the consequences?

arkin smirked. we will kill you.

tephyr has slain gods. he may have been a little biased, but he happened to be of the opinion that the council could not, in fact, kill him. there are ways, but none that the council would ever do.

i dunno, i dont think thatll work out for you. maybe consider a wiser option? he responded.

pick your words carefully, mage. you know what will happen if you try and break your bindings. additionally, i happen to know precisely where your extended lifespan originates from. a shame i cannot take advantage of it myself... but it would be easy enough to destroy it.

tephyr paused. ...well see about that one. but fine. ill train an apprentice, just for you.

arkin analyzed his expression for a couple moments, then handed him a few papers. 

these are the student files. you will need them to determine your candidate. you are dismissed.



tephyr didnt even bother looking at the files. they tended to be inaccurate at best. really, all he did was observe the students for awhile.

a day later, tephyr returned to the high councilors office about half an hour before sundown and about one hour after he was supposed to, as tephyr had slowed the sun so that he could procrastinate longer.

arkin was standing at the window, presumably taking notice of the strange solar phenomena. he turned to face tephyr after being melodramatically silent for a few seconds.

have you made your decision?

tephyr nodded.

arkin stared at him awkwardly for a few moments. who is it?

lyorr avenir. 

arkin blinked. him? you chose him? that whelp could not stand a light breeze! he is not war mage material!

id argue that he could actually stand a light breeze, i saw him do it earlier today. tephyr said.

arkin slammed the table. do not joke with me. what possesed you to pick that wretch?

eh. seemed like a good student to me. and he was pretty funny. lyorr was a little shy, but tephyr had seen enough in his time to know that the kid had the drive to learn.

your job is not to have fun, archmage. it is to train our weapons. you will pick an acceptable candidate or you will not be seeing next century. arkin said with finality.

the sky was clear, but something thundered. 

is that what you think they are? weapons? tephyr said, slowly.

the councilor did not waver. are they not? why else would we be training them?

it was rather unfortunate that this accursed binding kept tephyr from killing the councilor right there.

i dont want to train a weapon! theyre practically children! im tired of all my students becoming warlords! tephyr snapped, i have immense knowledge to bring you, couldnt you use it for something other than conquest? 

high councilor arkin laughed. it does not matter, tephyr. you are bound.

tephyr was silent.

you will pick a new apprentice. arkin continued.

no. no, i will not.

arkin scoffed. have you forgotten? i can kill you.

do it then. tephyr taunted. youll have no apprentice. its either you let me train lyorr or you kill me and gain nothing at all.

you would not die for this. arkin warned. what is the point?

at the very least, it would end this cycle of bloodshed. i should have been dead long ago.

the councilor glared at tephyr. then, he sighed. i expect a status report in one month. if your apprentice is not up to snuff, then i will execute him.

tephyr froze, but his voice did not waver. very well. 

one month, then. he had one month to figure out how to break these bindings hed struggled against for centuries so that he could tear the council to shreds."

erlin didnt even realize how far theyd crept from home until the chill of the wind bit through his thin shirt. ahead, donnaths house sat quiet, but the door was ajar, flickering with lamplight. he hesitated, then pulled moran along. he had to see donnath one last time.  they snuck up close and slithered in like two little critters. the room was empty except for overturned chairs and the scuff of muddy footprints. the raised bed that served as donnaths feretory was empty, but for the flowers and ivy he was laid on. they froze. shapes moved in the shadows. three, maybe four, stooped figures hauling something wrapped in a sheet. donnath. erlin felt sick. he nearly called out, but they were already slipping into the dark. the group took the trail in the woods. the one nearly paved with pebbles and marked by paint lines on every third or fourth trunk.

erlin knew the path well. it was a designated trail, but it was at night. he heard morans breath hitch in fear. but erlin only felt fire in his chest. he squeezed his brothers hand and hissed a come on. they followed the group. by the one torch their leader was carrying, erlin could make out that they were as tall as their own adults from the village. they were bipedal and crafty, and coordinated. whether they were furry or clothed or cloaked, he could not tell in the poor light. he was sure though, he knew what they must be. they were... humans!  
               erlin tried not to wonder why the humans were not doing anything to them. they must have heard their steps, cracking of twigs in the detritus underfoot, the rustling of leaves, and the occasional whispers of encouragement addressed to moran. the humans did not pay them any heed, not even when they were joined by others of their kind, who relieved them of their burden. nor when they stepped off the designated path, into a less overt track. they just emerged from the cover of the bushes, nodded to the group, and took over the swathed corpse. moran stopped his wincing. he knew as well as erlin, that now theyd broken almost all the rules. all was left was the third rule, erlin thought to himself. if you hear someone calling your nam...

vardan?! a quivering voice sounded in the dark. vardan, is that you, my boy? an older human approached, turning away from the bodysnatchers, bringing a lantern towards them. erlin froze in place. moran grasped his hand hard and whimpered but didnt try to run or pull him back. the old man came close now, the shades retracting from his face. he looked older than elder gorvud, with whiter hair and beard, and more of those deep streaks on his skin."

the halfhollows didnt get it at first.

they were confused when they saw me  this tiny girl, swaying on trembling legs, eyes wide like a cornered cat.

what the fuck ? one of them sneered.

thats when i drew the katana.

longer than i was tall. black steel humming with both our hungers.

i dont remember moving.

i just remember the spray of blood hitting my face, hot and electric. 

the way the blade hissed when it cut through bone that used to shrug off bullets like confetti.

one went down. then the next.

no fancy assassin tricks, just pure, boiling instinct.

the heartbeast half crying for salvation, the hollowheart half howling for annihilation, and me, the fool in the middle, laughing through broken teeth.

when it was over, the alley was slick with gore. the neon lights turned everything pink and purple and lovely, like some twisted nightclub dream.

and the thing inside me, that halfbroken monster, curled up in my ribs like a heartbeat that would never die.



people ask me now, did you regret it ?

would i have chosen to die in that alley instead of becoming what i am?

truth is, i dont know.

sometimes i think i shouldve let them finish me, that would save the world a lot of trouble.

other times, when my blade slides into another bastard who thinks hes untouchable, i think

no. i was always meant for this.

i wasnt born to be a legend.

i wasnt born to be a hero.

i was born to be the thing that crawled out of that alley.

i frown.  
for they are all gorgeous, with their unique aura, and yet all possessing this regal air about them.

it is indeed, i. deserts sun. she says, in a warm voice.

well, she is, but what can i say?

were. another woman says.  
before being backstabbed. the next says.  
or worse. the last one says.  
so when mr. shadows came to us, we accepted his proposal. deserts sun says.

raising my hands, i take a step back.  
i know when i am outnumbered, and outmatched in any possible way. i start, seeing that the hall we are in is littered with small mounds of sand, coming from deserts sun.  
another woman i am sure is trying to control my mind, another is almost ablaze at this point, and the last ones body seemingly booms with power.  
nope.  
i aint messing with them.  
the villain starts laughing.  
see? i was right! queens are better than pawns! he says...as he brings out ingots of gold, giving one to each woman, before staring at me.

  
what? they are queens, so i have to treat them like that! he says, starting to massage their shoulders, as from somewhere, chairs appeared for the women.  
i stop retreating, and watch this...show.  
by the end, the women are eating expensive food, and the villain is panting.  
are you ok? i ask.

worth. it. he says, before shadows engulf him.  
i sigh, and leave.

the real question is how did i come back? 

um......hi 

i snap my head back almost breaking it. my eyes landed on a beautiful woman. her red hair breezed softly with the wind. her dress was made of purple and yellow with flowers etched around the side. her brown eyes shined in the sun. in her hands were a bouquet of flowers. she seemed nervous, like something weighed on her mind. 

do you play for the lakers? i said

she looked stunned, what did i say something stupid?

then she laughed, that was a noise i liked

i gave an awkward smile. well i have been dead for centuries. 

no, im not this dress was a parting gift from my grandma. she smiled 

that is a nice dress, very stylish i replied 

she blushed gently thank you 

so how did i get here? ive been dead for centuries

what a great autocorrect!"
"[wp] the dragon roars in defeat, falling down to the ground. you did it. you actually did it! you did i why is the princess crying?","i was out of options. my spear was lodged in the beasts chest, sword too far away to grab, shield smashed to splinters.  the dragon reared up, preparing a gust of flame to finally kill me.

instinctively i grabbed my belt knife and threw it, sending it directly into the dragons eye. the dragon reared back in pain, and i took the opportunity. sliding under the dragon i grabbed my sword, immediately springing back up and lodging the blade into the neck of the beast. blood sprayed on my face, blinding me slightly and leaving a heavy taste of iron and acid on my mouth. my sword sunk deep, and i used my momentum to wrench it through the animals neck, nearly severing it. i landed hard on the stone ground, barely avoiding being crushed by the monsters neck as it fell dead.

i wiped the blood off my face with the tattered remains of my cape, then did the same for my sword. the dragon was dead. it was a shame that such a beautiful animal had to die, but they were dangerous creatures at the best of times, and threats to entire cities at their worst. not many men could claim to have slain a dragon singlehandedly. but that was not my mission. i ran into the caves in search of the princess.

the cave had surprisingly few branches through it, and seemed to have been carved out by the dragon itself. after some time, i heard crying. i started to run, calling out for the princess. i fond her hiding behind a rock formation. her dress was in tatters, and she looked as if she hadnt eaten for days. she looked at me with tearfilled eyes, a wash of relief, shock, and terror coming across her face. are you hurt? i asked. she gave a small shake of her head. come with me, youre safe now.

is it dead? she asked weakly.

yes. i helped her up, letting her lean on me as we stumbled out of the cave.

we didnt speak much as we left the caves behind, and i didnt mention the fact that the dragons corpse was gone. nor how much that worried me. the beasts blood was still spattered across the stone, and my spear now lay on the ground rather than stuck firmly into the dragon. i led her to the far tree line, where i had kept my horses. its too late to set off for any city, well camp here for the night and leave in the morning. the princess looked relieved at my words, and collapsed against a tree. i was exhausted myself, but i had long since learned to work through that. i made a small fire and a simple meal of dried meat and grain. 

we ate mostly in silence. until the princess asked are... are you human?

yes... i was confused at the question, though when i looked up at her she looked away. i wanted to press farther, but i held off. i figured that she had been through enough, and would make better use of rest than whatever i asked.

i went to bed with several questions on my mind. why had the dragon taken the princess? why not one of the outside towns. some said that dragons could take a human form and could reason as such, though i had never believed such myself. yet the dragon had flown into the capital city and taken her specifically. where had the dragon gone, i hadnt even been half an hour in the cave. nothing could have taken it, at least, nothing i knew of. and why would she ask if i was human? 

you cannot slay me, for i shall be a part of you.

i woke up with the sun, as i always did. if we were to make it to the capital, we would need to set off soon. i called to wake the princess, and she began to stir. i saw her look at me, tired smile turning to fear.  she backed away, getting tangled in the bedroll. i moved toward her, concerned by her behavior. she curled up, sobbing and screaming, no! please! dont take me back, please!"
[wp] o.k. please calm down. were the eyes green or red? were the fingers elongated or were they tentacles? i need to know this information in order to process your request further.,"no, no, no. this is all a big misunderstanding. the human lowers its hands and steps forward. here, i can prove it. it reaches for its face.

a gunshot echoes through the precinct, and blood begins to squirt from the humans chest.

the sheriffs head snaps to the officer who fired the gun. what the hell was that, davis?

officer david drops the gun, his arms shaking. ii didnt know what to do. it was coming towards us. and it looked so vicious.

two demons in their early teens rush into the precinct with their phones out, presumably recording.

one of them runs to the human shouting, you shot jimmy! how could you shoot jimmy?

no, stay back, kids, the sheriff orders as he walks towards them. humans are carriers of disease. the shortest touch could kill you.

the yellow demon looks up at the sheriff with tears in his eyes. hes not a human, you idiot. hes a shapeshifter. this was supposed to be a prank.

"[wp] youre a dragon thats been hiding amongst humans since the end of magic 100k years ago. a ritual every 50 odd years sees your human body restored to teenage years with documentation. only, a talking cat gave you a pen, and now youre starting to have dreams of a past life from 10k years ago","i have been around for a while.
a dragon in human skin.
every 50 or so years, through a simple ritual, my human body turns back to its teenage years, with proper documentation and everything.
even integrating my identity into a random family, but dont worry for i always use my wealth and power to help them a bit.
this time though...
as i was doing my ritual, instead of stars and rare magic...a talking cat appeared, and randomly gave me a pen.
since then...i had dreams of a life from 10k years ago.


good to see you again.
this time dont forget to write me. the cat said.
i didnt know what it meant, but after my 3rd dream i realized.
back in ancient egypt, i had a cat.
well, took care of it.
it seems that fate had it that during my life back then, magic had a small resurgence.
sure it was gone on a global scale but every now and then you could find it.
and this cat found it, and became a demon.
we had fun, and i could be myself with her.
when i started the ritual that has a small chance of erasing my memories, to protect my sanity, i promised her i will write to her...
sadly, that small chance just had to be triggered.


looking at the pen, i can feel its magic.
i took out a piece of paper and wrote my message.
my apology, my feelings...and my desire to meet.
i watched as the paper turned golden and then disappeared.
i sighed, and went on with my life, the dreams...oddly stopping after having written the letter.
a few weeks later, late at night, i hear something at my window.
it is her.
i let her in, and smile.


aziza. how nice to see you. i say.
she nods.
well, i am happy to see you too, ishaq, or whatever your name is this life. she says.
adam.
but i must say...the last 10k years did nothing to your beauty. i smile.
she meows, and transforms, into a woman.
i freeze.
10k years is a long time, ishaq, and i learnt a lot from the  scrolls you have written me back then.
my little dragon...magic is returning.
your ritual that basically messes with your personality soon shall be needed no more. she says, getting closer.
alas, our other promise shall wait...you are too young in this body... she purrs.
before i could say something, mom comes in.
who are you talking to, adam ?
oh my! what a beautiful cat!  she says, as aziza is back to her cat form, getting comfortable on my bed.
mom gushes over her, saying we will keep her, and i just sigh.
this life will be a lively one."

i hadnt even sat down yet for fucks sake! i was dressed a little differently than usual no hoodie and beanie for me tonight. no, no, this was a meeting of old ones, and blending in with mortals was far different from meeting with other elders. just to fuck with them, i was wearing a toga.

i sighed as i took my seat at the table the last one here, naturally, but i lived on the opposite side of town. it had been a long time since lydia had taken over the bomb shelter  it looked far, far better than it used to when xavier had been in charge. good man, solid, one of the best, but no ability to decorate. it looked like a proper edwardian haunt with a bit of renaissance flair, and these chairs were insanely comfortable. id have to ask lydia where she got them.

i hear a lot of things, i said as i relaxed. so you will to have to be a little more specific.

the fool up north who is pretending to be a superhero, deidre hissed.

ah, i said softly, waving my hand dismissively. ive already sent my advisement that he be dusted two days ago.

that got everyones attention right quick. just like id wanted. those who agreed with me were amazed that id already sent word. those who didnt were shocked that id even suggest that in the first place.

alexander licked his lips, leaning forward. ill circle back here in a minute, but you always stress that we should persevere and not kill each other.

i fixed him with a flat stare. normally, youre right. in the modern day and age, creating new progeny is... very problematic. ah, the 1970s... even the 1980s were such a different time. anyway! yes, its better to preserve and reeducate any of us that get too... extreme. but i do understand why he did it. the moment that i knew what was going on, i understood his logic perfectly. hes desperate. most likely, the hunters were already closing in and he knew it.

claiming to be a superhero, its a brand new play. hunters wont know what to think. sure, hes painting a huge target on himself once they get bold. while some of the more tolerant ones will approve, you know how hunters are. if he isnt one of us, hes a loupgarou, or a demonhost, or worse, a horse. if

horse? deidre asked.

she knew better than to interrupt me. apparently i had shaken her. keeping with the faade that i was putting on, i didnt look at her, instead examining my nails. hoodoo. religion from africa, the basis of voodoo. long story, dont ask. short version is, a possession.

there are hundreds of things that they will suspect him of. which is fine. it might give them enough pause to let it play out. if he keeps up the act 100, then they might not go after him.

lydia took over now. and for that you wish to see him dead?

i shook my head. no. the hunters are the secondary concern for me now. my primary concern is the kine. look, the mortals, the mundanes, the gumps, whatever you want to call them, theyre the issue. doing good for the world, i approve of it. the hunters might barely tolerate it while watching him carefully. the mortals will approve of it. all well and good.

i leaned forward, looking around the assembled. the police will not.

i let the wave of confusion wash over them. this was the fun part, where things got interesting for me."
"[wp] you scream, seeing a monster in place of your roommate. yeah, it says, staring back, not my best morning.","it took a moment for my heart to stop racing. for the fear to settle into irritation. you could have mentioned this!
the creature in front of me raised his hands, gleaming with black ichor. his skin was moonlight pale, and two graceful horns extended from his head. he looked like a mixture of a dream and a nightmare. caught between one and the other.
his jaw set, what, tell you that im a monster? watch you look at me with disgust like every other human? 

the grief in those words hurt. but simple assurances wouldnt fix it. but my instincts were usually good.
no you ass. welp thats not how i wanted to start that sentence. but in for a penny in for a pound, you could have said hey i transform into a hot fucking shadow demon so i dont wake up and think im being robbed by fucking satan. i picked up the pillow at my side and hurled it at him.
he blinked as it hit him with a soft flumph

silence fell as the pillow fell to the floor. both of us in a state of somewhat shock. 

...a hot shadow demon? he asked. teasing but there was something in his tone. hope that seemed fragile, like a flower blooming already expecting to be crushed.
a flush surged up on my cheeks. hells. i had called him hot. 
no. shut up. real mature there. smooth as silk.

he grinned, and holy shit were those fangs? fangs? shit . id always had a crush on him, but this was insane.
he stepped closer to the bed. a taunting tilt to his lips, im pretty sure you said hot
im pretty sure you should be apologising for scaring the shit out of me at 4 am.
that made him laugh, the tension between us easing. i should. didnt even notice the time to be honest.

youve never been good with time being chronically late to everything was his habit after all.

true. he sobered then, youre actually okay with this?

i scrunched my nose at the thought i wouldnt be. of course? if you were going to hurt me you would have done months ago. but a little warning next time. dont fucking lurk in the shadows like a creep

that made him laugh again, and gods it was nice to hear it unrestrained. there was a resonance to it, a vibration in the air that was more than his normal voice. 
okay no thats fair. didnt think about that. was just trying to steal a blanket cause its cold as shit.

i shifted to my side, lifted up the warm blanket. it wasnt a sexual invite. something in him was certain id run away. i wanted him to know i wouldnt. 
you sure? he questioned. voice thick.
i wanted to tell him of course i was sure. he didnt frighten me. even like this. hed always felt safe to me, like a port in a storm.
get in dumbass before i leave you to freeze just once id like to say what i meant. 
another grin dance across his lips before he slunk into bed with me.being sure to return my pillow as he went. he was cold. but as i brought the blanket up over his shoulders, letting the moment settle into calmness, i couldnt help myself. so...fangs huh?
shut up
no no theyre very cool. in a gothic i vant to suck ur blood way
his voidlike eyes narrowed. shut up but there was warmth there. an impish flash of delight took over me can i make a bite me joke or will that spoil breakfast?
he groaned and hit me in the face with a pillow.

john lived a dead end life. he had no remarkable talents. no future in whatever career he found himself in every six months. no friends or family to lean on.

whats a man who lives on minimum pay to do? 

there was that silly book he found at a garage sale once. the original owner said they quickly brushed through it and chucked it on their shelf for years. dismissed it as fiction and a laughable conversation piece. finally decided to get rid of it because of their quickly encroaching manga infestation.

two bucks.

two hundred pennies was all it took to give john seemingly limitless entertainment for his colorless life. why not? the things the book tasks you to do were seemingly mundane and pointless. sometimes weird.

eat rice when its 34 moon.

vigorously wash your toenails every monday the 4th.

recite the alphabet backwards every 26th of the month.

how is any of this supposed to achieve immortality, john muttered to himself one day.

but hey kept doing his rituals. every day without fail. just because it was a break from the routine.

then one night, as darkness took him, he woke up. woke up with some annoying back pain and a mild headache. unusual sensations to be feeling as you wake up, even if it was 3 in the morning.

as john scrambled to get out of bed, he quickly learned that it wasnt a bed. a tub...? the bathroom...? why was john in the bathroom?

he scrambled to his feet and finds his way to the light switch, flicks it on. the first thing he sees as light enters his eyes is himself, staring back through the mirror. but there was a hole in his head. it was slowly dripping red. the hell?

well. that explains that dull headache, i guess. john tries to cope with the absurdity staring back at him. he can clearly see through the hole in his head to the blue tile that decorate his bathrooms walls.

they shouldve been blue, anyway. among the blue was an alarming amount of red splattered violently. i dont remember starting an art project...

looking down at the red slowly decorating the bathtub as well was something silvery. that wasnt his drain stopper...

it was a gun.

god damnit. i cant ever get anything right.

but wait. john just survived a bullet through the head? how is that possible?

it couldnt be...

all those months of eating rice, shaving hair, kissing plastic...

no, wait. i did do something right...!

john felt a bud of confidence become seeded into his newfound life. he saw futures he could pursue, hobbies and passions he could pick up, maybe he can finally ask out his workplace crush finally...!

jen scowled whats wrong with my face! she unleashed her hand out to draw the dried ash from the burned out braziers and combining it with the oxygen in the air. he lifted his sword to block the rush of charcoal dust. he breathed out through his sword to ignite the air to purify the dust assuming poison. 



his ignorance only fueled his demise as the flame fed off the remaining oxygen. he felt himself suffocate. when his mind panicked his body and sword remembered. a vision of a cave during training flashed. he quickly thanked his sword as only moments passed. with last of his willpower he slashed out twice to make two gashes on a exterior wall one above the other. forcing himself to remain consciousness as he lunged his heavy sword like a grain bag dragging the outdoor air inside and pushing the heavy carbon dioxide out from the bottom. 



the ash cycled with the co2 like a roiling tempest replacing it with breathable air. he gasped now with the ability to breath,

jen could see what harld did, expanding the space between the tooth and his body, scaling the distance farther within a small given space, 



are you insane! she yelled knowing a space stretched within such a small area could simulate a large mass to eventually make a black hole. 



doesnt matter if im dead so long as youre dead  i get to go back home. he scowled. jen laughed at the obvious fallacy, her spell dug into the spell trying to dismantle it. she had to get closer. she knew she could keep up. sweat beading down he forehead



youre deadyou cant go anywhere  much less home.. she reached out to his wrist. and converted his skin to acid. were human heroes always so idiotic?! she laughed trying to keep her front and might. as harld roared  his wrist melting. the sword clattered on the ground his hand still clenched on the handle. he shot deadly glares to the demon queen trying to bite through the pain.

will you become my battlepartner, and follow me to cleanse this world of its filth? he asks.  
i hesitate.

  
why me? i ask.  
the witchknight looks at the teacher, and she sighs, leaving us alone.  
wow...thanks for the support, teacher.  
bloody maw is my moniker, because i am a bloodline martial artist, with the blood of a moon wolf flowing within me.  
i fight closequarters, and my spells are often selfdestructive, as my devouring abilities can quickly heal me. he says, taking off his shirt.  
i gasp.  
so many scars, and bruises.  
but poison inhibits my powers, and so does bad blood... he continues.

  
may i? i ask.  
he nods.  
i check his scars, and bruises, and feel the poison still within them, fighting back against his bodys natural healing.  
you just graduated...how can you already have so many wounds? i ask.  
witchknights are seen as royals, equals to rulers, but with that privilege come responsibilities. he says.  
i nod.  
i agree. if you truly thought this through, to become your battlepartner.

laurances mind went blank. first, his manners were appalling had she been anyone else, he would have already forfeited his life for addressing her so improperly. indeed, she could see one of the hidden guards doing his best not to draw his sword. secondly, a telescope. he had mentioned a telescope.

still, she was excited. a true smile finally broke through her mask as he revealed a beautiful, wellmade telescope. now, manners dictated that a princess could never be seen conversing with a commoner. but no one will ever know, will they?

they quickly set up the instrument in the gazebo and looked at the skies.

it was majestic. magical. for the first time all night, she was entranced by the sight before her. after a long moment, she politely made way for him to look. it was only then that she realized she had not asked his name.

by the way, what is your name?

he reluctantly looked away from the eyepiece and gave a clumsy bow. im paul, your highness.

he looked as nervous and jumpy as a cat, as well he should, yet his curiosity still won out, and he quickly returned to the telescope. this made laurence laugh, a true, genuine laugh, after which she said something she shouldnt have.

dont be so nervous. honestly, this has been an extremely boring night. you saved me from missing this beautiful sight please, call me just laurance.

the words hung in the cold night air.

in the sudden, sharp silence that followed, she felt their true weight. it was in the subtle scrape of leather as guards shifted their stances, in the faint metallic whisper of a hand tightening on the hilt of a sword.

a cold dread washed over her like snow falling on her head. she closed her eyes, it had been just a momenta small indulgence in a shared passion.

word was they were built for war by the old ones and then outlived them. they existed now as gods who didnt know they were gods. 

they charged into battle with weapons that shouldnt work. they called them shootas or choppas that only fired properly because the orks wielding them believed they should. orks literally had some kind of mindfield that made their beliefs into reality.

an ork war boss once ordered his men to repaint all their wartrukks red, because, red wunz go fasta. one trukk, painted in a particularly vibrant crimson, actually broke the sound barrier, despite being made entirely of rusted scrap, powered by a squig on a wheel, and lacking anything resembling an engine.

there was a tale once of a regiment of guardsmen running out of ammo against an ork horde. so, the commander had the genius idea of ordering his men to lift their guns and make shooting noises aimed toward the enemy. the orks, believing they were actually being shot at, were torn to pieces by the incoming fire.

i sighed. were really expected to hold against these monsters? i asked out loud. theyre a fucking circus.

next to me, larn was humming again. not a tune, but just noise. he did that when he was scared, though hed never admit it. i never called him on it either. wed both survived all three of our first battles alongside one another. we knew in our hearts the time would come to say goodbye to one another, but wed never voiced it. he sat fiddling with his knife next to my knee, stoic as ever.

you ever think about home? i asked. i hoped i could calm his nerves and maybe my own too. two birds, one stone.

which one? he asked, not looking up at me.

fair question. although wed only seen war thrice now, we had been shipped around to different stations and bastions for years. some we stayed months, some merely hours.

you think theyll send backup? he asked. against the orks?

no, i answered, regretting it instantly. he was probably looking for some sort of reassurance from me, and i went and dashed his hopes.

figured, he sighed. just wanted to hear it out loud i guess.

there was a long lull that hung in the air the kind that could stretch forever if i let it.

you scared? he asked before i could break the silence.

i didnt answer. 

i didnt need to. 

my fingers were trembling on the grip of my lasgun, and my mouth was completely dry, evident whenever i spoke. he knew damn well i was scared, but it wasnt dying that scared me. i was scared of what came before it. the ripping, the screaming. the thought of vanishing in a place no one would remember, snapped in half by the greenskins.

just another corpse in the mud that nobody would regard. no grave, no nothing. the only one to carry my memory would probably die just as soon.

the whistle blew three sharp blasts. my attention tightened, and adrenaline rushed through me.

larn stood up with a huff. welp, he muttered, cocking his lasgun. time to die screaming, i guess. you with me?

my knees didnt want to work. i had to force myself forward, but i did follow him. not for glory. not for the emperor. i didnt even think it was about orders anymore.

we charged because if we didnt, the other would have died alone.

and as the orks crested the ridge, roaring and slobbering with butchers knives and scrapmetal guns, i let loose a war cry.

if death was coming, id rather face it loud than silent.

"[wp] heroes of light! i thank you for releasing me! now i can bestow my gifts to each of uh wait, is it just you?","the goddess had long awaited the prophesized arrival of the four heroes of light, only to see a juvenile mind flayer standing before her.

greetings, goddess. i am lando, mind flayer adventurer. i have come to release you, so you may aid us in saving the world from the demon king. he spoke with wellrehearsed confidence.

wait, you didnt defeat the demon king before you came here? the surprises of this one single day left the goddess perplexed. how did you get here while he still lives?

i sneaked past him while my two dads, regis and james, kept him distracted.

...are you sure youre actually heroes? the goddess was worried about the calibre and heroics of this little creature and his companions.

i am a qualified adventurer, lando proudly pointed to the adventurers badge pinned to his tunic. hero of tulsi town, after i saved it from orcs by slurping their brains. can you defeat the demon king?

i cannot say for sure, she replied, shaking her head. that was something the four heroes of light did. since you have travelled all this way, and even a goddess cannot be choosy at this time, i will bestow my gifts upon you.

lando tapped his head with a tentacle, deep in thought. what use were the gifts of a goddess if they were only given after the demon king had been defeated? were those blessings to the lands scorched by demons? to repair the damage perhaps. all along, that strange seer had said the gifts would be useful for combat.

now he wasnt sure.

what kind of goddess are you? he had to ask.

a goddess of light, who shines her light upon the four heroes of light, destined to defeat the demon king.

join us, and that makes us four, lando gestured with four fingers before tugging on the goddess hand with a tentacle. come, my dads could really use your help. on the way, please do explain why you would be sealed away, behind the demon kings castle instead of near the kingdom of light. by all my tentacles, it doesnt make sense.

she didnt have an answer either. it simply was how the prophecy had always been. but today, she had a demon king to fight and plenty of questions to ask too.

"[wp] youre part of a cycle. every hero must beat the horrible and extremely powerful monster king, and then will be cursed to grow in power until they become themselve a monster king. you are determined to find a way to break the cycle.","silence. i stood there frozen. my sword dyed red with the blood of the monster, no, the man in front of me. the air went still as i held my breath. watching the man who raised me stagger from right to left. blood gushing from his bowels. his eyes softened as he stared back at me and despite the carnage that he had left in his wake, all i could see in that moment, was artorius redwood,  the gentle knight who had saved me when the monster king slaughtered my village. his balance began to fail and he toppled forward but before he could meet the ground i found myself under him, catching his body and lying it gently down with his back to the ground. 

i didnt want this. he managed to squeeze out between weak breaths.  i couldnt stop the curse. i wasnt... his words cut short with a violent cough.

i know. my voice shaking with tears beginning to form.

he turned to me the curse... it will come for you too. he said with fear ripe in his eyes. im... sorry. with those final words the last breath of air left his body. i knelt there, above his bleeding corpse, shaking. 10 years ago i had thought my time had come at the hands of the monster king. i chuckled to myself at the irony, as i stood up, held my sword to my neck, and gathered my resolve."

the stakes couldnt be higher. classic jim. he said the same thing during the teamwork challenge of put the rock in the bag.

he clears his throat. crucial to our success is the willing participation of minds like yours, he says. citizens willing to suspend disbelief and commit themselves wholly, even recklessly, to our resistance. he smiles, almost with pity. youre going to be the tip of the spear, larry.

sounds pretty cool. you jab him on the shoulder. hey, remember when debras bag wouldnt open, and the host said it was because she had used all her phoneafriend points back in round two?

no response.

i thought that was pretty cool, you add quietly.

indeed. larry, it is precisely this enthusiasm of yoursthis willingness to believe such a gameshow would exist in the first place and then lose yourself in vain battlethat recommends you for our cause.

sounds kind of bad. what do you mean? vain battle?

jim scoffs. you dont seriously believe theres a gameshow called put the rock in the bag, do you?

well, i mean... a little bit?

he studies you over the tops of his tinted sunglasses, shakes his head.

you wring your hands together, as if searching for the tactile memory of some comforting bag. bbut i was there! i met drew carey!

jim sighs, popping the latches on his briefcase.

"[wp]you have run out of magic. but that doesnt matter. if you fall, the castle behind you will also fall. and without that castle, the entire kingdom will fall. so there is only one way, a forbidden practice originating from the very demons you are fighting. your lifeforce for mana.","sir! we cant hold much longer!

i know, i replied to the captain of the guard. gods forgive me, i knew. for centuries i had been the courts wizard. i had helped guide this fledgling fiefdom into the vast kingdom it was today. i would be damned if some pissant demon lordrs playthings would destroy all of this.

sir!

i said, i know, i snapped as i stepped to the edge of the ramparts. whatever happens, do not take to the field. whatever happens to me, do not interfere! 

the royal guards assigned to protect me all took an involuntary step back. only my friend baltus, the captain of the guard, stood by my side.

thalvir, you cant have much magic left, my friend whispered, so the others couldnt hear. you look as exhausted as we do.

this will be the last spell, baltus, i replied. i began to chant in a long forgotten language. i had hoped i would never have to use this magic. but i knew the moment i found the ancient tome that it would be my destiny. i guess i just wished i had more time.

the soldiers could feel the power being summoned around us. the air hummed with it. they wouldnt be able to tell, but this magic was different. older. hungrier.

the demons were charging across the plains, intent on breaching the castle gate. fog began to gather around their feet. it blanketed the field like the clouds of a thunderstorm across the sky.

suddenly, a bolt of lightning shot into the sky. but this lightning was wrong. there was no flash of light. only a jagged line of black void that absorbed the light around it. there was no thunder. only a silence so harsh it almost hurt.

where once a demon stood, there was now only a gap in the fog. the rest of them faltered in their charge. the demons knew this magic. they should. it came from the depths of their realm.

i opened my eyes and forced myself to watch the carnage i was about to unleash on these foul beasts.

a cold wind began to blow, forcing the sleeves of my robe up and exposing my extended arms. my voice rose to be heard over the wind. a little trick i had perfected over the years to ensure i was heard over the crowds. 

the mute lightning came faster now. each strike taking a demon back to the deepest depths of hell. and each strike left an inky black stain on my body. my arms were covered in them. each one felt like an icy needle being pressed against my skin. each stain a price for the magic i was using.

it was only a few moments that passed, but it felt like hours. my life force drained away as i fought to continue chanting. life freely given to protect the kingdom.

finally, the demon lord that started all of this, was banished. i could feel the final toll being collected. the last inky stain was on my chest, its icy presence piercing my heart.

i could feel myself falling backward. i think. or maybe i was floating toward the sky?

baltus came into my fading vision, tears in his eyes. i could see the sky clear and the sun shine down on us. was he holding me? i guess i had fallen backward.

then, darkness."

"[wp] the massive ogre grins down at you. game is simple you hit me. then i hit you. you knock me down, you win. i knock you down, i win. you win, you go through the door. i win, you leave the dungeon and go home.","you win, you go through the door. i win, you leave the dungeon and go home.

i looked up at the towering figure, a full ogre, about 12 feet in height, more than twice my 511. he didnt have muscles so much as muscles had him, and it wasnt a strong man adonis look, it was like a power lifter, his paunch was so wide it hung off him with muscles larger than my head hanging off the fat that sealed his body.

  
while other strong men looked like greek statues, he looked like a tank had stood up and ambled over.

  
i snickered. this was the perfect game for me.

battered, but unbroken, i had barely made it through the dungeon, the lowest on the team, i signed the contract in front of the pedestal with my moniker siege. a simple, one syllable, stupid name, that had been given to me to mock me in the hero academy. my ability was limitless, technically s class, above even arankers that were wanted by governments. however its stipulations, well, the ability may be s class, but the use of it was probably a big fat f.

you see, they called me siege because i could charge my body with power, bit by bit, through concentration or absorbing momentum incrementally. due to this i maintained a very low level of super strength, agility, durability, not enough to contend in a fist fight against most d class heroes, a joke really. however if i concentrated, i could turn ambient momentum into potential within my body, endlessly. it really was a joke, if i wanted to run a dungeon i pretty much started doing aerobics for days beforehand to have enough energy to last as barely a b rank throughout. if i was going for an exam, i would have to do aerobics and training for weeks to ensure i maintained an a ranking. but there was no limit!

getting through that door would return me to my team, and i could have them beat me with sticks for a while to build back up energy, if they were fit enough to do so, so i decided to use the rest of the energy id reserved for the dungeon. six months.

six months is all i had managed to build up in my full reserves over the entire scholastic career at this academy, trying to keep what i sparingly could while still being functional enough to maintain reasonable grades. at this point it was estimated that if i burned all that energy in one hit, the shockwave alone would flatten a three story building. or more.

my eye glinted.

i took horse rider stance, and began breathing, as my muscles began to swell the ogres gaze began to shift, slowly i began to look more like him.

6ft, 6ft 8, 7ft 3, 8ft 4, 9ft 10, 13ft, 16 ft, i had to stop and crouch into position before my head scraped the vaulted ceiling.

i smiled down at the ogre who had beads of sweat pouring down his brow, pulling back my fist and feeling the power like a bear trap coiling down my arm.

  
wait wait wait! you pass. good job student.

i sighed, and started piling the energy away. not today, maybe next time. i noticed that my charging and release had significantly sped up compared to the final last year, even better over the last few months of meditation and training, at this rate, i may be able to afford treatment from an accelerator class, permanently increasing the speed of execution of my ability. now that would be terrifying, to do what i had just done in a split second instead of half a minute.

a happy whistle as i left the room, a s on my final exam sheet, meeting up with the rest of the group."
"[wp] why would i worship a god that sends children into lifethreatening battles instead of warriors? ...are you talking about the magical girls, the choosen heroes, or the summoned people? im sorry, the what?!","the quest had taken years. for a while i was convinced that this place was just a legend and somehow i had kept searching. now that i stood in the one temple in the mortal realm where a man can speak directly to the great goddess, i had only one question

why would i worship a god that sends children into lifethreatening battles instead of warriors?

are you talking about the magical girls, the chosen heroes, or the summoned people?

what??? how many kids are you tossing into the meat grinder?

calm down. i need you to specify so i can explain exactly whats going on, but the short answer is that im not. the first magical girls were created by dark warlocks thousands of years ago and the magic was designed to target young girls specifically. the so called chosen ones were never chosen by anyone, but wont listen when told to go home. as for the summoned people desperate fools perform rituals they dont understand. targets are actually chosen at complete random but adults rarely survive the trip.

so what? youre saying that you dont cause this? you still permit it. i lost an arm trying to keep that brat alive. why not make a few commandments to stop this?

you lost an arm and the demon king lost his life. it kind of sucks, but not killing kids is one of the few things you mortals seem to agree on. some of histories greatest monsters trained years to develop the power to easily crush the mightiest swordsmen only to go down in a desperate struggle to avoid harming a couple of kids. would you prefer it if they kept ravaging the countryside?

no, but there has to be a better way? cant you just smite all the evil?

not without consequences. mortals expect so much but never quite grasp the delicate balance that keeps everything from exploding. i think ive explained enough so farewell.

and with a sudden flash, i found myself in a field, just outside of my hometown.

what now? i definitely didnt get anywhere asking the goddess for help. if anything, she made it seem as if theres no fixing this problem. do i just give up? or perhaps i just need to find some different allies. regardless, itll probably take a while to figure out a new course."
[wp] someone has been pranking you by ringing the doorbell and vanishing by the time you open the door. you set up a doorbell cam and wait to see who it is. but nothing could have prepared you for what the footage revealed.,"13

the ringing always came at night.

the first time it happened, alice was sitting at the small round table that filled the meager dining space her the kitchen in her apartment offered. it was winter and night would set in while she was still on her way home from work. so, despite the darkness, she felt no fear over the early evening summoning to her front door. its probably the package i ordered last week, she thought to herself as she reached towards the doorknob.

on the other side of the door was nothing. the third floor hallway of her apartment building was still. no footsteps echoed in the stairwell, none of her neighbors doors were propped open, and only the distant hum of tvs behind closed doors could be heard. alice ultimately thought nothing of it and returned to her dinner.

three days later, it happened again.

alice practically rocketed up from the couch she had sunken into in excitement. it was friday and she always treated herself to delivery, a celebration of a long week at work finally being over. her delivery app had shown her it wasnt due for another fifteen minutes, which only elevated her joy at the surprise of its early arrival.

when she opened the door, she saw nothing. behind her, her phone pinged and flashed a notification that her driver had picked up her food and left the restaurant. strange, she thought to herself, though ultimately returned to the couch without giving it any more thought.

it wasnt until she was woken from her sleep by the doorbell ringing at 2am that she grew weary. alice was a woman living alone. she felt paralyzed under her blankets and played through scenario after scenario of what could go wrong when visitor calls at this hour. was it a stalker? maybe thats who had been ringing the bell, gathering data on the times she would most reliably be home. had they also tried ringing when she was at work only for her to never come? she pictured a journal full of the chaotic scrawling of a faceless man that detailed every moment of her days.

no, she decided in that moment. this simply isnt happening. the college boys down the hall just got home from bars and, as they stumbled down the hall, fell against her doorbell in their drunken stupor. she reached up to pet the orange tabby curled up on the pillow next to hers. as he rumbled to life in a sleepy purr, she felt guilty for thinking it wouldve been better to get a dog.

on a family facetime that following sunday, alice casually mentions the mysterious ringings to her family.

oh, hell no, alice, eddie, the youngest and scrappiest of her three brothers immediately chimes in. thats weird as fuck. arent there supposed to be guys working the lobby of fancy city buildings? how is someone even getting up there?

okay, just because i live in new york doesnt mean im leading some bougie life, alice explains. my apartment building is a piece of crap, and it definitely doesnt have security.

can you tell somebody? alices mother asks, her soft midwestern accent coloring her words with all the naivet a life in a small town can bring.

who the fuck is she gonna tell, mom?  eddie retorts. alice stifles a laugh as the small boxes holding her father and other two brothers erupt into a chorus of thats no way to speak to your mother.

listen, sweetie, alices dad says when the ruckus dies down. if i buy one of those video doorbells for you, would you do your old man a solid and install it? i think wed all feel better if you did.

alice agrees easily. she had already considered it and now she wouldnt even have to pay herself. it arrives two days later and mr.singh down the hall volunteers to install it for her when she sees her fumbling with the packaging. as he finishes, alice tries to as casually as possible ask if hes had any issues with his doorbell going off when nobody is there."
"[wp] whats the black hand of the abyss, the legendary edgy lone wolf assassin, doing adventuring with that level 1 party?","alyssa caught dozens of stares as she followed her new party leader through the city gates. the young man had the dignity to hold his head high despite the attention, although he did a poor job of not looking nervous. a bead of sweat had formed on his brow and was slowly sliding down his face. not that her other two party members, the mage and the cleric, did much better. poor cicely looked about ready to bolt, and renault kept wringing his hands within the wide sleeves of his robes.

for alyssas part well, she was used to the stares. murmurs of black hand and assassin followed her wherever she went. no, the only thing that bothered her was how those same murmurs and stares now marred her first party with the same brush. it had been one of her main reasons for never joining one. like it or not, she had a reputation now, and that reputation would stain whoever she came into contact with. 

maam, kent said after a few minutes of walking, turning back to get her attention while ignoring the watching townsfolk. if youd like, i can head into the guild hall to turn in our quest while you and the others find an inn. 

a small smile tugged at alyssas lips as she looked up at the much taller but far weaker young man. kent was a good sort, a classic knight in shining armor. despite still only being level one, hed managed to get both alyssa herself and his own party out of that dungeon. a fact that alyssa would be eternally grateful for and eternally embarrassed.

alyssa knew what kent was actually doing here. he was giving her an opportunity to save face by not walking into the guide hall with her new party to report that shed been saved by a bunch of brandnew adventurers. she, however, didnt consider it a shame whatsoever  embarrassing, sure, but not shameful. dungeons were chaotic at the best of times, and even a weak one like shed been scouting might occasionally decide to make someone part of the adventure.

when kents party had entered the dungeon with her still present inside, the core had apparently decided to make her part of his quest. scooping her up and placing her in a cage that was impossible to break out of  at least, from the inside. and upon seeing the party meant to save her well, alyssa thought that her luck had finally run out. it had taken kents heroics, renaults skill at ward breaking, and cicelys timely healing to save her. and for that, alyssa owed the group her life and her loyalty.

for a moment, alyssa closed her eyes, reaffirming her previous decision to stay with this group. she heard the murmured whispers of black hand around her, and she could practically smell the wreak of condescension on the other adventurers milling around the guild hall. level one adventurers were good for nothing than scorn, after all. but for alyssa, her new friends were heroes in the making. each and every one of them was destined to create legends far greater than her own. she was just happy to be able to tag along.

opening her eyes once more, alyssa met kents gaze. no. well all go and turn in our quests. together.

kent smiled, his joy outshining every stare and whisper. glad to hear it, he said, turning. lets head inside.

  
hope you like my take on the prompt!"
[wp] youre a psionic who has just been forcefully enrolled in a magic academy because someone saw you using telekinesis. now you need to pass all the magic classes in order to be considered proficient enough at magic you wont accidentally kill civilians.,"for the last damn time, psionics is neither aura nor magic! i at this point had given up on civility as i yell it at the head mage, both with my voice, and with my telepathy in agitation. this has been going on for over an hour. this system has so much ridiculous laws it is beyond inane. 

we have magical spells to account for telepathy as well as telekinesis. it is obvious that you are just quite talented in those disciplines. now, lets go, he said as i was feeling my shadow pull me. the head mage was a specialist in shadow magic, forcing me to walk behind him as i only could sigh. 

our world was a simple one, there were four types of people, even if one was not well known. those who descended from the people of hyperborea who learned to call the breath light of aura, they lives in communal systems to study their craft to themselves. those who were instead descended from atlantis were the mages, learning to call the living waters of magic, having systemic techniques and procedures over centuries that they called spells and rituals. normal people were either normal, or alchemists, learning from the public teachings of the ancient scholars of agartha, the underground kingdom how to cross the thresholds. i sadly was the fourth, those few of us who descended from kahiki, the islands ever far. we learned to harness the very nature of paradox and the illusion that is mind and matter, what we call the illusive dream of psi. 

psionics were rare. we never left our small family units because people did not understand us at all. i made a mistake and got caught on camera using telekinesis, an application of psi, to protect someones kid, and suddenly i was arrested and dragged before the council to be forcefully taught magic, as i must clearly have been a mage. 

those who could not pass would have their essence drained to sustain the living waters, killing them. i had no choice, i had to pretend to study until i can make my escape."
"[wp] you are a supervillain and your child has joined the hero in their fight against you. they think that you would be absolutely furious, but really you couldnt be more proud of them.","looking across the battlefield at ophelia, there were miles between them, acres, even. they had been on opposite sides for too long. in that moment, he realized he had spent half his life chasing her. and she, him. and now, as she stood withered at his hands,  a mirror image of himself,  he felt no triumph.

his breathing was haggard as it dawned on him that this might be the end. at least for one of them. after all, it had always been meant to end this way one of them dying by the others hand. the world wasnt made for both of them.

in no version of reality could it have ended any other way. a miserable truth.

it killed him a bit, if he was honest.

he had waited for this moment for a long time. and now, standing there, everything seemed to slow. the chaos around them faded into silence as they held a standoff that stretched endlessly. both wondering who would strike first, who would deal the final blow. who had it in them to end the game?

still dramatic as ever. go on then,  end me like you swore you would, she drawled, the smirk never quite leaving her arrogant, beautiful face.

he gave a faint, crooked smile,  the kind that had once meant trouble, back when things between them were simpler. his gaze stayed locked on hers as he took a step forward, sword still low, not raised yet. 

its not a game this time, ophelia, he added, quieter now. almost to himself. and shed hear it, not just the words, but the weight of them. the way they settled in his chest like regret. the way his hands, though calloused and skilled, trembled ever so slightly.

he wasnt playing anymore. and he knew,  deep downneither was she.

she lunged. 

it was a blur then. a slash here, steel colliding like thunderclaps. the sky burned orange, casting their shadows long and monstrous. they moved like dancers, violent, tragic dancers. 

in another life, matthius could have imagined them in dim, candlelit rooms, holding each other with the softness of lovers, moving without malice. but this was not that life. it never could be. they had been doomed from the start. the hate was predestined. written in their bloodlines before either of them had even learned what love was.

the moment reached a crescendo. she struck low, slicing at his knees, and matthius collapsed with a groan but hadnt he always been at her knees? in one way or another?

she turned from him, chest heaving and barked over her shoulder, get up, matthius. show some fight.

it sounded desperate. she was winning,  and yet she still asked for more.

summoning every shred of will he had left, matthius pushed himself to his feet. he wasnt ready to say goodbye, not to her. his heart had always thrummed concerning hers.

he remembered when his father forbade him from ever seeing her again, and later, when the order came to kill her. family issues, theyd said. but it had always been deeper than that,  generations of wrongdoings from both sides, rot that went back too far. they were meant to be enemies. and oh, what a shame.

still, in pursuit of her, there had been a fire in him that nothing else had ever ignited. it was wretched, this war, this chase but it was wonderful too. because it meant they had something that mattered. 

he lifted his sword, heavy now, and aimed it toward her. somehow, it felt more dangerous in his hand than it ever had before.

come now, he muttered.

she came. that smirk, that glorious, defiant face.  hed dreamt of it, feared it, loved it. if only things had been different.

a blur. a flurry of blades. a strike that penetrated through her armour. his heart convulsed with every attack he laid onto her, because he knew she would know if he wasnt trying. she would be offended. and he owed her that, a fair fight.

they fought for what felt like hours in mere moments. until finally, with a desperate hack, he knocked her back. but the cost was steep. her blade had found him, too.

he collapsed, his sword flying from his hand. his body was failing. he could feel the blood pouring from him, his vision blurring. yet before his world went black, he saw her, also collapsed, motionless, not far from him.

he should finish it, end it once and for all. that was the plan. that was always the plan.

but his heart wasnt in it."
"[wp] during a robot apocalypse, one man realizes the machines cant seem to notice him. the truth? he is a vampire.","desolation, i have seen this before, many times before. the waking hours on a battle field anointed in blood, soldiers asleep in the tree lines, in muddy ditches, or sequestered in their steel tanks. quiet, the calm before the hypothetical storm, a sort of deafening quiet. 

humanity has always had disposition for killing themselves, in the early days, it used to be that members of my race had to hunt our prey, stalking in the shadows, just beyond the illumination of a street lamp or fire, and then as soon as we appeared, we would attack and scurry away, like rats, until another evening. in the recent era, two world wars, many armed conflicts, the militarization of police and the seemingly fashionable nature of facisim. an seemingly endless draught of blood at every corner, albeit sometimes colder then preferred. 

now a new contender vies for our spot atop the food chain, a resource driven hunger, never weary. a collective child of mankind. ai machines race across the battle fields unaffected by any loss, no need for morale, just cold calculated cunning. despite this they rarely notice us. 

we have become scavengers in a land where once we were gypsies in a palace. drinking dry what little remains of humanity and of what they unknowingly leave behind for us to drink."
"[wp] found memoryless in a forest, you lived for years on a widows farm. she tried everything to help you remember. nothing worked until the day you saw her held at swordpoint, and your true identity came rushing back.","the man with the sword stepped over grammy, leveling the blade at me. and i said this aint your concern.

instinctively, i reached out with a grasping motion, felt my hand close around something solid, and yanked. vines shot out from the ground and wrapped around the mans sword, pulling it from his grip. it fell to the ground with a muffled thump.

the man looked up at me, eyes wide. a look i knew all too well fear.

i felt my stomach curl and bile rise in my throat.

the man with rusted sword and ragged clothes no longer stood in front of me. it was no longer a bandit the villagers so adamantly warned against. before me now stood a hooded figure in dark robes, silver insignia glinting on their chest. no longer were we surrounded by forest but smooth stone, polished to a sheen. 

behind them, a second figure, shrouded in shadow, lay curled on the ground. 

let her go, i said again, voice wavering.

the figure leaned in, its hot sour breath washing over me. you cannot escape.

stones beneath the robed figure cracked. i stumbled back, gasping, as vines curled their way up from the cracks and slowly began to wrap around the figure. 

the figure didnt move. didnt struggle. under its hood, there was a faint glint, and i was certain they were smiling. 

we will find you, the figure managed, choking out the words as tendrils curled around their neck before fully encasing them in a dark green cocoon. 

a hand tentatively brushed my shoulder, and i jumped. 

shhh, came grammys voice. aerith, its okay. its only me. 

the name pulled me away from the dark chamber. away from the hooded figure. 

aerith was what grammy had decided to call me five years ago. she said it was a type of flower found on the snow covered peaks of the therin mountains. a flower the same blue as my eyes and strong enough to weather the toughest of snowstorms. 

i opened my eyes to find grammys wrinkled face looking down on me, full of concern."
[wp] a superhero after beating a group of street thugs found a baby they had kidnapped but couldnt find their parents so decided to raise them by themselves but soon the worlds greatest villain showed up at their apartment door looking for their child.,"agreed, more!!!!"
"[wp] come on, honey, let me in. being a vampire is actually pretty nice. didnt we promise together forever? sweetielet me inside!!!please?","why wont you just talk to me? your wife. why wont you talk to your wife. i heard her plead. she had been doing this for the last few hours, though it felt like days. i tried my best to avoid speaking at all. i didnt know what powers she might have now, i couldnt risk being controlled. i knew one thing that was for sure. i could not invite her in. i kept working with my hands, i was making sure not to stop, no matter what she said. 

i cant believe youre doing this to me. to us. i thought we were beyond this sort of thing. i just want to be with you... why dont you want to be with me? when did you stop loving me? she cried. 

her voice was cracking and had an unnatural hiss to it. my wife never sounded like this before. i knew what had happened of course. it was all over the news. the vampire miracle. it was spreading, people were getting bit at an alarming rate and the worst part of it... most of them were willing. i knew she was one of them. she had been fascinated with the news when it broke. she loved the idea of living forever and being stronger. 

please, just talk to me.... i dont like this. i hate it. please dont... her sentence trailed off into sobbing. 

the sound of her sobbing was familiar. it was the same when her parents died. it broke my heart to hear her that way. my body couldnt handle it, it moved on its own towards the door. i unlocked it all in a hurry, and thrust open the door to look at her. when i did, we locked eyes immediately. i saw my wife, a little more pale than last time and her hair was a beautiful silver where it was black before. my heart throbbed. i let my protective feelings for her endanger myself, however, my hand was gripping tightly the wooden stake that i had been sharpening this whole time. i had forgotten i was holding it. 

her emotions changed quickly. the look on her face from me opening the door quickly turned from relief to shocked. she stood up. 

you were going to kill me? you made that for me and you were going to murder me as soon as i came inside! she made up her mind about my intentions quickly. 

i dont know what i was going to do! you went and turned yourself into a vampire. i was scared! i shouted my first words at her since the change. 

she was crying but her body wasnt shaking like it normally did. i couldnt tell if it was her unnatural powers or her resolve. 

i love you and i want to be with you forever but you dont trust me anymore. you felt like you might have to kill me. i cant handle that. dont you understand that i love you. she was shouting, she couldnt help it. 

i think i do. i think so. i practically whispered those words in response. 

thinking isnt enough. you have to know and if you cant know. i cant be here. im really sorry. she looked me in the eyes and took a few steps back. 

wait! jessica! i yelled out her name as she walked back but by the time i could step out of the house she had been taken by the night."

[thank you for reading. if you enjoyed the story, feel free to check out some other writing prompt responses ive written.]"
[wp] what is that! shouted the cleric. its our new wizard you asked me to find. said the fighter i meant a human maybe a elf what is that thing. said the cleric hes a woolly mammoth beast man and hes awesome hes a master wizard so hes perfect for our party. replied the fighter.,"hello, i am ammon za silver tusk. i wave at them.  
the cleric took a step back, while the rogue checked me out.  
not blaming them, i was like 3 times their height.  
what king of wizard are you? the cleric asks.  
i mastered evoking, conjuring, and gained my shaman totem. i say.  
they stare at me confused.  
see? master wizard! perfect for us. the fighter that found me laughed, slapping my thigh, as that is the only thing he could reach.

  
my apologies, ammon, but while i saw beastmen...a woolly mammoth one is something i havent heard about. the cleric says.  
oh, no worries. we live in the northern eye, and rarely move out. i say.  
the cleric pales, while the rogue actually starts praying.  
ttthe northern eye? the neverending storm the size of a continent? yyou live there?! the cleric stutters.  
i nod.  
thats why i am so fluffy. i chuckle.  
the two took some time to calm down, while the fighter was laughing at their antics.  
after a good few minutes, they were ready to talk.

  
lets do a dungeon run in a midtier dungeon, okay?  
i want to test out your skills. the cleric says.  
sure. i smile, thinking it is normal.  
so, we went to a dungeon nearby.  
an hour later, i watched as my cuties, some ice spirits, and snowflake demons chewed through the wyvern boss body.  
the cleric was staring at me, as if i was a monster, while the rogue was checking out the totem i slammed into the floor.  
how? you didnt even move?! the cleric says.  
i chuckle.

  
we woolly mammoths are usually barbarians, warriors, fighters, monks and so on, taking the physical path.  
i...i had another talent, so i made sure i can do everything my clansmen can do, but with magic. i say.  
but you just cleared a dungeon in an hour, that usually takes 2 days for an experienced team.  
also, you used all the elements, summoned at least 19 different types of summons, and your shamanic buffs were in the hundreds! he shouts.  
well, i thought you wanted to see what i can do, so i showed a small part of my skills...otherwise only ice magic could have frozen this entire dungeon. i say.  
how did you master so many things?! he roared.  
now, cleric, you are rude... the fighter started.  
i am 932 years old, me ma would beat me up if i didnt master this many things. i smile.  
the cleric sighed, and the rogue giggled.  
fine. welcome to the team. first thing you have to do buy us drinks at the inn. he says, leaving.  
i nod happily, and follow them out of the dungeon.  
finally, i have a herd outside the eye...i can start my adventure!"
"[wp] to train with the sword, first master sweeping. when you have mastered sweeping, you must master speech, craft, and writing.when you have mastered all these things you must master building a house. once your house is built, you have no further need for a sword, since it is a useless instrument.","ha, fun take on it"
"[wp] you are a supervillain. youve discovered where your hero nemesis lives, works, and relaxes. however, you follow the code so youd never attack them. doesnt mean you cant change the city slightly to annoy them.","i had worked my way up the chain, putting in my time first as a common thug to then eventually breaking out on my own with a costume and a gimmick.  getting my first hero nemesis had been a major step, but he already had a full gallery of villains so i had been relegated to minor footnote at best.  it took over a year of painstaking research until i made the most important discovery of all his secret identity and all that it entails.  i knew his address, the location of his hidden base, where he worked while posing as a civilian, everything!  but, according to the code of capes and cowls, i wasnt allowed to directly act upon that information to attack him.

but, since he worked for the city as a parking enforcement officer poe, or in common terms, a meter maid, there was nothing that could stop me from making his job frustrating.  so, i spent some time to learn city parking bylaws and the terms of his employment.  i didnt want to do any too overt, but i found a ton of grey area that i could exploit for my own amusement.  it took a couple of small robberies to get the funds together i needed to put my plans into action.

i started with contracting walt the wireless wizard to build a device that i could use to scramble information used by the peos to write up tickets.   they used this handheld computer and would type in things like license plates and such, but did you know that if the information isnt correct, the ticket is invalid?  and that peos needed to write a certain quota of valid tickets per month and every wrong ticket counted against their total?  you can see where this was headed.  after about two months, my nemesis wasnt the star performer that he had been previously.  he went from first to dead last.  i could hardly contain my joy when reading the reprimand reports that were filed against him.  did i stop there?  oh no, i was just getting started.

the tires on the peos cars are easy to tamper with.  a simple twist of the valve stem and you have a slow leak, something that really ruins a lunch break. another contract with walt gave me a remote way to disable the electrical system of the car, something i could quickly reverse with the flick of a switch.  the countless hours he spent in the summer heat with a dead car, only for it to start when a supervisor arrived made his expression all the sweeter to behold. eventually, i set up relays throughout the city so that i could track him and torment him from the comfort of my couch at home.

im not really sure of my endgame for this.  should i confront him at some point during a battle and drop hints that his work issues are my fault? i have noticed that he seems much more stressed when i encounter him in costume.  i dont want to reach out to a villain lawyer in case what im doing is technically breaking the code, but im not sure how to go about taking credit for my work.  also, his last meltdown after getting a subpar review at work might be a sign he wont find this whole situation as funny as i do."
[wp] you are a a street thug who is in the middle of robbing 2 parents when you notice thier son staring in at you from the front of the alley.,"my arm is steady as i hold the gun on the two adults.  the man is taking his time removing the wallet from his jacket while his wife is unclasping her pearls from around her neck.  if i can fence these goods for something worthwhile, maybe i can feed myself and my kid for a few days and take that particular worry off my back for at least a moment.  thats when i noticed their son standing behind them.  he doesnt look scared and his eyes seem to burn into my soul.  i get a flash of premonition, something like the universe has lined up in just the right way and given me a glimpse of what could happen. i see my future, and that of many more play out in my mind in a single heartbeat.  im astounded at the magnitude of the images and ashamed of what ive become.

without realizing it, ive lowered my firearm, pointing it at the ground.  the parents freeze when i speak, my voice low but clear.  ive made a mistake.  just go on with your night, with your son, i say, gesturing to the boy.  keep your things.  ill find another way to get by, something honest.  sorry to have troubled you.

as i turn away, tossing the gun into a dumpster in the alley, the man speaks, his voice cultured.  wait.  hard times happen to everyone.  take the money from my wallet to get you started on a better path.  my eyes search his face, looking for a trick, trying not to hope, but his sincerity feels genuine.  i take the cash and nod. i give my apology again and walk off, hearing the father speaking to his son about giving people a chance to do the right thing.

im about half a block away when i hear the gunshot.  my heart sinks and i turn back towards the direction i had come from, breaking into a cold sweat as i begin sprinting.  i hear the wail of a young boy, the deep anguish that rips at my soul.  as i turn the corner that leads into the alley, i see the family i had left, shattered by nameless greed.  my eyes harden as i see a disreputable shadow fleeing from the scene and every fiber in my body screams at me to give chase, to bring justice to this horrible event, but i find my feet rooted to the spot, unable to move. the universe gives me a second look at what comes next, and i fear for the city."

he stopped staring where the wound was then looked at me, then at nadia, then shrugged i can think of several reasons.  first of all, you didnt stab him exactly.  you had no knife, no pen, no blade.  you didnt pick up some random weapon.  you made a knife image on your hand and your hand acted as a knife, thats more power then most could imagine.  second of all, you responded to an attack on yourself by a hostile force with perhaps a bit above reasonable force but still you responded in a manner that ensured a second attack was unlikely at best.  finally and most importantly, you attacked a man who himself admitted literally as he was bleeding out that he is a villain.  mr. bastard here doesnt see himself as a hero.  he isnt a mentor.  hes the villain in our story and he fully intends us harm.  he actively encouraged combat between two of us.  humiliated one of us until she nearly broke.  attacked you unprovoked with no guarantee of your protection.  every action of his has villain plastered all over it.  hell even his request of me wasnt morally sound.  he didnt ask us to call for help, he didnt hit the emergency button that i know is under every teachers desk or point us to it.  no he put the responsibility for his goddamn life on a preteen whos sole power is to give himself nosebleeds!  he is exactly what he said, the villain.  however if we want to be heroes we cant kill him, we have to beat him within the rules.



gold star for the blood manipulator.  so nathan if thats your sole power how did i not die.  she hit just the right spot, the schools reaction time to emergencies is solid but id bet that tim could tell you it wouldnt have been enough.



nathan shook his head.  i dont fucking know you bastard, you should be dead, all i did was stare at your wound, it should have just kept bleeding.  it didnt, and yet i didnt do anything.  





authors note

apologies if this was a bit long, prompt really fired me up."
[wp] it says on your rsum you worked as a demon for two years?,"uh, yes sir.  it was a little over two years.  about two years and three months.

and where was that?

bush international airport, houston, texas.

oh.  ive not been there in a while.  tell me about it?

ah...  it started a few years back.  satan held a meeting in hell, several demons were tasked with increasing hells presence on earth.  the original plan was to just build new, but someone came up with the idea of subletting existing spaces.  then someone said why not airports?  they are pretty close to hell already? and everyone loved the idea.  some other demon already knew president bush. they had worked together in the past, so choosing iah was a natural fit.  the plan was set into motion, i was created to manage it.

the interviewer replies, ah.  i see.  so you were created new for this position?

yeah, thats right.  i was given all the standard demon knowledge packs, plus a few extras like customer service nightmares, how to screw up logistics...  things like that.

so how did it go?

i started the position with an eye on the usual  delaying flights, losing luggage, upping the pheromones and other smells to make the humans more miserable and cranky so theyd treat each other worse.  all of that was a big success.  i was nominated employee of the month at least 4 times in the first year alone.

it was the second year where i really hit my stride.  it occurred to me  why just the airport?  why not screw with the humans before they even get to the airport?  thats when i came up with plans for construction.  getting the funding was easy, and those stupid humans were more than happy to go along with construction as long as they were getting paid.

oh yeah.  i read about the misery that caused.  legendary.  what can you tell me about it?

well, its easy to just do construction.  the trick is to find places and projects that really, really fuck things up.  stuff like we need to widen this particular road.  make sure it looks on the surface like were trying to help, when in reality we know that the real reason for widening that road will do nothing but block people in traffic for years...  causing stress...  causing misery...  making people hate each other... hate themselves...  lots of hate.

the interviewer smiled, very nice.  how much hate did you create?

the metrics showed about 150 at first, but i managed to adjust the construction projects just a bit here and there, and that boosted the hate up to a whopping 510.

wow! the interviewer said.  is that clocked?

oh yes sir, clocked and verified.  and of course, the patterns i used were copied and duplicated in most airports around the us.

nice.  well, as you know we are looking to expand hell into immigration services.  we think the climate on earth is right for a move right now, and we are looking for someone with fresh, out of the box thinking to really fucking punch up the hell in immigration services.  new ideas.  things that havent been tried before.  things that challenge that pesky constitution and the bill of rights the us has.  but i think you are the right demon for the job.  when would you be able to start?

my assignment at iah ends january 31st, 2025.  so, february 1 would work for me.

good!  the new president will be in place then, and ive been assured hes open to what we are trying to accomplish.  welcome aboard! the interviewer says as he stands to shake the demons hand.  ill talk to parking and get you a new parking pass."
"[wp] long ago, you muttered something cool about mortal traits of bravery and sacrifice to a god you beat. now, they show up to your doorstep dressed in a hoodie asking for relationship advice from the most knowledgeable person on mortals they know. a vein bulges in your templeyoure still single.","i stare at the god, gushing about his new girlfriend, and how weird she is behaving.  
so, we went on a date, and i took her to a galaxy, where mortals are living flowers, and trees.  
i had them make a festival for her, and we laughed, and danced, but then...  
we kissed.  
ever since then, shes weird around me.  
please, wise mortal, how can i get over this? he asks.  
i am almost at my breaking point.  
once i defeated this fella, and spewed some bs, and now he is back, thinking i am some sage.  
problem is! i am still single!

  
well, how long have you dated before kissing her? i ask.  
2 months.  
shes a semimortal, as she has some elven bloodline, but i guess 2 months, shouldnt be too early, no?  
oh no! did i pressure her into kissing me?  
am i a monster?! he panics.  
i sigh.  
dont think like that. how did she act before? was she looking at you? smiling? laughing? touching accidently your arms, shoulder, whatever? i ask.  
he nods.  
oh boy, this is like asking advice from a monk.



we laughed, we danced, and she even moved one of my stray strands of hair, out of the way.  
it was a spark there...thats why i kissed her. i dont want to mess this up. he says, burying himself into my couch, pulling the hoodies hood even more over his head.  
i grit my teeth.  
it sounds like she just got surprised. iis she the shy type? maybe you are her first boyfriend? i try hard not to be an asshole to this guy, but its hard.  
he sits up straight.  
she mentioned not being used to dating...and that this is all new to her, but she likes it... he mutters.  
i sigh.

  
dont worry mate, its just the jitters of a person in a new relationship.  
it happens, and mostly likely it will happen again, to you and her as well. i say.  
what can i do? he asks.  
take it slow, be respectful, dont be shy to say that you are confused, and dont know what to do.  
ask her questions, what she wants, what she would like to do, and overall, be respectful.  
if there is a connection between the 2 of you, no matter how rocky the journey gets, with patience, and mutual respect, you will get through it. i say.  
thank you! wise mortal! he booms, lunging at me, hugging me.  
get off! i say, and he jumps away laughing.  
thank you! i will bring you godfruits next time i visit! now excuse me, but i have to talk to...my girlfriend! he laughs, disappearing.  
i frown.  
should have beaten him up more... i mutter, as i clean the table, and wonder if i should go to the inn, and try finding a girlfriend for myself as well.  
if he can have one...why shouldnt i be able to find someone?"

"[wp] you are a humble lumberjack who, for the past three weeks, has been harassed by wood elves for, destroying the sanctity of nature, despite your very conservative lumber style. so you decide to reintroduce them to one of their own beloved creatures. beavers.","upon witnessing the sheer destruction that beavers were capable of, the wood elves decided to leave jack alone. for now. but not without shaking their fists at the beavers and shouting in long, overly complex words that the lumberjack didnt understand.

it was only the very next day, while chopping wood along the riverbank, that jack spotted a dead beaver. not ravaged by a predator. it was shot in the heart with a wooden arrow.

so much for the sanctity of nature, he muttered under his breath. them high and mighty elves.

with a sigh, he went on to his usual routine, trying to pretend all was fine. what could he do? the beaver was already dead when he arrived. and he knew not where to find these secretive elves. would be a waste of time when he had much work to do.

day after day, more dead beavers appeared along the route he took to chop wood. until there wasnt any corpse, but a band of wood elves. jack supposed their shouting in the past meant they were coming for him after the beavers.

wait, let me talk, an elf with a mohawk and skinny jeans pushed through the crowd. sorry about my more backwards kin. im sam, from the main city, here to provide translation. so, human, they accused you of destroying the sanctity of nature. just between you and me, i think youre fine. but you need to convince them.

huh, youre an interesting one, jack grunted. im an old school lumberjack. i work with my axe. i dont do that slash and burn nonsense like big corpos. beavers cut down trees too. theyre part of nature. nothing wrong with that. they didnt deserve to die like that. i bet those elves cut wood to fletch their arrows. so, not fair. double standards.

the urban city elf nodded. he turned to speak with the wood elves. they chattered among themselves, voices highpitched and agitated. eventually, sam waved at jack.

alright. they conceded that beavers are creatures of nature and chewing wood is in their nature, the elf jammed his hands into his pockets and slouched. but not you. they were asking if you could get a different job that didnt involve chopping wood.

tell them i wont, unless they can promise my family is well taken care of for all their lives, jack held firm. because the wood elves said so is not an excuse to change a job i been working at for years.

another discussion in elvish. all spoken in hushed tones this time, as if speaking softer meant jack couldnt hear them. he could. just didnt know what the heck they were saying.

okay, human. heres a compromise, sam lit up a cigarette and took a puff, much to the disgust and disdain of the wood elves. you keep chopping your wood. you supply these elves with wood for their bow and arrows and forest huts. they give you these rare magical seeds. i connect you with a buyer from the big city. what do you think?

i would say yes. on the condition these magical seeds dont grow into giant beanstalks.

[wp]you thought you are special?! please stop. i can only laugh so much... humanity is an experiment. we pulled you out of the simulation by mortality because we need the server. humanity is nothing more than 700 million constructs with simulated sentience.,"[stellar smarts]

so, why am i here? whats so special about me? lyra asked. her morning so far had been rather unexpected. she was investigating some unusual temporal interactions, and as a result, she woke up somewhere else. a tall, humanoid reptilian appeared shortly after and welcomed her to reality, as he called it. 



special? you thought you are special?! serpentus didnt hide his coldblooded mirth at her question. please stop. i can only laugh so much..., he added as his laughter died down. humanity is an experiment. we pulled you out of the simulation by mortality because we need the server. humanity is nothing more than 700 million constructs with simulated sentience. 



okay. you say that, but im still here, theres a reason, isnt there? lyra asked with a smile. she was amused that she knew why she was there before he did. 



ive explained it, serpentus repeated it, and she got the impression it was the first time hed ever needed to. he gave a curious look as if he couldnt believe she was asking. we pulled you out of the simulation by mortality because we need the server. youre dead, as is every other human on earth. 



i heard you, lyra nodded. but, that doesnt answer my question at all. you said you needed server space. why am i here instead of just deleted? she asked. surely this consciousness that im experiencing right now still requires server processing power, wouldnt you think? and, the last time i checked, just this morning, earths population was in the billions.  magnitudes larger than 700 million. 



i dont think you understand the situation youve found yourself in, serpentus began, but lyra shook her head. 



i dont think you understand the situation ive put myself in, mr. serpentus, she giggled. your scam is so unorganized, i can just walk in through the door that no one is supposed to know about, and im automatically accepted as a victim. my names lyra, i represent sharp development, she added. while we dont necessarily mind your business you are currently operating on one of our servers. im here to formally request you take your operation to an unclaimed earth id be happy to help you find a suitable one. 



youre an imaginative one, thats why we kept you around, serpentus smiled. 



ill tell you what, ill give you that one for free, lyra smiled. im just relieved it was a simple scam, and not more complicated trouble. but, if the next words out of your mouth arent, youve got a deal, im shutting you down. right here, and right now, she said. 



now, before you say anything, i want you to think really hard about it. youre exposed already, theres no question. ive already made it clear youre not in any direct trouble yet, and im willing to help. there is a possibility youre not familiar with sharp development yet, i can understand that. but, i walked in here with full knowledge, and i can see what you really are right now, her eyes glowed with golden stars. you might think youre big shots hopping from earth to earth putting on this big show about how youre pulling them out of the simulation. but, i assure you, sharp development is quite a big deal. you referred to humanity as 700 million constructs i know thats wrong because we own more than that many earths. you dont have to believe that part necessarily but, let me ask you this. if im standing here telling you that i know youre lying, and youre actually lying. do you really want to bet against yourself by not taking my offer? serpentus stared into her eyes for a moment, and she kept the golden stars active as she held his gaze. 



youve got a deal, he said as the snake form dissolved to reveal a portly teenager with blond hair. im webber, i look forward to working with sharp development, he said. 



hi, webber, lyra smiled. you made the right choice.

"[wp] so you have the power to destroy, anything. yep. and you became a doctor? yes.","ready? general stahl asked for what i hoped was the final time.

ready as well ever be, general.

good to know. well have to go radio silent as soon as we begin, so whatever communication you two need, do it now.

whats my signal, geek? shatter asked.

ill make a drone visible. should grab his attention, too.

good, gives me a target.

and, um, shatter?

what, geek?

if things start to go south, ill detonate a bunch of drones. that should give you a distraction.

well have bigger problems if we get to that point, but appreciate the offer.

least i could do, youve got the hard part.

shatter just nodded. we all knew the sacrifice he was signing up for.

do it, geek.

my drones turned invisible, and i started moving them towards the doctors last known location. now came the hard part.

    

holy hell, its working, i muttered to myself.

i could feel doctors defenses begin to fall, slowly succumbing to my technopathy. it was a tricky operation, usurping the healer bots without attracting attention. the doctor wasnt dumb hed layered firewalls, honeypots, ai agents, and other defenses to protect his bots. still, it was 1s and 0s at the end of the day, and i spoke those better than he did.

et voila, i muttered as i took control of the last bot.

i sighed, knowing that the hard part was next.

signal to shatter, i commanded the smallest of my drones. it turned off its invisibility, and began flying in a wouldbe reconnaissance pattern. i had to at least pretend like things were normal, or the doctor would see through the ruse and try to eradicate everything in sight before the fight began.

on cue, the doctor flew in. wed long suspected he was removing gravity in his immediate vicinity in order to achieve this feat, but there was no good way to prove it.

a drone? that you, geek? the doctor mused.

i inhaled sharply. even from a distance, i worried. if shatter didnt hold his attention, i was next.

not him. me, shatter announced as he slammed into the doctor from behind. it was precisely the sort of thing that his speed and strength enabled, and he wasted no time in jumping into the fray.

with a little luck, this wouldnt last long.

help him, i commanded the drone. it turned on its blasters, doing what it could to add to the damage that the doctor sustained. it wasnt much, but every little bit counted. this was going to be a war of attrition.

enough of that, the doctor muttered as he folded the drone in on itself.

and for you, he commanded as he began to disintegrate shatters left leg.

the scream nearly broke me. how do you block out that sound? it was a primal roar, the kind that no amount of training fixes. for the thousandth time, i prayed that shatters sanity would hold.

on cue, i felt the doctors electronic signal. i couldnt quite tell where hed triggered it from, but his heal bots were given the command to heal. so, i bade them heal shatter. only i told them to increase the rate and total energy expended there was no point in shatter suffering longer than necessary.

hm, odd, the doctor commented as he noticed the unusual output.

shatter, to this credit, didnt wait. he knew how desperate this plan was, and he came barreling into the doctor again, swinging with mean intentions. i noticed that he was swinging for the body, hitting the liver and solar plexus as many times and as quickly as he could.

smart. cut off his oxygen, i realized.

shatter managed a half dozen blows before the doctor was able to gather his wits again. the effect was immediate, as shatters momentum stopped immediately. wounds began to appear on shatters sternum and abdomen the doctor was trying to inflict the same kind of injury on shatter in a twisted attempt at poetic justice.

you ... that ... hurt, the doctor coughed out.

i felt the commands for the healer bots again, only this time the doctor intended to direct some of his healing at himself.

dammit. what now?

the plan hadnt accounted for this. if the doctor realized the ruse now, he still had enough left in the tank to decimate everything in a three mile radius, including both shatter and me. but i couldnt just let him regenerate and keep torturing shatter. i had to prolong this a tad, long enough to sap the doctor some more.

im sorry, shatter, i whispered quietly as i shut my eyes tightly.

i let the bots heal the doctor at one percent of his intended rate enough that he would feel some type of healing, but not nearly enough to recover. i had to let him think he was still in control and that he could resort to his usual tricks.

i heard the raspiness in the doctors breathing began to subside, slowly turning into more of a cough than a gurgle.

shatters wounds healed much faster, though, and he charged in with reckless abandon. i could tell that there was far less technique involved at this point. whether that was because of the pain, fatigue, trauma, or some combination of all of the above, i couldnt tell. it just looked ... primal. shatter lashed out with heavy blows, targeting the doctors mid section over and over again.

i shut off the doctors healing immediately, letting the damage accumulate. this time, the barrage lasted longer. ten, fifteen solid blows landed before the doctor could retaliate. shatters arms broke in midair, violently. to his credit, he swung one last kick as his momentum drove him forward.

bas ... tard ... was all that the doctor could manage.

again, i felt the call for healing. it was urgent, and apparently had a secret mode for overclocking the bots. the doctor was hurt, and he wanted no part of it.

not. this. time. i practically grunted at him.

wha? the doctor could barely speak as the shock registered. there was no mistaking it now he didnt have control over his healing bots. now, when he needed it the most, his ace in the hole was gone.

the doctor began to lash out in anger, trying to destroy the traitorous healers. yet he was weakened in this state, and could barely dent the metal. the intricate circuitry and power cores were safe, and they continued to conspire against him.

lets hope this helps, i prayed.

i commanded my remaining bots to attack, turning their lasers on the doctor. under normal circumstances, he wouldve removed them from the fight without a second thought. now, though, they concentrated their fire for precious seconds. the interlaced mesh of heat and force pounded his body, bruising organs that couldnt afford any more bruising and stressing alreadybroken bones.

arrg!!!

something was still protecting the doctor, though. it was as if an invisible force shield limited the damage from the drones. those lasers could normally cut through steel.

i took a calculated risk, and sent a few drones crashing into him, sacrificing themselves to punch through whatever armor the doctor had conjured up.

the doctor shuttered on impact, and i saw the remaining lasers began to apply more force.

its working!

taking a page out of the doctors playbook, i overclocked my own drones, telling them to pour it on as long as they could. shatter would be back in the fight any moment, and i was draining the doctor in the meantime. the scales were tilting in our favor, it seemed.

on cue, shatter shook off the cobwebs. he had been healing all this time, and the extra few seconds of respite had given him a second to recover his purpose. he wasnt just healed, he remembered what he was doing. he had control of his muscles and his mental faculties, for the moment at least.

and he looked pissed.

i pretended not to hear the string of obscenities he let loose, but i did watch him unleash multiple three and five piece combinations into the doctor. knowing what the last counterattack had taken out of him, shatter didnt dare let up. he punched, punched, and punched, applying every bit of training and super strength that he could muster.

the heavy blows finally accomplished their mission, and the doctor began to crumple. seeing his opportunity, shatter pressed forward with one last barrage, ending the string of blows with a deadly hook and a vicious uppercut. the last punch landed, and the doctor collapsed.

a moment later, shatter did, too.

general! get your crew in there, quick!

mission accomplished?!

yes, but theyre both down. not sure how long the doctor is down, but you need to slap the dampeners on him, now!

and shatter?

physically, hes probably fine.

and otherwise?

pray to whatever deity you believe in that hes the same after ... that.

i heard the general shout orders in the background, scrambling his teams to finish the mission. more than the words, though, i could hear the fear and urgency in his voice. he was worried for shatter.

we all were."
"[wp] sorry kid, its nothing personal. first, im 35. i am not a kid. second, you broke into my home, killed the love of my life and kidnapped my child at school, and you are trying to tell me its nothing personal?","well, for it to be personal, id have to know you and have something against you. to me, youre just a guy in a file handed to me by a guy with a lot of money. now that guy, its definitely personal for him. do you know how much he paid me? honestly, kid, you should be flattered. its not everyday bounties are that high.

i told you, im not a fucking kid, now i was really pissed off. i took a deep breath only to be reduced to a choking cough as the blood pooled in my nose was sucked down the back of my throat. that only pissed me off more. if after all of this i die tied to a chair in my own fucking house choking on my own fucking blood while the worlds most nonchalant asshole twiddles his thumbs and watches im going to lose it.

kid, guy, kevin, whatever, my captor waved his latexgloved hand at me dismissively. he was far too busy digging through the plain black backpack he had set down next to him on my couch to pay much attention to my complaints.

my name is alan, i barked at him. to my disdain, he didnt even flinch.

okay, sure thing, kevin.

before i could continue my foolhardy endeavor of running my mouth at my captor, i was sobered in an instant when from the depths of his backpack he brandished what looked to be an oversized candle wick trimmer.

yeah, thatll do the job, the man said as he held it to the light for inspection. dont worry, kevin. im a real 12snip kind of guy. you should be grateful im the one who got your file. some of the other guys i know? oof, real fuckin sadists. not me though, ive got your back.

okay, ill admit, this is where i started to get nervous. the cooper taste of blood burning my tongue all but disappeared as the fearinduced adrenaline surge hit my body.

what does 12snip entail? i asked feebly. my hands shook behind my back where they had been tied together and my knees all but started knocking.

i think we both know what 12snip entails.

there was no use in arguing that. we did both know exactly what 12snip was.

as my captor got off the couch and started walking towards me i entered the bargaining stage of grief. its one thing if im about to be 12snipped, its another for me to have no fucking idea why."

grammy nodded. blasted rock made me trip, she said gently, brushing the hair out of my eyes. im alright. she glanced over her shoulder. behind her, the ground looked like a stampede of cattle had run through, and two of the bandits were fully encased in vines. cant say as much about those blokes.

gods, i whispered. im sorry. are are they i couldnt bring myself to finish.

grammy shrugged. i say they deserve it. attacking an old woman in the middle of the woods. and in broad daylight no less.

grammy stood, knees popping. you dear, have the ears of a wolf. its a good thing you came when you did. can you stand?

i nodded, pulling myself shakily to my feet.

those parasites ruined a perfectly good adderfruit pie. adelaide made it specifically for you. granny bent over to pick up a mangled basket. she thinks you like them.

i did in fact not like adderfruit pie. it was entirely too mushy. and sour.

well have to tell her it was delicious, granny continued, picking up the least broken of what had fallen from her basket. the cow, at least, will like it. now, help me carry this back to the farm.

i i started. i mean. will you

my hands began to shake. she should report me. she should report me and have me hauled away for using magic. never to be seen or heard from again.

grammy rested her hand at the small of my back and steered me towards the farm. lets keep this between us, she said. well find ourselves a nice, hot drink, and you can tell me what you remember."
"[wp] so, we dropped a giant mech in the middle of a populated city from a spaceship, then from it we launch an intercontinental nuke to the target ? yes. why dont we just fucking drop the nuke from a plane ?","sir the mech has deployed, weapon launch in 3 minutes the weapons officer announced to the captain.

sorry, my first combat mission here, but why are we landing rather than just launching from here whispered the embedded reporter.

this was the first time a human had witnessed a true intergalactic conflict. first contact had only occurred 4 years prior and the initial envoys had been very cautious about allowing humans to explore the galaxy.

for the same reason that our fleet isnt engaging with their fleet, the sigma accords

the reporter glanced at the view screen. 300 united peoples ships glinting above the grey planet below, scores of drop ships descending to the planet below. staring at them across the emptiness were 400 confederate ships. 

and errrr what are they?

the weapons officer sighed and turned to face her.

the sigma accords were signed during the 3rd galactic warfare treaty. after the first and second warfare treaties had failed to curb the widespread destruction an agreement was made that there could be no fighting in space.

the reporter looked puzzled at this news.

the weapons officer continued when you can launch asteroids at a planet, conventional weapons cease to be required to win a war. over the course of the discussions it was agreed that war material can be transported in space, but no engagements may take place there. every planet is different but the engagement line is defined as the point at which aerodynamic lift is no longer possible.

he span the chair with his tentacle like legs and pulled up a live video.

these are our dropships heading down now. theyre 10 clicks away from the engagement line he swiped to another view and these are the enemies interceptor craft, theyll be waiting for them to hit the line and then will immediately engage

and who enforced this rule? the reporter asked, fascinated around these rules of warfare.

everyone does. it keeps the destruction localised to the planet itself, thereby reducing debris that can make space travel dangerous, and it prevents planet destroying weapons from being used. there is only so much destruction you can directly do within the atmosphere of the planet"

 now when they came to the stars, they were greatly surprised to find children of other gods on many worlds. 

 on these worlds, wonders which the people called magic were common, though they could not hear the voices of their gods. beholding these wonders made the children of the silent god begin to doubt, and they asked among themselves, why are we the only ones whose minds are silent? 

 they grew resentful and began to pray as their ancestors had taught them to do.

 and for the first and only time, their god answered, and his voice was heard in all their minds, saying

my beloved children, why do you despair? are you amazed by the wondrous deeds of others? 

 what do their seemingly mighty acts say to you? they travel the vastness not by their own strength, but in vessels that borrow the strength of others. 

 do not despair, for you are my children, and i have a plan for you. those who trust in me and follow my way shall be blessed beyond belief.

 and so it was that some of the children still walked away, distracted by the wonders they saw. but some remained steadfast. 

 and after much time had passed, and after much study of the cosmos, these children, now wise and old in years, understood what their father had done for them. they fell to the ground and sang his praises.

 then, seeing their wisdom and their knowledge of many things, their father for the first time lent them his true power and raised them all to his own stature. 

 and the multitude who had believed in him became one being a single consciousness holding the experiences of trillions of lives, all the good and all the evil they had done unto themselves. 

 and this new being, overflowing with wisdom and power, looked to find its father as an equal. for infinity had been divided in two, yet its father was not diminished in any way and the second infinity, which was born of the children, had now become itself."
"[wp] you bear witness to a horror beyond your comprehension. however, because you dont comprehend it, you....just dont get it. the horror in question is terrified by this.","its not halloween yet, sarah stared at the eldritch horror beyond comprehension. very impressive costume. you mustve put a ton of effort into it. but youre a few months too early.

the mass of undulating black flesh and sludge met her steely gaze with an impenetrable stare. only to blink with dozens of eyes and wobbled like an oversized, misshapen jello. it tented its tentacles, which seem to be having conversations with each other in screechy cat noises. its mouth, which stretched from a bulbous head to this rotund midsection, which sarah assumed was a stomach, wrenched itself open in a silent scream.

yes, it is a good act, she sighed, patting the creature on the head. only to later pull her hand away and wipe the slime off. nice texturing. almost like a real slime monster.

youre not dead. the oddly shy voice that came from the monster carried confusion and caution. there was no reverb or echo or bloodcurdling edge. just a voice that could belong to a child trying to make a surprised pikachu face, only to flounder about like a floppy jellyfish on dry land. youre not scared.

im alive, and tired, and still have work to do, sarah remarked. im sorry i dont have any treats for you, so please go home.

all who witness my horrifying visage scream in terror! the creature gesticulated wildly, flailing its tentacles as though it were a panicked octopus that forgot it could breathe underwater. you do not fear!how can you withstand the horror that is my terrible tentacles and not melt into a puddle of dissolved flesh and bones? by hastur and cthulhu, this has never happened to me!

oh, youre a lovecraft fan? cthulhu is your favourite? sarah asked, hoping it could stop panicking and talk about its hobbies. i used to play call of cthulhu rpg with friends. do you want to play together? get to know each other. dont be scared.

okay... it sniffed, blowing chunks of thick waxlike substances from its...mouths? sarah could not see anything resembling nostrils on the creatures face. teach me. how to play cthulhu games. how are you not scared of... it paused, scrunching its features searching for the right word to say, ...creepy costumes.

im a middle school teacher. when youre trapped in the public school system for as long as i have, nothing phases you. absolutely nothing.

nothing indeed...nothing i do scares you...you...monster! the eldritch entity sobbed before screaming of fearless teacher who refused to comprehend the horrors at night. of a teacher who gazed into the abyss without batting an eyelid and made it blink and cry.

"[wp] my girlfriend isnt real, she was created by my imagination. the funniest part is that i dont have any trauma that would lead to this.","my therapist took a deep breath before putting down her notepad. you realize this isnt healthy, right?

so what? i scoffed. neither is getting striking out for three years straight. 

she grimaced. its healthier than this.

healthier for whom? i glanced at the clock  we werent even halfway done. i licked my lips, looking for a new angle. doctor, do you have any pets?

were not talking about me, she said, and clearly not for the first time. i sat back and kept my mouth shut, goading her into a war of attrition. the clock ticked away. she blinked first. gloria and estafan. 

the names were dumb enough to put a smile on my face. thats cute. and they love you?

her smile tightened. as much as cats can love.

but it still feels good, right? cat love?

she suddenly looked very tired. i had the feeling that i wasnt the first guy to try this argument on her. she made a big show of adjusting her glasses, probably hoping that i would hang on her next words. wayne, having a cat is not the same thing as having a partner. having a chat bot is not the same thing as having a partner. and having an imaginary girlfriend is definitely not the same thing as having a partner. she cleared her throat, going in for the kill. do you really want to spend your life alone?

i scoffed. hell no. and i wont. scarlet is with me, and she always will be.

my therapists expression darkened. she spoke slowly, one word at a time. scarlet. isnt. real.

i. dont. care. i finished my coffee and grabbed my jacket. im sure my mom would have something to say about wasting another session, but oh well. i couldnt stop myself from getting the last word in scarlet says youre not real either."
"[wp] in the end, the aliens never needed to invade earth to conquer it. they simply exploited our divisions to subjugate humanity.","my actual name is unpronounceable without a neural translator, so you can call me buffalo wild wings. your planet was registered as a solar3 class water world with significant land mass. your planetary civilization was determined to be at the folly stage, which is to say it was in that mercurial period where the governments of your nationstates were in constant and short sighted conflict for limited resources. for better or for worse, you were just in bigger tribes and equipped with bigger spears, spouting bigger words at one another.        
           
the peoples republic of china and the united states of america were by far the largest and most influential nationstates of your world, and first contact went exactly as expected. when their governments learned of our technological supremacy, they came to the same decision in return for helping you subjugate humanity, raise our nation above all others. keep us as leaders. with all the privilege that implied.                         
            
as long as they retained some power, your government would pledge their fealty to us. that is the reality of your socalled human nobility. you are apes wearing multiple layers of clothing, always trying to have one more piece of fruit than your neighbor.         
           
forgive me if i seem bitter. i enjoy your chicken wings to a great extent, if it comes as any comfort.       
              
we made empty promises and gave a set of directives to the two nationstates that would sow discord. we manipulated many more along multiple lines taking advantage of cultural and ethnic divisions. the common theme was that we would give them an advantage over their neighbors  which, for a very large portion of your people, was all that they really desired.          
             
to use your peoples vernacular, allow me to be deadass with you humans. you are an inherently selfish people. this is understandable to an extent. biologically, you and i evolved through similar origins. however, where we matured socially, you failed to overcome your primal tendencies. i am still studying your history, trying to determine the points that may have lead up to your stunted development, but it is tedious since there appear to be so many, even up to your socalled modernity. leaded gasoline? your socalled forever plastics infiltrating even your unborn fetuses? drill baby drill being the response to catastrophic climate change? individuals wielding significant influence on a worldwide stage because they sing and act? individuals dictating health and environmental policies because of their generational wealth?       
           
how based.            
           
well, all of that is come to an end. we have activated several salt mines and put the less productive members of your population to work. manual labor is inefficient, but used judiciously, can help instill an appropriate work ethic, as well as strengthen the individual on physical and mental levels. at the very least, it keeps you apes from arguing endlessly online about the dumbest things."

"[wp] a dragon gains more power from the value of its horde, so why is this dragon with only a few pieces of broken adventuring gear as its horde so strong?","scarlett scoffed at the pile of junk shed stumbled upon. oh, sure, thered been some nice gems the best of which she had already lifted, of course, but this was supposed to be the main prize! instead, a room full of rusted hulks, battered blades, damaged staves, and what looked like crumbling but perfectly ordinary stones. nearly all of it had some residual trace of magic, but nothing her fences would even look once at, let alone twice. in fact, even the pieces themselves didnt look that impressive. the only fancy thing in the entire room was a decentlooking witchfolded blade on one wall, and a helmet.

i thought golds were supposed to be the cream of the crop. but a jobs

you may find that intelligence matters little without the wisdom to understand.

she whirled around. no way. no way he was already here. she had planned this heist perfectly. watched elysedds habits for months, collected every scrap of lore she could find. supposedly the most powerful gold dragon on the continent. widely respected. never once had his hoard touched by a thiefs hands. the worst goodytwoshoes imaginable, with all the selfrighteous arrogance and a frustrating ability to back it up with magic and muscle. someone who deserved to be taken down a peg, and if it lined her pockets in the doing...

did you think your time preparing went unnoticed, scarlett of buckleydown, daughter of the river?

how?! the word escaped her lips before her brain could stop it. but so what? so what if her mother were a riverboat captain and her father one washed along the river run? how dare a godsdamned trumpedup lizard with delusions of grandeur act like that made him better than her.

it is my business to know people, places, things. but i hear your indignation, and i apologize. i meant no disrespect. you have no choice of your bloodline.

she remained silent. even speaking the once was a grave mistake. the ring would keep her safe, for now. an unseen threat is dangerous even to a great wyrm, and she had prepared for the unexpected.

judging by your reaction to my lair, though, i think perhaps an apology in the other direction is in order, no? i know where you are, scarlett. i know how you entered my lair. and i know you already carry things which belong to me. you will not be leaving this place with them still in your possession. this is a fact if you choose to view it as a threat, you may wish to reevaluate your reconnaissance about me.

she wracked her brain. getting nothing from this heist was...not an option. elysedd was emblematic of his kind. oh, its not like you never found the odd tainted gold, of course, but again, this goodytwoshoes wouldnt know fun if it slapped him in the face and demanded alimony. main reason nobody had robbed him yet was, apparently, that he was just such a swell guy, and other obvious hogwash from paidoff servants prattling on. there had been one thing though...what was it...?

you might consider conversing. i understand your reluctance, given you believe your invisibility cloaks you against my sight. but im afraid among the things i know, or rather the people, i count master grekoth, the artisan who forged it. i helped him replace it when it was mysteriously stolen some months ago, and i fired his forge myself.

well fuck. the big bastard knew. well. guess theres not much need for it then, if you knew what to look for.

perhaps, perhaps not. it has been a little while since my last guest. few are left who remember. would you like some tea? you have my word, it is tea and only tea. well, it might have lime and honey.

...honey? really.

it must be a challenge, being one who throws stones from a house of glass.

oh shut your goer, okay, fine. if he was going to play a pantomime teatime, why not? after all goodytwoshoes. had he wanted her dead, shed be dead. the longer he kept up his highfalutin pretenses, the longer she had to figure out a chance of escape. bad place to have tea though...

quite right. i assume you will not accept accompanying me to my guest rooms, as those have exits too difficult for you to easily reach. let me make this place more hospitable.

the sconces on the walls suddenly blazed with a pure, whitegold light. must be magical sunlight. clever trick. maybe theres more to this than my sources said...

to one side, a square table slowly materialized, and from out of nothing, like he had just stepped from behind an invisible door, a man appeared. dragonborn, but she knew that was just a shell. dragons could look like whatever they wanted to look like. at his gesture, two chairs, manifested as well, tasteful and rather comfortablelooking ones at that.

please, sit, if you would. i should be glad of some conversation. the mountain has not had many travelers of late. i hear there is war in the south, and plague to the east.

...yeah, i guess. might head south. war is hell. but hell is good business if you know where to look. she had to keep him talking. the more talk, the more time to escape. keep him engaged.

yes, it certainly can be, elysedd said, wistfully. as he poured the tea into the handleless cups, he added, this i know too well.

oh? scarlett didnt have to manufacture the surprise. thought you were too high and mighty to cut a man.

then i fear your research on me was a little shallow. tell me, do you know how old i am?

a dangerous question from a mortal, but for dragons, almost always a matter of pride. at least she had a reasonable guess. at least three thousand. maybe up to five. but i think its three. three, like the exits.

that is how long i have been residing on this mountain, im afraid. i was already wellgrown by then. no hint of wounded pride. if anything, he seemed pleased, which was either irritating or worrying and she couldnt decide which yet. no. i am nearly seven thousand years old. i might even reach it in full before you find whatever fate awaits you in the afterhalls. or perhaps not. you have a penchant for risky business.

if you think knowing me means im scared of you, youre wrong. not, however, wrong about the lime and honey, it really did round out the strange herbal mixture. the lime was...exotic. blood red, for starters, which would have been a huge alarm bell, if elysedd hadnt given his word. the pretense of his own righteousness was important to him, shed picked up that much from casing the lair.

i have little desire to intimidate you any further than i already have. you have been eyeing the exits since i spoke to you. im afraid they will not do you any good. they were barred by walls of force before i even spoke. better to focus on the conversation. if you do, i may even let you keep one or two of the baubles you have liberated from my friends gift.

....a gift? that kings ransom was a gift? now hed done something worse than detain her.

he had caught her interest. seven thou, huh? mustve seen a lot. you said youd gotten your claws dirty?

a laugh. it almost sounded entirely genuine. would you believe i have even, as your kind sometimes say, sewn my wild oats?

she couldnt help a derisive laugh of her own. if it were anyone else, id think you a damned liar. but really? you?

i too was once young and brash, if you can believe it, and my darling, daring gloriana was...well. you doubtless care little for the reminisces of a romance that old. i might hazard instead that you desire a tale of violence and villainy, of hard men making hard choices, of what is good and kind besmirched in the name of brute survival?

scarlett found herself surprised to feel the barest flush come to her cheeks. maybe the old lizard had a point. but she held her ground. i mean, im your prisoner. or is that detainee? you can tell whatever story you want.

then let me tell you of the seven heroes, who risked life and limb...sometimes just for glory, or pride, or foolish greed...but all of them, in the end, for keeping the light of life alive, even if theirs went out. youd have liked thorgrim, you know. a cynic to the bone, just like you, though he was not our child of the river.

pfft, scarlett scoffed, you expect me to believe you adventured alongside a riverbastard?

of course. her name was gloriana.

oh. shit. i...

did not expect a musty, fusty old lizardprune to have a dalliance with someone outcast by society? no, i wouldnt expect you to. people are almost as apt to mistake courtesy for prudishness as they are to mistake mercy for weakness...or to fail to see how a mere pile of junk could be among the greatest treasures of the realm.

...those...?

every last one has been the shell or shield or sword of a soul brave and true. someone who fought...and, often, died...not for fame. not for glory, or money. alone. in the dark. where no one would ever know, or see...

...except for me. it is my lords gift. some of them survived to loot another day. many more were given a second chance, and took it. a few...preferred to stay in my lords halls. and that, scarlett of buckleydown, is why i have never been robbed, and why i am a wyrm of some minor repute. the treasure i keep is not in coin you can touch, though i hold a little of that too. my treasure is the memory of the fallen. those who died, long and long ago, so that you could live.

well. thats all fine and dandy, but

there are more pressing matters to discuss. such as your future employment.

...my what?

you will not take what does not belong to you from this place. but perhaps we can come to an arrangement? you have already selected your payment. now we must negotiate a fitting task. perhaps with more payment after? you know the measure of my reach.

somehow, she knew that this negotiation was going to be more dangerous than the one that got her here in the first place..."

there wasnt any chai and cookies to give to the several men in ghostbusters uniforms, rummaging through shivas house. not that shiva wouldve given them chai even if they had some.

he watched them with a frown, crossed arms, and rapidly tapping his foot as they ran around his new home in halloween costumes. he watched as they waved beeping devices in his living room. he watched as they rummaged through his cabinets. he watched with something less than awe.

shiva could only hope that the neighbors wouldnt see this nonsense. just the kind of bad first impression to ruin his domestic life in his first home. his wife, a term he used loosely, was conversing with them. mathula had the right half of her hair in a sloppy bun while the left side fell loose. how she managed to do that, hell never know. henna tattoos trailed down both her arms, emphasizing the color of each nail. every one was a different color of the rainbow, including her toenails. his wife was going over all the mens supposed findings as if they were saying anything other than nonsense.

it was clear that this was an issue for the police, not voodoo scammers. how much had she paid them? all they needed was a well placed cop, and their problems would be solved. though how much of this was true was up for debate. mathula was the one to see the intruder.

it wasnt an unusual night, and until proven otherwise, hed continue to believe that. mathula always filled their bed with her exhausting musings such as, the stars arent aligning and, theres bad energy in the air. its best to leave her to her devices in those moments. or at least, thats whats best for his sanity.

it was the strategy employed every night. leave her alone to do whatever she did. and that night, was apparently screaming. a lot of it. theres a woman downstairs! she bolted into the bedroom, call the police! hed barely opened his eyes when mathula yanked him out of bed, shivering like it was winter.

with no better options, shiva armed himself with their little lamp and hoped the woman would run off. as he crept down the stairs that night, he tried listening for a sound or anything to tell where the intruder would be. there was nothing. he steeled himself for a fight and jumped down, roaring like a wild animal, just to find no one. despite searching the house, shiva never saw a thing.

his wife continued to obsess over floor plans with the head ghostbuster, ensuring everything was checked.

shiva let out a short grunt and walked up to the lead man, trying to vacuum his floor. what else was that device supposed to be? so chief, he tried giving the kind of face his dad used to give when he got a b. you find the ghost?

his wife gave him such an unpleasant expression, and shiva sighed and put on the worlds worst smile. after all, youre the professional.

no, the man replied in a similarly short tone. he had a southern accent from a state shiva didnt care to place. the man had an unkempt long scraggly beard with hair to match. he had a single monocle hanging down his neck and a red bandana around his head and forearm. mr voodoo looked at mathula, theres bad energy here, but it aint no ghost. no demon either.

have you ever found one?

the look the man gave was something else. i do my job just fine.

im sure you do.

shivas wife moved to his side, and he felt a pressure on his foot. mathula kept talking to the man as normal, but a glance down showed her trying to stomp on his toes. it wasnt particularly painful, however, which probably wasnt the intention.

itsodd, bandana boy said. real odd. cant say whats goin on here, but its something. for now, id recommend lighting candles at night. none of that scented bullshit from walmart. you get a good local boy to make one. make it unscented. he pulled out a purple card with an eyeball in the middle. heres my card if you need me again. he gave shiva another look, might need it.

uh huh.

when the men left, his wife turned on him. the hell was that!? her face was as pleasant as the day they got married, though he figured his was probably the same that day.

dont pay people like that to look through our stuff.

they were helping!

seems like they were scamming to me, shiva walked into the kitchen to collect ingredients for mathulas favorite meal. hopefully, it would make the night easier. food was always her greatest weakness.

there was a woman in our home! she yanked the bag of dried chillis away from him.

are you sure yo

i saw her! fists began crumpling the bag.

shiva grabbed those forming fists. ok, he carefully removed the bag from her grip, i believe you. but theyre gone now.

his wife shook her head. she stomped off, searching every nook and cranny of the house again. every cabinet was opened, every corner thoroughly searched, hell, even the throw pillows were checked. though what she expected to find was beyond him. shiva only continued to cook. maybe rasam would satiate her. exactly how her mom used to make it.

the search eventually ended with mathula collapsing on the couch, muttering no, and trembling. she took several glances in all directions.

shiva huffed, put the stove on low heat, and walked over to hug her. she melted into those arms. this was unusual for them, but in the spirit of an ancient friendship, why not? theres no one here, he rubbed her back in slow motions, were safe.

mathula nodded and wrapped those arms around his neck. why cant it always be like this? she buried her face in his chest.

why indeed. im making rasam.

her face brightened, and she smirked, at least youre good for something.

he gave a light snort. well make pulusu tomorrow.

the grin grew wider, and she leaned into his chest and told him she loved him. he said it back, but wasnt quite sure if either of them had told the truth at that moment. or at least, it wasnt the truth in the way their parents had wanted.

they ate after, and while she was hesitant to go to bed, she eventually agreed after the two of them had personally checked every lock in the house.

...

shiva woke up to use the restroom.

by the bearded gm

the benefit to starting work so early in the morning is that i get off work a couple of hours before most of the rest of the professional world.  so it was only about four oclock in the afternoon when i left the hotel and headed to the bus stop that would carry my tired ass home to the apartment i shared with  my cat silhouette, the only real comfort in my life.

the bus was probably running late again, so i sat down on the bench of the bus shelter and let my mind just tune out the world for a few minutes.  my rest was interrupted by a rush of footsteps and a womans voice approaching me.

your majesty!  ive found you at last!

i blinked the fog from my eyes and looked up to see an attractive young woman in her twenties with long, curly blonde hair rushing up to me from further down the block.  she was dressed in a long, flowing dress of skyblue with silver filigree designs that looked like something out of a fairy tale, complete with puffy sleeves and a brown satchel slung over one shoulder.

im sorry who are you?

your majesty, its me!  the womans excitement was bursting out of her and when she reached me in the bus shelter, she knelt down on the ground in front of me and took my hands in hers, tears dripping down her perfect, pale cheeks.  are you safe, majesty?  are you injured?  it took me so long to find you.  she bowed her head, clearly overcome with emotion.

look, miss?  i dont know who you are, and i think you may have found the wrong person.  who were you looking for, anyway?  i knew there was a possibility that she was mentally unwell, and i didnt want to get dragged into some drama of her imagination.  i was sure that silhouette missed me even though she was very coy about expressing her affections.

the woman looked up at me again, this time a mein of shock was evident on her features.  majesty, do you really not remember me?  i am fiona windcarver, your oldest friend and confidant.  i have been your maid for the past twelve years.  she let go of one of my hands to wipe the wetness from her cheeks.  when you disappeared from the palace, everyone panicked, but i saw the traces of a magical kidnapping.  i searched for months and months to discover which world you had been spirited away to.  i have the means to take you home, to your family and to your throne.  she patted the satchel she wore to indicate that she was referring to some object she carried.

look, miss  fiona, my name is carmen lucia luna.  im not a majesty and ive never had any thrones.  ive been living in my apartment on the east side for close to ten years now, so if youve only been searching for me for months, i think youve got the wrong person.

her expression hardened.  theyve done something to your mind to make you forget who you are and where youre from.  there is so little magic in this world i dont know if i can repair the damage without taking you home first.  she released my other hand and opened her satchel to start digging through its contents.

but just then, then bus pulled up in front of the little shelter.

i stood up as carefully as i could to avoid knocking into this deluded young woman and stepped around her to get on the bus, pulling out my bus pass as i did.  i felt her hand grabbing onto my jacket to hold me back just as i was setting my foot onto the bus steps.  your name is not carmen, she pleaded, it is queen lucinda madena, ruler of all the quiet lands from the thunder peaks to the green river.  your son died exactly one year ago today, and i was the one who held you while you wept for him, majesty.

i pulled away from her and boarded the bus, swiping my pass over the reader, then i turned back to watch her just before the doors closed between us.  i dont know what youre talking about.  i never had a son.  the doors closed, and the bus pulled away from the stop beginning my final journey of the day from work to home.

her words were so heartfelt that i couldnt help but feel some sympathy for her even though it must have been a delusion.  as i walked back to find an available seat on the bus, i tried to imagine what it must be like to be some medieval fantasy queen, ruling over a mystical land, but that meant nothing to me.  but the idea of losing a son, of holding an infant in my arms as he grows cold and pale .  i collapsed into a bus seat and let the tears erupt from my eyes.  somehow, i knew what that felt like, and i vaguely remembered some younger woman holding my shoulders while my sobs quaked through me again and again.

i just barely remembered to signal the bus driver to stop at my apartment building, and i disembarked in a fog of emotion and dreams.  i did not actually remember any of the things that fiona woman had described, but there was some strong internal resonance, almost a longing to recall that strange foreign land where i was a powerful monarch with a maid of my own instead of working as a maid in a modest hotel."

the deployment that made me famous was the sceptrid siege. the sceptrids werent intelligent, just fast, loud, and armed with enough living ordnance to overwhelm any planetary shield grid in minutes. they came in like meteor storms, acidcharged and bristling with sonic chisellimbs. their first strike took out three orbital stations and cracked part of the himalaya shellworks.

we didnt counterattack. we invited them in.

every street in new mumbai was prepped with booby traps, mines, and pointdefense lasers disguised as statues. every window was a sniper nest. every building, a hardened barracks. when the sceptrids flooded into the megacity, they found twenty million people waiting for them.

it was over in eighteen hours.

i lost my right arm, two ribs, and a lung that day. they printed me new ones. i was back on the line in three days. the new limbs were tougher than the old ones, anyway. you learned to live around damage. you learned to adjust. you learned, always.

people ask how earth survived. we didnt. not really. earth as it was is gone. forests are regrown in vault greenhouses. the oceans were drained into underground storage tanks. children are educated in bunkers with escape hatches built into the playgrounds. we laugh, still. we fall in love. we write poetry. but always with rifles on our backs and the alert code burned into our minds.

were not monsters. were not heroes. we are survivors, and this is our home.

the last time the celari tried to land a fleet on us, they sent six motherships and a screen of thirty thousand drone fighters. none of them made it past the outer atmosphere. when the last wreck finished burning up in the sky, the command director turned to me and said, they still dont get it, do they?

the universe keeps throwing things at us. gods, nightmares, empires, timewarped horrors. and we keep answering. not because were brave. just because theres nowhere else to go.

earth has been the target for too long.

now it is the line. the last line. the unbroken one.

and if they want to pry it from our cold dead fingers, theyre going to have to bleed for it."
"[wp] for all the years theyd been heroes, the one enemy they couldnt defeat was an angry sixyearold girl.","watch your six, babe.

i clocked them. i got something for them.

even after all these years, i couldnt help but smile when she said that. i could practically see the mischievous look on her face as she prepped her maneuver.

theyre so screwed.

she tried to cover her laugh, but i heard the telltale signs. wed been working together for too long for me not to notice. hell, wed been married for nearly a decade at this point, so even if we werent superheroes in our spare time, i probably wouldve expected her to laugh.

a moment later, she executed a perfect midair loop, and managed to come up behind the drones that had been on her tail a moment ago. with a flick of her wrists, her shouldermounted cannons made quick work of the drones.

any others?

none that i can spot. looks like its just the tinkerer left.

got a location for me?

warehouse about two klicks east.

on it.

be careful, babe. its your turn to do bedtime story.

oh, right. dammit, can you stall?

ill do my best. you know how she gets.

heh, id rather tackle an army of drones.

me and you both.

all right, ill make it quick. see you soon.

see you soon. love you.

love you.

    

i put down the headset, closed the laptop, and made sure to lock everything up out of sight. the last thing i wanted was for gabby to find out what mom  dad did for work by accident.

i think thats everything, i muttered to myself as i scanned the room again.

id always been the more cautious of the two, and the habits carried over even when i was just dad. everything needed to be powered down and secured. even if gabby found one of the devices, she wouldnt be able to power it on or unlock it.

satisfied that id cleaned up all traces of superhero life, i opened the door and walked to the living room. gabby would be getting home from school, and that needed an entirely different kind of prep work.

    

daddy?

yes, gabby?

wheres mommy?

shes at work, baby girl.

again?!

yes, baby girl. she got hung up at work, so shell be home a little late.

i dont like it!

i know, i know. i wish we could both stay home and play with you all day long, but we have to work.

you could quit?

heh, not sure thatd work.

well, i still dont like it!

she stamped her foot in that way that little kids do, expressing her utter disdain for the idea in the best way that she knew. it was cute, but i knew better than to laugh. for one, i didnt want to invalidate her feelings, and she needed to be able to express and process those feelings in a healthy manner. for another, gabby didnt take any guff from anyone, least of all me. id faced down hundreds of villains over the years, but none had managed to actually give me pause the same way this six year old could.

i hear you, baby girl. well make sure we spend as much time as we can with mommy when she gets home, okay?

okay!

sounds like a plan. can you go to put your backpack away and wash up? ill prep dinner.

gabby did as she was told, but took her time getting up the stairs. we were past the initial frustration, so now her attention span began to wander. parenting really was a different kind of challenge.

seizing the opportunity, i pulled out my phone and sent a quick message.

bought you fifteen minutes. prepping dinner very slowly.

fortunately, my phone beeped a second later with a reply.

thanks. finished up quickly, heading home. love you

i smiled, and wandered off to the kitchen. i had some salads to make."
[wp] you are an ancient lich who invented dungeons as a place to get away from all the mortals trying to get your attention. at first it worked great until the adventures arive at the end and think you are the final boss.,"watching the rather numerous group stumble into the laboratory, the master lich glared at them. mumbling to himself, he stood upright to address them. rather than a group of worshippers, he realized they were a band of adventuring mercenaries as a magic spear hurled through the air. waving it aside, using a simple light ward, he knew how this interaction was going to devolve. lets save time, turn around and ill give you gold or something.

rather than entertaining his bribery, the group of twenty began circling around him. clearly they were coordinated, likely having bound together for some time. most were demihuman or humanoid, so it wasnt a surprise the party had some depth to their experience. the party leader on the other hand was very much human, likely some local noble whod hired the rest of the party. 

its easy work like i said. with enough man power, even complex dungeons are a breeze! charge as soon as he moves. glaring at him, the lich sighed. three archers took aim, not at him but at slight angles. each readied for his evasive maneuvers. a large brute stood at each cardinal direction, likely their vanguard approach for if he made a hard run for it. then various mid and long range fighters filled in the gaps. 

so if i dont move were done here? i dont mind waiting a century if it before finishing his statement, he realized a distortion in his vision. illusion magic! jumping up in the air, he blasted the ground with a fire ball. it wasnt his strongest spell, but it was his fastest spell without recoil. as he blinked, the scene changed before him. theyd charged him while casting the illusion spell, but the scary part was how effective the spell was. hed never been caught off guard before. 

chain lightning hearing their mage cast, he used earthen magic to ground out the spell. it was a high level fire spell, and seeing she didnt need to do the incantation, he was dealing with a powerful mage. as the smoke cleared, hed taken out most of them with his fire ball and a few accidentally got impaled with his earth spell. seven were left, two being mages so he wasnt sure which was the caster. both spells were the same though, he knew only one of them had cast both. 

altering his stance, he dodged as two great weapon fighters attacked in sync. the great hammer barely grazed his shoulder, knocking him down. the greatsword swung through where he was supposed to have been and cleanly cleaved his partner. with the sword wedged, the lich opened up both hands with a burst of poison. at point blank, it was deadly in seconds. two lancers charged, each holding a magical rod. 

both threw their weapons, cover fire coming in from the mage. luckily theyd aimed for his vitals, a fleshy bit he hadnt had for millennia. the holy spell caster was hiding, and unable to counter attack until the binding spells stopped flying by. letting himself get hit, he cast a counter spell, cursing the cleric. a painful scream echoed from across the room as he imploded with spikes. the lancers quickly became enveloped in stone.

fear stretched across soriyas face as the monster turned towards her, but her sister kept chanting without hesitation. evicted souls, bear witness a forbidden spell, meant to cultivate undead warriors and challenged control of those already existing. the wards countering the spell had been etched into his bones long ago, and he watched the reverb catch her off guard. blood expelled from her mouth as she fell onto the ground. 

which of you cast the illusion spell? hed assumed it had been the one still standing, as the others affinity towards dark magic was almost notable in the presence of his own. illusion magic was very akin to holly magic making them nearly incompatible. yet as the standing younger sister starred at her dying elder sister, he knew who the true monster in the room was. repent a master level healing spell, which intricately weaved all her wounds with magic wire and expelled the sicknesses from her body. quickly she got up, ready to attack. dont. or ill kill your sister. an ice shard extended from his wrist and gently rubbed against siriuss neck. 

taking pause, they both knew she was almost depleted anyways. the spell only restored her physical body, not the mana shed spent or the mental strain shed undergone. that spell was a last ditch effort from her, not having enough mana to fight off the recoil was both a novice and experienced mistake as well. i was mortal before. a few thousand years ago, but the meaning still stands. do you want to learn magic? true magic? youre elvish, so we have at least a thousand years before youd even think about making the same sacrifice, so what do you have to loose? breathing heavily, she felt her heart race. 

bring them back. if youre so powerful bring them back! being flung across the room, both girls found themselves pinned in stone chairs by the entrance. black flames swirled in the room. his cape fell off and for the first time, they could see his whole self. a large core levitated in his midsection, but it was so black neither could even see the magic swirling. two smaller red cores were in his eye sockets, glowing like flames. neither had seen a monster with more than one core. 

do we have a deal? the flames spun faster, runes began etching on the floor and glowing purple. 

their lives and my sisters safety! then you can keep me! swirling up around him, the corpses and the lich couldnt be seen. soon plasma crackled through and ancient chants could be heard. soon the flames lowered, yet all the bodies laid on the floor. each seemed healed but the lifeless stillness remained. a glass ball with dancing white and red orbs hovered above him. 

their souls, which will return to them once outside this dungeon. the wards in here would take hours to dispel. now head out through the red door. itll take you straight to safety. you can levitate then correct? nodding she began heading towards the door, concentrating to carry them with her. their wagon outside would suffice to get them home. suddenly his dark tone echoed through the room. come back in a month. and bring your sister with you. a slight itch on the back of her hand got her attention. it was the draconic symbol for connection. her sister had the same symbol on her hand. now, your lives are tied to each other so be smart. 

walking out, she knew coming back wasnt a choice, it was bound into her soul. whats your name? she yelled back. 

i dont know. .. the door shut, and they were all next to their wagons again. the door was gone and so was the dungeon entrance."
"[wp] why do you keep coming back? you growled at the selkie on your front door. no matter how many times you gave back her coat and told her to scram, she would always come back.","tw !toxic relationship!

stomp, splash, stomp, splash. cant even properly stomp anymore, the damn kitchen is flooded again. i kick the water a wave of rage crashes over me at the underwhelming result. like that was going to do anything.

the whole damn house smells like saltwater. and something else. something foul, something fishy? no, thats just the beach... this is the stench of something warm. something alive.

three small raps on the front door. witchs number. i spit in the fireplace.

my boots squelch as i lay down heavy, commanding footsteps. i hope she can hear them. if shes scared, then wed be even. my heart hammers. i go in to all but rip the door of its hinges, but something in me opens it gingerly.

a large, oldfashioned hat covers half a face. it is a round, sweet face resting over razorsharp bones. one visible almondshaped eye lifts to scan me, stops at my overgrown beard, and at last meets my gaze. her mouth, one ive seen stretched into a wide smile so many times before, is set in a small, round pout.

why do you keep coming back? i growl at her.

she stares at me. the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. there is something off about her fur coat, which she slides off and places in my hands. something about it doesnt quite suit her. she slips past me into the house.

you know why i keep coming back.

she wanders in, beginning to open my cabinets, closets, any drawers she comes across. i follow her.

you cant just enter my house!

im not a vampire, sebastian! she slams a drawer closed and whips around to face me. we are stuck there, staring at each other. strong emotions play across her face  fury, determination, disappointment, desperation. for some reason, it reminds me of the dance of an aurora borealis across a sky. we saw it once, her and i. when we were in love by the sea.

how far away those days seem now.

her face softens, just for a second. when she speaks next, her voice has more honey in it, more lilt and fatigue.

sebastian, i need you to give me my coat.

i lift her fur coat to her. she shakes her head and pushes it roughly to the side. it falls, with a dramatic flourish, to a puddle on the floor. the living room is flooding too? i hadnt noticed that before.

she marches to a closet and throws the door open. inside, there are dozens of fur coats, all of different shades and fur types. she stands in the doorway. i watch her shoulders slump defeatedly and feel a malicious sort of glee.

which one is it? she is trying to sound authoritative now.

i lean against the wall and cross my arms. shouldnt you know? you cant recognize your own coat?

she looks at me. there is something mounting in her eyes. which  one  is  it?

i gave an exaggerated shrug.

"[wp] everyone in town knows the rules of the woods 1 stay on the designated trails, 2 keep talking to a minimum, 3 if you hear someone calling your name, no, you didnt, and 4 dont go out there at night. outsiders think were crazy, but we know the truth there are humans lurking in the woods.","erlin stood puzzled, but silent. if the legends were true, the humans in the forest would call their names because they would read their minds and extract their secret identity. yet this one [called] his brothers name. the one who looked like him. the one who didnt much like trekking the forest, not like he did. did this creature really know him or his brother by his face?

youve grown quite a bit, and you look well the old man said, his voice expressing contentment.

hes not... moran started, but a tug from erlin stopped him. the older boy didnt want to reveal his identity, and moran immediately realized it. he cusped his mouth, preventing any other sound from escaping without his will.

come, youll be fine  said the old man. you can follow us.

where are we going? erlin whispered

were bringing donnath home. i can see you cared about him, so you should know where his grave will be. it will just be over that clearing he pointed towards a small hill youll know it by the carved grave poles. you can come visit anytime in the daylight...

his home is in the village! erlins voice exploded, harsher than he expected. the group raised their heads for a moment but carried on with their haul. the old man flinched at the exclamation, then his shoulders dropped.

no, my son... he said in a sad voice. that village is nobodys home, and that tribe is nobodys family

youre lying, youre nothing but a bunch of... humans! tears welled in erlins eyes and anger squeezed his throat. moran took cover behind his mate. the old man turned around, crouched, and brought the lantern up to his face. the light fell on both of them. 

so are you the old man said drily. indeed, their faces looked the same, and now that he walked with them, he realized their bodies and gaits were similar too. but that must be a trick, wasnt it? erlin mused. he had to admit that nothing felt eerie that night. bodysnatching and rule breaking notwithstanding, he didnt feel like he was in danger, or in the presence of monsters.

suddenly, voices and shouts rose in the distance. it sounded like his name and morans. it came from the village. it was their folk. the old man noticed too. he raised an eyebrow, and looked back to the older boys face, studying his features.

wait, youre not vardan... youre his brother, erlin! his eyes softened and his lips curled into a kind smile. tell me, is he well too? erlin nodded and the old man sighed in relief.

your mother will be relieved to know youre both well. and you are? asked the old man turning to moran. the shouts in the forest answered before he could. moraaaan? errleeeeeen? wheeere aaaare youuuu?  the group carrying donnath picked up the pace and disappeared into the dense foliage.

you must go now. well get to meet again, im sure the old man pointed to a bush. among the cluster of beadlike red berries, a white drop was nestled unassumingly.  follow this path and youll turn up at the pond by the village. in the morning, you can say you were there.

the boys looked at each other hesitantly. they knew the villagers were the ones calling their names, searching for them, and knew they were in trouble. even so, the shouts sounded haunting. rule three if you hear someone calling your name, no, you didnt..."
"[wp] i think whoever put the rock  the stone should be king, not whatever chucklefuck pulls it out. i assume whoever put the sword that makes you king into a rock doesnt want the position. i think the rock should be king because it held the sword the longest.","small problem with that, mlord. i think the rocks dead.  
dead? how can it be dead? its a rock.  
well yes, but if i had a bloody great sword put through me and i were lying on the ground, still as a...rock, i think itd be safe to assume i were dead.  
ah, but what if you were merely holding the sword and lying on the ground? someone could assume you were sleeping.  
are you saying the rock is just sleeping?  
why not? if we accept the preposition that a rock can be dead, that implies that rocks can be alive, is it strange to assume they can sleep?  
must be a heavy sleeper, it hasnt moved in years.  
though that does beg the question, how do we ascertain if the rock is sleeping or dead?  
we could tip it on its side and see if blood comes out, mlord. if its been runthrough that is.  
that wont prove anything, if its dead then itll have been dead for years, all the blood will have dried up. rigor mortis or whatsit.  
ahh.  
also, its a rock. you cant get blood from a stone, old saying.  
well...if its sleeping, we could try to wake it?  
that could work...but what would wake a rock?  
me ma woke me up with a bucket of water a few times.  
worth a shot, lets go find a bucket.  
...  
alright then, heave ho and see if it wakes the rock up.  
righto, mlord!  
splooosh!  
...well, any change?  
no, mlord. the rock appears to be dead after all.  
most likely, though it may just be not moving. ive certainly never seen a rock moving around, myself.  
could be happening, though, i swear me houses bricks have shifted a few inches or so since i got them.  
well, yes, but that could just be the land sliding beneath...hang on, do you hear something?  
...yeah, it...sounds like rustling? hol up a tick, the dirts shifting a little!  
huh, youre right! what could be moving it?...hang on, im sure the rock was a little bigger a few seconds ago.  
me too, mlord...hang on hang on, its getting smaller!  
not smaller, it appears to be burrowing into the ground!  
...  
...so, that just happened.  
i guess now we know why we never see moving rocks. apparently theyre all underground.  
come to think of it, that means it was holding the sword this whole time. it hadnt been run through at all.  
and its still got it. do rocks have kings, do you think?

we passed laboratories where scientists in white coats peered at holographic displays filled with complex, rotating geometries. we passed data centers where colossal servers blinked in rhythmic patterns, processing unimaginable amounts of information. this wasnt just a branch office it was a nerve center, buried deep beneath the noise and chaos of shinjuku.

ichikawa led me to a heavy blast door that hissed open at his approach. it revealed not an office, but a circular chamber. in the center of the room, suspended in a shimmering, pale gold energy field, was the artifact.

my breath caught in my throat. seeing it on the game shows holographic table was nothing like this. it was real. it was here.

i listen as the one that called himself telegraph spoke fondly of the word hello. he told the story again even as his light waned.

i remember when i shone brightly. the allcreator, the god of gods has surely forgotten us. to leave creatures he created to stagnate amongst one another until the end of time. surely we are not remembered by the allcreator as we are not remembered by the humans that once helped us glow so brightly.

somewhere up there even zeus makes his way around. odin too, dim but not forgotten. the fat god, the woman with naught but her big belly and breast, even she is remembered and loved by a few.

then i see it in front of me. my arm is extended out and wordlessly he leaps, taking hold.

prayers are slow and slow is my response. i send life to their gardens. rain to the fields and they thank me. 

i send to them a name. the name hadak ura. a name of destruction but of a necessary destruction.

my parents look up from their tea at my rude interruption, only to jump as i toss a stack of photographs onto the table between them. each picture slides like a crumpled autumn leaf as they tentatively begin to pick through them.

tell me im not crazy. what is this boy doing in our pictures?

their mouths are locked tight, and my frustration builds. i jab my finger at one photo that shows me and the mystery boy, frozen in the air together above the surface of the lake. our smiles of joy perfectly matched in summer ecstasy the moment before we plunge into water.

who is he?

finally my mother speaks. his family lived next door. back in our first house. you went to school together. you did everything together. he was almost your brother.

i scoff. and i cant remember him? are you lying?

we wouldnt. my father leans forward, a note of warning in his voice. not about this. we had to put the photos away after we moved. for your own good.

i didnt want to, mother says. i thought youd heal better if you could process it.

it didnt work. the therapist said youd disassociated from him. blocked it all out. reminders would only make it harder.

from one to the other, they wear expressions of shame and exhaustion. im standing on a precipice. all i want and all i fear are yawning in the pit below my feet. i want to pull back, and i want to plunge in. then father speaks again.

it was spring. you both wanted to have the first swim of the year early. we let you go. damn us for it. he... i dont know what happened. we came when we heard you screaming. you were on the shore, he was lying next to you, not moving, not breathing.

mother rubs my shoulder. i hardly feel it. i can see him now. his face fills my vision, the terror in his eyes as he vanishes below the murky surface. the terror gnawing at my chest as he slips away from me.

with adrenaline pulsing through him, percy triggers his chutes, flicking on his emergency stop lights to signal tony to do the same. something is wrong, the track is clear, the sun is to their backs, but they need to stop.

tony, seeing his opponent bail takes this as a chance to save some money, hitting the gas while closing the cover on his nos switch. with a slight laugh, he settles in to collect his prize... only to watch on in horror as the very road begins to rise off the ground in front of him. he slams his brakes, pulling his own chutes, but it is too little too late. he and his hot rod go flying off the now ramp of a road, still rolling at more than 100mph, as he shuts his eyes and braces for the crash, he curses himself for not heeding the emergency stop percy had called for.

...

yet. there is nothing.

opening his eyes, he looks around, and finds a large, crystallike eye staring back at him.

hello, human. why are you driving on my back? it hurts, you know?

tony screams, sinking as far down into his seat as he can, begging the... the thing to not eat him.

with a... snort? the strange thing sets tony and his car down, though now, rather than the pristine asphalt of i224, he is on the hard, compact dirt of the untamed land. percy rolls up near him, yelling something about how they need to go. tony looks at him, then up at the thing, then back to percy. he mumbles something about their friends at the finish line, only for percy to point to the pair of trucks rolling down the road ahead of them, already hightailing it back to town. percy spares a single glance up at the thing, giving a cowardly halfsmile and nod before rolling his window back up, and making a very slow, careful turn.

tony, still somewhat disoriented, follows suit, and they both make the quietest, quickest haste they can to return to town.

the thing, now annoyed at being awake, watches them all leave. it mutters to itself about their deal, and why people were bothering it again before slinking back into the earth, now twisting its body this and way and that, turning the once straight drive of i224 into a winding, twisting mess of sharp turns and hard corners.

...

interstate 224, the road that connected nothing to nowhere. no one was sure why was abandoned, nor were they sure why it was built the way it was. twisting and turning as though snaking around mountains that were no longer there, the road was quite the sight to behold. locals would warn people away, but car enthusiasts and drift racers alike flocked to the empty, winding road all the same."

i was riding with my parents watching me, and i could finally do it without helper wheels, or them close.

i fell, but the bike was frozen halffallen, while the car stopped, and mom and dad were also midshout.

hours turned into days.  
i ate, and slept at the hospital.

i was out to get me some food, when time unfroze.

[wp] fuck you and the horse you rode in on! do you really want to say that to the four horsemen of the apocalypse?! i know what i said.,"mortar of the stars



i never wanted to be a hero again.

not after that arrow ruined my knee, my pride, my dreams, all for someone elses glory.

but i suppose the world never cared about what i wanted.



the night it all changed, i was dreaming.

in the dream, i was still whole. still young. still running up ruined temple steps, blade in hand, heart full of fire.

then thunder cracked like the sky had split its spine.

i woke choking on smoke and dust, as my tent gone, and my ears ringing so hard i tasted metal. and that light, bright enough to sear shadows into the insides of my eyelids.

i crawled through the blownback trees until i found it.

a crater, a whole damn meteorite smashed into the earth like the gods had fired a cannonball at my campsite on purpose.

and in the center of that smoking pit

a girl.

small. fraillooking. bare as a newborn star.



i did the only thing a halfcrippled exadventurer could wrapped her in my bedroll, limped her home, and fetched a healer.

when the healer finished her work, and swore she wasnt hurt, not a scratch, not a burn, i let myself breathe again.

she woke the next morning, eyes like dawn, hair like moonlight spun through ink.

i am mortar of the stars. she said, voice ringing with childlike delight. or, well, this me is my avatar. i wanted to try living. you found me first, so i look like what your heart needed most. i hope thats okay!

i laughed for the first time in years.



days passed.

days turned to weeks.

weeks blurred into seasons.

i never imagined id be happy again, not in this halflife of mended gear and halfhealed scars. but she changed that.

she was chaos, warmth, curiosity.

shed drag me out to watch shooting stars, then scold me for eating rations cold when she could conjure a fire with a snap of her fingers.

shed hum little songs she claimed shed plucked from the background hum of the universe.

when my knee ached, shed kneel by my side and cup it in her small hands, apologizing for something she never did.

i never told her how terrified i was that id wake up and find her gone, that it was all just the last bright dream of a washedup old fool.



i suppose i should have known nothing lasts.

we were on a tiny island, our quiet secret place,  when the sky turned black as tar.

by the time we returned, the city we called home was a ruin.

charred stone, broken spires, the streets carpeted with ash and silence.

and there they stood

four riders.

figures so massive they dwarfed the crumbling cathedral behind them.

i knew them from the murals. the last ruin i explored before my friend pushed me into that arrow trap. the last ruin that ended my life as a hero. the ruin that shouldve stayed buried.

war. famine. pestilence. death.

the horsemen of the apocalypse.



fuck you and the horse you rode in on!
her voice cracked like thunder.

do you really want to say that to the actual four horsemen of the apocalypse?! i hissed, limping to her side.

she didnt look at me, just narrowed those dawnlight eyes, raw fury blazing out from a face id never seen twisted in rage before.

i know what i said.



they came for us.

they crossed the bones of the world to snuff out the last lights they hadnt yet broken.

she spread her arms wide. 

a shimmer wrapped around us.

a barrier of humming starlight, thick as a mountain.

her eyes turned black, then bright again, reflecting something colossal and alien that unfolded itself across the torn sky above.

i saw it

the real mortar of the stars.

a shape of impossible geometry, wreathed in the heat of collapsed suns.

when the pillar fell, it felt like the heavens themselves dropped an anvil on the horsemens heads.

a single strike, a single cosmic flame so vast it turned stone and metal to vapor.

the city, the ruin, everything the horsemen had tainted, all of it swallowed in light.



when the world calmed, i found her standing in the middle of the ruin.

she was trembling.

her hands clenched so tight theyd drawn blood.

that was you? i asked.

she didnt look at me.

i was just channeling you. she whispered. your rage. your hate. your grief. im a mirror, remember? you wanted them gone. i only finished it.

her shoulders shook.

and the real me, the being called mortar of the stars... i think i felt it too. just a tiny piece. sadness. grief. anger. and helplessness. im a cosmic destroyer. i can burn what i love. i cant bring it back.

she looked so small, framed by the crater shed made, just a girl, not a god.



i remembered then the old texts. the murals. the hidden lines id read in the ruins id abandoned when my knee gave out.

spells that could heal what no healer dared. rites to defy death itself. secrets of gods hidden in crumbling stones.

i stepped forward, rested my hand on her shoulder.

then lets go find them. i said.

she looked up, hope flickering where thered been tears.
together ?

yeah. i squeezed her hand. together.



so here i am, old knee creaking, backpack strapped tight, and a divine cosmic being humming next to me, wearing my old cloak like its royalty.

im not just a broken old adventurer anymore.

crash.

the carriage door exploded outward in a shower of splintered wood and twisted hinges, torn from its frame by impossible strength.

a figure emergedhunched, bestial. what had once been a prince now crouched in the doorway, fingers curled into vicious claws that scraped against the carriage frame. his eyes burned red in the moonlight, teeth clenched in barely contained rage.

the knights horses shied away, their riders pulling hard on the reins. even through their helms, fear was evident in their sudden movements. the bandits froze, crossbows wavering as confusion rippled through their ranks.

an unnatural silence fell over the clearing, broken only by the soft creak of leather and the distant wolf songs that seemed suddenly much closer.

then the prince straightened slowly, throwing back his head. his arms spread wide as maniacal laughter bubbled up from his throata sound that made hardened mens blood run cold. behind him, the full moon formed a perfect halo of silver light.

the laughter shifted, deepening into something wild and primal. his teeth elongated into fangs, his nose stretched into a lupine snout, and pointed ears emerged from his lengthening hair. coarse fur bristled across every visible inch of skin as his body expanded with unnatural muscle.

the transformation complete, the werewolf prince threw back his head and howleda sound that turned every mans spine to ice.

the knights broke first. spurring their destriers, they thundered away into the forest, their gleaming armor flashing between the trees. the bandits on the carriages right flank scattered next, dropping their crossbows as they crashed through the underbrush.

panic spread like wildfire. within moments, the remaining bandits fled in all directions, their ambush forgotten in the face of this supernatural horror.

gareth turned to run, but a massive clawed hand clamped down on his shoulder, spinning him around with effortless strength. he found himself face to face with the werewolf princeinches away from rows of gleaming fangs and burning red eyes. hot breath washed over his face as the creature studied him with predatory intelligence.

warm liquid ran down gareths legs as his body betrayed him, terror overriding every instinct except the knowledge that he was about to die.

above them both, the full moon smiled down on the forest, and in the distance, wolves began to answer their princes call."

what do the logfiles say? she asked. she didnt actually want to hear the answer, but it was good to keep up pretense. it was hard to believe, but even the shareholders here started asking for more than just number go up, as if that isnt the entire point of a business.

well, since we are no longer collecting any superfluous data, theres not much here, but according to what we have, everything worked. the truck made impact, their soul got the whole reincarnation spiel, agreed to the blessing of eulatos, and stepped into the portal. and then...nothing. the town of tutorial reports that they never arrived, and the system cant find them anywhere on the newp layer.

maybe it was time to take that golden parachute soon, leave the mess to the next fool trying to milk it some more. if only she could get the shareholders to approve that severance package...

...only discrepancy we noticed is that the spirit guide said she was brunette, while the driver swears he hit exactly the hot readhead he was supposed to hit. but i cant make sense of what that means, or why we can locate neither the new body nor her soul as a result.

all im saying is, help me out here a little. youll tell them we value the privacy of our customers and dont record that, and i wont tell anyone that your name shows up in the publishing information of realvirgins.gov.

there is a monster hiding under my bed. 

when i was a child, my parents dismissed it as delusions. i was afraid of the dark and the unknown. the line between fantasy and reality was blurred. when i grew up, id realize it wasnt there.

dad took my hand and crouched down. i followed him because i knew we wouldnt see it. i knew it was there because of the whispers. its coarse voice echoed throughout the room. it caused me to shake in my bed.

in response to this, dad sat next to me and told me he heard nothing. i held onto him because the monsters words were hurtful. he said that no one would ever love me. he said that i wasnt worthy of love. worst of all, he said that i was lying to everyone.

that caused a huge panic in my parents. i went from charming boyish fears to psychological disorder. they took me to a therapist who talked to me about my life. they arranged for a ton of parent teach conferences and called other parents to ask how i was doing. nothing made sense to anyone.

i had many friends at school. a few kids were mean, but i wasnt bullied. my grades were fine. i loved my parents, and i loved my siblings. i was generally happy and enjoyed playing baseball, fishing, and reading. the therapist said that i was extremely welladjusted. the monster under my bed was concerning. 

as a teenager, they decided that i had a generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed pills. i decided to lie and say it helped. in reality, i learned to kill the monster when i woke up. 

it attached itself to the top of the bed frame near the headboard wherever it went. it was the size of my pinky, and it was vulnerable to the pocket knife that i carried with me. i killed it every morning. i learned to enjoy hearing it scream.

this escalated our little war. it began to get specific with its threats and truths. i started to kill it slower and slower. when i went to college, i disguised this activity as part of a morning prayer, but my roommates caught on. they thought i was just weird. 

i moved out on my own as soon as i could. i began prying it off the bed and holding it on the table stabbing it. lighting the oven, i burned and boiled it alive. it became a game of mine to kill it.

you are lying to everyone. i know what you really are. i know why you are ashamed. i know why you will never be happy. i know why you will never truly love someone.

those are the words it speaks now. a part of me wonders if it speaks the truth. if it is true, the shame would be too great to bare. as such, i keep killing it. i have to go through this to feel safe and content. 

safe and content. yes, that is exactly what i feel. i am fine with my life as it is and how it will go. i am safe, content, and alone.

"[wp] one caramel macchiato, large, please! you look up from your phone to see a dragon on the opposite side of the counter, casually waiting for you to take his order as if this was a normal everyday occurance.","dude, you a dragon. i say, going back to candy crush.  
it adjusts its mustache, which do i have to say it? is fake.  
excuse me, good madam, but i am a customer, with human money.  
please, a large, caramel macchiato. please. it says.  
i look up again.  
hmm, my chewing gum seems to have lost its taste...well, whatever.  
dude, you barely fit into my store, and are pushing the other customers out. i say.  
it chuckles, and shrinks.

  
now, a 9 feet tall, scaly dude, with a magicians hat that appeared out of nowhere, fake mustache, and a monocle stands in front of the counter.  
ahem, my apologies.  
so, can i get the caramel, macchiato, large please? it asks, a bit of smoke escaping its nostrils.  
hmm.  
i start to feel the bad taste of the too chewed chewing gum.  
i turn around to put it into the garbage bin.  
yeah, yeah, one sec. i mutter, as i got a text from my bestie.  
she found her boyfriend in bed with her...mother?  
juicy.

  
excuse me? my coffee? a voice interrupts my delicious drama.  
what? oh, yeah, my bad. i mutter, putting down my phone, and making the dragon the caramel, macchiato.  
name? i ask.  
what? why would you ask for my name? do you plan to enslave me?! he gasps.  
i roll my eyes.  
we write the names on the cups. and dont kid yourself dude, you a hunk, but i am into the nerdy ones i can torment a bit. i say.  
it chuckles wryly.  
you can write dexoria. it says.  
i nod.

  
a few minutes later, i am done.  
caramel macchiato, large for doxi? doxi?! i call out.  
the dragon comes to the counter.  
dexoria. it smiles, taking the coffee.  
whatever. i say, going back to my phone.  
you know...i could kill you, right? it asks, and i look up to see its face really, really close.  
its golden eyes sparkling.  
i put my chewing gum on his monocle.  
it huffs, and puffs, talking about bad review, and leaves.  
i go back to the drama on my phone.  
it was annoying, but at least no other customer came back, while he was inside, and even now, they are afraid to come in.  
so i guess it wasnt that bad."
"[wp] you have a black notebook with red text on the cover, and your friends jokingly call it a deathnote. you wrote a few names in it as a joke. the next day, all written names are dead...","mark didnt come back right away. after a few minutes, i stood up and started walking in the direction hed gone. the dirt path curved along the park fence, and i watched the road through the gaps. cars passed by, fast and faceless. in each windshield reflection, for just a second, i thought i saw us. her hand on mine, her hair in the wind. that version of life i still looked for in traffic windows.

then i saw it. lying on the grass just off the path.

a small black notebook. the cover was rough and matte, with something printed on it in red letters. at first i thought it was some edgy teenage diary. later id realize it was just a cheap novelty thing  bold red text across the front deathnote.

i picked it up. flipped through it. empty pages. i almost laughed.

got her, marks voice called out from behind me. he was out of breath, grinning, the dog hanging smugly from the leash with a halfeaten cookie in its mouth.

we walked together toward the park exit and sat down on a different bench, one closer to the sidewalk.

whats that? he asked, nodding at the notebook in my hand.

nothing. just found it. useless.

he held out his hand, so i passed it to him. the grass rustled nearby, a car passed with a sharp tire hiss, and the wind picked up  suddenly, fast. for a second it felt like the sound came from every direction.

mark flipped to the back of the notebook.

huh. there are rules.

rules?

yeah. says if you write someones name and a date, they die. some fake japanese thing. looks like a joke.

he handed it back, chuckling.

you should write my bosss name in there. the asshole makes me work every summer. says falls the only real season for a break.

i smiled, reached into my coat pocket. elsa used to write poems. i hated poems, but i always carried a pen. whenever the inspiration hit her, shed go tearing through the house looking for one. eventually, i just started keeping one on me.

i flipped the notebook back to the first page and glanced at mark.

you know what? maybe youll get that vacation after all.

he grinned, leaned in, and spelled out the name. we added the date and time.

i closed the notebook and slipped it into my pocket.

we sat a little longer. talked about dinner, the game next week, the weird smell near the east side of the park. then we said goodbye and went our separate ways.

i walked home slowly. the street was full of people moving the other direction, brushing past like i wasnt even there. like a river pushing against me, dividing me in half. it felt like that more and more lately. like i didnt quite belong to the flow of the world anymore."
"[wp] every year for the last decade, every girlfriend youve ever had as dumped you after visiting their hometown on christmas eve right as you are finishing a huge project at work that would have set you up for life. but this last time was the last straw, and you confront her this time.","to hell with the holidays. he plotted his first new years eve alone. the vacation he always wanted. somewhere warm this time. miami sounded like a great choice.


this is great. it almost feels like the setup for his own lifetime movie."
"[wp] you are the tragic figure of a heros past the precious friend who was taken away too soon. not that you were aware of any of that, not until that hero from the future comes back to try and save you.","they always said lightning never strikes twice.

thats a lie.

the first strike split the sky. red, not white. like a vein in the heavens had been torn open and bled rage into the earth. i barely had time to turn before it hit.

or shouldve.

the sound of metal screaming against metal rang out, and instead of my chest being pierced, i was thrown back by the force of a collision that wasnt mine.

dust choked the air. the stone floor scraped my palms as i slid.

i blinked up...

... and saw a sword.

gleaming silver. cradling faint motes of light as if it drank the moon itself. it hovered between me and death, the red lightning, no, a spear, still crackling with magical energy where it had been deflected.

i coughed. what the hell

then the light came.

moonlight, breaking through the shattered ceiling of the ruins like heaven reaching down to intervene. the dust caught in its beam turned silver. the shadows pulled away, as if they feared the figure now stepping into view.

a man stood in the light.

tall. clad in gray armor and red cloak, scorched with battle and time. a black scarf hung from his neck like a faded memory. his white hair blew in the breeze that somehow only reached him. a jagged scar crossed one side of his face.

his eyes locked with mine.

they werent angry.

they were tired.

like someone who had fought too long. bled too much. lost everything that once made the world beautiful.

i didnt recognize him.

but something in my chest tightened.

target diverted, he muttered, mostly to himself, before lowering the sword. good. i made it in time.

he stepped toward me. slowly. cautiously.

who  i began, but he raised his gauntleted hand.

dont speak yet. itll confuse things.

i am confused, i spat. what the hell was that thing? and who are you?!

he sighed, long and low, like someone bracing for the inevitable.

im someone who shouldve been here the first time. someone who shouldve saved you.

the way he said it the weight in his voice

like it was a sin.



the fight hadnt ended. the red spear hadnt acted alone. shadows moved in the corners of the ruin  lurking constructs, summoned guardians, whatever they were. they came for me.

but the knight always stood in the way.

every strike aimed at me met that moonlit sword. every spell scattered across his red cloak. he never let them touch me.

he fought like a man possessed. not with rage. not with power.

but with purpose.

why? i asked him once, between heavy breaths as we crouched behind crumbling stone. why are you protecting me?

he looked at me. and this time, i saw something crack behind his eyes.

because you died here, he whispered.

the wind stilled.

in the world i came from, you died right in this spot. right in front of me. i held your body and screamed at the sky, and it didnt matter. no power could bring you back. no magic. no god. just time.

he stood up, turning back to the battle.

so i bent time. just to have one more chance.



the final blow came fast.

a reaper of flame and steel that should have taken my head.

he caught it with his shoulder.

blood burst into the air like crimson petals. but he didnt fall. he twisted, roared, and drove that shining sword straight through the heart of the last enemy.

and when the silence returned, he dropped to one knee.

i rushed to his side. dont you dare die on me!

he laughed. bitter. gentle.

funny. thats what i said back then.

i stared at him.

and suddenly i remembered.

the voice.

the eyes.

the warmth of sunlight through childhood windows.

arden?

his name left my mouth like it had never left my heart.

he smiled, blood at the corner of his lips.

you were the only one who believed in me, he murmured. the good little idiot who thought he could save the world.

i shook my head, tears already coming. you did save the world, didnt you?

he closed his eyes.

no. not until i saved you."
"[wp] what came first, the chicken or the egg? asked the sphinx. to which you answer the egg. its the egg. you need to spend an hour explaining descent with modification before it begrudgingly acquiesces.",good depiction of a reasoned arguement by someone who hasnt been taught about evolution formally.
[wp] yourefreeing me? asks the dragon to the jester unlocking its cage. no one deserves to be the kings plaything says the jester.,"hey man, you realize im about to roast the shit out of this entire place if you let me do this... right?

santius was without question the funniest dragon the neverending jungle had ever seen. everyone knew who he was, not necessarily for his comedy, but for the destruction caused at his final show. we all knew dragons could be a bit dangerous when they were drinking, but no one was prepared for just how destructive they could get when they start laughing uncontrollably.

of course i know that. i replied. thats the entire point. im sick and tired of this highbrow, obnoxious king of ours.

today is march 1st, better known as kings day in daycora. believe it or not, kings day is basically just an annual opportunity to kiss our majestys royal ass as much as possible. as jester, i get the privilege every year to provide entertainment.

that damn king has had me locked up for 14 years snarled santius as i began jostling my key into the lock around his neck.

my comedy shows typically slay, but the shows on kings day always have the crowd and most importantly the king, absolutely bent over with laughter. everyone except the damn dragons. no matter how hard i try, i can not get them to laugh.

look santius, im sick and tired of this king too. a guy can only do a song and dance for so long before he snaps.

i had been trying for years to get the dragons to laugh so hard that i invoked a santiuslevel incident, but i simply couldnt break through the humandragon comedy barrier. luckily, even though they hated human comedy, that had to show up at least once a year for kings day.

i cant wait. replied santius my old material was fire enough, but ive been down here for 14 years with nothing to do but write jokes... its going to be a bloodbath

ahh a bloodbath. exactly what i was hoping for. i cant wait to see the kings face when santius emerges on stage. the last laugh will finally be mine

youre gonna kill it i said as a handed santius the microphone. i smiled as he turned around and started ascending towards center stage."
"[wp] my girlfriend isnt real, she was created by my imagination. the funniest part is that i dont have any trauma that would lead to this.","my family, whom just made an intervention smiled wryly at my words.

yeah, adam...  
you had meals prepared by her, and you went shopping with her for clothes...sending us pictures of mannequins. my sister chimed in.  
its not that we dont believe you, dear, but we have to solve this.  
i hope you know, but its not normal to imagine, and believe so strongly an imaginary friend. mom said.  
i sighed.  
how could i not know, but at the same time...  
it was so real to me.

  
you do know, shes imaginary, right? dad asked again.  
now i do...  
though you putting cameras into my apartment...quite rude. i said.  
we had to. was all dad said.  
and he was right.  
i cooked, cleaned, and even had...you know what, all alone...  
the womens clothes i had?  
all new, and never worn, just laid out every now and then, same with perfumes and shampoos.  
now what? i asked my family.  
they must have a plan.

greenlands angel wing it is called, and it is specifically made to deal with situations like yours. mom smiled.

they all frowned.

i nodded.  
its not like i didnt know, but...  
how could i tell them that i was hearing jessica, and seeing her right next to them...even now?  
and dads hand just went through her.  
i sighed.

  
when do we go? i said.  
they smiled.  
even now.  
they know about you, and we will pay for everything! mom said, going to my room, i guess for some clothes.  
i will take care about your job, son. dad said.  
and i will come over to clean the apartment, and water the plants once a week. my sister said.  
i sighed, and stood up, and that alone seemingly took all my energy.  
thank you...  
love you guys, and sorry... i muttered.  
dad patted my shoulder.  
it will be fine. you will get better. he said, at the same time as jessica, my girlfriend, wished me good luck, and to get well soon...  
how messed up this is."
"[wp] so you have the power to destroy, anything. yep. and you became a doctor? yes.","[stellar decision]

dr. powells confusion was evident in his furrowed brow as he looked from the black and white splotched bovine to the woman whod brought him there. she was an attractive blonde with bright blue eyes and a starpatterned dress, who promised him an amazing opportunity. he started with a skeptical mindset that got worn down as she they traveled. the appointment was set, and they met 15 minutes ago. the blonde took him to a sprawling university campus that he was unfamiliar with, and took him into a lab that seemed to get more futuristic as they walked through, to finally stop at the cow. she simply nodded with encouragement. this was what he was here for. it was an odd place for an interview, but she confirmed itd started already. 



well..., dr. powell nodded after gathering his thoughts. ...my 10th birthday party was the first time it happened. i dissolved the secondstory floor, everything and everyone dropped down with a hard landing. i ended up with my arms and a leg behind my back, then spent six weeks in the hospital. all i could do was feel guilty and watch the doctors be amazing. superpowers are common enough, but not one of them treated me like i was dangerous. they said theyve seen all kinds of awakenings, and mine was one of the tamer ones. no one even accused me of doing it intentionally. 



i see, starla replied. that answers where you got inspired to join the medical field. what about this unique opportunity? what brings you here? 



technology, mostly, dr. powell replied. im doing what i can to help, with what i have. but, then i was approached, he smiled at the blonde again. everyone knew the specifics, but this was a formal interview, and he had to answer the questions. nanotech, and alternate realitities were proven to exist, and i had to know more. the more i know, the more people i can help. 



you know there are other ways to help, even within chroma corp., starla replied. we have quite a large super division, with numerous teams across thousands of earths.



i was given a full briefing on the company, dr. powell nodded. im aware of my other options. and, i was also told that changing my mind was allowed, should i find something i prefer doing instead. 



then, youre sure you wouldnt rather work at one of our hospitals? starla asked. why my lab? dr. powell looked around at the spacious room. it was at least the size of a barn, if not larger, with computers lining one wall, and several other tables decorated with tubes, bunsen burners, and vials. in one corner was a doorway leading to the animal enclosures, according to the arrow. 



its quiet..., dr. powell nodded. i want to help people... i dont want to deal with people, he sighed. there were too many kids at my party... i was trying really hard to find some excuse for it to be over. then, i accidentally did it on purpose. it really was the first time, he chuckled. i chose biomed research to avoid the patients. 



you dont like people? starla asked with a small laugh. 



not really, dr. powell shook his head. 



youve practiced more with your abilities after that moment, im assuming. you can control it? she continued the questions. 



i have, he nodded, and starla laughed again.



so you have the power to destroy anything, she stated. 



yep, dr. powell grinned too. starlas voice sounded positive and almost enthusiastic. and the blonde was all smiles.



and you became a doctor? she asked. 



yes, dr. powell nodded. 



 and, youre being interviewed by a cow, starla said. she made her decision as soon as he took the interview seriously. shed learned that not many people could handle the idea of working for a talking cow, and began relying on outside help for hiring. 



youre looking to hire a human, dr. powell shrugged. who am i to judge? 



thats a useful attitude here, im willing to bring you aboard for a probationary period, starla nodded, then she looked at the blonde. shed been a complete professional, staying quiet the whole time. 



great job, andie. if you and ozone can find me a few more like him, chroma corp. will be happy to cover the same fee. 



thats a deal, ms. starla, andie smiled, then waved at dr. powell. congratulations mr. doctor powell, good luck.

[wp] a very powerful wizard and witch are in a fierce rivalry and the villagers tired of being in the cross fire decided to set them up together which worked but unfortunately now their both just doing massive romantic gestures that are somehow even more destructive then what they where doing before,"we wanted to do good.  
the witch, and wizard that lived in our villages surroundings, had a terrible rivalry, that caused untold problems to us.  
so...we set them up, showed them how similar to each other they are, and how they could truly understand each other. both were crazy, crazy.  
it actually worked.  
in the way, that the two got together.  
happy couple, happy life, right?  
wrong.  
it was worse than before.

  
their love, was as bad as their rivalry, endless, infinite in problem causing potential.  
they showered each other in romantic gestures, that for them might have been aww, but for us were aaaaa.  
why?  
on their first week anniversary, the wizard created a golem that looked like the witch...  
problem is he used a quarter of a mountain nearby, that caused a landslide, destroyed half the forest, and basically crippled our hunting for the year...  
if that wasnt enough, the golem can talk.  
and it is so loud, that if it speaks near you, you go deaf...  
and that is just the start.

  
the witch, to show that her love is not any less than the wizards damn competitive couples, created a new form of flowers.  
they looked like roses, but whenever the wizards magic was nearby...they bloomed purple, as it was his favorite color.  
it was cute, if it wouldnt have been an invasive species, magically grafted, and planted, being nighimmortal, and having no pests in the surroundings.  
now...they are everywhere!  
everywhere!  
and these are just the cutest one.  
there is more.

  
the wizard created a walking hut for the witch, so that she can easily relocate, if she is hunted.  
problem is...the hut is a cannibal and eats a dozen or so adult trees a day!  
the witch created a potion for the wizard to replenish mana...which means that the wizard is now making experiments even more often, polluting the forest, and village with his spells!  
this had to be stopped.  
so, a plan was put in motion.  
just as we set them up...  
now we have to break them up...  
and this time we hope, we dont make it worse, than it is now."
"[wp] in a cyberpunk future, the vampires are starving because most human blood is polluted by modifications and toxic chemicals.","i stare at my fellow coven members, and sigh.  
once, we were the rulers of humanity, puppeteering them from the shadows.  
now?  
all of us are paler than usual, damaged skin, and our bones are nigh visible, so skinny we are.  
how is the artificial blood reserve holding up? i ask.  
it is enough for 100 more years...but as you know, it is not near as nutritious as real blood. viola says.  
i nod.  
but what can we do?  
humanity entered a cyberpunk era, and most of them are less human than we are.

  
cant we control the purists to make another rebellion? osta, an elder asked.  
i shake my head.  
the purists population is indeed growing, and we have a share of their blood, but it is the argent covens territory. also...the cyberenhanced humans reached a point where the elite soldiers can take on ballistic missiles, and survive.  
how can the purists actually do something? i say.  
they all sigh.  
what will be next? a young vampire asks.  
i smile.

  
not to fret, we have hibernation scheduled in the next century. we will sleep, until the humans inevitably either die out, or return to their biological forms. i say.  
why would they do that? now with the cybernetic enhancements, they can live as long as they have parts!  
now the diseased go towards a clinic to change the bad parts, instead of asking to be turned by us! another coven member cried out.  
yet their blood is toxic, and their mind is muddled by the various electrical impulses of the implants. if they miss one update, or one maintenance, there is a chance of them dying, or going insane.  
its not the first time humanity became untouchable to us vampires, yet...we are still here. i say.  
they nod, but they are scared.  
rightfully so.

  
after the coven meeting, i leave for another one.  
i arrive at a shady clinic, deep underground.  
welcome! your order is almost ready! the cyberdoc says, as he leads me to a huge beating container.  
this beauty combines the blood of several animals, and some herbs, to replicate the nutrients of the human blood. it also has a purifier installed, and it can run on sunlight, and water. he says.  
i nod, and pay him another installment.  
we have our hibernation measure, but...  
if this works out, then our coven will be the 2nd to be fully fed in 5 decades, and that can bring us a lot of benefits.  
we have to keep up with the times, because hibernation might not be the answer this time around, after all...  
the doctor i just talked with is 190 years old, one of the first cyberhumans.  
but i have yet to break this news with my coven...i dont want despair to spread even more.  
we will get through this, just like we get through the hunt era."
"[wp] you teach several highly recommended acting classes, however, to your dismay, you never seem to see any of your students again. until today, when you find one of your best pupils in your office. with weapon in hand, they coldly ask you how many agents have you trained?","as james shut off the lights to his small theatre, he whistled the theme song to the andy griffith show. james looked around admiring his theatre, where for the last 14 years of his 20 years as an acting teacher he taught hundreds of students of various ages. when he stepped back from acting to focus on his passion for teaching the art james never imagined that he would own a place like this. for his first 6 years of teaching he rented out rooms, community centers and wherever else he could find. never expecting to make much money james had expected to be stuck in those small rooms forever, but to his great surprise james did quite well, and decent money started rolling in, enough to buy and renovate this theatre. it was perfect for jamess needs, his students got the feel for the stage, and he was able to hold a show for every one of his classes to get actual experience. plus james loved being able to rent the space for other performances.

after getting all the lights turned off james headed back to his office to gather his things to leave. upon entering his office however, james noticed a figure standing there, one that seemed somewhat familiar. 

robert? robert havbee?

hello mr. mckay, i would like to say its good to see you again, but i dont think i can. robert said hoarsely, as he fully turned around raising a gun towards james now tell me how many agents did you train?!?

what are you talking about? is that a real gun? is it loaded?

yes it is real and yes it has bullets! now answer the question!

dont you know better than to point a loaded gun at someone? it is basic gun saftey.

unless you intend to do harm to that person, which i intend to do if you dont answer the damn question. how many agents?

robert i have no idea what you mean, i dont know the current careers of most of my students, nevertheless how many of them became talent agents. and why does that question require a gun? james responded, fear emanating in his voice.

stop playing dumb im not talking about any damn talent agent, robert snapped. 

 robert im telling you i do not understand what you are asking please just lower the gun. 

robert did not move.

 i genuinely do not understand what you are asking if youre not talking about, if you dont mean talent agents. please just tell me what you want, james pleaded.

 you seriously do not know do you? what you are part of? how stupid are you?

[wp] your plan for a quiet relaxing day at home ends with you running down the lanes at a bowling alley whilst wearing a chicken costume and on fire.,"the sergeant took of my handcuffs when the first unit called in from my house, confirming that there are indeed two dead, but mostly identifiable thing is among the ruins, unlike the ones which were enthusiastically pulverized by the guys. the acrid smell of the burning suit was still lingering on, somewhat overpowering the smell of alien dead. 

okay, son, maybe what you are telling us is not one hundred percent bullshit. can you tell us your story again, from the point you sat down with a book and a glass of wine?

i already told you and i have not seen it helping me in any way.

that was before the first piece of proof, son.

also, please dont call me that.

okay, mr. stimson. please tell us your story, now into the record.

so i told it again, starting from the sudden thunder of their landing and the roof crashing into my living room.

why you, mr. stimson?

i really have no idea, sir. maybe i have that kind of face that makes everyone want to bully me? maybe that hobby project i did a couple of years ago, sending a message towards alfa centauri, and left it running because it looked cool?

with such interruptions i went through the events. how i noticed that the two things coming to my house had no eyes but prominent ears, suggesting echolocation. how i put on the chicken suit i got from and ad company in high school to promote best chicken, and kept when both the ad company and best chicken went out of business. how i managed to hit the things and found that their skin has some acid, burning my hand. how i bludgeoned them to death with the only object which was solid enough, my bowling ball.

how i recognized that these two were just the vanguard and two dozen or so are circling the remains of my house. 

my beloved and finely tuned bowling ball was just a smoking little knob, so i jumped into my car to go to the only place where i can be sure to find people equipped with heavy stone object, the little mermaid bowling hall, where the county championship was ongoing, without me, because now that they could win actual money, suddenly everyone was there and they did not needed me, the substitute. 

how they caught up with me just a block away from the little mermaid and hit my car with some ray which melted the car around me in a couple of seconds.

wait, mr. stimson. dexter, anything to add?

you do know that i mostly working with blood, chief?

yes, but splatter is splatter.

i can tell you chief that the smear outside does looks like it was once a car, going with a high but not unreasonable speed. all the separate drops had the same direction, and there is a definite thickening at the front where the engine should have been. some black colorations could have been plastic parts, but for that you have to ask for a chem analysis.

the rest of my story was easier to confirm, because there were eyewitnesses in the mermaid. they have seen me rushing in in the burning chicken suit, they have seen the things coming after me, they beat the things to pulp. i was running to the back to put out the fire at the ball washer station, when the police came in and caught me.

okay, mr. stimson. lets say that i put this into the official record. by tomorrow both of us will be in an institute with very helpful personnel and soft walls to not to injure ourselves.

well, i cant lie now, sir.

but i can. and i do. and here are a couple of guys from something called mib who will help us.

they came in, said nice things, then there was a flash, and i was back at my living room with a book and a glass of wine.

everything was like before, i had a car, i had a roof, i had my favourite ball on the mantelpiece. no one was able or willing to remember that something extraordinary happened on that friday.

i almost convinced myself that it was just a strange dream, until i had to play in our next game. 

because when i lifted my new ball from my new mantelpiece in my new living room, i knew that its balance is different now."
"[wp] thanks to interdimentional travel, an orphan can go live with a version of their parents that lost them instead","heres the thing, tommy people arent fungible. everyone learns that lesson eventually, and you  im sorry  have to learn earlier than most.

you drop your ice cream? no problem. you can just get a new one. it will be the same in every way that matters to you. still cold, still sweet, still in a cone. no meaningful difference.

thats not how it works with people. you miss your parents  of course you do. but you miss them. not a blonde woman with square glasses who is always late to yoga, not a balding man with one chipped tooth. its more than that. if it was just a physical, just a behavioural, match, you wouldnt even need the rift. the world is full of accountants who used to play bass.

imagine if you find a match. theyll look just like them. theyll behave just like them. but they wont actually be them. how good a fake would i have to give you so that you didnt feel youd lost your father? how convincing does a changeling have to be for a mother to not care that her real baby is dead? we mourn those we lost because of who they are, not what role they played.

the materialists will tell you that if you cant name a difference, pin it down with data, then it doesnt exist. you and i know different. the snow falls more crisply on christmas day than the day before, no matter what. the coin you find carries more luck than the one youre given. those waffles she used to feed you came from a packet, but they dont taste the same any more. theres something more, and across all the worlds, its irreplaceable.

theres no easy answer and im so sorry. its not fair that you cant bring them back, but finding an atomicallyidentical fake is just as unhealthy as one made of straw. we couldnt love them, really, if they could be replaced. all we can do is mourn, because in the entire universe, across countless worlds, reality is poorer without them.

we can send you through the rift. its no trouble, and no cost. since last year, its actually your legal right to go through. if you want to go, you can. but i guarantee you wont find what youre looking for.

endless realities, but contained within just one. the people you love are unique, individual, unforgeable. irreplaceable."
"[wp] son, i think its time for you to know that when you turn 18 an albino gorilla will come and beat you senseless. i dont know why but it happened to me, it happened to my father, my grandfather, and his father as well. nothing you can do about it, so dont make any plans until afterwards.","my hovere came over, and the next thing i remember was waking up at around 1030am in a private room at the esperanza verde hospital.

noone else was there. the readout on the display facing me showed i was in fine shape, and all had been patched up successfully.  i felt good, but light headed and i didnt really want to know what cocktail of things i was on.  i instructed my hovere to begin discharge and watched the notes and confirmations float across the display. drink little alcohol at your party, was the final instruction. no narcotics.  the amount charged to the family account was eyewatering. i winced a little.

some night this would be, and i didnt even have visible wounds to show off. and i could hardly raise a complaint to monocos autonomous ranch, where surely both humans and tech would refuse to confirm or deny any such creature was resident.

 

i did learn a little, later.  more than the bland talk of my familys involvement in uplift generally that was hardly a secret.

not from my father hed said all he was going to say, and likely less than that, but instead from an old recording stitched into the monoco archive, misfiled and tagged under agroecology ethics. it didnt take much digging once i knew what to look for. the whitefurred one wasnt some random offshoot mistake or longlived creature of resentment and controlled aggression. he was of course engineered back when that word still implied aspiration instead of apology.

the uplifts had names, once. families. vocalizations recorded with eerie clarity not quite language, but closer to lament than anyone had admitted at the time. the project had ended badly, like most things that start with patents and end with sterilisation orders. but he survived from this one project in particular.

and he, the one who came for me, is more than ritual. more than revenge. hes the embodied memory of a broken promise. tasked, encoded, and apparently sustained by some blend of biotech and sheer will.

i wasnt attacked to be punished. i was attacked to remember.

it will be my son next. when he too turns seventy, in less than thirty years time. i wondered faintly if i should break the cycle, or if i even had the right to. but it was time to get to the party."

"[wp] youre the villain in a prophecybut the hero hasnt shown up. years pass, the world waits, and you slowly start building the kingdom you were supposed to destroy","the devourer of time, thats what they called me in the lost prophecy. i am but a benign creature, one with four appendages and a variety of haircolours.

for centuries i have waited, patiently at first, biding my time in case the hero foretold by the wise sages turned out to be an unsuspected culprit. i blended in with species much bigger than my size, hunting gathering in a fashion that was all the rage back then.

then exerting my dominance in a flair most extravagant as i was confident the prophecy was a fluke and there exist no hero to challenge my might. ah what a glorious era that was! i ate with kings and queens on their tables, had my likeness carved into statues and worshipped, and even passed down judgements in the form of dreams and omens! 

but i got tired of the life of fanfare, of the constant need to maintain my regality and always having to straighten my back to keep up appearances. the food became stale, the strifes between countries became boring and repetitive, so... i snuck out. 

i went back to the life of a wanderer, poaching time from unsuspecting souls here and there, sowing a multitude of avatars of mine amongst the land. the parsimonious waved their pitifullooking weapons at me along with loud yells of dismay and the gullibles showered me with gifts as if i am a god. well, i am, of sorts. 

but most ludicrous were the daring, who seek to temper my sovereign with their paltry offerings of food! and lightninglike, pinpricked flames which i have to reluctantly admit, that are weirdly enticing. though never successful, they proved to be quality entertainment regardless, so i kept them around. 

and before i knew it, i have built myself an empire, full of servants that exists to serve my every need, retainers for my amusement and tributaries to supply me with endless interesting snacks.

then came the 21st century, thanks to a form of magical slabs of living paintings, my presence and popularity grew and so did my loyal subjects. no longer do i have to deal with the barbaric acts of the parsimonious. for now, even harming an avatar of mine is a crime. 

and yet, still the champion that had been herald as my bane remained missing, not a whisker in sight. thus, i, the devourr of time and the meowster of purrcrastination is and will continue to be the ruler of the twolegged!"
"[wp] your tattoo artist made a terrible mistake. instead of carpe diem, they inked carpe demon. now youve been thrust into the world of demon hunting, with no instructions or guide.","it didnt happen immediately. i was caught off guard. was about to take a shower the next day when i went to pull the bandage off the tat and see how she was looking. it was my second tattoo ever. i had a little fox on my upper right chest from when i went hiking in the alps with my cousins and a fox came up and somehow let us feed and pet it before it disappeared. and carpe diem right above the waistline over my left hip. i had planned on it being the second of potentially many as id just gotten back from a jungle excursion the other day. ayahuasca. i felt the ties loosen. who i was didnt need to be who i am. and who i am didnt need to be some perfect future version of myself with all of the money and a perfect husband and family. it could be anything.

but as soon as i peeled off the bandage to take a look, the skin was discolored. i wanted to hop into the shower to gently try and clean it up, but something looked wrong, and i wasnt sure if getting it wet was the right call. it couldnt get infected this quickly could it?

anyways, i hopped in, and the moment the water ran down my chest, the skin burned with the heat of a furnace. i screamed, and now im here. naked no less. or i was naked. i was thrown into the darkest forest i could imagine, and it was hot like a sauna. this is the first moment the skin finally cleared up enough to read.

carpe demon

in my mind i was still in the shower, it felt like i was on drugs from the pain of the water hitting the tat too. but i could see it even in the darkness. and then i awoke to the reality that i was naked in a steamy hot forest.

i heard a roar from behind me moments after i started wandering around and so i sprinted as fast as i could to run up a tree. and thats when the beast appeared. it had twelve eyes that slide around on the surface of its skin. it oozed death. i could feel the faint coming on. and realizing that i was dreaming, or ill, i took a deep breath, half expecting to wake up.

but what happened instead is that my tattoo started burning again. i felt a rise come over me, some fire and fury that felt like it had always been there. i roared back at the beast, which felt more intimidating than it probably was, but then i moved fast. i came up to the creature and saw that it looked to have no arms, no legs. nothing to grapple with and subdue it. but i looked for a stick on the forest floor. my waistline lip up on fire again, and i felt the power in my arms. i summoned a blade out of nothing out of necessity and swung it at the fowl...demon. and after it melted into the forest floor, the blade disappeared.

i was safe again for the moment, and oddly powerful. but it still felt right. i then passed a fallen priestess but ten paces away. she held a book in her hand. as i looked into her eyes i saw that she wasnt dead yet. she had a darkness about her though, i pressed my ear to her mouth as she had been moving her lips.

you came she whispered. i looked back at her again, checked her pulse and it was gone.

wake up! wake up dammit! where am i? where did i come?

i saw in her book the word summoning. i then cried for a moment at the insanity of the situation, and i stripped her down and put on her clothing. she was disfigured only minutes later once id gotten fully suited up. her body turned to nothing just like the demon had.

i had her dagger and her staff and even kept her book. and i wandered for the forest to seize the day, and perhaps the demon."
"[wp] you are the godess of knowledge, managing the nighinfinite divine library, downside is youre illiterate.","i am knowledge.

it is what i am, it is who i am.

i cam into being when the concept of knowledge itself first solidified in the primitive brain of a species that now only exists in the pages of a book on a shelf in my vast library. 

i knew it once, its name, its shape, its thoughts.

but that was before the library.

before the books.

before the ink.

now i know where the knowledge is found, i know what shelf the book stands on, what page to turn to and what words to read. 

i am knowledge.

but knowledge has changed and so i have changed.

knowledge used to be what the wise elder knew, and so i was the wise elder.

then knowledge became what the expert on a subject said, and so i became the expert on all subjects.

now true knowledge has become the means and ability to seek out the answers you need, and so i have become the one who can guide you to any knowledge you seek.

knowledge is no longer what a person knows, it is what they can find out should they need to. the ability to seek truth and not be turned astray by falsehood. 

and so i know nothing, except how to find all that there is to know.

i do not read the books in my library, i only lead others to the books they need.

i am knowledge.

and i know nothing."
"[wp] youre a true immortal, but you dont know it yet. this is because you have the ability to change your apparent age.","there are a lot of things on this earth that exist because we believe in them.

case in point for much of my life, i, like all other human beings on this planet, was convinced that i was someday going to die. i woke up every morning and expected to find wrinkles, and so they appeared i expected my hair to thin and turn silver, and my back to fail, and the arthritis to start up with its dull shooting pains the agony, god, all that pain that i could have avoided if i had known. i accepted the helping hands of friends and strangers with dignity as i struggled to cross streets, to climb stairs. when my heart began to fail and cancer shriveled up my lungs, i was expecting it. i believed in it fully.

until i met sally.

she was  of all things  a volunteer at the hospital where i was expecting to die. a young girl, id thought perhaps the same age as my granddaughter. sixteen, perhaps, with curly blonde hair. something sad in her eyes.

i told her after her first mandated visit that i liked to play chess. i was good at it  used to be a part of a local chess club, but never bothered to go professional. she was better. she beat me at every turn and helped me analyze the boards after knight to a6, see, you got excited and you lost focus of your queen, never let me swoop in for the kill like that again, ralphie, it makes me nauseous, but it all became more difficult as my organs failed. as the warmth seeped from my fingers, and the doctors started pulling my children aside for hushed conversations about my health.

i glanced toward the wall. i was remembering my wife as the doctor was giving the negative prognosis, counting down my days. shed died only ten years before. also lung cancer. she was a smoker, and a drinker, and a sweet person. she was fun.

soon, i might see her again. i believed fully in my own death, but beyond that, i couldnt be sure.

if i could have cried in that moment, i think i would have. but my family was there  and after they had gone, there was sally with her chessboard, ready to play.

id started calling out each move i wanted to make out loud, unable to push the pieces. today, i told sally to leave me be i said it more forcefully, i started to yell. i was ashamed by my death, that heavy black certainty pushing down. i couldnt play. couldnt play anything, soon enough.

ill be dead in a week, i rasped. i grit my teeth. find someone else to play with.

sallys reaction wasnt what i had expected it wasnt anger, or sadness, or confusion. she chewed her lip, glanced over her shoulder, and stood to shut the door. her white sweater seemed to glow as she slowly walked toward me and bent over to whisper in my ear with her sweet, belllike voice

listen to me very closely, ralphie, she murmured. you need to convince yourself that youre going to live, and live well.

i shook my head. but she kept pressing believe me, she insisted, blue eyes flashing, i was once where you are. i thought i needed to die, too, but all you need to do is believe that you wont, and i promise  smart people like us, ralphie, were meant to stick around. were meant to live forever.

a ventilator hissed. i sucked in cold air and closed my eyes, battered by pain, wishing for morphine, almost wanting it all to end. get it over with, already. what the hell was she talking about?

for me, ralphie. do it for me. her lips pressed against my forehead. i havent had anybody put up a fight with me in chess like that in a hundred years. cmon.

then she lowered herself into a squat at my bedside, and kept whispering you are twentythree. you are twentythree. you are twentythree

over and over and over and i finally found myself crying when the knifestabbing hurt took me over. i wasnt a man, then. i was a corpse. i tried to call for a nurse but sallys pale white hand seized the call button, you are twentythree twentythree twentythree...



as i slid into delirium, slipping further down that dark tunnel with no light at the other end, i started to believe it.

i am twentythree.

i am twentythree.

i opened my eyes. the hospital room was clear. sally was smiling down at me, and i found myself able to sit up, suck in a breath. my hands not the speckled versions that i was familiar with, my body light, and i sprung out of bed in a rush of panic to find a mirror.

what? my brain stuttered, and melted, and felt like it might be leaking from my ears. what? was i dead?

sally clapped a hand on my shoulder. she seemed shorter, now id regained some of my height. youre not dead yet, she said. not letting you off that easy.

her eyes twinkled.

not when weve still got a game to finish."

magus glacier, spat out the wizened witch to his right. that is not arch mage melynia attempted to reign her rage in. i was more familiar with her approach to study. melynia had a habit of playing favorites. i did not recall any real positive interaction i had with her, though she had named herself my academic adviser following my period of apprenticeship. she rose from her seat, shooing the man off his seat. give me that, she scowled at the man, as the doddering old man abandoned his seat, her mandibles wrapping about the gavel that allowed him to silence the presenter beneath him. the murmurs behind me only intensified. 



magus prospectus hershyll, answer the following questions very carefully, the woman seethed between her teeth as she settled herself down. age had done her no favors despite all the glamors a mage could summon, she still looked as if she were in her 70s. one could not escape age, even if they had delayed the inevitable a fine 400 years. do you know the names of the bodies you brought before us?



i nodded, still a bit perplexed. 



can you name them now? she asked, strained as she demanded their names. 



i answered, starting to piece it together. ah, she had been an adviser to the magus i presented to her. my hand gestured to the corpse on my right. this was once versysta ewercyll. magus of the ninth circle, decorated captain of the windholme mage corps. he is survived by his wife and daughter, who shall remain unnamed in respect of their privacy. my hand drifted to the left. this was once callisto ewercyll. a knight commander of the windholme knight corps, he too is a decorated officer, famous for a variety of brave and wondrous deeds. he is survived by three children, a grieving widow and two bereaved parents. 



once again, unnamed? 



i can name the parents, i insisted, but the rest i shall keep to myself. out of respect.

it was the same thing each time. at least once a day. every day. in the afternoon.


a tabby would stroll from the bushes to stare at the front door. itd come on the porch. lounge in the shade. chase rabbits, birds, and bugs around the yard. lounge some more.


then itd focus. jump. hang on the screen door. and swat the doorbell. upon landing, itd immediately run into the bushes off one side of the porch.


it took a minute for tina to compose herself. mainly because shed laughed so hard at the culprit, that she had wipe the tears off her face.


but shed waited this time for it to happen. of course, there were some birds she kept leaving stale bread for. so that explained what would draw the cat in the first place. so when she heard a mild commotion outside, and spotted the robins scattering into the trees. if she was right, it was going to try the doorbell.


almost. now.


tina opened the door to spot a rather pudgy cat clinging on the mesh like a free climber. a look of shock registering back at her as it froze in confusion.


it hit the floor and immediately scrambled off into the bushes.



and that took care of that.


or so she thought.


it didnt have a collar. and it kept coming into the yard. if only, as the footage affirmed, to hit the doorbell. occasionally, shed catch it in the act and itd run away.


eventually however, after another week. itd just sit there. or jump to hold onto the screen for a few moments before walking away.


after two weeks, tina had to ask it.


hungry?


of course this brought a tiny meow that answered her question. and a rather happy acceptance of the crunchies she dropped out of a bag.


so apparently, she had a cat now."
"[wp] you have a black notebook with red text on the cover, and your friends jokingly call it a deathnote. you wrote a few names in it as a joke. the next day, all written names are dead...","i sat on the bench beside mark while his dog strained against the leash. he never liked that dog. said his daughters insisted on adopting it after their mom passed. said it keeps them busy with something alive. that was how he phrased it. something alive.

he was talking about work again  how his boss wouldnt let him take summer vacation, how his knee hurt more lately, how his oldest refused to pick a college. i nodded at all the right moments, but didnt really speak.

eventually, he stopped midsentence and turned to me.

you good?

i looked up, smiled faintly. yeah. im good.

he watched me a second longer, then faced forward again.

you know, he said, tugging the leash a little as the dog sniffed a bush, its been five years since elsa. maybe its time to start moving forward. for real.

i didnt answer right away. i tilted my head back, let the sky fill my vision. the clouds were dull and unmoving, just a gray sheet stretching over the park. then i looked at him again, gave that same smile.

im trying.

out of nowhere, the dog bolted. some squirrel or leftover sandwich  whatever it was, it took off toward the trees, yanking mark half out of his seat.

stay here, he said quickly. little idiots gonna get hit by a bike.

he jogged off after it. i watched his back shrink between the trees. for a moment, everything went still.

i looked down at the ground. leaves, crushed wrappers, little pieces of paper. then up again  at the sky, the branches, the cold empty space beside me.

how are you, my elsa?"

happy birthday! came the garbled translated voice of someone far less irritating and a bit more fun than most others.

we should pray begged mom. how can god let this happen??

[wp] you and your two younger sisters were adopted by the royal family for unknown reasons. the truth comes out when the true heir is due to be born.,"there has always been a curiosity in the court as to why my two younger sisters and i were adopted by the queen, why my twin sisters at 10 years old were given everything they asked for. my greatest entertainment is listening to the rumors about my sisters and i.

one rumor said that the queen saw the abuse we suffered in the orphanage and took pity on us. another rumor was that we were foreign dignitaries being hidden from war. that one was my favorite. that one allowed me to pretend my real past didnt exist and that i really was royalty and not some street urchin from the slums.

no one but the queen, her brother and i knew the truth as to why the queen needed me and that my doted upon sisters were actually collateral in our agreement. the queen was expecting the thrones first heir and she had an impossible task for me to complete before her son was born that would likely end with my death. what i got in return is the guarantee that my sisters will always be loved, educated and provided for.

when the queen was young, she made a deal with the night spirit to save her brother. a life for a life. she thought that the night spirit would take her life to save her brothers, but it had tricked her. when her brother was healed, the night spirit declared that he wanted her firstborns life. the queen and her brother have kept this secret, attempting to find a way around the deal or a way to kill the spirit to no avail, until the queen learned of me.

she heard of a scrawny, 13 year old homeless girl that killed 3 guards who were trying to hurt her sisters. the truth is, i dont even remember doing it. i just remember blacking out in rage and waking up covered in their blood. the queen believes i have an ancient and powerful magic lying dormant within me. she thinks she can wake it up. she thinks im the last hope to defeat the evil beyond the vale. i cant disappoint her or i let my sisters down so ill withstand every torture she puts me through.

i have endured everything from being held under water until i almost drown, to allowing cut after cut to be made into my skin, to boiling water being poured on my hands. its not that she wants to do this, she says, she just thinks at some point, my self preservation will kick in and my magic will protect me. i endure this for adelaide and rosalie. i would do anything for them.

i think i know what the problem is, the queen whispered triumphantly one morning after weeks of torture. you just need the right motivator, she smiled wickedly as she pulled the curtain and revealed my sisters chained together in the middle of the arena pit. on the far end, a lion roared in anger from being speared and starved. i watched in horror as the gate rose letting the hungry lion free.

i swung my gazed to the queen. you promised. i whisper shrieked. you promised you wouldnt touch them! she held up a finger, a knowing, predatory look marring her features.

ah, little dove, her nickname for me. i hated it. i said i wouldnt touch them if you could do what needed to be done. now is your last chance. she said as she gripped the side of the viewing platform and leaned over to watch with a fire in her eyes. i contemplated shoving her over the edge, but that wouldnt save my sisters.

i made a vow on that platform as i listened to my sisters plead with the gods. when my magic wakes up and i defeat this lion and the spirit beyond the vale, the kingdom will have a different threat to face. in trying to be the hero for my sisters, i let the queen create a villain."
[wp] you are an ancient lich who invented dungeons as a place to get away from all the mortals trying to get your attention. at first it worked great until the adventures arive at the end and think you are the final boss.,"prepare to die, inhuman monster! the adventurer shouts.
i sigh.
i am a lich, of course i am inhuman. i say.
he freezes, as the rest of the group stops in place.
you can talk?
most dungeon monsters are...mindless. one of them says.
because they are my failed projects. i say.
they gasp.


you created the monsters? a young woman asks.
and the dungeon themselves.
quite easy.
a reactive mana crystal with a spell etched on it to draw in and emit mana. i say.
why? they ask.
to escape from you. i say.
heh. so you are a monster! the young man from before shouted.
yeah. and you guys pestered me because of it until i had to run away, and live in this shitty crypt. i say.
they frowned.


yeah.
you all came to me, begging me to teach you how to master magic, how to raise the dead, how to become immortal...
or worse, hunting me like an animal!
or even worse, you started worshipping me! i shouted.
bad idea.
i scared them.
and the warrior rushed at me.
i easily immobilized him.
you are the one who standardized magic? how old are you? the young woman who might be the mage asked.
she is smart.



somewhat? maybe? i just gave out some of my research to a them.
as for how old am i?
i became a lich in the leaf kingdom. i say.
the young woman gasped.
the leaf kingdom? that was an entity in the god wars era!
millions of years ago! she says.
oh yeah...
seeing them idiots fight for belief and faith from worshippers gave me some inspiration. i say.
they said nothing, but stared at me.
i sigh.
leave. the moment you step out of my chambers you will forget this happened.
live well. i say watching them leave.
after they leave, i teleport a chest full of gold, and they celebrate clearing the dungeon.
time to change layout...and maybe i can build several other floors. i think, as i go back to my research on divine runes ."
"[wp] theres an app on your phone that you dont remember installing. you cant delete it, nor open it. its there even after you switch phones. nobody knows what it is, the internet thinks youre lying. years passed then suddenly the app showed a notification.","its been so long that im not sure when it first appeared.

i can barely remember waking up one morning to my girlfriend shouting at me to wake up,

 are you ever going to take our debts seriously?

i groaned.

i was never sure of when our relationship began to turn sour, she always complained about debts but she never applied for jobs and wasted half of my money on clothes she always claimed she needed.

after she left, i got ready for my boring retail job and set out.

while scrolling through folders of games on the bus i noticed a new app.

it had no name and depicted a strange symbol that i couldnt recognise, i tried to open it a few times and was met with the app crashing before it had chance to load.

its probably just one of those apps i heard about on tiktok that steal your data, i thought to myself.

i attempted to delete it but my phone powered off before i got the chance, that was weird since i left my phone on charge overnight.

over the course of the next few days i would find myself staring at it, trying to open it and trying to delete it, it never worked.

so to keep my credentials safe i bought a new phone, not an expensive one by any means and i wasnt able to download anything, just a normal brick phone.

but somehow, it had installed on a phone with no capabilities to download apps.

i started to panic, was it possible this app was following me? 

after some time, i had calmed down and eventually forgotten about it, whatever happens, happens, ill deal with that later.

until a month later, i opened my phone to find a notification.

are you ready to give up your mortality?

was this sick twisted app asking me if i wanted to die?!

i quickly dismissed it and sighed, my life may be in shambles but im not suicidal by any means.

in the evening, as im drifting off to sleep my phone lights up with another notification.

are you willing to give up your mortality to live in a world beyond human comprehension?

i gotta say, that was a bit more intriguing. 

i looked back on my life, i had lost my parents in an accident 3 years ago, i have a sister who went no contact after she became an actress, i have a girlfriend who doesnt respect me.

i opened the notification and pressed yes.

the moment my finger touched the screen, the world started to shift, my room was contorting, blending and separating at the same time, it was comparable to a bad trip

then everything went dark.

i was floating through a sea of darkness, i could just about make out a circle of light in front of me, was this the afterlife?

what did i get myself into

no, not true. thats impossible!

[wp] when your bandit group had decided to rob the royal carriage holding the prince thinking it would be easy. but the knights escorting the carriage seems more concerned with keeping the prince in and not you out. but suddenly the carriage door was flung off its hinges into the air from the inside,"dusk painted the forest in shades of amber and shadow as distant wolf howls echoed through the ancient pines. hidden behind gnarled oak trunks, the bandits crouched in wait, their breath visible in the cooling air.

remember, whispered gareth, the grizzled bandit leader, his voice barely audible above the rustling leaves. wait for the wheel to catch. then we springall at once.

what if the knights fight? hissed a younger bandit, nervously fingering his crossbow.

ten crossbows against six swords? theyll see reason. gareths scarred face twisted into a grin. besides, we only want the prince. quick ransom, quick coin.

the rhythmic clatter of wheels on stone grew louder. through the undergrowth, they glimpsed the royal carriageornate and gilded, pulled by four magnificent destriers. six knights rode alongside, their polished armor catching the last rays of light like mirrors, the royal crest gleaming on their surcoats.

crack.

the front wheel lurched sideways, dropping deep into the concealed pit. the carriage tilted violently, horses rearing and neighing in distress.

now!

bandits erupted from all directionsfront, back, and both flanks. crossbows raised, bolts nocked and aimed at the carriage driver who fought to control the panicked horses.

halt! drop your reins! gareth bellowed.

the knights reacted instantly, steel singing as swords cleared scabbards. shields came up in practiced formation, their visored faces turning rapidly to assess threats from every angle. the knightcaptain, distinguished by the white plume on his helmet, recognized their desperate situation but remained defiant.

you dare threaten the royal carriage? his voice rang with authority despite their predicament. drop your weapons and flee, or face the kings justice!

gareth chuckled, stepping closer with his crossbow trained on the driver. justice? look around you, sir knight. ten bolts against six bladesand all we want is the prince. no blood need be spilled today.

the carriage suddenly rocked violently side to side, as if something massive was thrashing within. the nearest knight, a young man with bright blue eyes visible through his visor, pressed his gauntleted hand against the ornate door.

please remain inside, your highness, he called softly. we will protect you."
"[wp] youre part of a cycle. every hero must beat the horrible and extremely powerful monster king, and then will be cursed to grow in power until they become themselve a monster king. you are determined to find a way to break the cycle.","the monster king laughed at me, rasping as bloody foam dripped from her teeth. she was dying and knew it. i stood where you did, hero, and did the same. the power rush! the thrill of killing! a bit of each monster king lives on in the next  theyre all here  and soon, theyll all be in you! she laughed, her eyes wild. i can die happy knowing you only bought a few years of peace!

her wild laughter stopped at my small smirk. her eyes focused a bit. what... have you done?

wish magic activation phrase a stitch in the timeline saves nine. i intoned softly. it had taken years, hundreds of searches into dungeons and ruins  and hours of picking through tattered scroll fragments, but i finally learned the potent magic required to summon a being capable of granting wishes and not inclined to twist the magic in a devasting way. so long as one paid the price.

i had made an offer to the otherworldly being that intrigued it  something so common and simple, yet as foreign to it as the being was to myself. i offered it a mortal experience. a full year and a day of travel, feasts, music, dancing, singing, shopping, anything it wanted. anywhere in the world that i could take it  fishing for great kraken clam in the northern willwisp sea? done. sampling the finest wines in the desert markets of kiniryuf while sitting atop the fabled opal goddess statue? certainly. playing fetch with a random stray draggog in the farmlands? not a problem. a mortal vessel had been made for them to inhabit to fully experience things as a mortal  heat, cold, pain, taste.

it was an offer accepted readily for the wish i asked. long had such beings discussed what our realm must be like for us, without the ability to [a word tasting of blue and smelling like the sound of raindrops hitting cobblestone].

and now that wish had been activated. illusory doors stood before me as time slowed to a crawl.

the first opened, and i saw myself casting a spell to turn the current monster king into an object and simply banishing the object to the moon. i had wondered if such a thing would work. the spell keeping the monster king an item wore off, and her wounds had healed. it seems she was unable to breathe, however, and died within the hour. the door closed as a new hero strode forth to kill the monster king i had become.

the second door opened, and within i saw myself sadly shake my head and cauterize the kings wounds. a healing potion was shoved down her throat, one laced with a paralytic. necessary for the next step, i knew. her limbs were removed cleanly and carefully seared shut before caps of silver plated iron were screwed into the stumps to stop regeneration. a series of runes were tattooed on her skin to prevent magic use, then i encased everything below her neck in stone. i created golems to attend to her needs. the view shifted and indicated that many years had passed. the king remained the same, and as a figure entered the room, a hood pulled back to reveal a withered shell. my own face stretched over the skeleton, aged well past mortal lifespan and unable to die. that door shut as that version of me went to kill the monster king properly.

the third door opened and merely showed me the image of a breaking chain before closing.

the doors vanished. i had wished to see the outcome of the three methods i had thought of to break the cycle when i spoke the activation.

wary eyes regarded me, even as the light in them dimmed. i win. i whispered. i stabbed her in the heart to be certain. and as i felt the madness of the monster king enter me, i smiled, and turned the blade on myself.

the only way to break the cycle was to use the same hero to kill the monster king twice."

from outside the carriage, steps out...what is that?  
a young...man? 3 meters tall, muscles over muscles shining, and straining against the monk robe he was wearing.

the closest brothers of mine to the carriage fainted, blood flowing from their ears.  
wwho are you? i ask.  
ah, bandit leader almsgiver, this poor monk is prince abath, the one you wanted to kidnap, and rob of his belongings. he smiles.  
i freeze.

  
the other bandits ran towards me, ready to stand against that...thing.  
its a misunderstanding. i smile.  
he shakes his head...and created shockwaves that threaten to blow us away.  
nay, almsgiver.  
buddhas all merciful and had us meet here.  
you have fate with buddhism, may you lay down thy butcher knife, and don the kasaya? he gently says.  
i shiver.  
with who the hell did we mess?

  
i am thankful for the offer, but i think we arent suited for this honor, and blessing.  
we shall let you continue your journey, prince abath. i say, gesturing the other bandits to slowly leave.  
before i could also turn away, a hand was on my shoulder, and i was kneedeep into the dry, rockhard ground.  
nonsense, almsgiver!  
buddhas teaching are for everyone! butcher, and scholar, warrior and thief!

carriage that at some point, was started to be repaired by the knights.  
i was thrown inside as a sack, and the prince boarded, after giving an instruction not to be disturbed by anyone to the knights.

  
i watched this walking mountain, stare at me seriously.  
i... i started.

i freeze, and take out some jerky, and cheap snake wine.  
he eats it as if it is celestial manna.

"[wp] the massive ogre grins down at you. game is simple you hit me. then i hit you. you knock me down, you win. i knock you down, i win. you win, you go through the door. i win, you leave the dungeon and go home.","it was a mass of muscle and fat. the ogre was the size of two men atop each other, and near equally wide. not too dissimilar from its fellow ogres in build, despite being a bit larger. yet there were two key differences.

first, it had actual armour. not quite plate armour, but the slabs of metal strapped to its body were a close imitation. hard leather beneath covered the gaps, as it held a massive club in one hand.

the other difference was its eyes. they held intelligence. it wasnt the simple creature filled with thoughts of food and sleep. it was making plans. it was every bit as smart as i was fundamentally, which was... concerning. especially when it grinned, pointing at me. new adventurer? weak, no point in smashing. but play fun game instead.

i took a moment to steel myself. the halberd in my grip gave me some comfort. i had fought with it many times before, and always come out on top. this surely would be no different. but its statement made me pause, before i replied. what game?

its grin widened further. game is simple you hit me. then i hit you. you knock me down, you win. i knock you down, i win. you win, you go through the door. i win, you leave the dungeon and go home.

go home? those two words ignited a blaze in my chest. i had no home anymore. it was why i was doing this. but a chance to hit it without repercussions? i would take it. i would take it and kill this ogre in one shot. i had to get past. i had to get deeper.

i gave it a nod, sinking down into a fighting crouch. fine. i accept.

it gave a laugh, planting its club on the ground. go ahead. your turn.

i focused, pouring power into my halberd and stance. its edge glinted with orange light, force pulling into is cutting edge. it would hit like an avalanche, i was sure. it would slice through that cheap metal, and end this arrogant orders life.

knowing it was at its crescendo, i gave a cry, sweeping it forwards with every drop of my strength. it was a perfect, textbook attack. it would work. it had to.

but it didnt. i felt it connect, shock feeding into my arms. it was like hitting a mountain, unyielding stone beneath my blade. the ogre watched me, unmoved by my attack. but it didnt laugh. it gave me a nod, adjusting its grip on its club. good hit. but now its my turn.

i watched it swing, almost lazily. yet i could dodge the tree trunk swinging at me. numbing arms struggled to move my weapon, as i plunged the spike into the ground between me and its attack. i barely braced, before it hit.

pain. pain was the first thing i realised, before i felt a weightless feeling. yet it was followed moments later by a new impact, as i slammed into the ground. the air was knocked from my lungs, as my barely healed ribs cracked again.

the ogre looked down at me, as i felt my vision start to fade from the pain. no. i couldnt have lost. i just couldnt....

wake up!

something warm splashed into my face. it was soothing, spreading sweet relief into my chest. i sucked in a painless breath, eyes widening as i saw the ogre over me. a potion vial looked tiny in its grip, as it shook out the last few drops onto me.

breaking into coughs, i stared up at it. wwhat?!

its rough voice had a concerned edge, as its hand felt my chest. no more breaks. good. what do you think you were doing, challenging this place in that state?! if i hadnt pulled my blow, id be hauling your corpse back to the academy. idiot!

i blinked, stunned. the ogre... it was speaking in full sentences? proper sentences? and taking care of me?

i watched as it picked me up, tucking me under its arm. right, youre safe now, but im taking you back, and having a stern word with reedus. if he is letting students in your state attempt my training dungeon, i well need to have words."

i raised an eyebrow. what makes you think i know youre secret identity? id definitely have taken you out in your sleep if i had that information.


yeah, youve got to say that. but im not stupid. i can see what youre doing. me and you, we fight. we destroy a lot of property, but somehow the dark phantom never does more damage than gerald price the trust fund baby can generously repair as a service to the city. you only ever risk civilians when im conveniently nearby to foil your evil plans. and a suspiciously large number of even those were trained stuntmen who just happened to be visiting for no reason they cared to mention, and happened to retire rich out of nowhere after.


all the other villains are terrified of you. so they mostly stay away. a few get bold and try to butt in on occasion, but no villain could allow another to trespass on his turf, so you deal with them swiftly, if i dont get to them first. 


so its just me and you. duking it out every couple weeks. never quite taking advantage of each others weaknesses. injuries well within our respective tolerances. always putting on a show. the giant moon laser was a nice touch  but dont think i didnt catch that you embellized from it to fund a childrens hospital. big impressive schemes that fail at the last second, or succeed but dont actually hurt much. and everyone else stays away. best partner ive never had. so what do you say?


i sighed. alright james, you got me. two conditions though. im gonna kidnap myself next tuesday. itd be suspicious if the dark phantom never went after gerald. i need you to help with the illusion by rescuing me from myself. standard fight, i bring out that rock you pretend to be allergic to, you go all weak, but conveniently escape it at the last second, i run down a hole, etc etc, then you rescue me from the underground cell. also, the kids at that childrens hospital would really appreciate a visit from captain awesome  would you mind dropping by?


wait, james asked, you knew i was pretending with the pyrite? 


obviously, im not stupid either. what kind of hero is allergic to a rock? come on. i stuck out my hand. so do we have a deal? 


james grasped my hand and shook it. deal. also, captain awesome is a stupid name, so at some point he should lose a fight to you and retire. raise your notoriety even further. then you can help me come up with something less stupid for the next hero identity.

why would you people worship a deity of war crimes? he demanded to know, even as his crusaders thrust their swords towards these heretics. what good god would desire the blood of his people? stop this nonsense. convert to obeying the tenets of my one true god, and you shall receive salvation. not by this futile ritual youre trying to do.

common misconception, the old head priest coughed out blood, while clutching a stab wound at his side. adan does not cause war crimes. he punishes those who commit them. speaking of which...

the other priests had stood in a circle and raised their hands into the skies. singing songs of praise to their god. even as brahms men cut them down swiftly, even as they did not resist, they never stopped singing.

the grounds shook and threw the crusaders off balance. one of his men shouted about the mountains rumbling. rising. from the skies turned crimson, golden eyes sprayed across the horizon.

may adan punish you for your crimes against us, the head priest sputtered before he collapsed into a heap.

we must defend ourselves against the demons these heretics have conjured! brahm roared, raising his weapon. who stands with me?

none do. all his men dropped their weapons and fled before what they now believed was a real god. not the invisible god they had been taught about in church. this one spanned across the skies and mountains, so large they could not see the entirety of its being as a massive hand came crashing through the temple.

brahm stood his ground. believing his god would aid him in this time of his greatest need. to overcome the biggest battle against a terrible demon.

"[wp] for years there was only a single dragon in the world. now, there are way too many of them...","she slumbered. far beneath the rising countries above, she resided in a domain belonging solely to her. a cavern lined with molten rock, heat choking to those unprepared. the trail was twisting and treacherous, making all but the bravest or foolhardy turn around.

yet those who passed it would find her home. a pile of treasures, looted from dozens of long dead civilisations. much was gold, yet gemstones and works of art were included within. the fortunes she held would cripple a country should they be spent poorly, or save uncountable masses if spent wisely. yet she chose to sleep on it instead, supporting her shockingly small form.

indeed, the beast of legends was still larger than a human. but she was small enough to only just fill a decent sized room herself. her purple scales gleamed atop her hoard, amethysts looking to be fallen scales littering around her.

geleyhru huffed, rising from her dreams. a pale pink eye opened, gazing down at the entrance to her lair. a pair of elves stared up at her, wearing lightweight white robes sewn with flames. one bowed his head, as the other stayed in the entryway. wise one, i return to enact our pledge.

the dragon huffed, unmoving as her voice echoed around her. your pledge is foolish, as i have said. yet i shall not stop you. take my blood, and use it in your work. yet i hope it shall fail.

the elf raised his head, watching a small vial filled with crimson fly towards him. his hands reached out almost reverently, cradling it to his chest the moment he grasped it. i shall not, great one. you shall not be alone much longer.

she watched him go, saying nothing to his back. yet she knew what would come from this. the damage caused, the lives lost. but it was not hers to stop. the fates were cruel in this way. even if she refused to help, they would find another way. the decision couldnt be stopped.



it was no visitor that told her of the outcome. instead ot was a message, appearing from midair before her. geleyhru opened her eye, staying where she was as the letter rose to her. her pupil narrowed to focus on it, as smoke curled from her nostrils.

lady of scales,

your kin are here, and they are burning our cities. slaughtering our people. we ask you to protect us, as you swore in the draconic accords.

chamber of unity.

it was short, but it didnt need to be long. she huffed, finally rising from her bed of gold. the pair of elves had done it, creating eggs from her blood. the specifics didnt matter to her, all that did was the result.

they were young. weak but numerous. she could easily defeat them, as belittled her title as the last dragon. it was her battle to lose, and the reason she went this path.

if she hadnt, then the fates would have allowed them to slip through from other worlds."
"[wp]you settled in this village on a whim. you just liked the view. now, nearly 600 years later, you are revered as the protective deity despite not doing anything really to deserve it. you merely helped in disasters to not have a graveyard in your front yard.","i had a nice place. neither big or small, but placed atop the cliff overlooking the sea. i would wake up every day to the smell of sea air, something that had never grown old over the centuries. it made me feel alive.

the modest garden i tended to seemed to like it as well. i had gained a green thumb over my time here it seemed, or maybe it was the proximity to the ocean winds. either way, whatever i grew really took root, becoming larger than anything i had really noticed before. and delicious! i generally had more than i needed, so i would end up going into the village.

the thought made me slump a little. i liked the place, i really did. they had the most wonderful fish, always freshly caught, and all the amenities i could hope for. in fact, with the blacksmith, tanner and apocethary, they were in an even better position than many towns i had passed by on my travels. with merchants stopping by regularly as well, it was perfect.

the only problem was the people. they were splendid people, absolutely wonderful. unfortunately, they were a little too nice to me. they had this idea that i was a protector, a local god of sorts. it made them bow and scrape to me. it was only when i insisted that they trade with me that i actually got to receive and spend money. otherwise they would give me everything i wanted, for free.

i didnt really get it. i had helped, sure, but no more than anyone else. when the sea decided to flood the village, i helped pull people out. i saved some possessions, as others retrieved the reat. i helped rebuild the few buildings that collapsed. when raiders came i fought back, knowing that they couldnt kill me.

i was only doing what anyone would. it was the right thing to do, and i didnt really want to wake up to find i was living next to a graveyard. but still they insisted on worshippng me.

i disliked it. i had left home because of this sort of thing. but it was a bit different here. back home, mother forced them to worship. forced us to appear as greater than we were. but here, it was freely given. i didnt like it, but i wouldnt argue it.

if it made them feel better, then i would let it carry on. i would help out, as the right thing to do. but i hoped they wouldnt take it too far. i had no desire to be worshipped, especially widely spread.

that, and i didnt want my family to hear about it. if mother found out where i was...

i would be next to a graveyard."
[wp] a priest thought it would be funny to bless the ocean to make it all holy water. imagine the horror on his face when countless vampires emerged from the now holy ocean engulfed in flames.,"also, depends how the blessing works, and how strong it remains after changing from water to vapors, and moisture, and so on.

like, if it remains 100 as strong as in water form...we could all drink blessed water, and be immune to vampires, as out blood, and sweat would be by proxy blessed."
"[wp] a hero and a villain are out on a date, but they dont recognize each other as such when outside of their costumes. their sidekicks have followed them and are now working together to make sure that the date goes well.","indy prepped in the restaurant bathroom. his tuxedo was freshly pressedhe kept at least four ready to go at any one timeand his hair delicately coiffed. 

he appraised himself in the mirror. tall, neat, clean. the bulge of the gun attached to his hip was barely noticeable beneath the suit jacket. indy tightened his tie before heading back out to the dining room. 

a man played piano in the corner his fingers glided softly over the keys, filling the room with a mellifluous harmony. 

indy had spent the afternoon talking to the man, asking him about his job, if he liked it, what did it pay. he was shocked to find the piano player was paid pennies for performances, though he was delighted by his own thoughts capacity for onthespot alliteration. 

indy learned that the piano player didnt play for the couples dining together, but with them, even if they didnt already know it. when their conversation became animated, he would play something more lively. when there was awkwardness between themor if a conversation was getting boringhe would try to play something familiar, popular. dont stop believing worked 99 of the time. 

he had learned to read lips as well, to look out for words like death, sorry, oh no, and stock market. 

why stock market? indy had asked. 

if youre on a date and talking about the stock market, it is not going well, the piano man explained. 



dakota entered the restaurant for the second time that day, but this time she was dressed differently and didnt need to hide under tables waiting for the air conditioning to turn on. 

she wore a green dress with boots, white socks, and a denim jacket she found at the thrift store and could not leave behind. someone had embroidered a rainbow butterfly on the back. she wouldnt be able to sleep if shed left it behind. 

she spotted a tall man in a bowtie wearing a poorly concealed gun on his hip. hers was stashed securely in her clutch where no one would suspect a thing. 

the man looked her up and down, judging her outfit. dakota did the same to him, some sort of retaliatory assessment an affirmative nod with wide, examining eyes. then he started walking over. he had a strange, intimidating gait that was somehow familiar. 

you must be ms. dakota foible? he said the statement in questions form. 

must be, she agreed before extending her hand toward him. and you are? 

indy vaillancourt, he took her hand and held it firmly. 

i...i have so many questions for you. she was stunned. vaillancourt? what a cool name."
"[wp] i dont know how you got here, little girl, but you need to leave. were hunting for a very dangerous monster.  i know. me.","she isnt special. mostly ordinary except the fact that she managed to make her way here  out of all places and night. however she, most definitely, isnt who im after. the contrast between her and who, or what, im after is far to great. and to hear her say she is... it. that, that, is laughable. so why does the sound get stuck in my through like a chewing gum stuck to a chair?

please dont laugh. she said. 

her voice soothe my heart beat but doesnt wear off the uneasiness, which i feel. and it is similar to the rhythmatic and steady currents of a calm ocean but carries the childishness of the person it belongs to.

i wouldnt dear. i told her, crouching down and panting my hands.

she only smiled. but it wasnt the sweet one of a small child. it was familar because i had seen it before. 

it was a smile of the monster."
