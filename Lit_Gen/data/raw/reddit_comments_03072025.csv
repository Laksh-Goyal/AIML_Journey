1lqha2t,n12vob3,"Okay, I rose from a peasant girl, to a Duchess, and lo and behold, the Church has named me villainess.  
Why?  
I don't know, a prophecy or something said that I shall be the evil that will be defeated by the Chosen Hero, and a kingdom of peace, and unity shall be built.  
I shrugged it off, and developed my Duchy.  
It annoyed the kingdom I was in to no-end, and soon they waged war on me.  
I won, and I started to realize why I was called a villainess.  
I was going against the norms, upsetting the balance.

  
Years pass, and the world awaits the hero.  
I slowly fight back, and end up conquering the whole kingdom I was in.  
The commoners cheer for me.  
I try to spread the wealth as well as I can, without chasing away the merchants, and nobles.  
I start schools for everyone, even peasants, hoping that some talents are hidden away in far-away villages.  
I also try to make as many Physician offices as possible, to ensure my people are healthy.  
With my initiatives, and laws, more and more people want to join my kingdom.  
Watching myriad races mingle in my lands, I sigh.  
""Isn't this the promised kingdom that the Hero shall create?"" I mutter, but I go back to my business.

  
Decades pass, and I am an Empress.  
Ministers, and scholars abound, and so do mages, and knights that were unearthed by the schools established in remote areas.  
They are especially loyal to me.  
The prophecy still exists, and the Church still claims I am evil, I am the villainess.  
They even start rallying armies against me.  
Problem is...  
They barely can find allies.  
Why?  
Because I want the best for my people, so I acted in their interest.

  
I married the 2nd Prince of a neighboring Empire, as my husband, and have 2 more consorts from a beast kingdom, and the elven tribe union.  
Basically, I made marriage alliances with the territories surrounding my Empire.  
The Church would have to go through their lands, to arrive at mine...which they can't, because those allies won't allow them.  
The rumor mill is turned up to the max by them, but nobody believes them.  
I have free trade with all the kingdoms, and races, even the Underground ones, and have visited personally all of them for diplomatic reasons.  
I might be a villain, in the sense that soon...the world will be changed forever by my measures, and approach to leadership.  
But it is a role I happily assume, and from what I see...a role that people accept.  
If the Hero comes or not, I don't care, because I already left my name in the history of the world, and the changes that I have started, can't be stopped anymore.",113
1lq4q3k,n1003np,"I had worked my way up the chain, putting in my time first as a common thug to then eventually breaking out on my own with a costume and a gimmick.  Getting my first hero nemesis had been a major step, but he already had a full gallery of villains so I had been relegated to minor footnote at best.  It took over a year of painstaking research until I made the most important discovery of all: his secret identity and all that it entails.  I knew his address, the location of his hidden base, where he worked while posing as a civilian, everything!  But, according to the Code of Capes and Cowls, I wasn't allowed to directly act upon that information to attack him.

But, since he worked for the city as a parking enforcement officer (POE), or in common terms, a meter maid, there was nothing that could stop me from making his job frustrating.  So, I spent some time to learn city parking bylaws and the terms of his employment.  I didn't want to do any too overt, but I found a ton of grey area that I could exploit for my own amusement.  It took a couple of small robberies to get the funds together I needed to put my plans into action.

I started with contracting Walt the Wireless Wizard to build a device that I could use to scramble information used by the PEO's to write up tickets.   They used this handheld computer and would type in things like license plates and such, but did you know that if the information isn't correct, the ticket is invalid?  And that PEOs needed to write a certain quota of valid tickets per month and every wrong ticket counted against their total?  You can see where this was headed.  After about two months, my nemesis wasn't the star performer that he had been previously.  He went from first to dead last.  I could hardly contain my joy when reading the reprimand reports that were filed against him.  Did I stop there?  Oh no, I was just getting started.

The tires on the PEO's cars are easy to tamper with.  A simple twist of the valve stem and you have a slow leak, something that really ruins a lunch break. Another contract with Walt gave me a remote way to disable the electrical system of the car, something I could quickly reverse with the flick of a switch.  The countless hours he spent in the summer heat with a dead car, only for it to start when a supervisor arrived made his expression all the sweeter to behold. Eventually, I set up relays throughout the city so that I could track him and torment him from the comfort of my couch at home.

I'm not really sure of my endgame for this.  Should I confront him at some point during a battle and drop hints that his work issues are my fault? I have noticed that he seems much more stressed when I encounter him in costume.  I don't want to reach out to a villain lawyer in case what I'm doing is technically breaking the code, but I'm not sure how to go about taking credit for my work.  Also, his last meltdown after getting a subpar review at work might be a sign he won't find this whole situation as funny as I do.",242
1lq4q3k,n11drei,"KRRRRT. KRRRRT. 

Blake’s eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling.

KRRRRT. KRRRRRRRRRRT. KRRRRRRRRRRT.

It just wasn’t fair. 

Just today, Blake had a bank robbery, a convenience store robbery, and a school shooting. All three with no casualties! 

Did he not deserve his rest?! Clearly Voltage Man needs his sleep!

KRRRRT. KRRRRT.

It was a jackhammer. 

Superheroes don't take risks that can hurt their families. So, a time came when Blake, or Voltage Man as he is known on Tiktok,  needed to set up a few safe houses. He did it in lower income neighborhoods. And, sometimes after a tough night you just don't want to fly home. They didn't need to be more than a soft bed and a small workshop. He could always order the food he was accustomed to from an app when he tipped enough. 

But after trying to go to sleep hours ago, a water main broke right outside his safehouse. It was severe enough that the city had to deploy repairmen immediately.

And, with all these workmen around, there was no way he’d be able to power up his Voltage Man suit, let alone leave with it without compromising his safehouse.

So, Valor City’s hardest working superhero was not going to get a good night's sleep tonight. 

Exasperated, Blake pulled himself out of bed, stepped into some slippers.

The workshop might be quieter. It was inside the lead-plated basement he had installed. Perhaps it would be enough to block the noise.

Not wanting to move the mattress by himself, Blake grabbed his pillow and blankets. a few steps to the door a few steps down the stairs a few steps to the secure door. Blake then tilted two picture frames, which revealed the keypad.

Groggily, Voltage Man slowly entered the keycode to his lair. 

2-66-7-44-777-2-222-444-7-33

Blake was old enough to remember flip phone texting. To him, the numbers spelled “Anthracite”. Normal people would Google that word and find it’s a type of coal. 

In Valor City, Anthracite was a name that invoked fear. 

She was 6’4” with a body to die for. She wore the same shade of black as her heart, and could put out enough heat to melt a three-foot-thick solid steel bank vault in six seconds. Everyone had seen the video, and the thousands of hours of content it inspired.

And Blake and Anthracite had a history. For a time, between two sheets, he called her “My blazing star”.

And, with his superintelligent intellect, Voltage Man had no problem remembering a password that long. 

“Swvvvvvt”… the hidden door made as it opened. Overheat lights illuminated the room as he took his first step in. 

There wasn’t a soft place in the shop to rest, so Blake just tossed the sheet down as he folded the blanket into a makeshift bedroll. He placed the pillow at the top, and grabbed the sheet over himself as he lay down.

“Close door, lights off,” he said. 

The room darkened instantly as the door slid back into its position. After a few seconds of wriggling to get comfortable, Blake closed his eyes.

Krrrrt. Krrrrt. Krrrrt. Krrrrt.

Blake sighed in defeat. Lead shielding didn’t make this armored bunker turned supply station soundproof. Hopelessly, he tried to fold the slack in his blanket to hold it over his ears. It wasn’t enough.

So, he was condemned to try to quiet his restless mind without silence. 

The aforementioned try lasted about 8 seconds.

Krrrrt. Krrrrt.

A pause, then another: Krrrrt. Krrrrt.

Another pause, then longer ones: Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt.

The pauses were exactly as long as each noise, and each noise was a short one for one count, or a long one for two counts.

Morse code worked like that.

Blake didn’t want to hear it. He tried to toss the idea, that the workmen are operating a jackhammer in perfect time, from his mind. 

But the city had a fleet of robotic jackhammers. They had them because Voltage Man made and donated a dozen of them to help with city maintenance. He had found some free time, and hey, “safe streets” meant “no potholes” as much as it meant “no crime”. 

“Lights on, open a word processor,” Blake said, getting up. 

The holoscreen fired up in the center of the room as Blake cleared his head, hoping the message was short and repeating. It had to be, right? It had been going on for hours now.

After a short while, there was a few seconds of silence before the jackhammer started up again. 

Krrrrt. Krrrrt. Short pause.

“India,” Blake said, as the letter appeared on the holoscreen.

Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt. Short pause.

“Kilo.”

Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrt. Short pause.

“November.”

And, one letter at a time, Blake decoded the message. 

He was certain it was Morse code. The first 5 characters spelled “IKNOW”.

He was at maximum readiness when one part spelled “VOLTAGE”. 

He was ready to fight at “SKULL”.

He was dying to hear what was next after “SIGNED”.

And, he was completely and utterly petrified by the five seconds of silence after “STAR”

Voltage Man’s mind kicked into overdrive. How could she know where any of his safehouses are, or even that they existed? How could she have detected him on the way here? How could she hack the maintenance robots to work in time with Morse code messages? Even if she could, how would she even get access?

As a thousand other questions rushed through his mind, Blake laid down on the floor.  

Across the room, the completed message was still on the holoscreen. It read:

“I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE VOLTAGE MAN REMEMBER I CAN CRUSH YOUR SKULL BETWEEN MY THIGHS SIGNED YOUR BLAZING STAR”

There was no doubt about it now. One question certainly wasn’t rushing through Voltage Man’s head as he laid there on the hard floor.

Had she forgiven him? Clearly not. 

Krrrrt. Krrrrt. The message had recycled itself and started over.

Blake’s eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling.

Krrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt.

It just wasn’t fair.",75

1lqiioo,n1383dj,"""Who is this?""

My parents look up from their tea at my rude interruption, only to jump as I toss a stack of photographs onto the table between them. Each picture slides like a crumpled autumn leaf as they tentatively begin to pick through them.

""Tell me I'm not crazy. What is this boy doing in our pictures?""

Their mouths are locked tight, and my frustration builds. I jab my finger at one photo that shows me and the mystery boy, frozen in the air together above the surface of the lake. Our smiles of joy perfectly matched in summer ecstasy the moment before we plunge into water.

""Who is he?""

Finally my mother speaks. ""His family lived next door. Back in our first house. You went to school together. You did everything together. He was almost your brother.""

I scoff. ""And I can't remember him? Are you lying?""

""We wouldn't."" My father leans forward, a note of warning in his voice. ""Not about this. We had to put the photos away after we moved. For your own good.""

""I didn't want to,"" Mother says. ""I thought you'd heal better if you could process it.""

""It didn't work. The therapist said you'd disassociated from him. Blocked it all out. Reminders would only make it harder.""

From one to the other, they wear expressions of shame and exhaustion. I'm standing on a precipice. All I want and all I fear are yawning in the pit below my feet. I want to pull back, and I want to plunge in. Then Father speaks again.

""It was spring. You both wanted to have the first swim of the year early. We let you go. Damn us for it. He... I don't know what happened. We came when we heard you screaming. You were on the shore, he was lying next to you, not moving, not breathing.""

Mother rubs my shoulder. I hardly feel it. I can see him now. His face fills my vision, the terror in his eyes as he vanishes below the murky surface. The terror gnawing at my chest as he slips away from me.

""You were young. It wasn't your fault. Nobody could've predicted it would happen.""

He did. There was worry in his face, long before he started struggling. But always my voice was there. Pushing. *A little further. A little further.*

Always a little further. Until it was too much.",14
1lq59cp,n10ptew,"I had a nice place. Neither big or small, but placed atop the cliff overlooking the sea. I would wake up every day to the smell of sea air, something that had never grown old over the centuries. It made me feel alive.

The modest garden I tended to seemed to like it as well. I had gained a green thumb over my time here it seemed, or maybe it was the proximity to the ocean winds. Either way, whatever I grew really took root, becoming larger than anything I had really noticed before. And delicious! I generally had more than I needed, so I would end up going into the village.

The thought made me slump a little. I liked the place, I really did. They had the most wonderful fish, always freshly caught, and all the amenities I could hope for. In fact, with the blacksmith, tanner and apocethary, they were in an even better position than many towns I had passed by on my travels. With merchants stopping by regularly as well, it was perfect.

The only problem was the people. They were splendid people, absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, they were a little too nice to me. They had this idea that I was a protector, a local god of sorts. It made them bow and scrape to me. It was only when I insisted that they trade with me that I actually got to receive and spend money. Otherwise they would give me everything I wanted, for free.

I didn't really get it. I had helped, sure, but no more than anyone else. When the sea decided to flood the village, I helped pull people out. I saved some possessions, as others retrieved the reat. I helped rebuild the few buildings that collapsed. When raiders came I fought back, knowing that they couldn't kill me.

I was only doing what anyone would. It was the right thing to do, and I didn't really want to wake up to find I was living next to a graveyard. But still they insisted on worshippng me.

I disliked it. I had left home because of this sort of thing. But it was a bit different here. Back home, Mother forced them to worship. Forced us to appear as greater than we were. But here, it was freely given. I didn't like it, but I wouldn't argue it.

If it made them feel better, then I would let it carry on. I would help out, as the right thing to do. But I hoped they wouldn't take it too far. I had no desire to be worshipped, especially widely spread.

That, and I didn't want my family to hear about it. If Mother found out where I was...

I would be next to a graveyard.",84
1lq59cp,n112sm9,"When I arrived in the valley, there had been a small, quaint gathering of buildings, nothing too fancy, and maybe a handful of families trying to make of go of starting a new community.  I don't know why they had left their former homes, and honestly I didn't care to know.  I had began my cultivating journey many centuries before deciding I needed a stable place to call my home, my peaceful sanctuary, and this place had everything I needed.

I had built my home at the top of the valley, mainly for the spectacular view of the ocean framed by the lush forest of the hills.  The breeze in the morning and evening were decent, and the quality of game nearby satisfied my needs.  There was even a modest stream that ran beside my house for easy access to fresh water.  I had planted a garden that repaid my efforts tenfold.  It was, in a single word, perfect.

I didn't initiate contact of any sort with the people living below for over a decade.  They stumbled upon my compound by accident, while hunting in the forest I assume, and at first there was a mild misunderstanding.  Despite my advanced age, my body was still firm and strong, and disarming the hapless fools took no effort.  After we came to an agreement, mainly them leaving me alone, I was back to cultivating and strengthening my connection to the universe.  I barely noticed the passage of time, marking it mainly by the occasional visitor bearing gifts from the growing village.

There were a few times I made my way to their modest civilization, usually to buy something I desired.  I was surprised how they were thriving, an inn with decent ale and a competent blacksmith. I made a point of visiting every decade or two to keep abreast of the world in general.  Once, a young boy asked me to save someone, maybe a brother or father, from bandits in the area.  Took less than an afternoon to clear the whole thing up and the remaining bandits relocated themselves very far away.

Now, it's the dawn of my sixth century in the valley. Sure, I might have missed my usual visits now and then, and there was that seventy year gap a while back, but I was pretty sure they still knew of me.  On my most recent visit, something I had put off until I ran out of seedlings for my garden, I discovered something that I found alarming.  In the center of the town, which was much larger than I remembered, with multiple streets and large, numerous buildings, they had erected a statue that resembled me.  As I listened to the townsfolk, I was apparently regarded as a protector deity of the valley and my alleged reputation had kept others from trying to attack or take over.  I'm not sure how this story has grown to such proportions. In all honesty, I have only stepped away from my diligent studies when the occasional disaster has interrupted my peaceful meditations. I don't want these people to perish, less from my desire to be part of their community and more from the painful experience that mass death has a way of creating annoying spirits that would force me to find a less haunted sanctuary.",32
1lq59cp,n12ikex,"He arrived on a quiet night, beneath a fine, whispering rain, when even the wind seemed to murmur ancient secrets. His ship left barely a trace. It landed gently between dark hills, as if the planet itself had accepted it in silence.

Marcione did not come as a conqueror. He carried no flag, no mission of conquest or diplomacy. He came with no weapons, only exhaustion. His homeworld had crumbled under cyclical wars, endless disputes over depleted matter, over dead ideologies and senseless pride. He fled. He flew without destination, guided only by the desperate hope of finding a place where he could breathe without fear.

And there, in that forgotten curve of the world, he found the village. Simple houses. Muddy roads. Clothes fluttering on lines. And a quiet kind of pain lingering in the air hunger, illness, fear of wolves and soldiers. Marcione looked at it all and, strangely, he wept. His eyes, too blue to pass as human, turned brown. His skin, once like liquid silver, took on the color of damp earth. His body shifted slowly, adapting to the dominant species’ genetic standard. It was an ancient technology of his race, a survival mechanism. He didn’t use it to hide. He used it to belong.

For years, he was just “the outsider.” He showed up with seeds that sprouted even in dry soil. He repaired tools with a touch. He healed fevers with soft glows no one could explain. He never asked for anything in return, only silence. The elders said he spoke little but watched everything, and when he looked at you, it was as if he saw things no one else could.

Marcione smiled with his eyes. Always calm. Always kind. He learned the children’s names. He learned the rhythm of the seasons. He loved afternoons that smelled of woodsmoke. The sound of water hitting stone. The laughter of a couple harvesting grapes. One day, he realized he loved humans for their fragility, for their strength, for how they kept trying, even when everything hurt.

And so he protected them. He repelled beasts with pulses of sound too deep to hear. He prevented diseases with soft vapors released into the night. When armed men came to take the village, he raised an invisible wall of light, and the soldiers fled, convinced they were cursed. The people began calling him a spirit, an angel, the old guardian of the hill. Each generation retold the story differently. No one knew he came from a dead world. That beneath his human skin, living circuits pulsed. That at night, he still dreamed of stars that no longer existed.

Marcione never corrected them. He simply kept watching over them. And every time someone said “thank you,” he only gave a slight nod, smiling quietly. Because that was exactly what he had been searching for all along.
Peace. Not in the world. But within himself.",18

It's just that I've been here, and my friends have been here, in some pretty harrowing conditions. At the end of the dya, we all walk back out. But those who get caught with the monsters on the frontlines don't get this sort of stuff. Are we that much more valuable than them?""

He'd stopped scribbling, seemingly lost in thought. But because of what I said. He flipped over the paperm and another, then traced his finger on a line. What is he doing?

""Rose Firelight is your...cousin, right?""

""She is.""

""And your common grandmother was Effy Starborn, yes?""

""Eh, yeah.""

""I see."" He flips the papers back and puts the clipboard facedown on a table next to him. ""You're right to be curious. I've worked here quite some time, and I share your curiousity. It's appreciated, actually. So many like you just roll in, get fixed up and go back out again without a single thought expended on what goes on behind the scenes, the efforts undertaken to make sure you get to see tomorrow, and us alongside you. That said, I recommend getting some audiotherapy sessions. I want to rule out that your last encounter has any major sideffects. Azreon was the most significant enemy you've faced in your time with us.""

My eye twitches as that demon's name gets mentioned.

""I don't think I need audiotherapy, I need to get out there and get him before what happened to me happens to someone else.""

He throws his hands up in apparent surrender.

""I can assure you, that mentality is very much what we're looking for. I'm glad to hear you say it. Though I also do hope that you understand that the best way to do that is to make sure that you're not too affected by your encounter with him.""

""I'm _not_ affected.""

He raises an eyebrow at me. I barely even raised my voice.

""Look, if you don't I'm going to have to tel your team captain, and then they're going to be pushing you for it, and then if you don't want to, there will be consequences, escalations. No one wants that. Play along, you'll be out on the field in no time. It's just a box to check on the form for your full release.""

""Can't you just check and it and let me go?""

""Not without risking my job. Are you apprehensive of audiotherapy?""

""It gives me headaches.""

""That is a known side effect with some people with your disposition, but that's good to know. How about this, you get the audiotherapy and I'll get you some extra painkillers and an extra day off afterwards to recuperate?""

""What about Azreon?""

""The Archangels are onto him as we speak. That's all I know about that.""

Great, they won't leave anything of him behind. He's gotta have serious clout if they're being called in though. So much for payback.

A pager goes off on the assistant's belt. Reflexively, he plucks it off his belt, looks, and his eyes go wide.

""Shit. Sorry, sorry, I have to go. Show yourself out and check out at the reception, ok? I'll make the appointment but I have to go-""
He barely finished his sentence before you sprinted out the room, the door slamming in the wall.

The clipboard is there.

I shouldn't. I'm not suppose to see that. It's none of my business. I don't need to read it anyway, I probably won't understand anything on it. What'd be the point? I'd just get into trouble. Not worth it. Medical mumbo-jumbo would just confuse me. Gotta stay focused on the task. Get my priorities straight. Yeah.

So I pick it up and start reading it.

    Saben-161, age: 13 months, incident 7: Lower right arm replacement.
    Limb replacement success, full motion and sensation.
    Mental stability possibly jeopardized, mindwipe and neuro-reconstruction recommended.

What the _fuck_ is this? 161 is not my last name and I'm sure as shit not that 13 months old. That's the length of my career here. What incidents? I've been in 2 fights that seriously injured me, not 7.

M-mind wipe? Neuro-reconstruction?

I flip multiple pages. Medical records. My medical records. No, they're not. Severe, brutal injuries. Bisection? Partial Disintegration? Dissection and reassembly? I've never seen this before? This can't be me, have they gotten me mixed up?

    Seed crystals: 12-1, 19-3, 20-3.
    Convert: Melissa Asterom.

A picture of a woman. I have no idea who that is. I start sweating. Why am I sweating? There's something about this picture. This woman. Melissa. Melissa. Convert. I don't know what that is, but seed crystals...

*After my selection, I stand before He In Hallowed Depths. He initiates me, and I stand in awe.*

*""Upon you, I bestow a crown most worthy.*

*The first gem bestows upon you, the power to restore yourself and others.*

*The second gem bestows upon you, the power to manipulate and control metals.*

*The third and final gem will keep you safe from any flames that dare scorch you.*

*They are worthy of you, and you of them. Embrace your gift as they embrace you, as do I.*

*Go forth. We are counting on you. We believe in you. Saben.""*

I place the clipboard back on the table, grab my stuff and let myself out. There are so many thoughts in my head, bouncing around.
Crystals. Seed crystals. Convert. Melissa. Incidents. 13 months. 161. Mind wipe. Neuro-reconstruction.

In all this, I recall Rose. Cousin, sure, but she might as well be my sister. We became heroes together, on the same day. Before that, I barely knew her, but afterwards, we were inseperable. We got thrust into this position of a strange, new, exciting way to live and all we knew inside those wall back then was each other. One time, while fighting a Scaling Hydra in the Combolto Canyons, I held her as I closed her wounds as fast as I could. Something caught my eye as I looked down. Something shining. I always figured if it was a trick on my mind from the stress, pulling Rose back from the brink of her having been mosly dissolved by acid. She was fine not long after, but now I wonder, was it a crystal? Maybe it was red and I couldn't see it through the blood pouring out.

I look back to ensure no one's following me, or looking at me. People seem to be too busy. Hurrying along, I make my way through the hidden doorway into the hallway of the Doctor's office, which leads out the hospital through several doors. I haven't stopped sweating. The instruction of checking out is buried under the avalanche of intrusive thoughts. It feels like I'm wearing a crown of thorns on my brains, and it's tightening, coiling around, passing through. What did I just read? My hand finds its way to my stomach. Crystals. 

Grandma. Surely she knows. She has pictures of me. Of years ago. I just need to look at them, and then I'll know. I mean, I _know_, but maybe this'll slow down this madness uncorcking in my head. It's one thing for my consciousness to know, but ym subconsciousness also needs to be blatantly shown. It'll be good to see grandma, I haven't seen her in a while. The subway station isn't far. I check in with my transport pass, sit down in the first train headed there. Waiting for it to leave is agonizing. I fiddle with my uniform, looking out the window, watching people pass by. Trying to get my thoughts away from what I just read. Should I have listened.

Some person sits next to me. Seriously? The train is mostly empty. I try to catch a glimpse of the jackass who decided to try my luck in my bad mood.

Her bright blue hair matches mine, though hers isn't taken care of properly, looking frazzled and unkempt. She's taller. Beefier, I can tell even through her longcoat that hangs open at the front. Her mouth is covered with some carbonfiber facemask. Her eyes are similar to mine, but tired, with bags underneath them. There's an edge to them, as they look right at me. She looks like me, but there's a bit of Rose in her, too, but none of her kindness.

Something is going to happen. My instinct are yelling at me to transform. I gently move my hands into starter formation, before I realize she's doing the same thing while maintaining eye contact. I stop, and she stops. We both hold, waiting for the first to pop. Behind her, people move past to take their seats. The train car is filling up, no one any wiser on the standoff I've found myself in. She doesn't let up, doesn't flinch. What is happening?

An old man walks into the car, his crooked wife right behind him. He sees us and stops, intrigued. I look at him as if to plead him to back the fuck up. To stay back for his own good. But as I look away, she flinches.",15
1lpv43g,n0yavlg,"I look at him. Curious. He looks at me. Angry.  
I take another bite out of my sandwich and close the door. He keeps yelling something but my full focus lies where i should take the next bite out of my sandwich and I ignore whatever he is yelling.  
Someone as angry as him isn't a bringer of good news. Or solutions.  
It's to early in the day for whatever kind of exchange this would've become.

After I took a short break and checked if this weird man was still somewhere close by - no he wasnt - I went back into my garage to relax. This time though I kept the doors shut. I don't want nor need another weirdo knocking on my door this early in the morning. But now I have to focus, I know I'm not that far away with finishing one of my childhood dreams.

It took longer then expected but here was this strange man again. He was here just three days ago. I really don't want to engange with crazy people. Espacialy those who just shout and make random demands. I just turn of my brain and ignore them. Thinking about it, I really don't even know what he wants from me or where he came from. But that doesn't matter to me. Back to the garage I go.

Today I will finish my project, however long it will take. But first let's power up my little hobby workshop.  
I flick a switch, the lights turn on and I hear a faint electric humming. Once it's gone I open up the dividing curtain in my garage to get more space. Let's get to work.

About five hours later I think I'm done. Time for a testrun.  
I connect a small USB device with the little machine on floor. For now it's just wires and some frames and other stuff put together. It isn't a finished product by all means, but it works and that is the most important thing.  
\- Please select what you want to summon. - the voice from the littel machine chirps.  
A strange voice. My voice. I really don't like hearing my voice. Maybe I should've hired a voiceactor for the lines and commands. But that will be a problem for future me! Now it's time to focus on the present!

\- Please summon B.E. - I tell the machine. Some lights blink, first red then they switch to green. So far so good.  
\- Understood. Summoning B.E. - the little machine confirmed my command. now lets wait.

It was dark outside. Was. Suddenly my little garage lit up as if someone exchanged her for a sun. It was nearly as bright as day for a short moment. Then an explosion. Where my Garage was, now stood a digital dragon. Not just a digital dragon, it was like he was alive. I could hear his breath, his heart beating and see his eyes move around. Perfection. I touch his scales. If feels weird. Like my hand is about to pass through but isn't quite. My skin tickels where i touched his scales.  
Time for a spin.  
Time to show the world that it isn't just a deranged dream.  
Now it's time to introduce Seto Kaiba and his Blue Eyes to the world!

\-----  
This is my fist story I wrote so i just hope that it is readable and enjoyable.  
Please excuse any mistakes since english isn't my first language and I hadn't had time to proof read.",106
1lpv43g,n0zyzvi,"Looking at the stranger with confusion thoroughly drilled into my mind. ""Yeah. Bolting my door from now on."" Slamming it in their face I do just that turning from them in my robe pondering how they got past the buildings locked lobby doors.

In my living room I looked over the assortment of parts at my disposal. Bits and bobs I'd scavenged from dumpsters. Begged and bartered for over the years. I'd gotten past the planning stage only two years ago. Having built up a ridiculous horde of parts during that time. The prototype looked like a poorly made coffee machine. Over engineered of course.

Checking the UPS, then the cords. A final checklist as persistent banging on the door echoed down the hallways. ""Give it up!"" I growled as I pressed some keys on the computer interface. Everything looked good. No unanticipated spikes in power.

Then it was finally time.

Unable to contain my excitement at the maiden voyage I didn't prepare or enact any basic safety measures, before lifting the protective case. Gripping tightly I pulled the lever. Everything important should have one.

The machine hummed and it vibrated on the floor, my neighbour predictably banging on their ceiling as it did so. I did sound and act an awful lot like a washing machine with a brick in it. 

A bubble of energy slowly worked its way around us as the hum turned to a whine and...

Blinking I looked around. My eyes, slowly adjusting to the new surroundings. It was barren and completely devoid of any visible life. Though it had an atmosphere. Evident by a lifeform resembling a snake violently awoken from its slumber, slithered away.

I dared not drop the barrier but stood up in a joyous, ""Whaaaa hoooo!"" I've done it.

Travel to another planet was no longer years in our future. It was here! In a machine I'd made out of scraps!

I took some time to cuss out some naysayers and critics over the years, as well as astrophysicists and engineers. Before my euphoria ran its course and I gained some sense of equilibrium.

The landscape was orange. Shades of orange and red as the default colour on this landscape. It looked like a desert back home. A few rocks here and there but still similar enough for me to understand.

Then my Uninterruptible Power Supply beeped at me, it had been drained. ""Oh shit.""",43
1lpv43g,n124etr,"The time that Zoe got to spend in the her garage tinkering with different things was time that she cherished, she had always been one to enjoy science in school but then after high school her parents died and she couldn't really afford to go to college and take care of her younger brother, so she sacrificed her dreams to help her brother out.

While she tinkered she tried to create things that would help others out, things that could serve a purpose, but it was also just to get her creativity released before she had to get back to her boring office job on Monday, the only job that a twenty three year old girl could really get that wasn't fast food or retail. As she tinkered with the generator she was building, something that could be used to power an entire neighborhood off just garbage in a small compact from it let out a longer whine and then a hiss before it shot out an entire electro magnetic pulse that flicked the entire city's power supply off, that was until it sputtered to life and slowly the power started coming back on, she had done it, shed created wireless power that was created by garbage. And then she heard a knock at the door. 

Going to answer the door she saw an angry man in a suit with two equally angry police officers at his side. It turns out when you're the epicenter of a town wide EMP someone will notice. ""Do you have ANY idea what you just did?!"" The man exclaimed angrily. Before he noticed that the power was coming back on slowly around the neighborhood. 

""Yeah uh sorry about that."" Zoe spoke, as the man looked astonished. 

""How do you all have power the EMP wiped everything out and fried everything?"" He inquired, the edge in his voice dissipating. It took showing him and then explaining everything and demonstrating to actually get him to believe what happened. From then on though slowly more and more people wanted to get a slice of the cheap power option, which in turn led to a bigger generator and Zoe held all the rights to it, though she wouldn't let that get to her head and only held it so that others couldn't profit off of it. And that was how the country's power grid became reliant on the trash that humans created.",9
1lq29gi,n0zl7vi,"The guards had approached me with genuine concern in their voices.

""My lord, the prisoner, he has yet to awaken."" The largest of the group whispered to me.

I narrowed my eyes and followed them to the prison compound.

""He only tosses and turns milord, we can't get close enough to hear what he says but he's whisperin to himself something fierce."" The other guard says quietly, unlocking the doors and mechanisms that guard the Prince.

When we arrived I had them open the prison cell, unconcerned with any attempts he could try to muster.

It was only when I crouched to his level that I could make out what he was saying.

""No... a5 isn't in triplicate... have to... redesign entire proprosal..."" The princes eyes furrowed, sweat beginning to drip from his brow. ""Must... convince them to use... plumbing...""

Was... was this idiot having nightmares about paperwork? I would have laughed but honestly I understood the misery of it all. How many forms did I have to fill out everytime someone blew up a room in the labs?

The Archmagos of Belius stared at the tossing form of the prisoner, their crown prince.

As quickly and quietly as I could, I moved my hands through the air, manipulating the magics in the air until a spell washed over the prisoner. The princes eyes relaxed, and his breathing became steady. A dreamless sleep. I refused to look at the guards as I left the prison cell.

His Lord was aiming to become the next King. No one had ever stated they needed to be rid of the prince, and certainly no one was telling him to off him either. Who knows, maybe a well rested prince will be a willing worker.

At least those panda eyes of his would go away if the prince could sleep well. Who knows, maybe a well rested prince would be better than a sleep deprived idiot we currently were dealing with",47
1lq29gi,n11k23e,"When they captured Prince Pietro, they expected nobility. Pride. Maybe tears. What they found was silence.

In the damp cell, he slept like a child. Arms crossed over his chest. Face serene. Almost… content. Every now and then, he mumbled in his sleep. “No more audiences. No more decrees. No more pretending.”

On the third day, a guard stormed in, club in hand, kicking the cell door open. “Alright, prince. Playtime’s over.” Pietro didn’t move. The guard stepped closer. Misjudged his footing. Slipped.

That was his last mistake.

Pietro sprang like a waking serpent. His legs wrapped around the man’s neck. One twist, sharp and sudden, and a crack echoed off the stone walls. The guard twitched. The club dropped. Pietro picked it up slowly, methodically. The man was still breathing, barely. Pietro crouched beside him and stared, like a child watching an insect squirm. “You woke the only man who actually wanted to be here,” he whispered. Then he drove the club into the man’s mouth. Once. Twice. Three times. Until the sound stopped. Until there was only pulp where a face used to be. He didn’t blink. Just licked his lips. Calmly. Deliberately.

The second guard rushed in, sword raised. Pietro hurled the club without looking. It smashed into the man’s knee. He collapsed, screaming. Pietro was on him in seconds, straddling his chest. Two fingers slid into the man’s eye sockets. Pushed until they disappeared into wet, soft darkness. He tilted his head slightly as he worked. Like he was listening to music. “They always said I was dangerous when I got bored,” he murmured. “I guess they were right.”

The last one ran.

Pietro followed, barefoot. Silent. Smiling. He caught him before the stairs. Grabbed his hair. Sank his teeth into the man’s ear and ripped it off. As the man screamed, Pietro crushed his nose with both thumbs. Then drove his head into the stone wall. Over and over. Until everything stopped.
He watched the blood run. Spat out the ear.

“My father never understood,” he said, wiping his face with his sleeve. “I didn’t want the crown. I just needed an excuse.”

Then he walked back to the cell. Closed the door from the inside. Lay down. Folded his arms. And went back to sleep.",13
1lq29gi,n138rye,"I'm the crown prince. My only duty used to be to prepare for marriage. No need for me to ever lift a finger. 

Turns out, being so pampered and so lazy was off-putting to women. But that was fine with me. I was happy to be left alone, and to sleep. 

Until my dad fell ill. Now, he lies in bed, waiting for death. Meanwhile, I handle every royal responsibility I've avoided for 20 years. 

When people think royalty, they think of balls and fancy gowns and ordering people around. 

They don't think of paperwork. Endless. Stacks. Of paperwork. 

The trouble is, to do anything, I need to fill out papers. Royal decrees. Or I have to read papers, which are every bit as mind-numbing. How many times have I had to stare at the budget report, trying to figure out what I could cut so I could afford to give our people what we needed? 

On top of that, I've come to learn my father was an ass. I mean, I already kind of knew that. He was always cold and distant with me. But I mean, he was a *real* asshole. Like, he'd buy slaves so he can take them to a secret lab under the castle and experiment on them. He'd host feasts and balls while the rest of the kingdom was suffering food shortages. But you couldn't complain about that. Anyone he caught complaining about his rule would be taken to *another* hidden dungeon under the castle, to be tortured and eventually killed. Execution was his favorite form of punishing criminals, such that even petty theft was punishable by it if he felt like it on that day. 

We also had a colisseum for gladiatorial combat. He'd host these tournaments to distract people. Force prisoners to all duke it out. Last one standing supposedly gets set free with a clean record, but he'd find and kill that prisoner later on. 

My father didn't care about anyone else but himself. The only reason I say he was an asshole, not that he is an asshole, is because he's physically incapable of doing anything mean anymore. His selfishness left me a lot to clean up after. But I'm working on it. I abolished slavery. I had the lab dismantled and the colisseum shut down. I released prisoners kept there unjustly and started a system of due process. I maintained friendly enough relations with other kingdoms that we don't have to worry about going to war for a while. I got people working and our food shortage is slowly but surely ending. 

But it's not enough. There's always more. Refugees are coming here to escape kingdoms warring with each other. I've yet to find somewhere to house them. My dad's rule created many orphans, especially due to our lackluster medical care. So I need to find funding for orphanages so the kids won't starve. I also need to figure out some way to treat illness. Where's that budget report again? 

How many times have I stared at that damn thing? 

Doesn't matter. I need to look again. 

I wish I could just sell our castle to pay for everything. Then I could be a commoner and never have to read anything ever again. Sure, a life of hard labor isn't fantastic, but I'd take it. 

I let out a wistful sigh, then get back to business. Staring at the budget report. If I could just make one more cut -   

Something stings me. A bee? Whatever. Can't afford to get distracted. Can't . . . afford . . . to . . . 

My vision swims, and suddenly fades to black.",6
1lqc76n,n12bnf0,"Cloaked, towering, with me wagon I travel the world, to sell bread.  
I sleep in the open singing to the birds, and animals, avoiding any sounds of battle.  
I hate waagh. I want peace.  
But, why can't Duomo get it?  
I look at the bandits tying 2 sharp-ears to a tree, and laughing badly.  
Duomo must help them, even if I don't like battle.  
""Stop."" I say, maybe a bit too loudly, and the men freeze.

  
""Who are..."" one of them growls, turning around, and then pales.  
Human men...almost worses than orcs.  
They stutter looking at me, maybe they young?  
They barely reach Duomo's knees.  
""L-leave!"" I say, maybe a bit too weakly, but it works.  
They run away.  
Duomo then frees the sharp ears.  
""You free. Go."" I say.  
They stare at me.

  
""You are an orc, aren't you?"" one of them asks.  
""I leave now. Worry don't."" I say.  
Sharp ears, sharp noses, they always know Duomo is an orc, even when cloaked.  
A bird flies on me shoulders, and the sharp-ears grab my cloak.  
""Wait! We don't mean anything bad!  
You saved us...will you come to our village? We have to show you our gratitude?"" the other one says.  
I nod.  
Maybe I could sell my bread.

  
They gave Duomo a shop!!  
They like my bread, and the sharp-ears are actually nice!  
I don't have to travel anymore, and I can also sleep in the open, because we in the woods!  
A bit strange that the sharp-ears aren't afraid of me, and that this village is only female sharp-ears, but I am happy!  
Duomo not like other orcs, so this won't be an issue.  
Hmph.  
I will now try a new bread I wanted: bread with honey inside!  
I can finally stop travelling, and try new things!  
I think Duomo will like it here...even if the sharp-ears are often clinging to me.",7
1lqc76n,n12hqfu,"The oven had finally come up to the right temperature as the logs turned to ash.  Duomo had spent that time kneading the dough with care, mixing in the crushed walnuts evenly as his large hands worked before letting the dough rest.  The pans were already prepared when he swiftly cut the raw dough into sections and filled each one before sliding his creations into the oven.  After a while, the kitchen began to fill with heavenly aromas as the large orc cleaned up his work space and washed the mixing bowls from the rain barrel he had carried in earlier.

Drying his hands on a scrap of soft cloth, a grin tugged at his lips as he heard the familiar trill of birds as they alighted upon the window sill.  Without looking, he snagged a small handful of crumbs he kept in a jar on the counter.  Moving slowly and deliberately, he hummed softly as he deposited the crumbs before the waiting birds  and the smile bloomed into fullness as the hungry songbirds began to peck at their meal.  It was moments like this that filled Duomo's heart with happiness, unlike other orcs who craved conflict and bloodshed, he preferred peace and tranquility.

A loud, booming sound rolled across the village and the birds took flight immediately.  Duomo knew those were the war drums, calling warriors to arms for an upcoming battle.  A single tear trailed down his flour encrusted cheek as he reflexively glanced at his war axe hanging by the door.  He preferred a rolling pin to that weapon, something his brethren would never understand. More drums sounded, faster and with an increased tempo.  Enemies had been sighted and everyone was to defend the village.  Duomo looked longingly at the oven, his experience telling him that the bread was almost ready to come out.  He debated what he should do when a large crash stopped the furious drumming.

*Whoever they are*, he thought, *must have breached the gates*.

Duomo carefully untied the apron around his waist and started to move towards his weapon when he stopped suddenly and instead turned to the oven.  Pulling open the door, the fresh scent of baked bread filled the room as he carefully pulled the hot pans out and set them on the table, his thick skin preventing any burn.  The crust was the perfect shade of brown, smooth and unblemished.  They were perhaps the best bread he had ever made.  His smile reappeared as he slid one of the loaves from the pan onto the cutting board.  Taking a serrated knife, the one his father had gifted him to saw through bones of fallen enemies, he carefully and surely cut the loaf into clean slices.  I quick dab of butter he popped it into his mouth, chewing slowly to savor his creation.

*Even better than it looked*, he mused.

He took another slice and buttered it fully, intending on spending his last moments enjoying the fruits of his labor.  He was about to raise it to his mouth when a sound from outside the open door caught his attention.  An female elf, dressed for battle and holding a drawn bow, stood there with an arrow ready to end Duomo's life but instead of loosing it, raised her arched eyebrows at the bread in the massive orc's hand.

Duomo pushed the bread forward as if offering it to his race's most hated enemy, nodding slowly.  To his surprise, the elf walked soundlessly into the room, lowering her weapon.  Their hands briefly touched as Duomo surrendered his delicious creation into hers.  She took a small bite, her eyes widening in surprise before taking a larger bite.  Half a moment later, the slice was gone, devoured rapidly.  Her eyes saw the rest of the sliced loaf and the many others still waiting in the pans.  Her voice was clear and musical when she turned her head and declared loudly:

""The one we seek is here.  Our salvation is finally at hand!""",8
1lpyahf,n0yjliz,"""They did it."" the Cherub says.
I sigh.
I look at the souls that still grow in number.
""Did humanity wipe itself out?"" I ask.
The cherub nods.
I snap my notebook close, and the space and time before the pearly gates freezes.
""Now, tell me what did the Council say?"" I ask.
He hesitates.


""The angels think this is Their plan?
By the way, They are still missing?"" I say.
He nods.
I sigh.
""Gather a Saints' Circle for me will you?
Also, call on the Risen Angels, you know? The angels who once were humans?"" I say.
He nods, and flies away.
I look at my notebook shivering...
The souls were trying to come in.
I took the notebook, and left.


Inside a marble hall, we gathered.
Saints and angels that once were humans.
""Why have you gathered us, St. Peter?"" one of them asks.
""Humans destroyed themselves...again.
And the angels this time think that it is Their plan, and plan to do nothing...again."" I say.
The hall erupted in groans, and praying.
""Again?
St. Peter, can we at least this time be direct with our descendants?
This is getting old!"" a saint says.
I shake my head.



""Rules are rules.
If we interfere, we have to redo time until they are back on a path of their own, albeit slightly better."" I say.
They nod.
""Let's do this.
Several billion souls would overwhelm our systems!"" one of the afministrative saints says.
The others also roll up their sleeves.
I open my notebook, and open a portal.
We leave for Earth, ready to save it again.
It will weaken us all for a few centuries, but then...
If we can help...how could we just ignore them?",51
1lpyahf,n11h6vb,"She gestured up towards the other side of the railway and I follow the cherubs gaze. Beelzebub (or Beezy as I affectionately called him) was standing there and he looked... Sallow. When his eyes met mine and there was a panicked frenzy in them, a real storm was brewing. I'd never seen him like this.

He shook his head, then followed it with the a sign I hoped I'd never, ever see - he raised fists from his sides, towards his shoulders like a set of bicep curls, opened his palmed then crossed his arms so the palms touched the opposite shoulders, forming a very clear x with his forearms. My stomach dropped as he then adjusted his arm position to essentially rotated the X to appear more like a plus sign. Things were about to go from bad, to worse. 

Glancing back at the gate, still more souls were appearing. Amongst them I felt a rush of Empaths, Eruidites, Rectitudinals and ascendites. The number of pre-initiates was startling. 

Immediately leaping into action I start barking orders  through a mindwave. ""Broadcasting on a full spectral wide wavelength - Please can all available agents including saints, come to the front gates, immediately. I'm sending the images to Gabriel to forward on to God. Raphael is out of range so Azreal will need to step in for current resident management. Cassiel and Zadkiel - Can one of you PLEASE get hold of Micheal and tell him Peter is calling a code black - He MUST Convene the council straight away. Handiel - Prepare the Empaths for every possible ailment you can and arm the Ascendites with the flame class weapons. Make a barrier formation as quickly as possible up here -  I have no idea if we will need them but we HAVE to get them ready NOW. 

You pause and immediately feel a push back - there was a collective groan and a clamouring of replies. 

""Not another drill Pete, really? "" Grumbled Ellijah
""This IS a drill right Peter?"" asked Grace,
""I'm just at lunch with Thomas and Matthew, can it wait 20 eons?"" Whinged Bartholomew.
Other voices chimed in as well, with similar levels of annoyance.

Desperately trying to stay calm and repress the frustration and fear, so as to not alert the pre-initiates, you open your minds eye for the others to witness the spectacle before you. A wave of shock followed. 

Giving them just a few seconds to process the scene, I looked up again searching the growing crowds both on our side (platform Paradise) and on theirs (platform Brimstone) for signs of Beezy or perhaps even Dante, but I couldn't find them. 

Angels had started zapping in and some of the crowd watched in awe as the new arrivals tucked their wings behind them. I was bombarded with mindwave questions - some were logistical and easy to reply to but most, I just didn't have answers for. 

After what felt like 100 eons, the army of Ascendites began marching into sight. I had confirmation that the blessed souls had been moved well out of harm's way and the Empaths were nearly ready. A quiet, stuttering voice, broke through the cacophony of preparation orders and responses. It was Uriel. 

""Sir, M...Micheal wants to know... D...D...do... we need H...H...Hades or..."" He left the question unfinished.  

""The WHOLE council"" I replied. ""We are going to need God AND Lucifer at the table. Beelzebub was up here and..."" I trailed off. I knew I was getting more than a few raised eyebrows my way. I tried to ignore the looks so swallowed and carried on ""He gave me the sign""  I faltered again. They'd all tuned in now. Taking a deep breath I told them. "" He gave me the Triple C. He did the corners, the cross AND the crucifix"". 

Silence. 

Then, all hell broke loose.",24
1lq6mmn,n10lucp,"""God DAMN.""

I let out a long, slow whistle as I unroll the scroll I've pulled out of Alluwin's bag. Dust falls with each extension of the parchment. The ink is faded but still legible, revealing incantations that have not been heard in this world for at least two hundred years.

""You are so fucked if they find out you have this. Why didn't you turn it in when they were being gathered?""

""I'll have you know I am not in the business of complying with the authoritarian nature of government ruling,"" Alluwin spoke in defiance as he examined a seemingly unimpressive shell through a monocle he held to his eye. ""I'll also have you know that I was unaware until now that I was in possession of that spell.""

""If you're ever audited,"" I say as I let the scroll spring back into its curled up state. ""Let's just say they'll be giving you the Salem treatment.""

Alluwin tosses the shell over his shoulder before turning to give you a deadpan stare.

""The precious government and their meticulous documentation of all things magical will be the first to be able to remind you that I, Alluwin of Everglade, have never been successfully burned. Nor drowned. Nor starved. Nor flayed. Nor hung. Nor stoned. Nor guillotined. Nor felled by an arrow. Nor -""

""Yes, yes, we all know how incredibly powerful you are,"" I wave his words away and pull another random prize from his bag. To my dismay, I find my hands coated in a thick syrup-like substance paired with a rancid smell that is being urgently secreted from every pore of the gelatinous creature I have pulled out. ""What the fuck is this thing?""

Alluwin turns his attention towards me and breaks into a gummy grin. You'd think that for all his infinite magic that he'd maintain a full set of teeth, but he claims that to be slightly off-putting is actually quite freeing.

""Bloppy!"" he cries and snatches the creature from me. The creature begins emitting a sort of gurgling purr as Alluwin pinches at the various folds of... whatever the substance making up Bloppy's epidermis is.

""I take it you two know each other.""

""Oh, yes, yes,"" Alluwin replies, never removing his attention from this 'Bloppy'. ""An old flame of mine from my college years. Oh, do forgive me for losing you in there, Bloppy, I hope that you were able to keep yourself amused amidst all the bips and bops to be found in my bag.""

For a moment, I consider giving in to my downright profound curiosity. To inquire about the mechanics of their relationship would have likely only resulted in me trading my confusion for a previously unimaginable degree of disturbance. When you befriend someone who is a bastion of endless knowledge, you will quickly learn just how true it is that sometimes ignorance is bliss.",13
1lq263q,n112emj,"Nobody tells you how hard it is to adjust the glow. 

It didn't help that my first time experiencing the glow involved one of the worst hangovers I've ever experienced. My mind came to life before my body and I resolved then and there to keep my eyes closed. The ache over took every bit of me and the blood in my veins slogged through me as if it had been replaced with a toxic bile. And the nausea. The nausea that churned my stomach so violently it would've thrown sailors off of the ships trying to sail it's seas. 

My first thought after assessing my body was that I've finally done it; this would be my first three day hangover. Though that thought was quickly overtaken by a second one; how is it so bright when my eyes are still closed?

And so, with every ounce of strength that remained in my addled body, I bravely opened my eyes.

The pain was blinding at first, shooting its glow straight through my retinas and into my already throbbing brain. I had never been tasered before, but I can only assume this was the psychological version of that. Through my pain came the fear that I was either dead or that I would have my eyes cooked into obsolescence by whatever this light was. 

I groaned in pain as I threw an arm over my eyes. To my dismay, the glow someone became worse. Almost as if the light were coming, at least in part, from the very arm I'd hoped I could use to save myself.

""Poor thing,"" a woman's voice startled me. Who the hell did I bring home last night?

""It took a while, but I managed to find the protective spectacles,"" a man's voice spoke now.

No, really, who the *hell* did I bring home last night?

I felt large hands pull my arm off of my face and then place a pair of glasses over my still closed eyes. mercifully, the glow blinding me even through my eyelids dimmed. For the first time since waking, I opened my eyes to assess the damage of the apparent orgy I'd thrown myself.

Except when I opened them, I wasn't in my bedroom.

Somehow, impossibly, I appeared to be laying in a cloud that was a smaller cloud atop of an endless sea of clouds. As if that wasn't strange enough, I saw the two voices I'd heard were not the only occupants of whatever space I'd found myself in. Before me stood a smattering of people and other creatures in a large horseshoe formation. There were humans both minuscule and staggeringly giant, redwoods and shrubs coexisting as equals, all beautiful beyond reason. Scattered at various intervals between them were all sorts of creatures. Some of which, to my shock, included what appeared to be mythical creatures such as dragons as well as extinct ones. My eyes fell specifically upon what appeared to be a sabre-toothed tiger exuded depthless wisdom. 

And then there was me. Hungover, a certified disaster, who appeared to be emitting the bright light that plagued my hungover eyes. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd died, if the nukes had finally launched and I was now bathed eternally in a radioactive glow. The fear that I had died was quickly replaced with the horror that the afterlife was shitty enough to have me retain my hangover upon entering it.

""When's he going to say something?"" a hummingbird fluttering next to the ear of a towering old man asked. How a hummingbird spoke and how it spoke so loudly that I could hear it clear as day was just another thing to add to the list of mind-boggling confusion I was rapidly adding to.",12
1lq263q,n12s1bv,"You want to know how I became a god ?

Right. Okay. Well, brace yourself, because I have no idea.

---

If you’d told me, back when I was eight and collecting my third degree, that one day I’d be a god, I’d have told you that was terribly inefficient.

Godhood? Infinite life, infinite responsibility, no work-life balance. It sounded exhausting. Not that I knew what “life” was, really. 

---

Let me rewind.

I'm **Lucian Vale**, first god to ascend in millennia. *Apparently.* Also, former CEO of about nine hundred companies, inventor of two cryptocurrencies and one universal food printer, and the richest person in recorded human history.

I was born rich. *Not* ""Ferrari for my birthday"" rich. More like “My parents bought a Pacific island for our dogs” rich. Legacy of a trillion-dollar empire. Microchip pharma. Planetary mining rights. The whole dystopia starter pack.

For the first twenty-five years, life was a sequence of quarterly goals, merger deals, and my parents’ quiet pride. They called me a genius from the moment I spoke in full sentences at age two. Graduated university at eight. Designed orbital economic simulators by ten. By twenty-five, I’d doubled the family fortune. My parents were proud. I was miserable. I was the heir to the biggest fortune ever assembled, and I was supposed to turn it into something even *bigger*. End of story.

Then my parents went up in a private rocket to look at the stars and didn’t come back. 

Space tourism, they called it. 

The moment the floor dropped out from under me, the moment they said ""seatbelts optional"", I called it. 

I didn’t cry.

I didn’t *feel* anything, honestly. I just… stopped.

For the first time in my life, no one told me what to do.

And that was terrifying.

No more quarterly goals. 

No more quiet nods of approval from across the dinner table.

I’d won the game I never chose to play, and there was nobody left to tell me what came next.

---

So I did the only rational thing: I tried living. For the first time.

Started with doing things *they’d never let me do.*

I backpacked through cities where nobody cared about my name. 

I rode trains just to watch the world blur by. 

I hiked across Nepal. 

Got stung by jellyfish in Australia. 

Got food poisoning in Italy. 

I gave away more money than my family ever spent hoarding it. 

Schools, clean water, free clinics, you name it. 

Started a charity in Nairobi and actually *worked* in it, digging wells with my own two hands. 

The staff didn’t recognize me at first, which was refreshing. 

No bowing, no yes-men, no headlines.

I learned how to dance in Brazil. Badly.

I gave away islands. Canceled a trillion in debt with one signature. Got into street graffiti, started writing poems on walls in Detroit. Tried karaoke. Cried at karaoke.

I crashed in hostels, took cooking lessons from street vendors, washed dishes in a soup kitchen.

I wanted to feel useful without the weight of an empire strapped to my back.

---

And when that wasn’t enough, I threw parties. For orphans, for strangers, for the staffs who used to polish my floors and bow when I walked by. Endless, ridiculous parties, just so people could laugh. So *I* could laugh. So I could finally see what “joy” looked like when it wasn’t attached to a line item on an annual report.

The more I tried, the more I felt… *human.*

---

But I never really *let go*. Not fully. Not until the night I decided: I want to know what it feels like to be *completely* irresponsible. I decided: **I want to know what it’s like to be absolutely blackout drunk.** 

Not tipsy. 

Not socially lubricated. 

I wanted to get *obliterated*, to not think, not plan, not strategize. 

Just *feel* something stupid and wild. 

Just *once*.",9
1lq263q,n112fc9,"""Hush,"" the old man replied. ""The first words a God speaks are theirs alone, we cannot rush nor prompt them.""

A what?

Okay, so maybe I'm not dead. I clearly must be in a coma or some profound state of alcohol-induced psychosis. We all can have a bit of an ego, I won't pretend I'm any different, but for my mind to be producing some sort of fever dream where I'm a god is really something else.

""Umm,"" I stammered, immediately disgusted by the stale tang of my hungover mouth. ""Where am I?""

Silence. They all stared at me. I stared back. Then, suddenly, a roaring sea of laughter. They all shook with it, causing claps of thunder to echo through the clouds and lighting to light up the skies behind them. The spectacle certainly did not help my hangover and certainly added to my confusion.

""I see now!"" the dragon managed to say through fits of laughter so powerful it caused fire to flare up in its nostrils. ""A God of jest has ascended to our ranks! How befitting! I have grown tired of Ser Lyam's wisecracks, the fates knew we needed such fresh air.""

""HERE, HERE!"" the crowd of... Gods? shouted in approval.

""We greet you, young God,"" the woman whose voice I'd first heard spoke now as the laughter and celebration died down. ""Tell us your name and regale us with the tales of jest so wondrous as to deem you the first worthy of ascension in so many millenia."" 

Imposter syndrome took on a new meaning. I remembered the time I'd lied about having waiting experience and dropped a full tray of wine glasses on my first day. That was imposter syndrome. This is something closer to sheer panic. What would happen if they found out I was just a person? An incredibly regular person? Would I be thrown from these clouds like the useless brick I am? Smitten on the spot? All I knew was I had to say something before I evaporated under so many expectant eyes.

""My name is Brad,"" I stated. Curse my parents and their inclination towards mainstream names. ""The last thing I did before ascending was go to my friend's birthday at a karaoke bar.""

""A what?"" another God asked. ""I am familiar with taverns, but what is this kerry-okay you speak of? 

""It's where you sing,"" I explained tentatively. ""But other people's songs. We call them covers.""

""NOT A JESTER!"" the dragon shouted again. ""A BARD OF THE MODERN ERA.""

""BRAD THE BARD! BRAD THE BARD!"" they all began chanting again. 

""Brad the Bard, yep,"" I repeated, though my words were drowned under the cacophony of their cheers. All I could do was hope they didn't ask me to sing anytime soon.",10
1lq263q,n12s25i,"So I found a dirt cheap bar in a nowhere city, no cameras, no bodyguards, no “Mr. Vale, your suite is ready.” 

Just a barstool, cheap shots, and a promise I’d never made myself before: *Tonight, you don’t have to remember tomorrow.*

---

So I did it.

I remember the first drink. The warmth in my throat. I remember laughing until my ribs hurt, at what, I couldn’t tell you. 

I remember a drinking contest with a goat. I remember trying to bless someone’s dog by tapping it on the forehead with a martini glass. 

I remember screaming “**ABUNDANCE FOR EVERYONE!**” and flinging cash into the wind, and someone shouted, “Is he glowing?”

Then the lights in my mind flickered out, like someone switching off the boardroom lights after a meeting.

Total darkness.

---

I woke up floating.

Literally.

In an endless starfield, warm and vast and *drunk.* The space itself buzzed with tipsy laughter and the scent of jasmine and rum. I was glowing gold.

And surrounded by thousands of people on their knees, shouting prayers I didn’t understand. Flowers. Offerings. The works.

“Lord of Endless Elation!” they cried. “Patron of Abundance! Master of the Bottomless Cup!”

A voice, not quite male, not quite female, whispered in my skull:

*""Welcome, Lucian. You have ascended. You are now the God of Endless Elation and Abundance.""*

Apparently, the universe took me literally. In my blackout haze, I must’ve stumbled across some ancient leyline, or primal ritual, or maybe the cosmos just took pity on the world’s loneliest billionaire and gave me the only promotion I didn’t ask for.

Since then?

Well.

Mortals pray to me now. Not like “please smite my enemies” kind of prayers, but stuff like:

* “Let me have one night of real joy, Lord Elation.”
* “I wish I could share this meal with the world.”
* “Thank you, Drunken One, for that extra paycheck. I don’t know how it happened.”

I don’t smite. I don’t judge. But I do *bless.* Spontaneous laughter in traffic. Sudden acts of generosity. Unexplainable pizza deliveries to starving artists. That feeling of dancing in the rain with no shame? That’s me.

Some gods inspire fear. Me? I inspire *release.* Joy without guilt. Giving without debt. Celebration without occasion.

And yes, I still get *very* drunk from time to time.

---

So… how did I become a god?

Honestly ?

I don’t know. 

Ask the bartender. 

Ask the gods who came before me, if you can find them at all, as they haven’t answered in millennia.

Maybe they were waiting for someone like me. 

Maybe the universe got tired of watching uptight immortals with cosmic grudges and thought: *You know what? Let’s give it to someone who actually learned how to live.*

Someone who once ruled the world’s wealth… and decided to give it all away for the sake of a genuine laugh.

Someone who’d spent a lifetime hoarding wealth, only to fling it at the world like confetti.

Someone so desperate to feel something real that he cracked the veil between man and myth, one shot at a time.

I’m the first new god in an age. I didn’t get here through meditation on a mountaintop or a thousand years of fasting. I got here by pouring a round for everyone and finally pouring one for myself.


I may have been blackout drunk, but I meant it when I yelled: *“ABUNDANCE FOR EVERYONE!”*

And apparently, the universe was listening.

And you know what ? I think they chose right.

So go on, have another. Drink deep. Laugh harder. Be kind. Be reckless with your joy. If you wake up tomorrow with your pockets lighter and your heart heavier, come find me. My temple’s always open. The cups are always full.

I’m the Drunken God, after all.

And trust me, there’s enough to go around.",9
1lpr55b,n0wz56v,"He wasn’t sure of the exact moment he figured it out.

It wasn’t a dramatic revelation; there was no lightbulb flash or metaphorical curtain yanked open. Just a slow, creeping certainty that revealed itself to him across several months. The oddly timed thunder when he cried. The perfect lighting in his bedroom. The way people lingered around corners, just long enough to hit their mark.

Eli was the star of a hidden camera show.

Had it been going on his whole life? Or was it a recent development?

He had no idea. But one thing he wasn't going to do was give himself away. Not yet. First he needed to find out who his friends were. 

And so he still laughed at his best friend's jokes, still kissed his wife, and still watched his favourite shows on TV.

But beneath the façade, he was watching. Learning. Growing.

A few weeks later, he was laying in bed, trying to reason himself out of it, trying to be logical, trying to be rational, when he finally heard them; two voices in the vent above his bed.

“…ratings are in the toilet.”

“Network says two weeks max unless something big happens. Drama, scandal, something. He’s just…kinda boring.”

Kinda boring?

Eli stared up into the vent for a long time, not moving. Not blinking.

That confirmed it.

By morning, he had a plan.

He didn’t go to work. Didn’t even call in. It was all fake anyway. Instead, he spent the day sitting on the living room floor, cross-legged, watching the door, waiting for them to come. The TV was off. His phone was off. His expression was perfectly calm.

Around 3 p.m., the mail slot clinked open. A small thud. Letter.

Eli didn’t move right away. He just smiled.

He stood, walked over, and picked up the envelope. Plain white. No return address.

He opened it carefully and pulled out the single sheet inside. One of those fake coupons for a pizza place he’d never heard of. 

Perfect.

He walked to the kitchen, his fingers trembling as he took out the largest kitchen knife he owned. 

With a deep breath, he slit the pad of his left index finger, the blood flowing forth. On the back of the flier he wrote carefully, neatly, in blood.

“I know you’re watching.”

He held it up to the cameras in each corner of the kitchen, and suddenly, the creeping static feeling living between his ears was dulled, the multitude of voices that guided his consciousness silenced, no whispers in the vent, no phantom cues curled behind everyday noises. Just a clean, expansive quiet, as if someone had finally turned off a humming fridge he’d never noticed until it stopped.

He smiled to himself, looking at his smeared blood on the page and imagining the boost in ratings. Who was boring now?

He grinned. 

He felt much, *much* better.",72
1lpr55b,n0zf17b,"I would argue that the success of the show depends on the immersion of the subject believing it's real. If the subject knows it's not, I'm not sure why people would tune in. At least, it would seal that there would be an end to the show.  
  
I think it would be interesting to explore why the subject would want the pretend world to continue. What would he gain from a continued fake world?",14

1lpvafh,n0ydeb3,"\[Truth & Love\]

And there it was. Dee, Ray's fiancée, stared at him as she adjusted her stance. She shifted her weight to one leg and crossed her arms; she wasn't leaving without an answer. 



""Babe..,"" he tried to put it off so he could have some time to think about it, but she shook her head. 



""Don't 'babe' me! You think I haven't noticed your little disappearances and side quests? Running around without the supposed love of your life, doing god knows what? It's a simple yes-or-no question. I don't want to hear your stories or excuses."" 



""Didi..,"" he tried a pet name, and her glare grew colder. He could answer 'no', and it would be the truth. But it would ruin everything for everyone involved. If he said 'yes', the wedding was over and the woman he loved would leave him. No matter what he answered, she would believe him, because that was his particular ability. It felt like a curse early on, but he got the hang of it. He tried not to use it too often and kept himself decently honest. 



He'd met a nice woman, then fell in love. He tried opening up about his powers to her, but there was no way to convince her. Only lies were translated to belief, and the truth could be ignored freely. He tried examples, but his ability was too powerful.  Anything he convinced her of was just something she'd always felt.  The sky was always green, and she started to panic until he told her it was always blue again. But, now he was backed into a corner. For the first time, possibly ever, he actually needed to lie to keep everyone happy. It wasn't even a major lie, more akin to a surprise birthday party than a torrid affair. Part of him was glad no one was around to overhear the conversation. It would've been easy for anyone to assume the worst of him. It wasn't a major lie, but it was an important lynchpin for giving her the wedding of her dreams. He had no choice but to lie, and resorted to one of his more underhanded tricks to avoid answering the question he really didn't want to. 



""I don't know...,"" he said. Her face softened immediately. 



""You don't, do you... oh my god I'm sorry!"" she rushed over to hug him.  ""I'm just so stressed about the wedding. Every detail is super huge and important and I'm overanalyzing things again...,"" 



""I don't know what you're talking about,"" He chuckled. ""You must REALLY be stressed, because you never overanalyze things like that.""  It was another lie, but that was one he'd been wanting to work into the conversation for a while. 



""Yeah, you're right,"" she nodded. ""I can't wait till it's finally over and we can relax as husband and wife."" 



""It'll be the most wonderful feeling ever,"" he said as he held her close. 



""Liar,"" Dee rolled her eyes at him, but smiled. She could always tell when he was just fibbing for fun. It usually came with a big smile from him that grew a warm feeling in her heart. And, she was feeling lucky that he'd always been completely honest with her.

You forgot about the nametags. Damn these work functions.

You plow ahead. ""Johnny Carson, too,"" you add. ""Some would call him the most influential talk-show--""

""How do I pronounce that?""

""Pronounce what? 'Johnny?'"" You give her your most ""Johnny"" chortle as the hired jazz band continues tuning their instruments. She's still looking at the tag. ""It's a fairly standard name, 'Johnny,' but I like to give a little more emphasis to the J at the beginning. Sort of to set expectations for the rest of the name, you know?""

""Is that Gaelic or something?"" She smiles at your nametag. ""You know, on my mother's side, I'm actually part--""

You forgot how loudly you speak when nervous.

""Yeah, Johnny!"" Marie in accounting calls. She also sets down her crudités. ""What should they play?""

You smile at the apparent potency of your magic, this spell you've never fully understood. Now you are become Johnny, enjoyer of corporate functions.

Still, as the music swells at your command, you feel an ache unlike any you've felt before. A sense of loss for the name that never was, your history hastily erased. So what if it was hard to pronounce? It was your father's name, and his father's before that. 

Just then, you get an idea. You raise your champagne. ""I'm not currently experiencing the complex emotions of cultural assimilation!"" you cry.

The elevator door opens, and I freeze.  
For all sorts of beings, fly, crawl, and walk, in a humongous office like space.  
""Welcome to the N.H.B.O.A. , the Non-Human-Bureau-Of-Affairs."" she says.

I mechanically follow her, to a cubicle.  
""This is where you will work at. Don't worry, as an entry job, your tasks are simply.  
Register requests into the system.  
Basically, you will read the requests that come from non-human inhabitants of Earth, categorize them after the system you will find in that guide there...and then submit them into the request system.  
Others will analyze if they are reasonable or not, and agents will be sent out to solve these requests.  
Any questions?"" she asks, as a phoenix flies over us...  
I shake my head, sit down, and start reading the guide.  
She smiles, and leaves...  
""Need money for rent. Need food..."" I mutter, promising to myself that next time, I will read the job descriptions better.",45
1lpjuvg,n0vq13m,"I look at the tourists that hired me as a guide, and see them smirk.  
I sigh.  
I just told them the Rules of the Woods, and like many other tourists, they think we are paranoid.  
""Sir dragons, please if you would follow me."" I say to them, as I start leading them into the Woods.  
As a Giant, I am a guide, and a lumberjack in the town.  
I lived my life in the Woods, and yet...  
I am still fidgety whenever I have to go in here.  
Because I know the truth...human do be walking sometimes here.

  
The shadows flicker around the golden flames of the dragons.  
I put it out.  
""I told you! Normal fire only! No magic!  
It attracts them!"" I say.  
They laugh.  
""Humans are a myth! As if the world is bigger, and there is a part where magic is destroyed, and ""humans"" with no magic rule it."" a young dragonness smirks.  
They are literally in humanoid form, I am a humanoid...why do they...  
I see lights, and those are not from Will'o'Wisp spells...

  
""Shh. One by one follow me.  
We are going back to the Town."" I say.  
Before the dragons could answer, we hear a loud boom, and in the distance, a poor deer cries out.  
""What's that? Bigfoot?!"" voices shout, as I see figures approaching us.  
""Follow me!"" I shout, as we ran towards the Town.  
From behind us, taunting shouts, and random names were called out.  
Damn it!  
We were on the official trails, we didn't really talk, and it is the middle of the day!  
After what seemed eternity, we got back to the town, and the shouts stopped.  
I looked at the terrified dragons.

  
""Are you alright?"" I ask.  
They all nod, except the young dragonness.  
She lifts her dress, to show her thigh bleeding.  
""T-they can hurt us? T-they are real?"" she stutters, clearly in shock.  
I take her to a druid, and hope for the best.  
And then...stop the Wood tours, for as long as needed.  
I go out for logs, and herbs, and our hunters as well, but we are careful, and we follow the rules.  
Until the human activity lowers...the woods are half-forbidden to us.  
Outsiders may think we are crazy, but we know the truth, especially me.  
After all...  
I was raised by a human, until the age of 9.",149
1lpjuvg,n0vw3uc,"The first glimpse of how things are in the Woods i got when i was 5. I still remember the events of this trip as clear as if all of it happened yesterday. We were camping with my family because of the special occasion. My older sister Emily was finally able to walk, after being bedridden for almost 3 years. The original plan was to stay there for 2 nights and 3 days. 

The day we arrived, Emily told my parents that she had this uneasy feeling. My mother however, having used to looking on things with rational persepctive, brushed it off by saying that the reason she feels this way is because she’s simply not adapted to the environment yet. I wish that was the case. Dad on the other hand was completely preoccupied with setting up the camp, so he wasn’t really paying attention, which resulted in him never forgiving himself over it.

First day went relatively fine. Outside of hearing a couple of strange sounds, that is. What bothered me, was the fact that those sounds wasn’t feeling like they were made by animals. Some of them were close, the others were farther away, but all of them were quiet. Suspiciously quiet. Almost as if we wasn’t supposed to hear them. Now that i think about it, maybe they were warning sounds. I kept wondering, how things could’ve turned out, if we payed more attention to them and headed back. I guess i’ll never know the answer.

I remember first night being strangely soothing. Somehow i had a very deep sleep, despite the problems i had with my sleep for the past couple of weeks. That was yet another strange thing left out of our view. When i spoke to my dad about it, he simply said that it’s a good thing, since now we are ready for some fishing at the nearby lake.

Emily and mom decided to stay at the camp. By the time me and dad prepared all of the necessary equipment and headed out, it was already past 1pm. Hours flew by, as the sun kept getting lower and lower. And since it was winter, the sunset was approaching rather rapidly. As soon as it started getting darker - dad decided to head back. That was another instance of something being off. The trail we used to reach the lake was gone.

We ended up wandering in the darkness for at least 2 hours. Thanks to the headlights we had, we somehow managed to return safely. Or so we thought. At first glance everything was normal, mom alongside with sister were sitting by the campfire, patiently waiting for our return. We had a little chat, and even managed to joke about us getting lost, considering that the lake is no more than a kilometer away. Then we had a dinner, and after our usual loud laughing and chatting with my sister - we went to beds. 

That night was the moment it happened. At the moment we had 2 tents. One for me and my sister, and the other one for mom and dad. At first everything was as usual. I had no idea that the good sleep the day before was the last time i was able to sleep peacefully. This night ended in nothing less than a nightmare.

I think it was around 2AM. That was the time when something interrupted my sleep. I opened my eyes, but to my surprise - i couldn’t move, i couldn’t speak, i lost control of my body completely. I could still hear and see, but that was it. And so after my eyes adjusted to the darkness, that’s when i saw Emily, standing in front of the tent entrance, slowly unzipping it from the top to bottom. I tried to do something, but it was useless, my body wasn’t moving.

That’s when i heard it… “Emily” echoing deep inside the woods. “Emily, come to us” the voices were quiet, yet very clear to understand the words. They were the reason she was awake. They kept calling, up until my sister stepped outside of the tent. When she did that - i realized that the campfire was no longer burning. There was no moonlight, it was pitch black. Then the voices got louder. “Emily, come here”. I heard brunches cracking behind our tent, there was no mistaking it - someone was here. 

It was the last time i saw my sister. Emily disappeared out of my view, leaving the tent open. I could hear her going around the tent. Next thing i know - everything went quiet. I desperately tried to scream, i wanted to do SOMETHING. I think i managed to shake my body, and thanks to the coins i always carry in my pockets, i was able to make some noise. Dad woke up and rushed out of his tent, only to see our own tent open, with only me laying inside. I think he realized what was going on, so he immediately woke up my mom, and told her to make a fire again, while he was looking for Emily.

He took his flashlights and went searching, only to return alone in the morning completely devastated. He said that the best thing we could do was head back and make a police report. And so we did. But in the end - the searching group couldn’t find anything. They even said that there was not a single trail we mentioned in our report. In fact, none of the description of our campsite was matching with what they saw, they said. 

Everything ended up with some people calling our family crazy, some went as far as to say that it wasn’t an accident. Things got so ugly with all the rumors, that they resulted in my mom shutting off and never leaving the house again, and my dad bearing the grudge of what happened until his very end. As for me, there is only one truth - there are Humans lurking in the Woods.",29
1lpjq3y,n0wkmft,"It was always funny the moment they realised. When parental concern turned to fear. When their adrenaline kicked off and the hair raised along their arms.


Had I been but a few thousand years younger, unacquainted with the *deliciousness* of my current preferred prey, i might have indulged in hunting them.
But they were close to my den and my latest catch would soon awaken. If i wanted to play as i always did, to cultivate fear to its most intoxicating point, i would have to wrap this up quickly.


One of them, smarter or perhaps quicker than the rest reached for his gun. I kept my voice light, childlike when i told him simply, ""If i wanted to hurt you, I could have done so without revealing myself."" 
I let that hang in the air for a moment, let it settle in their brains and he obligingly moved his hand away from the weapon. ""Obliged"" i simply responded before looking over them.

The threads that bound them were colourful. Guardian colours. They wanted to protect people. To save them. No doubt they believed me to be a monster, and to some i was. ""Why are you hunting me?"" I asked. Gentle, non threatening, non accusatory. Just...curious.

""There have been"" a swallow against a dry throat, before one of the hunters finished ""disappearances. In the local town. All signs point to you.""

""Because it was most likely me. But i still dont understand?"" I cocked my head to the side. ""Do you not know who they were?"" Revulsion curled the edges of my expression, ""do you not know what they did?""

The leader of the group, braver than the rest. ""What do you mean?""

I huffed. Hunters. ""Come with me."" I crossed a hand over my heart, ""I promise you safe passage should you not break our peaceful stalemate"" old words, older than even i was. Like ducklings they followed and i led them down, down past the shell of a house. Down the twisting staircase from which none of my prey had ever escaped.
To where my latest victim lay dreaming. 

They seemed concerned to find him in a room of girlish thing. Pastel colours, toy ponies and soft fluffy things. It looked, for all intents and purposes, like a five year olds bedroom. 

They turned to me, confused. I gestured towards the man, ""he thought himself the wolf, but i was no rabbit to be ensnared in his jaws.""

Confusion. Theyd understand. I stepped forward. The plushness of the carpet deadening even the smallest sounds. ""I did not make this den. Not like this. This is where he feels safest. Most in control. It would seem...charming were it not for the cameras.""

I watched that thought hit them. Watched it turn their faces to disgust. Revulsion. I lifted my small petite hand towards my own face. ""This face is not mine. He dreamed of perfect prey. And so that is what i became for him. As i have done for them all. And now he is here."" I let that make me smile.
""He has not shown mercy to your children. Why should i show mercy to him?""

Silence. Those guardian threads. Bright and light. They wanted to protect. But i was like them in a way. I wasnt good. Far from it. But even i had standards. There was a delicious kind of irony in using their perfect prey to devour them. The way their confidence turned to shambles,  power turned to begging. It was delectable. 

""People like this"" i offered, ""these are what i hunt. I have no business with you or yours. I would ask the same of you hunters.""

A choice to be made. They could leave. They could just...walk away.

And like proper guardians. 

They did.

They were here to hunt monsters after all. And this monster was well caught.",162
1lpjq3y,n0wonq9,"I looked at the girl in confusion. She was dressed in a strange assortment of mismatched ragged clothing, none of whiich seemed the right size. Her dark hair was matted but with whisps that looked like someone had made a half-hearted attempt to brush it. Her face had dirt slightly smeared across it.

I gave a hand signal to Tommy who moved carefully into the room, checking doors and corners, ceilings and prodding furniture. Monsters were our profession and we’d all learned the hard way that the vicious creatures could come from anywhere, all furious claws and teeth.

Jan stayed slightly back and off the side from me, her gun pointed at the floor but ready to fire on the girl at any moment if she shapeshifted.

“I’ve met a lot of Monsters kid” I said calmly, keeping a bit of distance. “but I’ve never once had one talk. We thought this place was empty, the town said the woman who lived here reported a monster.”

I had been a bit skeptical myself when we took the job. The Mayor was going off second or third-hand reports from the owner of the place who had left the town in a hurry three days ago. Apparently she’d been overheard declaring that a vicious, evil creature had been controlling her and she’d only just managed to escape.

But when I saw the house the whole story felt more plausible. It was exactly the kind of run down place monsters liked, broken windows and holes in the roof, lawn grown wild and all dark shadows and creaking boards inside.

We’d only made it one room in before we’d encountered the girl sitting in the middle of the floor with a couple of chipped teacups and a headless doll on the floor. She’d stood up but hadn’t moved when we’d entered.

“My mother.” she said in a quiet voice.

I blinked and glanced back at Jan who was also frowning. “What?”

“The woman was probably my mother. She left three days ago and hasn’t come back. She said she wouldn’t, she said she was escaping.”

“She left you here with the monster?” I said, baffled. Monsters sometimes took an odd liking to certain people, leaving them unharmed even as they slaughtered others. Or perhaps she was mind controlled like her mother had claimed had happened to her?

“No” the girl said in that same quiet voice. “I told you, I am the monster. She tells me every day, I’m cruel and evil and vicious, I ruined her life, I’m a monster.” she said the last part in a kind of sing-song voice, as if she was reciting.

""Kid,"" I started, but she shook her head.

""She said if I was good, if I was quiet and stayed in my room and didn't ask for things, I wouldn't be a monster anymore."" Her fingers twisted in the hem of her too-large shirt. ""I tried so hard.""

Jan lowered her gun completely, holstering it with a soft curse.

The girl looked up at us then, and I saw how young she really was beneath the dirt. Eight, maybe nine. ""So you should probably kill me now. That's what you do to monsters, right?""

""Jesus,"" Tommy muttered.

I took a slow step forward, then another when she didn't flinch away. ""What's your name?""

She blinked, as if the question surprised her. ""Rosie. But she usually just called me—""

""Rosie's a good name,"" I interrupted, crouching down to her level. The floorboards creaked under my weight. ""I'm Marcus. That's Jan, and the big guy trying to hide behind the couch is Tommy.""

A tiny furrow appeared between her brows. ""You're not going to kill me?""",75
1lpjq3y,n0vr7k4,"I look at the little girl, and smile.  
""No, no.  
It is theoretically a monster that could end all life!"" I say.  
She nods.  
""Yes, Mr. I know. Me!"" she points at herself.  
I chuckle, but then freeze.  
The little girl just touched a rock...and it grew legs, and a sharp mouth, as it launched at me.  
I couldn't react, but thankfully, the little girl grabbed its tail...and ate it.

  
""See? ithsme!"" she says, chewing that...that rock thing.  
I take a step back.  
""H-How?"" i stutter, pointing my gun at her.  
This feels so wrong.  
""I am Echidna! Mother of monsters.  
Though, Mr. , I have just been reborn, and that's why I look like this."" she smiles.  
I freeze.  
They told us the monster is a newly reborn entity, but this...  
This is not a mere monster.



""You can shoot me, it's not going to work, or hurt."" she smiles.  
I...  
""Oh, you can't because how I look?  
Sorry...it takes some time to grow back to my true self."" she says.  
She's toying with me, isn't she.  
""Sorry."" I say, and shoot her.  
She catches the bullet. Easily.  
Then I watch as the bullet grows wings, and a proboscis, and multiply wildly, sucking a nearby tree dry.  
I start laughing.

  
""Oh, poor mortal...  
Already went insane? Let mother soothe you."" she says, and touches me.  
I want to scream but can't.  
I feel myself dying, my insides boiling, my mind shattering...and then...  
I look down at Mother.  
""Come up."" I say, extending my huge hand, which she climbs, and sits on my shoulder.  
Standing upright, I gaze over the trees, and see the distant town from where I came.  
""Let's spread Mother's love."" I say to her, as I uproot a tree, to use as a walking cane.  
She giggles, and it makes me happy.  
Mother's love is warm, and the world needs to know it.",190
1lpjq3y,n0vigyx,"""I know. Me,"" the little girl said. Wait, what!? How was that little girl- oh. oh no.

  
A couple hours later of running, we looked back to see how far we were, but we were in the same place. Not moving anywhere. The area in front of us started playing tricks on us. So, since we were gonna die anyway, we started shooting at it, and only bubbles went out. We reloaded our weapons, but when we looked at it, our weapons disappeared. There was nothing left. I took one last look at our team, and one look at it. It ha",24
1lpjq3y,n0w731m,"The little girl said “ I know, me.”

The entire squad starts laughing. “Hahahahahahahaha”

Sergeant, “ hold on there little girl, what are you doing out here all alone?”

Monster, “I live here, this is my home “. 

Medic, “Sergeant, let me check the little girl out, maybe she is hurt, maybe she hit her head.”

“Franky, Stevie, Fritz, Pat, spread out, check the area, we got to find that monster!” Sergeant orders.

Sergeant, “Jones get over here, keep an eye on the little girl.”

Jones , “what the freak? Sergeant? She’s a little girl “ 

Sergeant, “who claims to be the monster. So you watch her, while we search for the monster.”

Monster, “ I am the monster “

Jones, “of course you are little girl, know be quiet, the adults are doing important work “

Monster, blinks very slowly. 
The little girl, changes into a very large erect standing white bunny rabbit 6 feet tall with great big jagged teeth, sharp claws on her front paws, long soft ears, fluffy white cotton tail. 
The Monster grabbed Jones by the shoulders and bit his head off. 

Medic , screaming in terror as Monster Bunny, dropped Jones body. 
With powerful back legs, Monster Bunny, leaped into the air. Landing on the screaming Medic . 
Monster Bunny, rode Medic to the ground. Then tore off the medics gear, before shredding the Medic to pieces, with the sharp fore paws. 

Sergeant yelled “CONTACT!!!” , raising his rifle to shoot the Monster Bunny in the head. 
But the bullets bounced off Monster Bunny flicking fluffy fuzzy ears. 

As the other soldiers arrive, they line up and begin firing at Monster Bunny. 

Monster Bunny, jumps into the air. Spins backwards, kicks out a hind leg. A soldier goes flying backwards. Monster Bunny lands on a different soldier. Bits another head off. Jumping in the air. 
Monster Bunny does a backflip with a forward spin , landing a direct head shot to another soldier. Knocking him off his feet. 

Monster Bunny lands in front of Sergeant. Grabs his rifle, throws it away.  Stands before Sergeant, then blinks very slowly. 

Monster Bunny changes back into little girl, with blood covered hands and a blood all over her face. 
“I told you, I am the monster!” Little girl says then smiles. 

The Sergeant cold cocks the little girl, knocking her out. 

Sergeant, “someone get the cage, and find those tranquilizers now!”",24
1lpjq3y,n0zu99c,"She isn't special. Mostly ordinary except the fact that she managed to make her way here - out of all places and night. However she, most definitely, isn't who I'm after. The contrast between her and who, or what, I'm after is far to great. And to hear her say she is... it. That, that, is laughable. So why does the sound get stuck in my through like a chewing gum stuck to a chair?

""Please don't laugh."" She said. 

Her voice soothe my heart beat but doesn't wear off the uneasiness, which I feel. And it is similar to the rhythmatic and steady currents of a calm ocean but carries the childishness of the person it belongs to.

""I wouldn't dear."" I told her, crouching down and panting my hands.

She only smiled. But it wasn't the sweet one of a small child. It was familar because I had seen it before. 

It was a smile of the monster.",9
1lpjq3y,n0wooqp,"""No, Rosie. We're not."" I kept my voice steady, professional. Like I was giving a mission report. ""See, we've been doing this job a long time. We know what real monsters look like. They have claws and fangs and scales. They smell like sulfur or rotting meat. They definitely don't know how to have tea parties with dolls.""

She glanced down at the chipped teacups. ""I was just pretending. That someone would come.""

Behind me, I heard Jan making a call on her radio, her voice low and urgent. Good. We'd need child services, maybe the sheriff.

""Well,"" I said, settling back on my heels. ""Someone did come. Just not who you expected."" I gestured at the headless doll. ""What happened to her?""

""Mother got angry,"" Rosie said simply.

Of course she did.

Tommy appeared in my peripheral vision, shrugging out of his tactical jacket. He held it out to me with a meaningful look. I took it and offered it to Rosie. ""It's cold in here. This'll be too big, but it's warm.""

She stared at the jacket like it might bite her, then slowly reached out. Her fingers barely peeked out from the sleeves when she put it on.

""There's a diner in town,"" Jan said, rejoining us. ""They make good pancakes. Real maple syrup, not the fake stuff."" She looked at me over Rosie's head. ""Sheriff's on his way. Twenty minutes.""

I nodded. ""You hungry, Rosie? We've been out here all morning and I could use some breakfast. Job's done anyway.""

""The job?"" She pulled the jacket tighter around herself. ""But you didn't find the monster.""

""Sure we did,"" Tommy said gruffly. ""Found her three days ago when she ran out of town.""

Rosie's face went very still. Then, so quietly I almost missed it: ""Oh.""

We waited while she gathered up the headless doll, cradling it carefully in the oversized jacket. She looked around the room once, at the peeling wallpaper and water-stained ceiling, the broken furniture pushed against the walls.

""I don't have to come back here?""

""No,"" I said firmly. ""You don't.""

She nodded, a tiny motion. Then she looked up at me with those too-old eyes. ""Do pancakes really have blueberries?""

""We'll make sure they do,"" Jan said, and I caught the roughness in her voice.

As we walked out of that house, Rosie between Jan and me, Tommy bringing up the rear, I thought about all the monsters we'd hunted over the years. The thing is, we'd gotten pretty good at killing the ones with claws and fangs.

The other kind—the kind that looked human, that had daughters and left them behind in rotting houses—those were harder to stop.

But looking down at Rosie, taking her first tentative steps into the sunlight, I figured maybe we'd managed it this time.

The jacket pooled around her feet as she walked, but she clutched that broken doll like it was precious, and when Jan asked if she wanted to ride in the front of the truck, the tiniest smile flickered across her face.",92
1lq42yh,n1051gg,"I’ve never ascribed to dogma, be it scripture, ideology, or a recognized system of values. The value of a man isn’t predicated by what he ought to be, but is. And in my humble opinion, as one of the former members of the ordained party of adventures sent to slay the demon king, our so-called hero never was one outside the title alone. I’d seen him burn down villages for not supplying us along our journey, rob merchants, and kick a child into the way of an oncoming carriage.

I thought he had died then and there when the arrows started flying from the walls and the town-guard rang the alarm.

To be perfectly honest, I cared little for the hero in the first place; how could I? I wasn’t the priest that Lord Plexus confided his sins in for the undeserved absolution of a repeat offender. Nor had I been his childhood friend that I never learned the name of before he’d been run through by a goblin with a spear. Anyone that did care died on the long journey; as we watched fifty men dwindle to ten; and then nine, as we slipped out through the castle gates with gazes averted from the city’s commoners.

Times were rough as we gathered around the scarce few resources we could gather and discussed the future. We didn’t have a plan per se; just a vague direction, and the notion that if we returned with neither the hero nor the demon lord’s head we’d all be put to the rope.

Thus, the *adventure* continued as we distanced ourselves from our past. It was difficult to rebuild that lost trust; but the work was finally fulfilling, as we could put ourselves to task on the objectives and bounties our former lord considered beneath himself. We did this one step, one swing, and multiple broken limbs at a time. We changed our banners and colors, recruited new soldiers to the cause, and erased what we could and right some wrongs, but history still chased us.

It’s been years now.

The falling rain batters the foliage of the canopy overhead, as I keep my eyes closed and listen to the ambience of the company’s camp. It’s present in the distant thunder, the sound of rolling wagons, and of the tent’s wet fabric blowing in the light breeze. I’m still trying to find that peace that has escaped me as I finally open my eyes and stand upright in the now dented and bent plate armor I’d left the capital in so long ago.

These thoughts were for later.

The supply wagon is late, as I turn my gaze northward, toward human territory, and the wagon train now snaking its way up the muddy trail from further down the mountain. The men riding in the open top carriages are soaked through their red chain mail and fabrics. And while we were now behind our “schedule,” this lapse in organization could easily be forgiven as the lieutenant of the logistics team stopped short of our camp and disembarked from the driver’s seat. The man was quick to cut into a sprint as he waved his arms. “Captain!”

The priest was never like this; but he was now, as I felt the source of unease dictate the speed at which I was now standing upright. Still, I didn’t let it show in my voice, as I’d long since been desensitized to even watching men get butchered inches from my person. “What is it?”

Grange kept the pace, flinging the ankle deep mud behind him before he stopped short, wheezing. “He’s back!”

I responded in kind, as I helped the poor man from sliding around on the wet ground by grabbing his shoulder. “Who’s back?”

“Plexus.” The name sent a chill down my spine, as I looked toward the crown now disembarking with cargo from the caravan.

“Plexus? He’s alive?”

“David, he’s here.” With his good digit, he pointed out the offending would-be hero from the crowd, now making his way over. Despite the many years, and the now feeble body of his, it was more than clear that the guards in Glade had neither killed him nor lopped off an arm and made our lives easier. The concoction of anger and despair from seeing him again boiled into one clear thought.

Oh, fuck not again.

In a knee jerk reaction, I drew my sword; drawing the sound of fresh steel through the air, as the many eyes of the company and busy routines ground to a halt to watch the unfolding confrontation. Still, despite everything, it was the hero’s wide open arms and smile that started the conversation as he spoke over the divide. “Ah; captain, I love what you’ve done with the place!”",6
1lq42yh,n1052sz,"I made my stance clear on his return, as he stepped just close enough to keep my sword to his pale neck. “No, leave, get out of my camp!”

He smiled despite his shock, as he put two fingers on my sword and pushed it to the side. “Now listen here, this–”

I swung for his hand; missing only because of a flash of golden light shimmered into being around his wrist to deflect the blow. “Whoa, easy there; I only want to talk. There’s no need to attack an old friend.”

The arm locking around my right arm was the only thing that kept me from swinging again as the priest grabbed my arm and blurted. “He’s got a letter from the king.”

I felt my unmangled eye twitch in frustration. The same one that’d long ago escaped a slash from his sword.

Plexus pulled the scroll from his pocket and held it up. The mocking sadness of his face and tone made me want to run him through that much more than he grandstanded for the crowd. “That I do, and it says here that I’ve got my old job back. But I’m no fool. I know when I’m not wanted.”

Unceremoniously, he dropped the scroll into the mud, where it slipped between the foul ground. Though my reprieve from the moment was short-lived as he returned his gaze to my person and, for the first time since I met him, spoke with the hateful sincerity of his heart. “I don’t expect you to listen, but I expect you to follow.”",6

1lpjljk,n0vii7d,"Draugnir the Dreaded, Woe of a Thousand Kingdoms, Crown of the High Winds, pawed at the massive pile of coins in his lair. Thanks to his psychic magic, they wouldn't move, but the moment he let up, they would surely be carried away. His eyelids drooped, and then shut for just a brief moment before he forced himself back awake. 

As a dragon, he didn't actually need sleep, but when one is immortal, they crave respite from consciousness every now and then. And right now, he very much needed a nap. But of course, he couldn't.

He studied the tiny grimoire sitting on the floor of his cave. Though it was comically small in comparison to the massive dragon, his excellent vision still allowed him to make out the words and images. He carefully raised a claw to turn the page.

Then, a pebble socked him in the eye, bouncing off of the hard carapace around his pupils. Draugnir's eye twitched as a dozen more pebbles ricocheted uselessly off of his impenetrable hide. He smashed his tail into the ground in irritation, and the planet shook in fear of his wrath.

Yet, the pebbles did not stop. Another one almost clogged his nostrils, but it narrowly missed.

""Will you all PLEASE SHUT UP?!"" Draugnir bellowed, slamming his tail into the ground over and over again. ""You burn down ONE HUMAN VILLAGE and suddenly you all dedicate your afterlives to harassing me?!""

The Wraiths that flew about spoke in a language unknown to him, unable to communicate beyond the poltergeist behavior they were already exhibiting, but based on the sudden increase in pebble-throwing, Draugnir knew they were somehow offended by his rage. Every single other species, humanoid or not, would just die normally. But of course, for some Gods-given reason, the squishiest of them all just happened to receive a boon that made his life a living hell. Apparently, none of his other Primordials decided to TELL HIM THAT! 

But he supposed that made sense. Primordials rarely moved, and when they did, they had much, much better things to do than squish a few humans. Besides, the little bastards were both relatively new to the biosphere and rare, weaving between the tiny little nooks in mountains and such, so it was likely none of them had even encountered one throughout their long lives.

Draugnir sighed, clamping the book shut and storing it in his pocket dimension.

The Primordial Dragon uncoiled from his hoard and scuttled out of his cavern. The Wraiths chased him, doing what they could to irritate him, but he simply ignored them. *They're probably not going to be chucking rocks forever*, he thought grouchily. *They'll find some other way to kill me and then bugger off to do that to all of my ilk.* 

When he reached the open cliffside, with a mighty beat of his wings, he took wing, soaring at such a pace that no other creature could have followed him. Except, apparently, the Noncorporeal, whom stubbornly attached themselves to him and continued to scream human words in his ear. In a matter of moments, he arrived at his destination: a massive volcanic caldera smack-dab in the middle of the continent. Draugnir inhaled sharply and raised his maw to the sky. With a blinding surge of light, a pillar of yellow energy blasted from within his maw out towards the clouds, like waging war with the Sky God herself. Draugnir unleashed his mighty dragon breath for two entire minutes, and waves of force rippled outwards.

When he was done, he curled up by the caldera and lazily raised his head. The Wraiths, undeterred, continued their incessant assault on his body.",42
1lpjljk,n0vijyv,"After a few minutes, a shape emerged in the distance. Then two, then three, then four. His lifelong allies shot towards the volcano at speeds thirty-five times that of sound itself. Gracefully, they landed, each one with scales dappled in different colors.

""Draugnir, it's not like you to call a meeting so early in the day,"" Kaelgorr, Sovereign of Cinders, rumbled in a low voice.

Syrathene, the Deathly Blizzard, narrowed her eyes. ""And you're looking a little... 'rocky.'""

Draugnir's eye twitched as yet another rock, bigger this time, rolled off of his snout. ""Have any of you actually killed any humans?""

""The hell's a human?"" Charybdis, Silent Leviathan, piped.

""You mean the little monkeys?"" Erenvyr, Thorny Queen of the Briar Court, tipped her head. ""No, why the hell would I bother?""

""I mean, whenever they end up in my volcano,"" Kaelgorr said, ""I usually just pick them up and throw them out of my house. Why?""

""You see, a few humans were putting out some really nasty smoke, so I went and burned their village down,"" Draugnir began. ""And... well, I'm sure you can see the Wraiths.""

Murmurs broke out among the four other primordials.

""Oh, those were HUMANS?!"" Erenvyr leaned forward and tried poking one of the Wraiths, despite knowing better. ""You mean they turn into Wraiths once they die?""

""Well, no. Because if that was the case, we'd see a whole lot more Wraiths. No, I think it only happens when they're angry.""

""So they're too angry to die fully,"" Syrathene summarized, glaring at them. ""Pathetic little worms want to defy death, do they? Well, I'll show them death--""

""Syrathene,"" Draugnir cautioned. ""You and I both know that Wraiths are fairly dangerous creatures. You should not slaughter their species just to end up dead for it.""

Now, the Ice Primordial was being pelted with stones, and even sharpened sticks, too.

""So what do we do?""

""That's what I want to know."" Draugnir pointed at the Wraiths. ""I don't plan on letting these guys keep going on forever, and I couldn't find a spell to get rid of Wraiths. Usually, they're content to just mope around the sites of their death, and we could kill them by annihilating the site entirely since that's what they're attached to.""

""But these Wraiths are attached to you.""

""Exactly my problem.""

Kaelgorr curiously plucked one of the stones out of the air, scrutinizing the Wraith that threw it. In slow, deliberate motions, he spoke in a language that Draugnir immediately recognized as that of the humans. He was surprised that his ashen brother decided to spend time on something as trivial as that, but, then again, they did have a *lot* of time.

The Wraiths and Kaelgorr spoke back and forth for a while, and eventually, Kaelgorr turned to the other Primordials. 

""They won't be happy until Draugnir's dead,"" he explained. ""But, they did mention that they're concerned for the families they left behind. I would suggest taking the humans under our wings. If we do that, maybe they'll leave us well enough alone even if we accidentally squish one.""

Draugnir sighed. ""Fiiiiiiiine. I'll do something, then.""",41
1lpjljk,n0vikoz,"\-----------------------------------------------------------------

""And so, I did a few favors for your kind. And that's how this entire thing came to be."" A much older Draugnir spoke to the High Pontiff of the Draconic Church, who gaped. The Pontiff scrambled to find the words, but nothing came out. ""Now, is that your last question for your First Holy God? I'd like to take a nap.""",31
1lpt2fk,n0xbdf9,"I groan, as the devil starts explaining how important deals are.  
""Come on! I give something, you give something.  
It's a deal. Why are you overcomplicating it?"" I say.  
He smiles.  
""But if the deal includes me giving something now, in exchange let's say for a favor, or your soul...  
What will ensure that you will keep your end of the deal?"" he asks.  
I frown.  
""The contract?"" I ask.  
He laughs.

  
""And why would you follow the contract?  
You might very well say I coerced you, or that you didn't sign it."" he says.  
Hmm.  
""That could be a possibility, but I won't do that."" I say.  
""Of course you won't.  
Because Deals, true Deals, are Architecture as I said, clauses interwoven perfectly, ensuring no loophole, no accident, no phenomena can shake its structure."" he says.  
Okay.  
Now I am confused.

  
""What do you mean?"" I ask, reading the contract once more.  
""Real Deals include endless scenarios.  
Why do you think the contract is 9999 pages long?"" he asks.  
I laugh.  
""It is only 10..."" I start, then freeze.  
As I get to page 10, another appears, then another, and another, magically out of thin air.  
He smirks.  
""Real Deals are transparent, yet they still favor the more careful party."" he smiles.  
I frown.

  
""Whatever. Let me sign in, and give me immortality."" I say.  
He sighs.  
""You mortals and your pursuit of longevity.  
Taking out the joy out of Deals, well, I will be laughing one day."" he says, giving me a pen.  
I sign, and I instantly feel it.  
It's different than when I signed for a car, or a house...  
It's weighing down on me.  
""No Death, Possession, deal with another devil, demon, fae or any other entity will save your soul from fulfilling your end of the bargain.  
Not even the universe' destruction. So, enjoy your eternal life, mortal...  
We shall be seeing each other, sooner or later."" he says, disappearing.  
I shiver, but then shake it off, and start thinking in what kind of bonds, and banks I should start piling money...",6
1lpt2fk,n0xzhcd,"I twirl the pen around my fingers. Thinking hard on the words we'd exchanged, words that had challenged me and mine. ""Words are binding."" My voice piercing the quiet of the meeting room. ""They're wielded with such ferver and passion by those educated in their use, it's sad to see them diminished so."" Catching my opponents eyes with my own.

The room of five people sat silent as they watched the exchange between myself and the well dressed man at the other end of the table. We couldn't be more opposite. Wore out overalls and ballcap, a shirt that declares my love for the breakfast flapjacks at Marggies. Face a little scruffy. Sun baked forearms. The man across from me. Sharp. His face and hair are meticulously groomed. Well dressed, even I can tell that the suit costs more than my car.

I continue on uninterrupted. ""You know what's funny?People like you think Promises are Playthings. But Deals - real ones - they're Architecture. Pillars in the quiet chaos of our little world..."" I drift off to an old life, a past life. One I barely remember.

Seemingly unmoved by my speech. The man acts as if he'd had it all rehearsed. ""The contract is legally binding, I assure you we will pursue this to the full letter of the law. If you force us."" Of that I had no doubt. They had come at me hard and fast once they found that black gold under my land. Dragged me away from Harvest just so they could try and weasel me into some kind of legal dispute.

""Deals. Are made in confidence, between two people or parties to a mutual agreement. A Promise."" Holding up the piece of paper. ""Contracts are for those who don't believe in Promises. Think they're, Fragile. Intangible."" Letting it fall back down to the table with a solid thud. It wasn't too thick but big enough to intimidate. ""I don't sign Contracts sir. I make Deals."" A smirk came up across my face. One made of forthright planning and 30 years of fixing things.

Walking over to the other side of the table I gave him a smile, ""Deals are honoured."" Letting my eyes flicker silver long enough to show him my true nature. I added a mischievous grin. ""You're not ready for a Deal like this."" Colour drained from his face, as his professional demeanour wilted like a flower before a flame.

I left the high powered Lawyers meeting room and got back to my life. Crops don't bring themselves in.",5

""That's all?"" Alison asks.  
I roll my eyes, and put down the color examples I got from the store.  
""They are souls that used to live here, and will live here longer than we will."" I start.  
Nothing wild happens.  
""Yeah, ""live""."" Adam chimes in, and almost instantly the bathroom door slams open, and the lights flicker.  
I sigh.  
""Learn some manners, and they will be alright."" I say, turning back to check whether spring green, or swamp green would be better here...

  
A few days later, as I renovate the porch, the two ""smart"" ones, find me again.  
""It didn't work!  
I have been all nice, and polite, and...Look!"" she says, showing a rather nasty bruise on her leg.  
""You do realize they most likely hear us, and see us, right?  
And you do realize that whether Victorian or not, they know how to see something for what it is, right?  
You literally acted ""nice"" for a few days, and now you expect the ghosts to be all chummy with you?"" I ask them, they blush.  
I sigh.  
These guys...

  
""You broke a door off of its hinges on the very first week here, when you brought home that dude."" I say to Alison.  
She blushes, and pales at the same time, weird.  
""And you...  
You live in your room, and gather garbage enough for 9 people in a week..."" I say to Adam.  
Then I start talking about the little things, like messes left behind in the bathroom, slamming doors, not washing dishes, and so on...  
""Overall, you are just thinking about yourselves.  
Unlucky, because this house, has other tenants, than us, because if it was just me, maybe you would have gotten away with this behavior."" I say.  
The door slams twice behind us gently, as if agreeing with me.  
The two pouted.

  
Two weeks later, I watch them help me renovate.  
Alison is redoing the bathroom, and it starts looking good.  
She did waste some materials, but it is better than doing nothing, and cheaper than hiring a pro, anyway, I watch over what she does, lest she messes up the plumbing or something.  
Adam on the other hand is helping me with the roof now.  
And guess what?  
The haunting lessened.  
I look towards the backyard, to see faint figures leaning back on the chairs, nodding at me.

1lplr5o,n0wvf46,"Ricky's night terrors are getting worse. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Tina and I used to laugh at the nightmares he recounted but recently Tina's been getting some of her own. She's been stressed out at work so I figure that must be it, but these nightmares certainly aren't helping her. Both of them seem to be misplacing things all the time as well - I try to help out and create systems, but for some reason, while they work perfectly for me they do jack all for them. I even found Ricky's car keys in the fridge once. The fridge! I told him he really needs to chill out and get some proper sleep because the lack of focus could be super dangerous and lead to him dying on the roads.

  
I even tried recommending mindfulness practice but I guess the one time he tried he must've fallen asleep because about 10 minutes in he screamed and ran out of his room spouting about a little girl tickling him???

  
What with both my teammates going mental the kitchen and living areas are becoming a huge mess. I try not to hold it against them but honestly it's getting a bit disgusting. I try to tidy and clean once in a while but I really don't want to be responsible for their mess. It does help my mental health when I clean though, I swear the sun comes out and the birds sing and cleaning becomes easy, so I can get through a lot more than I think I can in the 20 minutes I give myself to clean. I've been nagging Ricky and Tina and they keep saying they'll do it but I never see them cleaning and the house just looks worse and worse. Tina's put together a plan though - on Monday she picked up a few things then asked if we could clean together on Saturday and honestly it looks like that's relieved some of her stress - she already looks like she's sleeping better. We tried inviting Ricky to help us but he said he's got something on on Saturday - I didn't see him try to reschedule or do his own thing in all the free time he's had since then though...

  
I'm thinking a bit of colour might help their mood? I've been repainting the cornices (the decorative wooden bits that join the walls to the ceiling) when bored and I would say that, apart from the mess, the house is looking better already! The wallpaper in the living room is looking pretty bad so I'm trying to decide between replacing it with some beautiful paisley wallpaper which would match the house, or taking it off completely and just painting it a bright orangey-yellow for some cool boho-chic feels. The thing is, I keep on misplacing the paint swatches I bring home - they must be under the Tricky mess somewhere.

1lporos,n0x0256,"I had been a prince, a prisoner, a traveller, a warrior and a sorcerer in the past. A destroyer and a devourer. A source of Great Evil. But that's in the past. I am now a father to adoptive children, creator of eldritch puppies and pets, a local guardian deity and Lord Mayor of this little town I rule over. And immortal freelance historical consultant.

Most will know me as Lord Elvari of Innsmouth. Eldritch God of Madness. Not a god of knowledge, not wisdom, and most certainly not of historical accuracy. Not that it has phased historians like Professor Gideon Hardwick and his colleagues. Or anyone with an inkling of the history of the gods of this world. Everyone had hoped I could provide truthful, firsthand historical account of events. Be objective about it, as a lone god with no pantheon or family.

That's the thing most immortals don't tell you. The thing humans don't always believe.

When you have lived as long as I have, memories get foggy. It is worse in my case. I've died and pulled myself back multiple times. Been maimed and tortured more than the average human had a papercut. A thousand years of imprisonment in limbo had my brains going in circles among themselves and throwing memories into the void like confetti. Most of these younger immortals will talk of the downsides of watching your loved ones die, all while I've observed civilizations and pantheons come and go, rise and fall. There is pain. There is grief. Sometimes, with the assistance of sufficient alcohol (this is where, in modern times, Alfred and Kat will yell at their drunken dork god to sober up) to dull my senses and wreck my liver a hundred times over, the agony and sorrow eventually fade with time.

Not the incessant questions.

The truth is, I frequently refer to the books I've preserved in my libraries. I'm not a walking memory and data bank. Even with the mass of muddled memories from those who I had assimilated over the centuries, very little is of actual historical value. Most of them consist of mundane little moments that the original owners considered significant. Their marriage. Their child's first birthday. The first time they ever left the village.

How often were they in the right place, at the right time, to witness the right people truly make history? Much more rarely than these humans who consult me on history. Frankly, I'm not even there most of time myself. I was too busy eating in my lair. Swimming in the seas, hunting for sharks to devour while the exciting stuff was happening on land. Okay, I confess, sometimes I was simply too drunk to recall a darn thing.

And even if I was there, once upon a time, I forgot.

Maybe it simply hurts to remember.

But what I do recall, I do my best to recount. Why else would these humans bring me in as a historical consultant? It is one of the ways I earn money to pay my employees and servants. To raise funds to buy myself a big cheesecake.

So, human, I've told you about myself like you asked. You've heard me rant and rave, now do you still have a question about this world's history for little old Elvari here? Or are you here for some tea and cakes?

1lpt2nq,n0xdezw,"Centuries ago I used to help humans curing the plague.  
Now, once again, I have to help them, especially the environmentalists.  
Why?  
As a vampire, I am not kindhearted or pure.  
No.  
I am using my vast wealth, and vast ocean of knowledge to help the humans, because of one reason only.  
Human blood with microplastics, and other chemicals is gross, and artificial blood is disgusting.  
So, I have to help them save themselves, so I can have good tasting food.

  
There were great changes when industrialism hit, and I still had some plants, and samples from before the days of technology.  
Using those samples, we artificially followed the reaction of fauna, and flora to plastics, and various chemicals.  
Hastening the evolution process, and making sure the initial values are clear, we managed to create strains of crops, and fruits, and vegetables, that can purify themselves.  
They aren't invasive, and aren't too different from the natural ones, it's just they can adapt quicker, and better to the chemicals in the soil, and air, cleaning them.  
Then...  
We turned to the oceans, and foods.

  
It wasn't easy.  
Microplastics were everywhere.  
But I remembered that there was a mutation in a bacteria long ago, that started eating coal.  
Based off of that idea, we managed to create a bacteria that ate plastic, and turned it into energy to multiply.  
It did nothing else.  
It will take roughly 50 years, but the oceans and their waters will be clean.  
That's one thing done right.  
Now...cleaning the already ""infected"" humans.  
That...that was harder.

  
The bacteria dies inside of humans, that's how we made it, so that was a no-go.  
And microplastics are too small, and the chemicals already altered their taste, ahem, bodies...  
So all we could come up with was to test ways to make the body recognize microplastic and eliminate it quicker.  
It's not yet effective, but we have seen a success or two.  
It's going great.  
My fellow vampires are laughing at me wasting my money, and time on the humans.  
But when everything is solved...  
Whom will have dibs on the tasty one?  
This guy!",6
1lpt2nq,n0z11hp,"Jack strides purposefully into the building, one he’s never been in before, one he’s never before wanted to be in. The lights are too bright here, even in the dark of this early winter evening, and there are too many eyes everywhere. Especially with these confounded security cameras everywhere now. 

The pert little miss at the front desk directs him to the hallways that will take him to the right room. He considers the delicate throb at the side of her neck with something beyond interest, but not approaching longing. His appetite has been falling off, lately.

Nowadays you’re lucky if you get ten seconds of smooth suck before you hit a grainy patch. In the good old days every one was smooth to the last drop. He sighs. The good old days, before Leander burst into flames after a hunt let run too long…before Effie took the leg of a stool through the heart during a bar fight that went too far…

He knows there’s no quick fix for this. He also knows that if he stays out of bar fights, keeps his hunt times trim, and otherwise conducts his affairs in the considered, circumspect manner customary to him, he has the time to wait.

He’s come to this solution last of all, reluctantly. He considered every alternative first. He tried going vegetarian, just sucking animals, but not only did that make him feel like a monster, those little suckers are chock full of microplastic as well.

He tried artificial blood again for the first time since the most recent 90s when he briefly (but so vividly- he sighs in appreciative remembrance) dated a fresh recruit from California whose compassionate eating habits bizarrely made the transition with her, for at least the first few weeks of her fang life. He wonders whether that lasted. He thinks not. Artificial blood is spit your mouthful out awful. His theory was that she was only able to do it at all because she had no frame of reference, no experience of the sweet hot beautiful real thing. Anyhow, artificial blood still tasted foul. He’d managed to work some down this time but it had turned his stomach. It was not a solution.

He had been exuberantly optimistic about filtration via a series of dialysis machines, each more modified and promising than the last, but all of them had been ultimately disappointing: 
It was too risky in terms of time management to suck the blood himself and transfer it to the machine, this is in fact exactly how he wound up with Sage, the new recruit he was now babysitting because of idiotic but indomitable siring rules, and god what a mistake that was, he feels uncertain the mortal world had any use for Sage but he feels damn sure the immortal world doesn’t; or too sterile to even warrant the effort, having the machine both suck and filter and then drinking the result like a human with a smoothie machine, a couple nights of that and he genuinely thought about just walking out into the sunrise and having it all over with. And anyway, the results were suboptimal. The filtered blood wasn’t as grainy, but it still wasn’t completely smooth. The machine missed bits. And it was lukewarm.

Turns out he’d rather suck polluted blood, hot and pulsing from the source like the joyous living animal he is, than continue with any of these artificial endeavors. So he does, but it vexes him. Every night. To the point where he’s beginning to think disturbing thoughts on a regular basis, thoughts like ‘is it even worth it anymore’ and ‘what’s the point of all this anyhow?’

He’s had Sage doing research for weeks on the provenance and properties of microplastics, which Sage seems to actually enjoy. Of course. He snorts. It’s true what they say, you can take the vampire out of his generation, but you can’t take his generation out of the vampire. He knows that he himself is hopelessly old world. That’s why he thinks this plan will work.

It’s all come down to this: a meeting called with the top ecofuture minds and creators on the planet. He’s built a plan for future generations of humans that will move them back gradually through decades to the use of glass bottle and waxed paper carton, soap made of ash and lye, foods grown in rich, rotating fields of chemical free soil…it’s all here, a plan to systematically destroy every last instance of plastic in the world. His maps are vast, his lists are laborious. His presentations are lively and brief, his proposals persuasive in theory and individual application. He knows he can make this work. He’s got what it takes to get the right people on board and the work underway.

He knows from centuries of experience that the only thing humans really respond to is abundance. Just like the only thing a vampire really responds to is pure experience. They can have everything they need, these humans, and still have endless capacity to desire more. Fortunately he is at this stage of his existence the very embodiment of generational wealth. He’s lived through lean times and fat times, financially speaking, but the older he got the savvier he grew, and now he’s something of a robber king. It comes of so many years of eating the rich and swiping their contraband collections. He can afford to wait whole lifetimes to unload these stolen treasures for unbelievable profit. 

He stands in front of the conference room doors, and takes a moment to smooth his sleeves, flip through his folio. He’s feeling strangely nerved up. He hasn’t felt this way about anything besides a very special meal for a long, long time. Maybe he needed this in more ways than one. Maybe this has become more than just the pursuit of a smooth sip. ",6
1lpar5q,n0tj5nq,"Being immortal has its benefits. Chief amongst them is birthdays .So many birthdays that remembering them becomes a burden. There becomes a point of fatigue on the memory. When you're immortal you tend to have a superior memory to most beings. Even then, unlike your existence it isn't without end. Mental load can become quite the downwords force. 

So there came a time which I called it quits. Birthdays based on solar orbit were overdone. Galactic orbits, however, they were something to savour. 

The party had been generations in the planning. Some who were arriving had grandparents not yet born when the thing was conceived. This was a monumentous occassion. Like the birth or death of a star (I'd seen both a few times now). To these I was nearly a god. No doubt I'd have to convince a few tonight that I did not in fact know all. My presence was not omni. Though one does find a certain wisdom somewhere between their third and fourth galactic orbit. But only the hindsight of millenia affords that priveledge.

The crowds churned into the near endless halls. They funneled into their designated sections, with perfect choreography. When the plans took decades, they better be water tight. Media from across the galaxy would be broadcasting this to all reaches of the confines of my fourth orbit. 

""Do you think you're the first to achieve such a feat?"" One reporter asked. I didn't bother to count the amount of mouths that she spoke to me with. I'd seen her kind before, several centuries ago.

I made up an answer I'd spent far too long pondering. What I didn't say is I'd long since stopped wondering. Either there was another older. Or there wasn't. But at this point they'd seemed determined not to reveal themselves if they had. So like the torment of endless birthdays, I decided to drop the matter.

I paraded myself through the halls. Ironically, the whole event would last a whole year. This was just one ceremony amongst many. Mine the first, but others of my kind (recorded as younger of course, would have their own lesser occassions. Most the days would be in celebration of the eldest, of course. But for every immortal being, there must be some appreciation. The universe doesn't seem to have rhyme or reason. No one race has worked out the pattern. But if they live long enough, grow large enough. It seems that inevitably they will produce their own undying peculiarity. Being the first, humanity, was raised mentally within the intergalactic community as some kind of shining example. I've long since realised that there's no such award, physical or mental, deserved. I was a production of sheer luck, even more so by the vast quantity of other intelligent species out there. Some who proliferate much more rapidly and widely than ourselves. And to be honest, after a while, when you're so far removed from the usual struggles of your kind, does it all matter anyway?

I realise I'd long since been ignoring the celebrations to dawdle. I force myself to be present. Engage in small talk with some far travelled delegation. I ever so wisely chomp down on some wonderfully crafted cake, and move on to the next group. 

A galactic orbit. Was it such an achievement after all? At some point I do wonder if I'll have to find another, longer milestone, to aim for.",61

A848d63196ae97de398a82cb9ded19f2e0bd5538014ba8f0ca1488c9ce3f95bf won't be coming; she's on a survey mission to MoM-z14. Now that I'm the last surviving organic lifeform on my planet, I've gotten used to the long identifiers for the different alien androids; it doesn't take that much time to recite the identifiers, in the grand scheme of things. 

Patience. That is the skill I have mastered. I make plans for the cosmos like a grandmaster plays chess. I have one remaining mission: construct the interferer. I've finished moving all the pieces to exactly where I want them. 

You see, back in 4783, I had amassed all human knowledge and cobbled together a little law of everything—not a theory: a law. (I had, after millennia of effort, proved it.) The short summary is that the universe isn't a universe—it's a dancing fractal. We live in the platonic realm. With my well-earned mastery of numbers, I determined the initial state of our universe from observations in the CMB and simulated the universe. I fast-forwarded the simulation until my own birth, then watched it play out in real time, up to the moment when my simulated self built its own simulation. That's where it always halts. 

Tomorrow will be different. It's the deadline I've set for myself. Tomorrow I'll deploy the interferer and celebrate. My interferer will cause disturbances in all quantum fields at the boundaries of our cosmic lobe, resulting in subtle changes in remote corners of the universe. If you appreciate the ramifications of this, then you understand how this will lead to inter-lobe travel.  

Instead of the usual, preprogrammed small-talk routines—""370e799a406343ca4956a14786fbaf3e0bcd4bcf6e2a39a3a01c4f034c282afc?"" ""fb30d3b96d26583ac3cc03bd901f6b58db1d0698664092ca60eb61b913bea4fe!""—my friends and I will have something active to do. I'll experience novelty for the first time in I don't know how long. 

There will be cake. Well. . . something like cake. . . Okay, nothing like cake.",27
1lpar5q,n0w63ne,"I sashayed my way across the dance floor, offending at least three different species as I downed another elixer that was somewhat remiscent of an ale I'd had when I was 14 Earth years old. In that it tasted awful and I was only drinking it to get drunk at a party full of people I vaguely tolerated but didn't hate QUITE yet.

""Happy Birthday!"" Came the garbled translated voice of someone far less irritating and a bit more fun than most others.

""Benny Boy!"" I screamed and launched myself forward into a hug with the giant insectoid 'Benxibalbo'. At least that's how I think it's probounced. His pinchers snipped impatiently together as I looked down and saw I was impaled on his spines. ""Whoops"" I somehow slurred on the ""s"" and pulled myself off him.

""You're drunk."" He chittered.

""You're late."" I pointed at him. ""And I really... I mean I don't hate them. They'd need to be interesting for me to hate them."" 

""I'm late because there's an actual legitimate war going on outside."" The bug chittered.

""Oh that?"" I said glancing out the window at the raging fires and starships. ""That'll be over soon. C'mon, I know you like your mates big.""

""Mexy"", not my name, but he's not Benny either, ""they're fighting because of you.""

""Technically no."" I said. ""Tech... 'scuse me. Technically, they're fighting be-cause of the black hole."" 

""Which you caused."" The bug face said.

""Only because otherwise  they were gonna blow up my ship, and I don't wanna spend another galact-month in space.""

 ""And you hate chairs."" 

""I do also hate chairs."" I said as I sat on my throne. 

""But they'll be fine."" The bug monster did its best at sighing and looked at me with black exo-eyes.

""Sure... so you say she's big?""

""HUGE! And not even because she's a giant."" I said and started dragging my bug friend to meet a space orc woman dancing  so badly she was offending at least 8 species. Something I could only aspire to.",9
1lpgyfz,n0w2fao,"I'd hate to admit it, but that dastardly superhero Flintlock had a point. He was right that I didn't like being judged or questioned. Not for my fashion sense, not for my choice of career.

But he was wrong about me half the time. I wasn't going to be some lowlife who robbed banks. My plans were far grander than that. Neither would I have a total breakdown if my plans failed. No, I have more backup plans than he had braincells. Most importantly, he didn't know he was talking to a construct and not the real me.

Extroverts are overrated. At least they had a use. To keep this circus show of fancy flying bricks in costumes throwing boulders and punches at each other. Lobbing fireballs and shooting lightning. A fine distraction and display of super powers these foolish civilians loved to watch. Loved to stream live even if they could end up collateral damage.

All fine by me, as my true plans stayed hidden. Too boring, unflashy, not suited for social media videos. Mostly involved tinkering in my lab. Building doombots and constructs to be deployed on my orders. Why put myself at risk when I can hide in a basement lab while my creations do the job?

And after a while, it gets boring fighting the same superpowered dimwits with my robots. There's little strategy, a whole lot of brute force. Couldn't blame them, when they're powerful with very little that could compete with them save for a handful of supervillains and some of my inventions.

So, now I'm mass-producing and selling my bots in an underground market. Who doesn't want to be part of a superpowered fight from the safety of their basement? Some of my creations even have practical applications in the manufacturing industry. I could grow my fortunes to afford more equipment. To buy my way into power.

Political power.

Because superpowers are overrated. How many fights can Superman be in? One. Not like he could make copies of himself and be everywhere. But with my robots, I could be everywhere.

Alexis is dominating the music charts and billboards. Music is predictable. The same few beats. Slap a sexy woman in the music videos. All that's left is to insert a mind-altering track beneath, and her millions of listeners will be mine.

Many are chatting with Charlie. They ask her about the stresses in life. The family conflicts and drama. She is a virtual friend, a therapist, an adviser, everything they desired, but no longer sought among real humans. I have more than enough juicy intel to blackmail almost everyone in the country.

But my favourite bot is Lance. He's a politician now. He has convinced the Parliament to vote for even more tax cuts to businessmen like me. Made them sign laws to curb the destruction carried out by superheroes. The excessive collateral damage that cost this country billions. The people loved him. Agreed with him. Voted for him.

The only thing left is the approval of his Bill to outlaw vigilantism and superheroes.",22
1lpgyfz,n0urodw,"I can be a supervillain because what you describe are villains. Weak minded self centered weirdos. I’m not trying to rob someone I am trying to force the world into a new better version of itself. I must work from behind the scenes until it is too late. I may not even see the results of my actions, but the world will never be the same. To be a supervillain you must be working for a higher purpose than your bank account or power. Those are just rogues looking to carve out their own piece of the already broke. System. I may be afraid of how people judge my appearance but when the history books are written I will be revered as a visionary who was willing to dismantle the system and force real change.

1lphv9x,n0votcl,"I just started High School, in a new town, and befriended a few of my classmates.  
Talking about my hobbies, they start to make funny faces.  
Then, when I arrive at the point where I say: ""Yeah, we are regular middle-class, but it's not bad, once a year we go to Vanaheimr, or some other place."" they stopped me.  
""Matt...regular middle-class families don't go to other realms as vacation."" one of them says.  
""Or, if it's true, middle-class families don't have 4th dimensional time-shadows as pets."" another says.  
I pout.  
""Shady is cute though...he always makes sure we are on time."" I mutter.  
My new friends face-palm.

  
""Not the point."" Alice says.  
""Yeah, what else do you think it's regular middle-class?"" Tom asks.  
""Let's see...dad has a secret lab, mom can travel through space-and-time...  
My big sis is married to the sun, and my younger sister is now secretly spreading the cure for the big C.  
But I asked them, and they all said that this is normal stuff."" I say.  
They stare at me as if I was a fool.  
""If we told us giving 1 million dollars to friends is normal for a middle-class family?"" Alice asked.  
I took out my bag of holding, and took out one and a half big ingot of pure gold.  
""Like this?"" I ask.  
They push it back.

  
""Dude...have you ever had friends?"" Tom asks.  
I nod.  
""Yeah, I used to help them with homework, taking them back in time for history stuff. And some of them are now rich, rich. They are good. Sadly we drifted apart..."" I pout.  
Alice flicks my forehead.  
""I've known you for 2 months, and I like you, but damn, you are dumb.  
Lesson number 1 in common sense: superpowers, time-travel, monster and creatures are stuff of fiction."" she starts.  
""Lesson number 2: flaunting your wealth will make you either a target, a fool, or a cocky bastard."" Tom chimes in.  
I freeze.

  
They teach me about common sense, showing me proof of what average income is, and life expectancy and other stuff on the internet.  
I feel as if my whole life was a lie.  
""You okay?"" Alice asks.  
""We are sorry...we didn't want to make you feel bad..."" Tom adds.  
I struggle to smile at them.  
""N-No...thank you, for real...You just saved me from a fate worse than death one day. I...I have been lucky before, but the luckiest thing to happen to me is meeting you two.  
Now, if you excuse me."" I say, teleporting away, then back home, I realized it...  
Teleporting is also not something a regular person would do!

1lp4625,n0ruixb,"The 9-headed hydra was not a hydra at all.  
It was a Demon God that was playing the part of a monster, gathering blood, and resentment to fully descend onto our realm.  
The many strong adventurer groups that fell before us made sure that this Demon God is at more than half its true power.  
We were losing terribly.  
The Paladin's sword snapped in two, my mana was almost out, and couldn't heal anymore, and the rogue couldn't even approach the demon, and her arrows were out.  
The wizard, our best chance, was nigh out of mana as well, so he did something unexpected.  
He took off his wedding ring, and threw it into the sky, and we marveled as it expended into a portal.

  
""What? You are bringing more snacks for me?  
Thank you!"" the Demon's 9 heads laughed, as the miasma grew stronger.  
I looked at the wizard...who took out his pipe.  
""This be done in a minute."" he muttered, sitting down on a log.  
The paladin walked up to us, and so did the rogue, as we were all confused.  
""Haha! Good. You realized the futility of your struggle!  
I assure you, your blood and souls will be used for great things..."" the Demon smirks, but then freezes, as a pillar of light engulfs him.  
From the portal in the sky, a beautiful Goddess steps out, sighing.

  
""Took you long enough.  
Almost bashed in the barrier between the God Realms and the Mortal Realms, to come here myself."" she says to the wizard.  
""Sorry honey."" he says.  
We freeze.  
Honey? And that wedding ring? He is...married to a GODDESS?  
""Luxia! You! What are you doing here!? This is a mere lower tier mortal realm!"" the demon roars, as the pillar of light shatters, but the demonic miasma is now noticeably weaker.  
""Oh, if it isn't the little worm of Mammon.   
Pretending to be a 9-headed worm? How...disgusting."" she says, and waves her hand.  
Amidst screams, the demon simply disappears.

  
""Darling!"" she says, flying down to us, and to the wizard, kissing him.  
Then...she slaps him, and kisses him again.  
""Honey..."" he mutters, before being punched in the stomach.  
Then she turns to us.  
""Thank you for taking care of him, and disallowing him to drink."" he says, the last part specifically to me.  
I am confused, should I kneel?   
""No need. I am off, the little deity of this planet is getting fidgety with me being here.  
Come over for dinner sometime."" she says, leaving through the portal, as it shrinks, and flies down to become once more a ring on the wizard's finger.  
We stare at him, as he coughs, and continues smoking his pipe.  
""Will explain everything...first, let's try to find the Demon's lair, and loot it."" he says.  
We nod, but frankly at this point, even legendary gear is less interesting than the story behind what we just witnessed.",211
1lp4625,n0t3wjl,"The land we stood upon was cracked, smashed into pieces that were battered endlessly by a wind strong enough to push us back. This was it, this was the end of the world, against that King, gone mad with power. Before him stood a group of four, a Wizard with a White Ring and a God-Gifted Staff. A Paladin with a Grand Shield, and a Gauntlet of Power. A Cleric with an Emblem of Grace and a Symbol of Hope. Then, finally, me, a Bard, with an Emperor's Trumpet, and, to go along with it, the notes for the Song of Calamity. The four of us were the last hope of this planet, Gardenia. This King, mad with power, equipped with a wicked and terrible blade, was set on wiping it out entirely.

But we were exhausted. We were running out of hope. Each moment spent fighting only wore us out, as the mad King cackled with every hit he took. Our Paladin spoke up, she cried out hopelessness. I tried to reassure her, but our Cleric knew it was true. The Grand Shield, and the Symbol of Hope, two items vital to our victory, had been completely destroyed beyond use. Our Wizard, however, said we were not done. That  it was not over. That we could still win.

We all looked, as a dark and terrible emotion came over the Wizard's face. He held his hand, the one with the pure white ring. Such an insignificant detail to us, it was something he never told us about, and, soon, we realized why. He muttered, just barely audible over the roaring wind, ""I'm sorry."" as he grabbed the ring. As soon as he did, the wind stopped. Hesitation filled the very planet itself. The ring almost refused to come off, but, after a serious pull, the ring laid in the palm of our Wizard's hand, vibrating at an intense speed.

He threw it into the sky, with as much force as he could muster. A great, and terrible, force was upon us, as the ring expanded into a large portal, and the ground shook. It was another violent tremor, but this one seemed to never end. We barely managed to stay on our feet, and look to the sky, as, from the portal, descended a woman, with long, flowing black hair, white skin, and a pure white dress.  

What came next was a deafening silence, everything had stopped. The wind blew no more, the ground remained still, the King's senseless monologue had ceased. Quietude prevailed, except, for a soft piano melody echoing out of the portal. The woman's dress and hair both flowed in a nonexistent wind as she descended further, her body flying gently towards the Wizard. Not a word was said by him, as he hung his head in shame.

The Wizard would gently reach for the identical pure white ring on the Woman's hand, gently removing it without touching her. Then, it would fall to the floor, landing in the grass and dirt. Its companion in the sky would shrink back to its original state, falling from above to land next to it.

For a moment, everything was silent. The Woman would then stop flying, landing before the Wizard, and, her eyelids would part open. They would be giving way to a pair of beautiful red eyes. She looked into the Wizard's eyes for a few seconds, and reached her hand out. The Wizard, in response, would grab it. As soon as they touched, a radiant energy rapidly condensed upon the Woman, causing her to glow blindingly bright. 

Then the release would come, in the form of her body exploding violently. The sound that followed was sharp, like needles in the form of sound, and, in an instant, each of us would be engulfed in the explosion. It would produce a light so brilliant that it would burn the very Sun, destroying every one of us in mere seconds, leaving nothing behind except for a pair of scorched, tarnished, white rings. They would sit alone in a crater, being the only other trace of the deed done to save the planet.",49
1lp0c60,n0rpk63,"""Am I dying?"" Greg asked, staring at the doctor's X-ray charts, which indicated his organs had flipped to the other side. Where his heart was once on the right, it now nestled left. His pulse felt funny. His organs squelched beneath his skin, as though someone had shuffled them and stuffed whoopee cushions inside.

But worst of all, his favourite shirt now had mirror writing in a foreign language that he could no longer read.

""You're perfectly healthy, if mirrored,"" the doctor spoke like a man who had witnessed fifth dimensional geometry. ""What are you experiencing is a fourth dimensional rotation along the W-axis.""

""I thought it was X, Y, Z-axis?"" Greg was pretty sure he remembered high school geometry just fine.

""W-axis applies to fourth dimensional beings,"" the doctor didn't look up at all. ""Like the one who pranked you.""

""How do I get back at that little shit?"" Greg was incensed. ""Make him fix my shirt! Flip my organs right back where they belong!""

The doctor pulled out his phone and began scrolling through his contacts. ""I can make a few recommendations.""

**
--

Greg's attorney at Slugworth & Coldslay, an interdimensional law firm that specializes in extradimensional mischief, was Janet Slugworth. Who was an actual slug. With stubby cybernetic arms.

She slithered along the meeting table, leaving a trail of slime. ""We have a solid case. The private detective we hired has tracked down Glowar, the fourth dimensional entity who was careless enough to sign his name on your shirt. We have secured video evidence. He had filmed himself rotating you and uploaded it to TokTik. The only question is how much compensation we can secure.""

""A million Euros for the distress he caused.""

""My client cannot afford that,"" Hogsnort the eldritch lawyer blinked his dozens of eyes. ""Glowar understands he has committed the crime of unauthorized biological and topological reconfiguration of you, and believes the gift of a temporal paradox and fist-sized wormhole to be desirable compensation.""

""I'd like to see a fifth dimensional entity flip this fourth dimensional prankster upside down,"" Greg scowled, still feeling queasy from his briefly misplaced stomach. ""Let's see how you'd like that.""

""I propose you let me flip you,"" Hogsnort turned to Glowar. ""This is the cheapest compensation that the plaintiff desires. More affordable than offering a temporal paradox and wormhole. Or one million Euros.""

""No temporal paradoxes and wormholes,"" Slugworth insisted. ""My client only wants a million Euros or for Glowar to be mirror-flipped by someone of an additional dimension more faceted than he is. Otherwise, we'll be seeing you in court, and I strongly believe the judge will rule in our favor.""

Glowar sniffed and sobbed. ""Ah fuck this. Flip me, Hogsnort.""

Thus, Hogsnort waggled his tentacles and flipped his client like a transdimensional pancake. Glowar was rotated around the U-axis, resulting in his guts spinning out of his body. His name wrapped around an incomprehensible axis to warp into Rawolg. The words on his shirt were a doubly mirrored, double Dutch twist of cursive that even the supernatural entities in the room couldn't read any of it.

""Can I sue Hogsnort for this?"" Rawolg moaned.

""Of course not,"" his lawyer retorted. ""I executed this out-of-court settlement correctly as per Article 9 of the Interdimensional Extradimensional Rotation Accords. You will remain in this state until you rotate Greg correctly into his normal three-dimensional configuration. And fix his favourite shirt.""

I'm just guessing here (it's been a while since I read about that), but getting your body flipped from left to right like that _should_ flip your biochemistry, too - some enzymes and whatnot are especially shaped like they are, because the molecules they work on can come in left-handed and right-handed varieties, but for some reason, practically all biology on earth does only use one side of these. When they match, all is fine and dandy, but for you as a flipped being, this is bad news: flipped enzymes don't work on 'normal' stuff, and so you can eat all you want, but still starve (or otherwise die in unpleasant ways) 😬...",12

1lpgxll,n0vbru0,"I am not a saint, though perhaps I am a savior. I was a well intentioned Don Quixote. But what The Eternal Star granted me is real. Gifts of intelligence, cognitive abilities that seem supernatural. I do not trust it, but if this Star can make a lowly creature like me into a demigod, destroying us all should have been trivial, were that what it wanted.

I wanted to give of myself to help others. I wanted to do so so badly that it slowly wore away my sanity. Even in the depths of madness, it defined me. It spoke to me after I had fought another battle against the adversary that existed only in my head. I still remember the words, ""Your noble sacrifice for the greater good has proven you worthy in the eyes of this Eternal Star. You will be entrusted with a great power, and the future of this planet. Rise, and help them build a better tomorrow."" I thought it was simply something pulling me even deeper into my neurosis, but shortly after hearing those words, I began to claw back my sanity.

I found intelligence inside myself, more than I had ever had before I fell into the pit of madness. For a time I thought it was simply healing, but that evaporated in the face of a cognitive transformation. I found I could master skills in days instead of years. Three months after encountering this called The Eternal Star, a self administered intelligence test indicated that my IQ was so high that it could not accurately measure it. Only then did I start to believe that it was something more than a voice in my head.

I relished learning before receiving the gift, and now I feasted on information. The exaltation of rapid growth and learning. In one year, I gained the skills of two dozen bachelor's degrees. Even then, I understood that the growth of my intelligence was still accelerating. I was confronted by the conundrum of what to do with all this new found ability and knowledge. The course of maximum positive impact. Even with my formidable mind, I was overwhelmed with possible paths.

Ultimately, I settled upon spearheading development of safe and effective artificial intelligence and maintaining the peace between nation states. Making sure synthetic intelligence would not be abused and making sure that the tremendous wealth it would generate was not monopolized. Even with my abilities, the murk of geopolitics was difficult to see through. All I had to do was prevent apocalyptic conflict while the technologies needed to eliminate scarcity kicked in.

In fifteen years, safe, aligned, and widely accessible artificial superintelligence became a reality. The incentives for large-scale warfare were dying, along with most of the reasons for warfare in general. I moved away from work on technology, and set my sights upon a rigorous system of ethics. A sprawling edifice of thought designed to handle every edge case, drawing on the ideas about morality other thinkers had shared through human history. Juggling so many different concerns and values, invoking game theory, and finessing and fine tuning so many different hypotheticals.

My creation became the ethical foundation for the human metaculture as expansion into space became a reality. Not only guiding human ideas about morality, but also providing a rigorous moral system for the synthetic intelligences to operate under. Industries were moved into orbit or other celestial bodies. I watched the dawn of a golden age, the end of so many of our civilization's demons. Biological and digital immortality were invented entirely independently of my intervention. I continued making small nudges to our long term trajectory, and strove to give everyone the tools to chart the best possible course. But, even with all my ability, it was becoming clear that they were accelerating faster than I could ever hope to keep up with enitrely.

As I write, the golden age has now lasted for thousands of years. I still look for potential threats, potential flashpoints. But for the most part, we have the tools to resolve such conflicts long before there is even a risk of violence. I contemplate physics, I make some contributions to the state of the art in some specific niches. Most of my time goes towards grappling with the existence and nature of The Eternal Star who set all this in motion. It represents a blind spot, one even our best science has failed to explain. We have come so far, yet it is clear that our story has only just begun.",7
1lpm4px,n0wd623,"""What's got you in a fuss?"" asks Jessica, the woman next to me. She smells sweet, like plums. I toss my phone across the room, wedging it deep into the couch. Even if I forget it's there, I'll find it eventually. The damn thing always seems to end up in the same place.

""Some woman keeps sending me videos."" I'm grumpy. I'm told I'm always grumpy.

""And you don't like them?"" asks Jessica. It's a stupid question.

""Of course not! She keeps saying it's me and my daughter and that she's my wife. I don't have a bloody daughter! Never even been married!""

Jessica looks concerned, at least, so far as I can tell. I don't like looking at her when I'm like this. I don't like looking at *anyone* when I'm like this. I just wish they'd all leave me alone, but it feels like the more I resist, the more they prod and pry. But perhaps I shouldn't take it out on Jessica. She tries hard with me. I can tell.

""Sorry. It's just. It's annoying is all. People get spam all the time, but this feels different. It's so... personal.""

Jessica nods and stands. ""That sounds difficult. I get why that would be scary.""

""Not scary, just strange. The guy doesn't even look like me.""

BZZT. I can hear the buzz from across the room. Both Jessica and I stare. She walks to the floral couch, pulling my phone from the cushions with ease. Like I said, always in the same place.

""Show me."" She flashes the phone in front of me. The font is big but I still need my glasses. ""I just need your face,"" she adds. Of course, I always forget. I look head on and it unlocks. Jessica pulls away and taps about. Most might care about privacy, but I've got nothing to hide, at least nothing that I can remember, and if I can't remember as it ever really that important?

""Well, would you look at that?"" Jessica smirks. It's the same damn smirk when she knows she's right about something. ""He's pretty handsome, I gotta say.""

Again, she flashes my phone in front of me. I back up. She always puts it too close.

""This is a different video!"" I protest. The gall to get all cheeky when she can't even find the same message as before.

""It's the same family though, isn't it?"" says Jessica. I look again. It is. ""Looks like they're having a fun time too, don't they?""

The man wrestles a little girl then tosses her across the room onto a floral couch.

""Hey! They've got the same couch as me!"" I almost laugh. The jokes on them; it's terrible.

""Well, well,"" says Jessica, ""Isn't that strange. Maybe they bought it at the same place?""

""No, it's one of a kind. Sarah's father built it for us when we got married. Never did like it. But it was a gift, so...""

A real smile creeps up on Jessica's face. She liked that story for some reason. ""It made a lot of good memories though, didn't it?""

""Yeah.""

""Kind of like these?"" Jessica hands me my phone opened to the photos app. Its the same man and the same girl. Some of the videos play on their own. They're... wonderful. Each and every one. For a moment, the world seems to fade away. I scroll, and scroll, and scroll. I could watch forever. There's a woman in some of these too; one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. I can barely look away.

Jessica places her hand on mine. I look into her eyes and at once I see it.

""You're... you're...""

""Mhmm.""

I smile. ""My little plum."" How could I forget? 

""The woman in the photos..."" I start.

""Would you like to see her?""

I can't even think up the words to say. A simple nod will have to do. Jessica pulls my hand, up and away from the sofa.

""Come on, dad. She's been waiting.""",15

I stared at the large person towering over me, struggling to find an answer to the absurdity of the question. Or was it a statement? The implication was that the question he asked was basic. But who defined basic? A raft of objections flooded through my head. The baker next door had his entire process and ingredient ratios as basic knowledge, but would be stumped by the blacksmith's questions on what color the iron should be when shaping. The glasswright knew what types of glass was good to use for windows, but not which saw was best to cut across the grain when making furniture. The night watchman knew which streets to watch more closely, but not which aisle held the books on the history of cloth making in the library. The book binder could tell what type of tree a piece of paper came from, but would not be able to answer What consistency the mortar needed to be when laying stone for a house wall. 

""I'M WAITING!!!"" HIs yell cut through my rapid thoughts, and I became conscious of the shuffling and murmurs behind me in line.

""Sir, do you have a list of things that you consider basic knowledge that I can study?""

It was his turn to stare, looking even more ridiculous in his purple and white clothes. There were laughs quickly suppressed around the room. What? It seemed like a reasonable question. If there was a list of basic knowledge, anyone could study it. Maybe we could even give it to people who already knew it as a to-do list and have children gather around them every day to learn about more. The sarcastic thought tugged at the corners of my mouth in humor.

The voice was quiet, dangerous, now, ""Are you laughing at me?""

Oh shit. I did it again. How could I explain? I couldn't. It never went well. The funny thought was in my head, a path the conversation could take, but wasn't. He would understand if he let me explain, but everyone hated my explanations. I always got in more trouble with them. Silence is best. Right. Got to remember that better. Maybe shutting up now works?

A rough hand grabbing my collar, hauling me out of the desk, a sharp whack of my knee to one of the legs, trying to keep my feet under me as I was propelled toward the door.

""I will not mock the teacher"" I wrote for the six hundredth time on the paper before me, glancing through my eyebrows at the figure of the detention monitor boredly flipping through a book. It was just us in here now, but twice as many people here than I wanted. It was also very typical. The whole thing was puzzling. Every time I was asking a question that I genuinely wanted to know the answer to and every time people got angry at me. It happened in school, it happened at home, it happened at church. No one liked me asking questions. And every time they tried to punish me in a way that only left me curious. Writing this phrase a thousand times is only keeping my fingers occupied, I've added at least 20 new questions that no one's going to want to answer while I'm writing. It keeps me from having to go home though, so I don't mind it at all. 

That was another part of the reactions that puzzled me. They always tried to punish me in ways that didn't really matter to me. At home my dad would always send me to my room, when the thing I almost always wanted was to be alone anyway. I could fathom that they were trying to punish me to change my behavior, but they didn't understand me or my behavior at all so it didn't do anything. Well, not really. I was learning a whole lot about behavior and motivations. I would rather be going back through the books on the shelf, I see a few bindings that weren't there yesterday, but I would get this finished soon enough and would have a few hours to enjoy that before being sent home. See? I'm already past 700. My fingers know what to do.

""Where have you been?"" My dad's voice wasn't a yell, he never yelled. Mom did all the yelling. But I could still feel the intensity, the determination to have an answer. 

I glanced over at my brother, who had known. He was ignoring it all. Of course he didn't bother to tell them. ""I was held back in detention again.""

""Again?"" a pause, ""go to your room until dinner.""

I turn away before rolling my eyes. He doesn't even care enough to ask why. What else is new. My bag bounced off the door frame as I slipped into my room, bringing a grin to my face. I had two new books this time.",21
1lp50t5,n0s0nsf,"I stare at this man that makes me feel things I never felt before.  
A man that makes stars shiver in his presence.  
And shake my head.  
""I can also feel this connection. This love you are speaking about, but...  
It is still forced.  
I don't know you, and you don't know me."" I say.  
He smiles.

  
""I know that you are perfect.  
And I know that I love you, and that our love is the truest love out there in this infinite universe.  
A love made through will, and need, without fate or destiny or any deity messing with our threads!"" he says.  
I smile.  
""Still...  
I am married. Happily so."" I say.  
He freezes.  
Oh boy...here it goes.

  
""I saw the ring on your finger, and assumed it, but it doesn't matter.  
I can feel the way you feel towards me, and the love you have towards your husband, is nothing compared to what we have!"" he says.  
I hate it that he is right.  
""Doesn't change the fact that I do love him.  
And that I don't know you, so please, leave."" I say.  
He frowns, and light fades from our surroundings.  
""What if we were to get to know each other?  
Speak, and go on walks, travel the universe? I could show you eternity, and moment, and the birthplace of deities!  
Your husband has no say in this."" he says, grabbing my hand.  
I sigh.

  
""Most likely I would fall for you, and most likely we would truly be in love, but...  
I couldn't ever shake the feeling of it being forced, randomly appearing here, stating that you willed our love into existence...  
What difference would that have, between you doing this, or a deity?"" I ask.  
He frowns.  
""And my husband, the man I love...if he heard about us...  
He would smile, ask me if I truly love you, and if I say yes, he would wish us happiness and leave, and I...  
I can't hurt him. And I won't leave him."" I say.  
He pales, nods, and simply disappears.  
As color comes back to reality, I collapse, my whole body trembling.  
I go inside, where I see a portrait of my husband and I, and smile...  
""This is perfect...I won't do something so stupid."" I mutter, trying to forget this encounter.  
Willing love into existence...and finding my name through the shattered bones of destiny...  
If that isn't forced love...what is?  
At least a God of Love just does their duty, but this man...sigh, forget it.  
Better to just ignore it, but I doubt that will be possible for long.",7
1lp1dxw,n0ramr2,"I look in the mirror, as the kids scream bloody murder outside, and inside my mansion.  
I sigh.  
For eons I have taken care of, and raised abandoned children I found during my travels across Hell, Fae lands, and the myriad mortal worlds.  
It wasn't easy.  
For one: as a Duchess of Hell, I have quite a few contenders that would do anything to either kill me, or marry me,or both.  
And two...many kids are not demons, yet raised in Hell, so I had to spend a lot to make sure the miasma isn't corrupting them.  
And now this...in the mirror, angelic wings, budding, but still, angelic, are slowly growing out of my back.  
Great.

  
I hide them under a black tank top, as I try my best to will them to fold, and go downstairs.  
The humans and elves are waging war again, as the demon kids try the best to mediate the problems.  
The few dwarves are busy building wooden weapons, and selling to the highest bidder, while the 2 Giant young ones, are shivering, hidden in a corner, afraid.  
I clap, and they all stop.  
""Mother!"" they scream, rushing towards me.  
I laugh, as I raise them all into the air with my magic, and take them inside, where I prepared food already.  
Sure, I am a strong demon, and could have servants, and maids, and whatnots...  
But after a few kids went missing eons ago...  
I don't employ anyone anymore.

  
""Mom! Have you heard about Oaken Leaf?!"" an elven lass asks.  
I nod.  
""She left Hell for the Azure Springs Realm. There she was hired as a personal tutor for an elven princess, and I hear she's now courted by 2 princes, and 1 noble.  
She's doing great."" I smile.  
""What about Duzuff?!"" a dwarf burps.  
I flick his forehead.  
""Manners. Also, Duzuff is now the chief blacksmith of a Vampire Viscount down south from us. From what I hear, all the vampire blacksmiths fear and respect him."" I say.  
They laughed, saying ""That's so Duzuff!"", I smiled.

  
Over the years, the kids I took care of, and raised left, and spread all across the various worlds, and regions.  
""Do you ever miss them?"" one of the human kids asks.  
I nod.  
""Yes. They are my children, just like you are."" I say, and they laugh, and thank me for the food, before going to wash the dishes.  
Good kids.  
I leave, watching the many portraits hanging on the walls...all portraits of the kids.  
I pass a mirror and freeze.  
My skin...my purple skin...is turning...golden?  
And my horns...they shortened, and the bulge on my back is getting hard to be contained.  
I look at the kids, and sigh.

I have to read some history books...",142
1lp1dxw,n0vtqmu,"A copse of trees on the crest of a knoll long forgotten by the living. 

They are my children. Planted in fall, they sleep until spring. I find them everywhere. 

Resting on the seat of office chairs standing together in a still office. Floating alongside fluttering colorful kites buoyed by coastal winds. 

People have them all the time, yet abandon them so easily. Toss them like trash, or worse yet, simply forget about them.

Dreams. Hopes. 

I ask if they’d like to leave with me, and they always say yes. 

I cater to their idiosyncrasies, nurture their souls. Until they decide their time has come to an end. 

Planted in fall, they sleep until spring, until they shoot up into the sky and forget their meager existence. 

I do this for… I’m not sure how long. Since there has been time. But the skin on my back starts to tighten. I reach across my chest towards my back and hesitate. I know what’s there. I put my hand down. 

I start changing. I’m lighter. Brighter, people look at me with kindness when before they couldn’t even glance at me. I’d roll my eyes, if I had eyes.

One day, my skin breaks, a wet trail of blood running down my back. So much relief.

I knew this day was coming. I rest my head against rough bark I hadn’t had a chance to say goodbye to yet. 

My wet, bloodied angelic wings drag along the ground, collecting dry leaves and other forest accoutrement, as I make my way to the edge of the copse.

I shoot up in the air, like my children before me, and leave my one beautiful life.",7
1lpeste,n0ump39,"##Ghost Chores

Chelsie lay in her room on her iPad scrolling through videos. One in ten made her giggle enough to leave a like. The rest were dull and pointless. She closed the app to check her social media feed.

""I was enjoying that."" A voice echoed in her room. Chelsie looked up to see a teenage boy in a suit float before her.

""Ulysses, this is my tablet time,"" Chelsie said.

""You aren't using it though. You are unimpressed by moving pictures, but they're a miracle for me."" Ulysses pointed at her and began to shake. His eyes widened and watered. Chelsie sighed and stood up.

""Don't walk away from me. You need to learn how to appreciate your belongings. I saw you not brush your teeth which would've saved my life."" Chelsie shut the door to her room. Ulysses continued to shout, but she couldn't hear him. 

When she moved to her kitchen, her mother was seated at the table while Mabel was mopping, cooking chili, making brownies, tossing the cake she made yesterday, and tending to the garden outside. Her mother was doing a crossword puzzle.

""I thought you said that you wanted to cook today?"" Chelsie asked.

""I did, but Mabel insisted on doing the chili. She said she never got the chance to cook it in her lifetime.""

""But she's made it lots for us.""

""What can I say? I am just helpful."" Mabel twisted her head around smiled. Her dress was covered with stains, and her arms moved rapidly. Chelsie never knew if the living Mabel was this much of a busy body. Either way, she didn't have to do chores like the rest of the house.

""By the way, your dad isn't happy with you,"" her mom said.

""Why?""

""Today, you were supposed to handle Derek. He had to do it two days in a row,"" her mom said.

""Oh no."" Chelsie ran down to the basement. Her father stood at the ping pong table drenched in sweat. 

""One more game."" A young man wearing a leather jacket jumped opposite him.

""Dad, I can take over."" Chelsie ran to her father. 

""No, he's my opponent now. Let's race."" Derek dropped the paddle and ran. Her father flailed his limbs, but he moved a few steps before almost falling.

""You lose. Let's play again,"" Derek said.

""Is it supper yet?"" he asked.

""Uh, I think it'll be a half hour,"" Chelsie said.

""I'll be there if I am still alive, but you need to cover one of my days,"" he said.

""Okay."" Chelsie left her father to get destroyed by a ghost. When she returned, her brother Michael came in from outside looking annoyed. He spotted his sister.

""Your turn with Grace."" He walked past his sister. An old woman floated to the door.

""Is this really how you keep a house? There is dust everywhere,"" she said.

""I am sorry."" Mabel stopped what she was doing and began to grovel.

""You should be. You are a waste of ectoplasm."" Grace's disgust caused Mabel to glow and shake. Chelsie ran to the matriarch.

""I want to hear about the flowers,"" Chelsie said. 

""There's nothing to hear. They're awful. Grass is horrid two."" Grace made her way to the backyard, and Chelsie followed. Mabel recovered inside.

She wished she could watch videos again, but either Grace would criticize her or Mabel would insist on cleaning it. It was hard sharing a house with ghosts who only experienced the most extreme emotions. Mabel's chili hit her nose and smelled delicious. At least one was a good cook.

1lp4qsn,n0s3sys,"I was treating a witch that added Boiled Boil Toad Oil instead of Boiled Toad Oil to a cauldron, and burnt herself, when another doctor at our hospital came in, all pale.  
""Chief...w-we have a big problem!"" he stutters.  
I look at the witch, and smile.  
""My apologies, my colleague here will continue your treatment, as another patient seems to need my attention."" I say to her, as I hand her over to the doctor.  
""Just bandage her burn, I already cleaned, and treated it with Ice Breath Grass, and a minor Dragon salve."" I say.  
He nods, and makes me hurry. I leave, wondering what is worrying him so much, after all, our hospital specializes in treating magical ailments, and injuries...what could be so bad?

  
I enter the lobby to see mages, wizards, and other magical professions in the waiting room staring at a man, alongside several nurses, and newbie doctors. He was a tall man, with scales all over his body, and...8 little stumps on his neck, growing small heads.  
I sigh.  
""Take him to Room 0, and postpone my meetings for today."" I say to one of the nurses, as I rush towards my office, to take some of the heavier magic pills.  
Entering Room 0, I saw that the stumps grew ever so slightly.  
""Warlock Ashtor, happy to make your acquaintance doctor."" he says.  
I nod.

  
""Doctor Smith, and I will take care of you today, Ashtor.  
Let me ask you, have you tried to induce a hydra bloodline into your body, and it failed?"" I ask, struggling to take a blood sample, as his blood melted all the needles I tried with.  
He shakes his head.  
""Succeeded too well. What I thought was an infant hydra blood, was actually a half-step divine hydra's heart blood, and I succeeded instantly."" he says.  
Oof...that's bad.  
""So instead of bloodline integration that you warlocks go through, you are going through complete bloodline take-over, slowly transforming into a hydra."" I ask.  
He nods.

  
I give him a 9 Suns Burning Pill, and a Golden Earth-Returning Lotus Pill.  
""The 9 Suns Pill will burn away the hydra bloodline, while the other pill will ensure you won't die in the process, and if you are lucky enough you might retain a trace of hydra bloodline, which you can use for integration."" I say.  
He shivers.  
""Will it be dangerous?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""Your chances of survival are 3 out of 10. But I will be here, casting healing magic constantly, and with herbs, and pills ready."" I say.  
""Alright. I agree, let's start."" he says, I give him a contract first, then tie him to the bed, and watch as he takes the pills. His body burns brightly, as the Lotus pill heals him instantly, his screams are terrible, but I cast a silence spell over this Room, so it won't bother the others.  
I watch as the scales turn brighter, then fall, and his stumps struggle...one moment he is human, the other hydra, as the bloodline fights back.  
I keep my focus, and maintain a steady stream of healing magic on his body, and soul, this won't be a short operation.  Then, I can't help myself, and I smile.  
This is why I became a doctor...dealing with interesting stuff like this, saving lives, is much better than waging wars, or being buried in books like other mages...",26
1loogq7,n0p38az,"John clutched his dog tightly. They huddled together without a care. Without caring that the world all around them was collapsing. Buildings crumbled to dust. Cars were swept up into the wind and vanished in a twinkle.

They only heard each other's heartbeats, not the screams of the other humans as they were reduced to blood smears on the ground. Together, they would wait for the end of the world.

Then everything went white.

When he opened his eyes, everything was still white. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sterile equipment beeping. And the pale old man with wiry white hair standing over him.

""You can't be serious,"" the old man said, pushing up his glasses and adjusting his lab coat. ""They said you were the best. We were hoping you could save the world when the Apocalypse comes upon us. Yet simulation after simulation, all you ever cared was for your dog?""

""It was a gift from my wife,"" John arms still wrapped around thin air where a dog once was in the simulation. ""You have no idea everything I did to be free and to be with her.""

""We do,"" the scientist tried to keep a straight face. ""That's why you were chosen to prevent the Apocalypse. Our directors had hoped you would find the source of the destruction, fight any armed guards along the way, and stop it before it blows all of earth to kingdom come.""

John maintained a steely gaze. ""Why is this world worth saving? This world that would never let me retire. To live quietly in peace. Everyone who comes to me, they want something from me. They want me to kill.""

""What else would we ask of you?"" The scientist was bewildered. ""Would you prefer if this operation brought you in to rescue as many dogs and hide them in a bunker?""

""Yes.""

""Well, that wouldn't stop the Apocalypse. Or the men and women engineering it,"" the researcher was close to tearing his hair out. ""Who ought to be killed before they doom us all.""

""Perhaps that is the only way I can be free of this life,"" John stated softly.

""We can promise you freedom. A new identity. A quiet retirement.""

""That's what they all promised,"" John said. ""Every time, someone else drags me back into the fold. I'm tired. Are you not also tired from repeating this simulation over and over again?""

""One last time,"" the scientist held out one finger.

""No.""

""What would you have us do? Wait for the end?"" he was distraught. ""Just sit and die quietly? Nobody else is more suited to this mission than you are, John Wick.""

1loogq7,n0ps1yq,"“A survivor?” The old man murmured, rubbing the dried blood from his forehead, wincing when his palm connected with the scabbed over wound. “You can’t be serious. Someone survived that? Impossible” He pulled his hand away from his forehead, adjusting his glasses. The shift allowing a piece of the wound to reopen, sending a trickle of blood over the frame of his glasses. “What is that ball of fluff you're holding?” He asked, his words coming out in a daze as he held onto the table’s edge to keep his balance.
 
Damien shivered, clutching Pearl closer to his chest. The small dog tucked tightly against its owner’s body, stealing as much warmth as it could get from him. Around the cold table they sat on were several machines, some with frayed wires, while others smoked or bellowed with their last dying beeps. He didn’t feel any pain, having expected to feel a lot worse when the world flashed white, instead he felt nothing.
 
“She’s Pearl. A poodle,” Damien said, giving the dog a gentle pat. “Who are you?”
 
“Anthony? Mark? Adam? I can’t remember anymore. I’m everyone and everything. At least I was.” He again rubbed at his forehead, this time moving around the edges of his thin grey hairs, touching two shallow holes on his head that were heavily bruised. Each rub he gave around the hole made him wince, though he kept repeating the action, as if it would stir his memory.
 
“What should I call you?” As the words left Damien’s lips, the door rattled, a heavy burst of knocks coming from it.
 
“We know you’ve unplugged yourself, Victor. Get back in the chair. This is your last warning.” A no-nonsense voice shouted behind the door. Both Victor and Damien tensed, with Pearl even letting out a small squeal at the noise, burying her head further into her owner’s body.
 
“Victor, I guess.” The old man said, dragging his feet as he circled the room they were in. He dragged a bony finger against a metallic chair in the corner, reluctantly drawing closer to it. The chair reminded Damien of something you would see on death row, having a large silver bowl dangling overhead, one with two plugs that contained five thick spikes on each of the plugs. Before the old man sat, he stared at Damien, that hazy stare fading momentarily as the relaxants in his body faded. “Are you real?”
 
“I… I believe so?” Damien had never been asked that question before, and in the past, he would have been confident in answering it. Though, given what he was seeing, this had him questioning everything. That was until Pearl wiggled her head up his chest, licking the bottom of his chin, before planting her head back against his body, that being enough to convince him he was real. “I am.”

“I… created life?” The old man pushed away from the chair, approaching Damien. With a shaking hand, he gently squeezed Damien’s cheek. “I created you.”
 
“What are you doing?” Damien shifted his jaw, trying to lazily move his cheek away from the man without moving his head.
 
“VICTOR. GET. IN. THE. CHAIR.” The voice shouted, and the banging grew louder, with the reinforced door now bouncing, threatening to spill open at any moment.
 
“That’s right. I’m Victor, the head researcher here. This was the company I helped create. I reinforced my door, kept my room private, making sure they couldn’t access my files. So, my encryptions held up. Company must have changed hands, either that or the research has gotten unethical. Don’t remember anyone banging on my door like this in the past.” He theorized to himself. “And you. What is your name, my son?”
 
“Damien.” He breathed.
 
“Damien. I always wanted a boy called Damien. Could never have kids, that’s why I spent so much time doing this. Our research was simple: we plug into people’s minds and allow them to live in a reality of their creation. It’s useful for those that can’t function in society any longer. It could also potentially cure coma patients. But… how are you here?”
 
“VICTOR.” Again, the door was struck. This time, a few bolts bounced away, scattering across the floor.
 
“I don’t want to imagine what they would do if they found you. A creation pulled from my mind. I brought someone into this world. I played god. If they found out about you….” Victor grimaced. “They can’t.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t get what you're saying. I can’t be a creation of yours. I’m human. I had a life. How could you have created my whole life?”
 
“I didn’t intend to.” He said, ducking underneath the table, pulling at a panel beneath it. “Our mind’s a powerful tool. When you dream, you create a world without putting any conscious thought into it. Our machines allow us to harness that mental activity, and with some careful prompting by the machine, it generates a world using our mind’s power and creativity. Mine’s an older model, newer ones can be prompted. Say you wanted to be a hero, or a barista, you could enter that into the machine and it would steer you towards it.” He placed a wire between his teeth, pulling it with his jaw. The wire snapped, and the panel fell away, revealing a hole and ladder.

“That’s insane.” Damien said, and Pearl barked in agreement, the small white fluff ball now walking over to the old man, sniffing at the ladder he had revealed.
 
“It is. I was only in that world to gather information on how it works. Seems the man I left in charge of freeing me either died or got fired. They probably forgot all about me until my room flashed red.” He said with a dry laugh, looking at the complete disarray of his laboratory. “I’m not sure how you came out of my mind. But I can’t let you get discovered. I build an emergency escape beneath this table. Run along.”
 
The door squeaked, and Victor spotted the mean glare of the guard behind it. His face drenched with sweat, having attempted to break the door down for the last twenty minutes. Victor followed the man’s field of vision, making sure he couldn’t see Damien or the dog. It was hard to say if he had even peeked into the room, or if he had been too busy with the door to even think about trying to catch a glimpse inside. Regardless, Victor played it safe, staying on his knees, grabbing Pearl. “Come on.” He whispered to Damien.
 
Damien crawled towards the hole, and when he reached the ladder, he climbed down it, landing in a small tunnel. Victor handed the dog down the ladder before smiling. “Keep heading down the tunnel, boy. It will drop you into the Bulnar forest. Go north from there and you’ll get to town. Oh, here.” He reached into his pockets, dropping his keys and some cash down to Damien. “I live at Forty four Grooleria street. You can use my house until you figure out things on your own. Good luck.”

“Thanks?” Damien awkwardly caught the items, having to try not to drop the wiggling Pearl. After putting the items into his pockets, he lowered Pearl to the floor. “Let’s go.”
 
Victor watched Damien leave, and leaned the panel cover against the bottom of the table, not having enough time to fully put it back into place. He then went over to the machine, sat himself in it, and hit a button on its arm, gritting his teeth as the machine went back into his mind, leaving him slumped against it, drooling onto himself.  
 
The door finally came down, followed by a roaring. “VICTOR.” The heavily armored guard marching over to the chair, huffing. “You think that was funny? Making me work my ass off to break down your door?” He pulled his hand back, slapping the unconscious old man across his cheek. “Whatever. Guess it doesn’t matter as long as you're back in the chair. What a dump this room is. How long’s it been since anyone’s even been in here?” The guard went to inspect the room, only to grumble as his phone let out a soft flute jingle announcing another person had woken up. He slipped his phone from his pocket, the screen flashing a bright red with the number 022 following it. He slithered his phone back into place, heading to room 022, allowing Damien and Pearl to escape.

My body felt flushed, courtesy of the radiation from the bombs still raining down. I was sure they weren't doing much better. ""Don't worry, guys,"" I said softly. ""It'll all be over soon.""

Cheeto gave one tiny complaint, licked my finger, and closed her eyes, tucking her head down. One breath, then two, then ... nothing. I wanted to cry, or scream, but I was too sick and tired to do more than a ragged sigh.

Everything turned white. I stared fixedly at the ceiling, in between the two light fixtures. I had lost track of the number of simulations they had put me through.

Dr. Kepler leaned over me, blocking the light. ""Why?"" he asked, voice somewhere between agony and anger. ""Why won't you fight back? The quantum simulator shows quite simply that the survival of humanity - possibly even the survival of Earth - depends on you!""

My eyes - empty, soulless, and dry of tears, stared at his. ""You've spent the last year since the discovery of that alien vessel strapping me down and putting me through hell. Why should I save you?""

He threw up his hands and turned away, even as the table began moving, automatically adjusting my body to be released. So I could be sent back to my cell. When I was in a sitting position, the straps loosened. I could have attacked him. But I didn't bother. I'd seen his death in enough simulations.

The guards brought me back to my cell, and I immediately went to the cage, pulling them out of their hammock one at a time and cuddling them to my chest. Goober bit my finger in protest at being woken up - not hard, just enough to complain.

Jerry, one of the guards, stared at me from the door. ""You're really going to let humanity die? After everything?""

I turned to stare at him. Then I pointedly looked around my cell. ""After everything, why would I save them?""

He scowled at me. ""This is different!""

""No it's not,"" I cut him off before he could start yelling at me again. ""All the atrocities of human history, my imprisonment and daily forced hell is just a tiny drop in an ocean of evil. If I defeat those aliens, then in a thousand years, or maybe sooner, we'll be the ones dropping towards an unsuspecting planet to massacre the inhabitants.""

""We won't do that anymore,"" he tried.

I snorted. ""Humans have always done that. If you think that discovering actual alien life will change the fundamental 'kill people and take their stuff' aspect of humanity, you're more delusional than I am.""

Jerry flushed with anger, and took half a step forward. ""I oughta crush one of those little rats and teach you -""

He didn't finish the rest of the sentence. One foot lashed out, snapping his knee sideways with a loud pop. The hand not holding my babies slammed his head into the wall right on the doorframe, snapping his neck on the reinforced metal frame.

Shouting came from the corridor as the other soldiers drew weapons - tasers, batons, flashbang grenades. I stepped away from Jerry's body, my free hand raised, as Goober and Cheeto started crabbing loudly. ""They're marsupials, dumbass,"" I told his corpse.

I lay down on the bed in the cell, letting the babies get comfortable on my chest. Was he really dead? Who knew. It wouldn't be the first time I ""woke up"" straight into a new simulation, nor the first time someone I had killed showed up again. I had been through so much my brain couldn't tell what was reality and what was simulation anymore.

All i knew was that these tiny, amazingly soft creatures loved me, and I loved them, the only thing that never changed. Everything else could burn.

1loogq7,n0tygnv,"""...you can't be serious...""

""PAY UP ASSHOLE!""

To say I'm stunned would be an understatement. Stunned is when your best friend announces she's pregnant or when your dad starts sleeping on the couch to signal an impending divorce. No, this was something far beyond that. Mindboggled? Irreversibly shocked? Worried that I'm dead and this is some strange hallucination as my mind flushes those final pulses of electricity from it? Traumatized?

The small tuxedo cat I had spent the last ten years was supposed to be in my arms. When everyone's phones chimed with the announcement, the shrieks of despair echoed throughout the streets. The instantaneous onset of mourning pulled the air from the room, a final whoosh of oxygen before fire bursts forth from the door.

The bombs were coming. Too many arguments between the men who we so foolishly called our leaders had finally come to a head. A flurry of fat fingers slamming in nuclear codes, decrees that ""that'll show them"" as missile silos the world over revealed their homes in the inconspicuous dirt of your own backyard.

What was there to do? Of course I was scared. The impulse to survive flooded my body with adrenaline, a perfect execution of the human design. Except this was no lioness stalking me across a savannah. I could not outrun this, none of us could. While so many others would spend their final moments flailing against the unbreakable chains they found themselves entwined in, I would surrender to reality.

I would die with Patches in my arms.

Patches, the sweet old man who had once been a small kitten sleeping in the pouch of my hoodie. Boyfriends came and went, both of my parents died, I moved to New York City to start anew with nothing but a duffel bag in one hand and Patches's carrier in the other.

When I heard the boom, I cradled him in my arms. The last thing I would smell was the warm familiarity of his fur. How many tears had I cried into it? How many brushstrokes had been pulled through it? A lifetime of memories flashed before my eyes in the same instant as the blinding light flashed over my existence.

Death. Oblivion. Nothing. Surely that was what I had coming to me next.",9
1loogq7,n0tyhaz,"But, life appeared to have other plans. For here I was, sitting up in what appeared to be a hospital bed, still hunched into the position I'd been holding Patches in. Only the light weight of Patches had been replaced by something else entirely. The weight of a fully grown man was crushing the air out of my chest. His back pressed into me, smushing my cheek, as he rattled with laughter and pointed at the man in a white lab coat across the room.

""Jesus Christ, fine, FINE,"" the man in the coat took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes with a sleeved arm. ""You were right, I was wrong.""

""Wrong about WHAT?"" The man on my lap lifted a hand to cup dramatically against his ear. ""Remind me of this thing that you were so positive about?""

""It was my belief that you are too big of an oafish jackass to make somebody love you,"" the coated man recited dryly. ""Specifically, I said 'you are so unpleasant that you couldn't even get a woman to love you if you were a housecat'""

""SHE HELD ME WHILE SHE DIED,"" the man cackled, completely uncaring about the way he was crushing me. ""THE WORLD ENDED AND SHE LOVED ME SO MUCH SHE DIDN'T EVEN CALL HER HUMAN FRIENDS TO SAY GOODBYE.""

""$30, fair and square,"" the man in the coat pulled the crumpled bills from an inner pocket, finally causing... Patches? to leap off of me. I remained in my position, ossified by my mind's inability to catch up to the situation.

""Excellent,"" Patches thumbed through the bills as though he had a wad of millions instead of just three tens. ""Alright, drug her up and send her back out. She'll be fine.""

Patches signaled the man in the coat as he walked out of the door. In a flash as instantaneous and blinding as the one created when the bombs fell, I found myself knocked out of consciousness once more.",7

1lp7nbg,n0th005,"**Didn't stay true to the character traits the prompt states, but hopefully still touches upon a good portion of its spirit!**

Barnaby Harris didn't know what to make of himself. He saw himself in all of them: men who typed angrily in the dark of a basement room, the shooters and their manifestos, any of the people who rage and rage over the feeling that they've been locked out of heaven. A tidal wave of expectations built over time crashes over us, defining this heaven and reducing us to starved dogs pawing desperately at the fence between us and it.

Heaven is love. Heaven is your hand in another's. Heaven is her hair splayed across the pillows when you wake before her. Heaven is the off-key singing  in the kitchen from your lover as they pour their hearts into a meal for you. Heaven is a lifetime of memories glistening back at you from the still-shining eyes wrapped in the drooping skin of your spouse in old age.

Surely, heaven is all we could ever want. So why, Barnaby Harris found himself asking, does he find it so repulsive? And how can something so repulsive be so consuming? Those other men, the incels among us all, he understood the insidious depths of their wrath. And, yet, despite their relatability his wrath had a flavor of its own. The weight of the necessity to enter this heaven as defined by others, the way it trumped all the other things he so desperately wishes to achieve.

There's a News Years Eve party thrown in the home of his childhood best friend, Artie. Barnaby wants nothing more than to mark the turning of the calendar in good company. He has a big social circle, deep bonds with people who would fly across the country without hesitation if disaster struck you from afar. And yet, that sense of obligation, the expectation of shared decision making, that part of the alleged 'heaven' does not exist here. Barnaby loves this, loves his freedom that floats untethered even though alongside his friendships.

As the night wears on, the inevitable happens. He watches as Artie grows flush from drinking and attaches himself to his wife's side. Emi has a new boyfriend and runs her hands up and down his chest, foreplay for the impending drop of the ball. All around him people flock to their partners. Barnaby can't help it, he scans the room for the people who, like him, have no one they share an orbit with. He hates it, but it drives him like the invisible engine it is.

He must find someone. He doesn't want to find someone. His head spins but not from the alcohol. Midnight hits. A cacophony erupts around him, cheers paired with the laughs as lovers gaze into each other's eyes after kissing. This year will be theirs, they started here so very together and nothing will push them apart. In the middle of it all, three single girls squat together under a table shoving grapes into their mouth. An attempt to cast a spell that finally opens the gates of heaven for them.

It began in high school. There was a shift. Friends who spent weekend nights watching movies or playing video games still did the same thing, though Barnaby noticed people starting to move closer and closer to one another. Gabi, a fellow Sophomore, shifted herself towards Barnaby one night until her leg pressed flush against his. Artie caught Barnaby's eyes across the room, mouthing at him to grab a blanket to put over the two of them.

*Don't fumble the bag, man. You've got her all over you! You gotta show her you're down.*

And so Barnaby reached into the wicker basket beside the floral couch in Artie's basement. In a performance of chivalry, he asked if Gabi was cold, draping the blanket over both of them while she still was giving her answer. The pressure of it all sat in him like poison. He had expected this moment to be a euphoria, though the reality of this euphoria was the anxiety that tarnished it.",7
1lp7nbg,n0th3sn,"It's as Barnaby stumbles home from the party at 3am that he decides his resolution is to make those words, his internal mantra, a reality. How he longed to be like Lady Macbeth in so many ways, freed from the weakness that love and its pursuit plagues him with.

""Come you spirits,"" Barnaby is drunker than he thought as the words leave his mouth. He slouches against a telephone pole in an attempt to keep himself held up. ""Come, you spirits, that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here.""

The street is silent as his words vanish into nothingness. The anger in him is unexpected, a stowaway in the night. His mind plays back the party, spinning before him as if he were a child mesmerized by the spinning of laundry through the dryer window. 

Artie and his wife. Emi and her boyfriend. The girls eating grapes, so desperate and undignified. The sound of lips smacking together in his ear from the endless sea of couples surrounding him. His jealousy that he had no one to hold when midnight hit. The disgust with himself for caring. 

""COME, YOU SPIRITS,"" Barnaby can't stop himself from screaming. The words he had so often thought in begging now wore the ferocity of a command. ""THAT TEND ON MORTAL THOUGHTS, UNSEX ME HERE.""

Silence. A breeze blows back Barnaby's hair as if it were a lover gently tucking strands behind his ear. He stood there, uneasy in the feeling that he was not alone.

""My, my, what a persistent thing you are,"" Barnaby jumps, startled and instantaneously feeling sobered. 

""Who's there?"" he asks, fearful and stepping backwards like a cat with it's back in a defensive arch.

""We are, in your words, the spirits,"" the voice continues. ""We have watched you. We have learned intimately your greatest desire. Speak those words no more, for we grant them to you now. Wear your freedom well, Barnaby Harris, for we cast it over you now as the invisible cloak that shall forever flow in your wake.""

Another breeze, this time a lover's kiss, saying goodbye for the last time. Barnaby stands, shocked. He has never been this drunk, so drunk as to be hallucinating. With nothing else to do, he walks home. 

The next morning, he finds himself hungover and in need of strong coffee. He stands in line, one of many clad in sunglasses that give away the choices they made the night before. As he waits, he doesn't even notice all that he doesn't even notice.

The barista is a beautiful woman. She has nose ring with a glistening blue jewel that accentuates the brilliant blue in her eyes. Long blonde hair, falling so effortlessly down her back. The flirtatious tone that slips off of her tongue, her hooded eyes gleaming in invitation as she purrs Barnaby's total to him. 

He smiles and swipes his card. A perfectly normal interaction with an entirely regular person. Nothing more, nothing less.",5
1lop9vc,n0p4a7v,"I look at him, confused.  
""It is proper immortality though, right?  
Like no aging, no diseases, no dying?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""It is called complete immortality, not proper, but yes, it is.  
You have to understand, this is not necessarily a blessing, and you have to be completely willing to take my place."" he continues.  
I nod.

  
""Yeah, sure, give it."" I say.  
He frowns.  
""That's it? No deliberation? Nothing?"" he asks.  
I groan.  
""Man, you came up to me, about feeling like I could use immortality, you propose you give that immortality to me.  
You stab yourself in the neck to prove you are truly immortal...and now you are getting cold feet?"" I ask.  
He sighs.  
""You are young...and remind me of..."" he starts.  
I groan.

  
""Daughter? Wife? And you don't want to subject me to a long cursed life?"" I ask.  
He smiles.  
""You are like them, and yes.  
Immortality is not necessarily a blessing, seeing everything you once knew and loved change, seeing everyone you love die...  
Slowly, but surely, you will become an alien in your own world, even if you keep up with times."" he says.  
I sigh.  
""I get it, man, I get it...  
But right now, I am living on the streets, have more diseases, and aches than a 20 year old should have, and immortality sounds about the right thing to allow me to change my current fate."" I say, looking at the handsome, ethereal looking fella.  
He nods.

  
Stabbing his finger, a perfect drop of blood is let out.  
""Take it and..."" he starts, but I grab his finger, and suck that blood.  
He stares at me.  
""Wow...no hesitation."" he says.  
I let go of his finger, and shrug.  
""Did worse, for a loaf of bread."" I say, feeling no change yet, but a little warmth.  
""Will..."" I start, but then I see it.  
His hair started to turn white.  
He smiles.  
""Thank you. Good luck. The novels you have read, about immortality, are half-right, half-wrong, be careful, and never forget you are human."" he says, standing up and leaving.  
A few days later, a lawyer finds me, telling me my ""father"" left me all his wealth to me.  
Oddly enough, at his funeral, I cried...",254
1lop9vc,n0oz66h,"“You understand, if you take this…”

“Yes, I get it.” The hooded and cloaked man had babbled on to 2 hours, repeatedly telling me the woes of immortality. None of them outweighed the plus,” I say yes, I live forever unless I get someone to take my place.”

The gravelly voice of the hooded man turned stern,” remember I must be honest. First immortal does not mean invulnerable: cuts,bruises,sickness can and will happen. I spent 1000 years  buried in a tomb.  Death still possible but you wake a few days later healed usually somewhere different with the worse hangover headache that last for day. 
You will continue to find and lose love. You will say never again only to repeatedly forget and do it again. Heartbreak will become an unending cycle of grief, that gets harder each time you feel it. I beg, plead and strongly advise you to say no. Do you want to be immortal?”
  
“  hell yeah  I do. Give it to me”

There was a flash of light and a deafening boom and the young man was gone. 

“I should’ve known Time travel wouldn’t fix this. I knew i screwed up when I didn’t trade off before the last human died. Now there’s no one to pass this off I don’t want know what will happen to me when the sun finally goes in a few days.”",36
1lop9vc,n0q3u67,"I like the idea of this personally.

Narrative wise, it's not much a curse for immortality if you can just dip out at any time if you can just convince someone. Sure no lies, but lies aren't needed. If you're that desperate to stop living, you just need to get someone to want it. You have all the time you need, you can manipulate someone into believing what they've always wanted. Or just keep looking until someone says yes.",62
1lop9vc,n0q7o0b,"Thanks!

Yeah, the prompt is pretty awesome, though I interpret ""voluntarily""/""willing"" as truly wanting, without tricks, or manipulation.

1lp138l,n0rcrul,"I watch, a bit baffled, as the man whom is considered a God of Madness, helps an old lady tend to her garden.  
He weeds some nasty invasive plants, and takes care of the soil, before casting a spell that brings rain.  
""Thank you, young man!"" the old lady says, giving 3 copper coins to the man.  
He thanks her... The old lady, while she is old by human standards, from what I know, the man in front of me is at least 10 thousand years old, yet...  
He doesn't care about norms.  
Lost in thought, I feel pain in my forehead.  
""Whatcha thinking?"" he grins at me, having flicked me.  
I pout.

  
""Master! Why did you do that?!"" I ask.  
He shrugs.  
""You looked lost. Also kid, I haven't yet accepted you as a disciple. Not in the mood right now to be a teacher."" he says.  
He was always like this.  
One moment I find him dining with my parents, in the Elven Palace, the next he is cleaning the public toilets for a copper coin.  
The next, the skies shatter, as he is chasing a God, trying to tattoo his own name into the God's skin.  
He is...unpredictable.

  
""You said you would teach me... Pass on the knowledge you accumulated."" I say.  
He laughs.  
""What I know can drive you insane."" he says.  
""Worth it, if I can be as strong as you are."" I say, smiling. Indeed. I needed his strength. Our family needed me to become strong, or...  
""You really want to know how I can do all this and more?"" he asks, as he snaps his fingers, and I find myself in a huge crystal palace, and around us fly phoenixes, dragons, and divine beasts, ignoring us.  
I nod.  
""This all...is but a simulation. If you know that nothing is real, then you can make anything that is not real, real."" he says.  
It hurts my brain.

  
""What?"" I ask.  
He sighs.  
""I knew you wouldn't believe me, but, listen. Imagine this world is a game."" he starts.  
I nod.  
""Then, nothing is real, but lines of code, 0, and 1."" he continues, but I am lost already.  
""And if nothing is real, then anything you can imagine, can be done, and made real, just turning the illusory into real. Like this."" he says, waving his hands, and an entire forest appearing around us.  
I gasp.  
""Teach me!"" I say, and he sighs.  
""I just did..."" he mutters, before he knocks me out.  
""I will put you in an illusion, will see if you have talent to break reality, like I do."" were the lasts words I heard, before finding myself back home...as my family was dying to the attack of the demons.  
My worst nightmare...and he put me into it?  
Truly, a God of Madness he is, but this is exactly what I need, so I take my spear, and rush towards the enemy, hoping I can learn to create new spells, or weapons out of nothing like Master can.

1louaem,n0pyjg2,"The young god stood silently before the pitiful shell of Zeus. The grand temple that once carried his booming voice now lay in ruin and the pantheon was nowhere in sight, save for the sickly old man in front of him. 


""You grew fat and drunk on their worship, old man. I cannot imagine a worse fate for your lot, much as I'd like to.""


""If you have come for Olympus, then you may have it, such as it is."" 



The corner of his mouth lifted in a slight smile, but a cough erupted from his lungs. In his fit, his eyes did not stray from his progeny. 



""You would gift this broken realm to me, believing it a futile gesture, but I have not come alone."" The young god did not return Zeus's sick smile. ""We have come to return Olympus to its former glory. We have become strong without the belief of your cattle.""


Zeus's eyes widened and fear gripped him. 


He beheld the rest of his nameless, exiled children, weapons in hand. Their expressions did not betray their thoughts, they were as the glorious, stoic, marble statues that once lined his halls. 


""Ah, but I was of the belief that he had died with the rest, but there he sits, clinging to life from the whispers of his pathetic myth.""

The mortals have forgotten us!  
They don't believe we exist, and think we are only stories!  
What do you think you can do to us? Make us disappear?

I snort.  
""Yeah, because that was a choice, not a boon for being someone relatively unknown."" I say.

Help us return, in one form or another."" I mutter, as I channel the remaining power I, and the other Olympians have into Athena.

The young god stepped aside. ""My brethren may feel differently, however, and so, to them I defer.""

Zeus saw himself in this lost child. His golden locks, and fierce but reserved gaze revealed his character to him. A leader, tempered by hardship but never unwound by cruelty. He then saw another aspect of himself in the man who approached. His unforgiving rage. 

""Lo and behold!"" The man shouted. ""Zeus himself rises to meet me in glorious combat! Your bones creak under the weight of your failures! And still! He rises! Come! I will lay you back on the ground, so tired you must be!""

The man strode proudly to Zeus, smiling heartily, but Zeus was no fool. It was a show of a teeth. This one's eyes burned with a hatred deeper and blacker than the pit into which he was cast. His skin was pale and he bore scars across his once beautiful face.

Zeus braced himself and began to call forth what little power lay dormant in him. The air crackled and the familiar, faint, current of godhood began to flow through him, albeit weakly. The Golden One looked on, his stoic expression unchanging. 

The Scarred One began to run toward Zeus, throwing his blade to the ground, overcome by a bloodthirst eons unquenched.",13

""We should pray"" begged mom. ""How can god let this happen??""

""But you aren't Gabriel.  We sent you, into an empty vessel, to do good on Earth, starting with rewarding the faith of those parents, and the many good works you've done in the seventy years afterward.""

But then, on my three thousand, eight hundred and fifty-second shift, I saw Jesus raise his head, and pull his arm forward through the nails that bound him. Blood spattered, flesh tore, and bone cracked and broke as he pulled himself free of the crucifix. And just as soon as he was free, his bone bent back into place, his blood vanishing from the stones below, and his muscle contracted back into place. He floated down from the cross, the flames that were supposed to burn hugged him like an old friend. People looked at one another, shock, fear, and many other emotions rippling across their faces as He stared at them. And then the first man fell to his knees in worship. And he was followed by a sea of bowing heads and the cracking of knees against stone. It took me a minute to realize that I was the only one still standing. And He looked at me. 
“What will you do now, Nathaniel?” 
My body shook. He knew my name, and spoke it in a tongue that has yet to be born. And my hand falls to my side, grasping the cold handle of my standard issue plasma shooter. And he looks sad.
“It’s all real? God, heaven, hell, all of it?” I question, my world spinning around me.
He gives me a soft smile. “Many things are exaggerated. I can’t begin to tell you all of them. But I can tell you you’re on a good path. You’re good to simply because you wish to be. Not many are like that where you’re from.” 
My hair stands on end. His eyes are kind, but his gaze feels like I’m standing directly under the sun. “Why now? Why not any other time? Why not free yourself the first time?” The questions spill out before I can even think them properly, like I was compelled to say them.
“Because I’ve seen the world over and over. I’ve given humanity the chance to lead themselves. Yet the path remains the same. Hate, distrust, betrayal. And once humanity unites beneath the stars, those feels turn to other species, who are the same way. And I simply can’t stand by anymore while humanity leads itself astray.”
His words feel final, like something clicking into place.  And frozen. I don’t know what to do. God is real. Jesus refuses to let himself be sacrificed. And all I can think is protocol. And it tells me my next move is to execute him. To try and keep the future as on track as I can. 
I close my hand around my pistol and pull it free, aiming it between his eyes, and his face softens even more somehow. He looks at me, but he’s not disappointed, not furious. Just sad. His eyes feel like a thousand stares, and the weight of my badge under my disguise feels like tungsten. And I let my arm fall to my side, and let my knees crack against the ground.

1loqt6u,n0p8ouz,"Whacking the bandits with my cane, I go towards the next village...or is it a town?  
Oh...I don't know.  
Me son might know more about the lass that said she's a Hero.  
Poor child, half naked, half-dead appeared on my stoop, and I nursed her back to health.  
She's so young, and said that she got hurt by some demon...  
I haven't heard anything since she left for her ""quest"".  
I hope she's alright...  
She reminds me of my daughter when she was young.

Entering the city? Village? I am met with a band of men, smiling.  
""Hey granny, what brings you here?"" one of them says, looking me up and down.  
Rude.  
I whack them, straightening their postures.  
""You are soldiers! Not thugs! Hmph, also, my son is theoretically some Lord? Lord Asthora?"" I say, and they pale.  
""T-The St-storm King i-is your son?!"" they stutter.  
""That is what he calls himself these days? Storm King? He barely can use mana properly."" I laugh.  
They pale, and before they could ask me something, lightning strikes close to us, as my son appears.  
""Mother! Why didn't you tell me you are coming? How did you leave the village?"" he asks, smiling at me, before giving the stare to the soldiers.  
I whack him, no son of mine will have that look towards others!

In his mansion, as it seems my son has a mansion, he smiles at me wryly.  
My daughter-in-law is sweating, as my grandkids are busy reading the books I brought as gifts.  
""No letter. No visitation in 50 years... Who taught you magic, oh great ""Storm King""?"" I stare at him, and he pales.  
I sigh.  
""Have you heard about this little girl...calls herself Lisa123, and is a Hero?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""She seems to be a Chosen One of the Empire, and is on a quest to defeat the demon lord."" he says.  
I whack him.  
""You a Lord of a town, your sister is a Mage of the Tower, and you let kids on quests like that? In my days..."" I start lecturing him.  
The servants, and the others didn't even dare to look at us.

I leave the town, while my son tries to convince me to take some soldiers, and mages as guards.  
I refuse, as they would only hinder me.  
On my way to the demons' lands, I met a few demons, who hit me, and tried to kill me, but to no avail.  
I whacked them with my cane, and they all fell.  
I hmphed, watching more demons fly above me, as I approached the demon lands.  
""Sending yet another child to such a quest...  
I will deal with these things, once and for all.  
I don't want yet another young one I taught a thing or two about magic, and this world, to die randomly..."" I mutter, as I walk into the Forbidden Forest.  
Wait, you little Lisa123, I will help you, and then we can continue our tea sessions...",33
1lp4oxs,n0sku04,"The Slime was cooking eggs in the kitchen, one of the few meals he could make that was actually palatable.  Major Frost busied himself with setting the table, aligning the cutlery and folding napkins.  As a finishing touch, he made a quick instant ice sculpture of the heroic Captain Freedom picking his nose.  It always made The Slime smile, something that rarely happened after the Freedom League completely kicked their asses in that last fiasco less than 72 hours ago.

""Two minutes!"" hollered The Slime, his words punctuated by the sound of the toaster popping up.

Frost took a moment to look around the apartment, solely his until he had invited The Slime to hide out here.  The walls were covered with tacky movie posters, blueprints of random buildings and an exploded version of his very first Freeze Gun.  It had died at the worst time, but it still held sentimental value, so he had taken the time to turn it into a piece of art.  Surprisingly, The Slime didn't have much to bring to the apartment and left zero mess in his wake.  His tendency to absorb all sorts of debris, dust and other random things as part of his powers actually made the apartment cleaner than before.

Frost blinked as full plates hit the table, pulling him out of his musings.  The eggs looked perfectly cooked, like something out of a food magazine cover photo.  Crispy bacon peeked out from under the eggs, and two diagonally-sliced pieces of toast completed the picture.  Sliding into his seat, fork instantly at the ready, Frost waited while The Slime mumbled a prayer under his breath before digging in.

He gave a satisfied groan of pleasure before remarking ""You could open a breakfast-themed restaurant just based on your eggs, you known?""

The Slime gave a short laugh and gestured to himself, ""Like anyone would eat food I cook looking as I do?"" as the undulating rolls of slime, slowly flowing downwards with gravity, blurred his features.

""Their loss,"" Major Frost stated before popping a delicious piece of bacon into his mouth.

They turned their attention to the television, which had stopped the 50s movie marathon with a breaking news story.  The elegantly coifed reporter was breathlessly talking about the efforts of the Freedom League and that they had just captured the last of the villain group, minus two, who had threatened the city just days before.  Police mugshots of both Major Frost and The Slime were presented on the screen with a hotline number for citizens to call.  The two men looked at each other and nodded.

1lopgtr,n0qwxom,"Keeper of the Harvest.

That's the job title every kid dreamed to be growing up. That's what I dreamed to be growing up. Thankfully, I showed the required spiritual and mental aptitude when I was 5 years old. That's three years younger than average, giving me an advantage over other kids in my generation. 

A three year advantage might sound like a lot, but in truth it's a drop in the bucket compared to the 50 year Initiate training required to then compete to be the Chosen. 

Fifty years of spiritual training. From the grueling endurance training to the delicate precision training. What the Keeper actually does is kept secret, as it involves the survival of humanity. However, everybody knows that it needs a godlike amount of spiritual power. Every single waking hour dedicated to increasing the volume, quality, and control of our spiritual power. Many failed in childhood, failing to withstand the soul-sucking regime of Initiate training. Yet, still more aspire to be the Keeper, to forever etch their name as the Hope of Humanity. 

Every 17 years, only one would be chosen from the Initiates to be the Keeper while the rest can only lament their failed efforts to then fade into obscurity.

I made the most out of my slim time advantage and now, finally, I pulled ahead of the competition. 

In the summer of 5078, what was merely a childhood dream became my reality. Me, the Hope of Humanity, the 179th Keeper of the Harvest.

—

“So… All I need to do is feed these bugs?”

“Yeah, bro. Just feed ‘em spiritual power.” 

The 178th Keeper of the Harvest sat in front of me in a loose and ragged tank shirt and shorts. He was sitting on a faded pink plastic stool, his toes wiggling on his dangling flip-flops. I was sitting there in my full official regalia looking extremely out of place. I would never have imagined that my predecessor would be this… casual.

Wait, no, that's not the point! What the f*ck is feeding bugs? 

I shook my head twice, in the hopes of catching my mind that was desperately escaping reality.

Looking around, we were sitting in the middle of a massive underground area of which no edges could be seen. A “tree” taller than any skyscraper and made of an unknown metal looms over us. The “sky” above our heads is blue and the fake “sun” feels as warm as the summer sun outside.

After my inauguration, I had traveled for several days in multiple government vehicles, with decoys thrown in so many times, the drivers and pilots would not have known whether or not they were bringing the genuine Keeper nor the actual destination. At the end, I was physically exhausted with only my excitement driving me onwards.

Now? Now I’m just exhausted.

“Fifty years of training? Just to feed bugs?” I asked, feeling hollowed out.

“Well, yeah. They're something called periodical cicadas to be precise. Only renewable thing left on earth that we humans can eat, you see.” my unkempt senior looked at me with kind eyes. 

“They teach you about the Great Cataclysm at the Academy, right? Yeah, bro. Almost all edible plants and animals slowly died out until we only had these cicadas left. The trees that they feed off of eventually died out, too. Thankfully, in 2035 we found that we can replace it with spiritual power. The first Keeper of the Harvest was born.”

“Their life cycle is 17 years, so each Keeper is in charge of feeding them spiritual power every day. Then at the end of 17 years we harvest the mature cicadas after they finish laying eggs.”

“Why only one Keeper each time? Well, that's because based on the government AI’s calculations, an average person’s spiritual power is enough to feed a harvest for all of us. But don't worry, we actually have backup broods elsewhere.”

“Anyone could grow their own brood so why we still need Initiates and Keepers? Haha you ask the hard questions, huh bro! Well, you didn't hear it from me, but I THINK that's how the government AI keeps us in line. Set up a system for a chosen hero from the masses, layer it with some narrative about human persistence, then have the government act as the good guy. Although, in their defense, I think it's best way to ensure our survival. After all, us humans like to destroy things if we're given too much power and agency.”

“Anyway, bro nice meeting you, but I’m outta here. Government got a retirement place for us ex-Keepers in Hawaii. See you in 17 years!”",34
1lopgtr,n0p6wbi,"I am taken to an underground facility, by an escort of 12 soldiers.  
Going through seemingly endless, repeating hallways, we arrive at a door.  
The soldiers tense up.  
""We are here, lady.  
Inside, your predecessor shall explain the rules.  
Thank you for your service."" the leader says, straining to look at me.  
I nod, and wonder.  
What is behind that door?

  
I enter, and as the door slams shut, I focus on the room.  
A pure white room, with a bed...on the side, there is another open door, that from what I see leads to a bathroom.  
In the middle of the room is a lone chair, on which a man is sitting.  
""Ah, my replacement. Have you won the ""lottery"" and gained the ""perfect"" job?"" he chuckles.  
I nod.  
He stands up, and now I can see that in front of the chair...there is a crack.  
For some reason, I shiver.  
That crack...is floating mid-air.

  
""Yep. That is the main focus of our job.  
Watching the crack, 24/7.  
Any anomaly, be it size growth, or shrinkage, voices, whispers, screams, buzzing, or objects falling through, needs to be reported."" he says, taking out a tablet from under the pillow.  
He gives it to me.  
""That's the gist of it. Questions?"" he continues.  
""Why are we doing this? What is the crack? Why 17 years?"" I ask.  
He smiles.  
""Good questions."" he says, stretching.  
I frown.

  
""Well, we are doing this, because that crack is seemingly impossible.  
A tear in reality? In space? A wound? We don't know.  
And why?  
Because the very first time it appeared, out fell an object that created our ""utopia"", while exactly 17 years later, a poison mist spread, almost sinking into the core of the planet."" he says.  
I am confused...what?  
Our world's peace and development is due to...that crack?  
And at the same time...this crack could potentially destroy the world?  
""You will have time to think about possibilities, after all...17 years is a long time.  
Good luck."" he says, leaving.  
As the door closes, the tablet lights up.  
When I get food, or when I can order something for myself, and how often I have to report on the crack's stats appears on the screen.  
Now...it is my turn to watch it.",49
1lopgtr,n0p0ubu,"*See you in 17 years.* Her escort gently closed the door. If it wasn’t so quiet in the wood-paneled room Autumn now stood in, she wouldn’t have heard the almost inaudible whirr of the automatic lock on the other side. 

*89 years old*. She did the simple arithmetic on the car ride over here. That’s how old she’d be when she finally left this place. She still didn’t know why they chose her for the job. She still didn’t know what the job was. Every 17 years, the world held its breath and exhaled disappointment. She hoped she could be the one to break this cycle.

*She looks like she’s only 15*, Autumn thought. A girl (young woman?) stood up from the leather armchair in the middle of what Autumn now recognized as a converted old-school library and approached Autumn with a shy smile, eyes focused on a point just behind Autumn. 

*20 seconds*. That’s around how long it took her to get to Autumn. Autumn wasn’t exactly sure how much time had transpired. She was so nervous. Maybe she was just counting the clicks of the young woman’s practical kitten heels against the hardwood. Why should she be so afraid of a young woman anyway? *I could be her grandmother!* She fixed her posture and hoped she looked presentable in the light blue jeans and patched up puffer jacket she hastily threw on this morning. Her eyes trailed over the young woman’s smart herringbone slacks and cable knit fisherman’s sweater.

*4 fingers.* The young woman’s pinky finger was missing entirely. The young woman held out her hand to Autumn. Like the crisp dry leaves of her namesake, Autumn’s trembling hand fell through the air into the young woman’s. *Hello Autumn. I’m pleased to make your acquantaince. The world is in danger, and we only have one chance left. You’re going to help me save it.*

1lop0oz,n0oxqgf,"At first it was an occurrence I expected to be a one-off variable.

Then the monsters kept coming from a rift in the deep ocean (damn the seaborn!), then in certain low-hab wild-regions (damn the cultists!), then from space (damn the xenos!), and the weapons were cumbersome due to their initial use cases being 'for installation on mobile heavy weapons platforms for industrial renovation purposes' and 'removal of paracausal threats'.

Such as said 'magical girls'.

But given the circumstances and their treatment of me being more of a weird arms-dealer, I have decided to escalate things.

I contact the cult and hire them to summon forth the injured and dying monsters.

I augment said monsters, and give them a new deal that actually sees them switch sides.

And then employ said monsters alongside specialised forces (thanks to intranational governmental support via numerous legal and quasi-legal channels; none of my work is illegal, sans the 'treatment' of the augmented summoned beings).

...After that the magical girls somehow corrupted the augmented monsters and turned them into women, and the cultists keep summoning more monster women, who work with the magical girls, to fight the giant eldritch monsters and -literal- demons that are coming from space.

Not sure what happened to the deep-ocean gateways, but whatever was responsible gave up on them - got a cryptic notification one morning about it.

Anyway, after a necessary addition to workplace policy ('if you are a single male, please be mentally and physically prepared for intense spatial violation by incredibly friendly human-feminine-adjacent lifeforms'), I opted to go through with some experimental arcane infusion and...

Let's just say I walked the path of the DOOM Slayer. Went out there myself and tore the demons in twain, every one, some by hand, some by saw-shield, some by gun, some by chainsaw...

They recognised who I styled myself after. I looked like him anyway; should've done this from the start.  
...I should investigate that later.

Anyway, the magical girls have started to throw money at me for commissioned hardware.  
Not going to turn that down on the condition that they work alongside my forces on this campaign against what can only be described as 'The forces of Hell itself'.

. . .

They agreed. Sure, they be fighting alongside cyborg monsters and demons and monstergirls, and myself, but we've been doing, ultimately, the right thing.

Not one of those 'DOOMed' demons is getting their messy claws and big guts on anyone who lives on this Earth.

...Now, how do I navigate conversations rife with innuendo? These magical girls are trying to corner me and I feel the monstergirls have been helping them...",37

How do those magical girls keep breaking in?  
And why?  
Theoretically, I am the villain, and they are the heroes.  
So why to they steal, while I am in the middle of my plan making sessions?  
And the worst part is...  
That even now, that I have them captured in a plasma cage...they laugh, thinking I am a goofy, kooky side character!

  
""Okay, old man, you made your point."" one of them chirps.  
""Yeah, yeah, we will ask next time, after taking the weapons."" another one smiles.  
I groan.

""Proving that you shouldn't underestimate me, just because I have never damaged or hurt anything, or anyone."" I say.  
They pout.  
Why do they have to be right though? And why do they have to be classmates of my granddaughter?  
I sigh, and give their powers back.

  
""While I am upset about the stealing part, we could work out a cooperation deal."" I say.  
They stare warily at me.  
""What kind of cooperation?"" they ask.  
""While I am a villain, and have worked against the government for personal reasons, I am a citizen of the city, and of the world.  
The monsters invading us from space, and from the depths of the oceans are my enemy as well.  
So, you are free to take my weapons, and even order custom made ones...but you are not to steal anymore, and you are to focus on your school work."" I say.  
They nod, before paling even more.

1lob8sq,n0m2v13,"I couldn’t take it anymore.

Day after day I spent in our little cottage on the edge of town, trying to ignore the whispers. Ducking beneath the windows. Hiding in the attic when visitors came.

That was the first rule imposed on me: don’t, under any circumstance, let anyone see you. The village knew you had died in that fire, if they saw you they would think they’d gone insane. 

At first, I thought I could manage it. I thought I could handle seeing old friends pass the cottage, throwing sorrowful looks through the windows as though they knew I was there. I thought I could handle having no one but the same six members of my family to talk to.

And don’t even get me started on the whispers.

They were inescapable, haunting me wherever I went in this small cottage like a hound of ghosts. There was nowhere to hide.

At first they tried to hide it. My parents would stop their mumbled conversations when I came down for dinner, my sister would smile at me pitifully like you would a kid with cancer, my once no-nonsense aunt would sneak me ice cream for breakfast. 

But eventually they couldn’t hide it anymore- something was wrong with the ritual. I only wished I knew what. 

They had me try everything: staring into the mirror, watching myself sleep, having my physician uncle do all sorts of check ups. Nothing stopped the whispers, only now they didn’t bother to hide them. 

“Do you know how much we sacrificed to bring you back to life?” My mother would say whenever I’d beg to know what was going on. “You should be grateful.”

And I was, truly. But this wasn’t life. This was torture. 

That was why, one night when I couldn’t take it anymore, I snuck down the stairs and scurried out the door.

I wasn’t going to talk to anyone, of course. I just wanted to feel the cold air on my skin, wanted to gaze up at the moon like anybody else. Like I used to. 

I found the cozy little clearing I once spent hours stargazing at, just a five minute walk from home. I’d only stay for five more. Just five minutes of nothing but me and the moon.

It wasn’t ideal, but it would do.

Only I must’ve lost track of time out there, staring up at the moon from my spot on the ground, because all of a sudden I heard the leaves crunch. 

I whipped my head around to meet the gaze of an elderly woman.

“What’s a boy like you doing out here?”

Crap. If my parents found out id been spotted, they’ll lock me in my room for the rest of my life.

I got up intending to run away, but paused. It was only some old woman, after all. She probably didn’t even know who I was.

What was the harm in talking to her a little?

“Just…stargazing.”

“Ah, I see,” she said, grinning. “Well I must say you’ve picked the perfect spot for it.”

I smiled. “What about you?”

“Just picking some berries nearby. Although…” She cocked her head at me. “I must say I don’t recognize you.”

“I’m, uh, from out of town.”

“I see.” She glanced over my shoulder. “Oh my, is that the cottage I’ve been hearing so much about?” 

“What do you mean?” I asked carefully. 

“Well I heard there was a great fire, although they managed to rebuild it. A shame, though, what happened,” she sighed. 

I nodded sadly. “It really is.”

“I wonder if the village will ever re-sell it or keep it as a memorial. 

“You mean the family?”

“Why, no.” She gave me a strange look. “It’s the town’s property now.”

A cold chill went down my spine. “What do you mean?” 

“Oh, honey, you don’t know? That entire family passed away in the fire. They’ve been dead for years.”",622
1lob8sq,n0mm2km,"To exist is a transactional thing.

We have dressed up our society as a series of exchanges. A basket of berries for your wolf pelt. Teas for spices. Coins for bread. A swipe of a card for a new mattress. These are the interactions that make our material world go round.

But what of the world within us? The world we cannot see in which we make trades that we so often don't even notice?

You fall in love and it sends a piece of your heart flying into the chest of another. Your child dies, and as you watch them lowering into the ground, a cold chill sweeps over you and blows some intangible part of you into the grave to be buried as well. A mentor whose words hold the weight of the world snaps at you in criticism and you are helpless as you watch a piece of your confidence flake off to wither on the ground like an autumn leaf.

And death? The transaction with death is everything. Every bit of you falls into death's arms, cradled like the weightless thing you ultimately are. A series of bones, still-bleeding lumps of flesh, and the frantic energy of a soul fractured and swirling around the bits and pieces that once could have been called you.

If death takes all, then surely it would not hand it back without a price. To hold all of you then find itself with none, what sort of a transaction would that be for an entity so merciful and merciless? So greedy, so selfless.

You wake up floating in a pool of water. The water is body temperature warm and comfortable, not too dissimilar to when you still swam within your mother, you think. Though you would have been sufficiently buoyant on your own, hands surround you and hold up your back, arms, and legs. Air enters your lungs with a shakiness as if you were learning to walk again. Chanting slows as your eyes adjust to the light.

1lob8sq,n0n3grt,"The last few days had been a blur. First, nothingness. Actually less than that. Like the time before you were born, but with the context of being painfully aware of it. The gap was punctuated by the knowledge that Otis had in fact died. Most in his life had taken his return first with a bit of shock, like they’d seen a ghost at first. Which was understandable, expected even. This he could work with, nothing a bit of time wouldn’t heal.

His parents though. They looked at him worse than that. Their barely hidden grimaces as he spoke. The way the conversation paused slightly when he entered the room. Mother was worse in this, she’d always held her emotions right on her sleeve. Father, stoic as ever, was harder to read. His usual reserved enthusiasm nearly extinguished. Replaced with a reservation that Otis tried not to read as disappointment. 

Otis sensed it all as a wrongness, which he couldn’t work out. He’d investigated himself closer than ever before. He stood in the mirror for hours inspecting each pore and curve. Had his eyes always had those flecks of yellow just above the pupil? His jaw had always favoured the left side when closed, but had it shifted further? His skin looked paler than before. Otis tried to shrug this off, he had spent several days without circulation.

He found himself lying awake that night, pondering his existence. There was an emptiness within. Hunger. On these nights he’d found no snack would quell the desire. Yet he gave in to the temptation anyway. He arose from the bed, donned a slightly too big robe. He’d take some time to fill it back out again, and headed towards the kitchen. He took a sharp left, silently praising himself for not going the wrong direction. He swore it had been right before the incident, but his mind struggled with those details. He took care with his steps, the floor had a habit of creaking which might awake his parents. He didn’t want to worry them. Rebirthed boys wandering around at night might worry folk. As he rounded a corner he saw there was light already peeking out from the door left ajar. He approached, maintaining the tip-toe movement. 

“This is all your fault,” mothers pointed voice eeked through the gap.

“Mine? Mine?” father’s voice struggled to keep low as it cracked, “I followed the ritual exactly. We couldn’t have known…”

“That it would bring back the wrong twin? Well there was a mistake somewhere.”

“Their forms were nearly identical. Perhaps their essence too. But now we must live with our mistake. He must never know.”

Unable to bear it any longer, Otis stormed through the door. 

“Good evening, son.” Mother spun towards the door, she dabbed at her wet eyes with a velvet sleeve. Behind her, half prepared vegetables sat on the chopping board, alongside her favourite knife. Otis always wondered why mother bothered to cook herself when they had so much help. Father had long since stopped urging her to stop. She’d refused to let their servants cook for them and despised the idea of a conjured meal.

“You should get yourself some rest, lad.” Dad stepped forward as if to embrace, as ever he wore an ornate jacket. White cuffs pointed towards Otis joined a navy breast with finely woven lapels.

“Don’t touch me.” Otis stepped back. “I want… No, I need the truth.”

“What do you mean?”

“I heard what you said. The wrong twin? I don’t even have a brother. But I see the way you look at me, like I’m wrong. A disappointment.”

They both shrank at that.",29

Celia, tells me I'm David. We don't call each other Brother and Sister alone, but we're the only ones who don't. I'm not sure why.  Brother Idaho, has been crying lately, though he tries to hide it. The puffy red eyes, the quick wipe of his face before he turns to see a person it's all telling.

They've given me a spellbook. I'm supposed to study it, It's supposed to jog my memory. But all the spells are wrong, they don't work the way the pages say they ought to. I know this, I've tried the charms but I can feel the magic is off.  The effects are too weak to be useful. 

Today I'm trying the spell magelight. It says that it reveals what's hidden to the unseeing eyes. As I chant the spell, the book is changing. Extra instructions appear, notes scrawled in the margins dance into being. Excited I flip to the beginning to see what I missed before. In the table of contents a previously blank page shows ""A spell for revival and healing"" and as I flip to it the pages state this spell will heal ALL WOUNDS up to and including DEATH.  But the spell requires that a willing participant must take on the wounds of the recipient. So if death is to be reversed, there must be a sacrifice of a person's life. 

It appears the ritual must have been done to me. I am in perfect health. But what wound has healed? Why can I not remember? 

Celia sees me reading the spell and says ""Now David, you aren't ready for that. Mother said you aren't to be meddling with others right now."" Especially it seems since you aren't the same David that we all knew.  

Seeing that Celia is strangely formal on this I say, ""Sister...""

Before I can finish she hushes me. ""I am Sister Celia no more. With Mother's last act she gave of herself too much and Mother passed away.""

Placing her finger on my lips she said ""You should call me properly around the others. I am Mother Celia now"" 

Closing the book she leaned over to me and kissed my forehead.  

""Rest for now, Father. You have been unwell and we have restored you.""

My eyelids heavy I return to the bed. 

""Mother?"" I question as Celia tucks me in.

""Yes?""

""Sing me a lullaby.""

""Of course Father dear.""

And as Celia starts to sing I feel my eyes close and drift off to the lands beyond the waking world.",46
1lob8sq,n0ns4yb,"I remember, I was running downtown—my heart pounding harshly in my ears, my breath jagged and uneven, my feet sore from the eleven-mile journey. A dead man’s memories were twisting my reality. I just had to follow the signs. “Wrong Way.” I didn’t go down that street. A green arrow on the traffic light. I went left as commanded. A crosswalk sign’s bright, emaciated figure beckoned me to change directions. Pain in the intersection. 

Dying ain’t no walk in the park—unless you’re murdered in one. For one thing, it’s painful. It’s so painful it literally kills you.

But when you die, you aren’t gone. You’re disassembled, but the parts of you that observe keep on observing. My family had been looking for me, and when the world warped, distorted and danced, my father’s blue Dodge Ram stopped and hummed alongside my corpse.

I felt the thud as I was loaded into the truck bed. I smelled the exhaust as we sped off. I heard my step-mother’s scream as she saw my remains.

“Get the book,” my father said. The chants were in a strange language. Probably Latin.

I woke up in a hospital—a psychiatric hospital. No sign of injury from the silver, speeding Honda Odyssey with the busted headlight that shattered my bones.

It’s a big, white room filled with navy blue dialysis chairs; a long, smudged window on the starboard wall—doctors and nurses watch us from behind, security cameras pointed down at us. I feel sorry for the patients that already feel like they are being watched.

“Jack?” asked the man in maroon scrubs holding a clipboard. Never trust a man with a clipboard; he literally has an agenda.

“Yes?” I said. I figured I’d best be curt; if I told him anything more about my guiding ghost he’d probably think I’m crazy. His eyes moved slowly—lethargic. I could tell from his flat tone that he was sick of having to deal with genuinely schizophrenic patients and unhoused folks the cops routinely picked up off the streets. To him I probably was just another one of them. I’d prove I was sane.

“Are you having any thoughts of self-harm?”

“No.”

“Any thoughts of harming others?”

“No.”

“Hearing any voices or seeing anything that’s not there?”

I paused. How would I know if anything I was seeing wasn’t really there? I realized I’d hesitated.

“Damn,” I thought. ”He might think I’m crazy—I better explain my hesitation.""  

“I don’t think so?” I said. “How would I know if what I’m seeing isn’t really there?”

He chuckled and didn’t say a word. I broke his script and a light flickered behind his eyes—then faded back to the usual lifeless gray.

Maybe I had proved I was sane.

There’s nothing to do other than eat stale string cheese and crumbled crackers and watch the pathetically small TV play movies I had already seen. When my family visits, they say I didn’t die, that I was just crazy, that it was all just a hallucination.

But I remember the ritual. I hear them whisper about me. I know.",19
1lob8sq,n0prqnt,"The first thing I remember since my death was my family surrounding me, hugging and shouting as they circled around the kitchen table to welcome me back.
The second was a look of utter confusion on their faces as they observed me further. 
Third was the shared mission between them all as they helped me off the table, wrapping me in the white sheet I had woken up under. I had noticed blood on it, but dismissed it at the time. After all, I had been dead just moments before.

All things considered, I had taken my resurrection well at first. The town never knew I had died so life simply resumed as if i had just returned from a short holiday. That is, until a year later I tried to take a real one for myself to the next town over. My father insisted there was more work to be done. My mother began warning me about some serial killer on the loose in said town and when that didn’t dissuade me my sister suddenly announced a pregnancy and planned baby shower that I just had to attend. Never mind the vacation. Sure enough, I come back home from father’s “extra work” and overhear my father and older brother in a heated argument. “It went wrong” “We can’t leave him like this!”
…“he should be dead”. 
Soon after I begin checking myself in the mirror for rot, decay, anything to indicate my death. But even the wound is gone. I look healthier than I was before my death. I try seeing a doctor and they come to the same conclusion.

Eventually one night, I dream of drowning.

But not in water. Something thicker. It drags at my limbs. Cold fingers brush my ankles. I wake gasping, clawing at the sheet. My mother is sitting at the end of the bed, knitting in the dark.

“You were thrashing,” she says softly, not looking up. “Bad dreams?”

I ask her what she’s doing here.

“Oh, just watching over you. You’ve been through a lot.”

I almost wanted to ask what she meant. But didn’t.

The next morning, I left.
I told no one. Took nothing. Just walked. Past the corner store. Past the rusted gas station. Past the trees that began to blur into themselves.

Then, something soft comes undone inside my head. I try to scratch it. Like a ribbon being pulled some skin comes off, but I can’t seem to feel it. 

Had I passed the gas station already? 
I continue on.

I catch my reflection in the window of a parked truck: my eyes are glassy, unfocused, my mouth slightly open with a bloody gash on one side. This person looked like a corpse surprised by its own death.
Who was it again?

I finally make it to the old sign that marks the county border. I try to reach out and touch it, but finally collapse. 

Just static.
Then nothing.

…

The first thing I remember since my death was my family surrounding me, hugging and shouting as they circled around the kitchen table to welcome me back. The second… a bloodied white sheet they wrapped me in as they helped me off the table. All things considered, I’m taking my resurrection well.",17
1lob8sq,n0mq9z1,"Days turn to weeks turn to months. Suddenly, it has been a year since your reawakening. The world has carried on as it always has. When you return to work, some of the faces of coworkers paled at your appearance though most of them welcomed you as if back from a holiday. Your old girlfriend nearly fainted when her phone rang, showing your name on the caller ID, and it was actually your voice that came through the phone. She had seen you, lying there on the floor, neck jutted in all the wrong ways as your limbs twisted in directions no waking body would have been able to endure. The fall, she says, I still see it every night. It can't be the same, it won't be.

The piece of your heart you had sent her withers and dies, far away from its home in you. You had expected this, few relationships survive a resurrection. That doesn't change that you had hoped. That you had sent pieces of yourself floating into the ethereal space between us and whatever is above to fall back to earth in an anointment of the love that once pulsed between the two of you.

You feel strange. Every single day. Off in ways beyond comprehension. You try to ignore it, but you know your family feels it too. You saw the way they tried to smile at you across the dinner table with a sense of normalcy. On the nights where your mother eyes have gone glassy from too much wine, you swear you can make out your reflection in them. In them is you and a stranger all at once. A stranger you know they all see across the table as well.

""We must've done it wrong,"" your mother slurs one night to your father as they lay in the dark of their bedroom, unaware of you lingering just outside in the hallway.

""I know,"" your father replies, defeated. ""I know.""

And so you flip on the bathroom lights, banishing the dark and forcing you to face the thing that is allegedly yourself. Your skin is pliant and rosy as it has always been. Your eyes a deep brown, shimmering pools of ultimately unimpressive mud. A buzzed head with dark stubble growing in a thin layer. It is you, undeniably the same you that has always been you.

""I hear that they visit us sometimes,"" another resurrected says in an online forum for those who have been brought back. ""The spirits that shepherded us home.""

The doctors had told you you were fine. Strong vitals befitting a healthy young man. You even got a referral to a clinic that specializes in care for the resurrected. They reassure you that you are, in fact, one of the lucky ones.

""Some people come back and spend the rest of their lives fighting off series after series of cancers,"" the specialist had said. ""Our working theory is somewhere between life and death the scrambling of your cells can lead to issues with their regeneration once you're back. There's a few studies happening now, actually, but it's hard to find subjects who you know for a fact will die and be resurrected.""

In desperation, you wonder if the shepherds are real and if they hold the answers you seek. If they can explain the unease that pervades every moment of your life. You simultaneously mourn and yearn with foolish hope to return to the version of you that was so carefree. This new you that the reawakening ritual promises is the old you hangs heavy on you like too-big clothes drenched in water. This unease radiates off of you, spreading like a parasite to everyone around you.

The small phone stand you bought arrives on a Tuesday morning. There's a narrative on the forums that sometimes shepherds visit at night. You prop up your phone on your dresser with your bed perfectly in frame that same night. Try as you might, you struggle to fall asleep. Is it excitement? Fear? Hope? These feelings swim within you, bumping and bouncing against the walls of your consciousness until finally, hours later, you fall asleep.

The disappointment is the crushing of Sisyphus's boulder rolling backwards and over you. You see nothing but a man sleeping in the footage. The shepherds have left you to suffer alone. Answers are not coming, nothing is coming. There is no choice but to move forward, inching step by step through the slog of life that extends between you and the death you can't help but feel robbed of.",86
1lob8sq,n0n3lks,"“No son it's not like that,” Fresh tears quickly replaced those newly banished. Father agreed with a quiet grumble. 

“There wasn’t enough left to save you both.”

“Both? What do you mean, both?”

“You don’t remember it but you had a twin, Gerald. You were inseparable, identical.”

“Nearly identical,” mother corrected.

“There was an accident. You were both playing. Your brothers magic had blossomed. It caused an extraordinary explosion out in the yard. We could only salvage enough to recreate one body.”

“So you brought me back, by accident?”

“If we could, it would have been both,” mother promised.

“What made Gerald so special?”

“Nothing. We couldn’t pick a favourite.”

“But you did.”

“No we…” Mother tried again. But paused when father put a firm hand on her shoulder.

“No more lies, Margaret.

She looked up at him, at first her eyes pleaded, but then she nodded. She looked down at the floor in her resignation.

“Your brother, Gerald. His innate talent was great. On the other hand… You’re.” Father took in a deep breath, “you’re a dud.”

Faint memories worked their way from somewhere dormant in Otis’ mind. He’d tried his best for years trying to conjure an ounce of the old magic. No amount of will or studying had brought about success. He’d been the first dud in generations of his line. And now without a magical heir, they’d lose everything it had taken centuries to build.

“It’s okay, I understand.” Otis said, shaking.

“You do?” mother looked up, brows creased.

“If I’m without magic, then everything will be lost. The land and home, our vassals will be overrun.”

 He spotted the solution before his parents. It all seemed clear now, what he must do. He moved towards them.

“You can make this right.” Otis’ heart pounded in his chest, his hands shook as he stepped towards the counter. 

“What is it son?” Father’s voice sounded distant. 

“Make sure to do it right this time.” Otis lunged forward. He ducked under the awaiting arms of his mother, grabbed the knife and plunged it into his neck. The ceiling retracted and somewhere far away he felt the floor thud against his back then head. 

Above him his parents looked down in horror, frozen by the sudden violence. 

Otis brought himself to smile, a blurry attempt at reassurance. “Bring him back.”",33
1lob8sq,n0muw7s,"Seven years have passed now since the resurrection. The old version of you fades from the memories of your family as though it were never more than a mirage. The discomfort becomes normal. You are frogs in boiling water, the calm of before long forgotten.

You have a new girlfriend, a fellow resurrected who you can share your deepest worries with as you both stare sleeplessly at the ceilings on those nights where the feeling of wrongness rages within you. It only took one date before the invisible contract was signed. A piece of your heart for a piece of mine. The trade is made and sealed in permanence.

When she is out of town visiting her sisters as she periodically does, you stay up late and scour the resurrected forums. Your private hope lives within you as an embarrassing secret. Anonymous user after anonymous user seeks the answers that you do: where are the shepherds? All who claim to have met them will make one post then disappear, never answering questions or providing the depth you crave.

You carry on. You convince yourself that toiling is a gift and that life was always this uncomfortable.

Forty-four years have passed since the resurrection. You stare down at your wife in her coffin. A false brightness blushes upon her paper-thin cheeks. She was hardly one for makeup in life, it feels odd to see her in it now. Her hands are clasped and at rest upon her chest, peaking out of the long purple sleeves that make up the gown she will be buried in. Your own hand reaches out to rest upon hers. They are both so bony, you can hardly tell which of you is dead and which is still living.

Forty-seven years have passed. Your children surround your hospital bed, assuring you that they will be okay as you feel yourself drift away. For a moment, your final ragged breath scares you in its arduousness. Suddenly, you find yourself floating. Your children's tears are raindrops from the clouds that you ascend through, they keep looking down at your body and miss you waving goodbye from above.

A room. Or something resembling it. There is no floor, no walls, no ceiling. Just space that you feel to be contained. If you could see still, you'd imagine yourself invisible. Energy is shapeless until it fills a body and takes that form. You are no longer in possession of a body. You must be as shapeless as you were before you were born.

""You have arrived.""

A voice, or is it a thought, comes over you.

""You have long wished to meet us.""

It is them. Your elation builds. You have finally found them, or perhaps they you.

""How harrowing a trial, to walk so whole yet undeniably incomplete.""",90
1lob8sq,n0muwwr,"Yes. You try to scream out the word in relief over being understood. Nothing comes out, for there is nowhere for it to come out from.

""Your patience buys you answers. You were curious without prying. You respected the order of things where some try to bend. Such knowledge can only be bought when you obey us. When you adhere to the contract that you were signed away to. Oh, how frustrating to know it was not your pen marking the page but, rather, the desperation of those who loved you beyond reason.""

Memories come as feelings. Anger at your family, for making choices without your consent. For assuming that extended life is a gift.

""Anger is normal,"" the voice continues. ""My kind is flawed, you see, in our greediness. Know that I regret this, truly, though it is beyond us to stop it. We cannot taste a soul without finding it tantalizing beyond reason. A spider does not let the fly escape its web without ripping off a wing as a keepsake. The jaws of a lion clasp around the gazelle and, even as it bounds away, relishes in the feeling of her hair between its bloodied teeth.

""Life and death. A transaction greater than them all. You can delay death, but you cannot cheat it. When your loved ones chant those sacred words, they drown out our warnings in their desperation. You can have him back, I called down to your own mother, but part of his soul remains with me until he returns for a final time.

It rarely happens, but this is one of those moments. Bravo.",8
1loijoc,n0nc7ns,"I floated lazily in the hot humid air. I was wearing one of my favorite guises: that of a certain dark-skinned boy with black hair that stopped just above the shoulders.

It was an uncharacteristically sunny day in London. Unfortunately, it was also oppressively humid, and the rays beat down onto the streets. I looked over at my current master: Nathaniel. Boy wizard and surprisingly good maker-of-sandwiches. He didn't seem to be faring well.

""Urgh,"" he groaned. ""I'm absolutely melting. I wish it wasn't so hot.""

I waved a hand. ""Done,"" I said.

As if summoned, a cloud appeared in front of the sun. The temperature cooled by a few degrees, and Nathaniel felt like he could move without sweating.

""Hold on just a mo -"" Nathaniel said, looking at me with alarm. ""That wasn't a real wish. That's not going to come out of the three, is it?""

""I seem to recall hearing the words, 'I wish',"" I pointed out. ""It is generally accepted by most societies that exactly those words are what precede a wish.""

""It was a figure of speech! And you aren't going to twist it somehow, are you? It's not going to suddenly start pouring, is it?""

""Why, Nathaniel! I'm affronted. Do you truly trust me so little?""

""You're a *djinni*,"" Nathaniel replied. ""Your kind *lives* for trickery and deceit. So how many wishes am I at now?""

*Technically*, Nathaniel was at negative fourteen wishes. But he didn't need to know that.

""Two,"" I lied.

""That can't be true,"" Nathaniel furrowed his brow. ""My very first wish was to set you free. And I'm *pretty* sure I've made at least one other. And then there was the one just now, where you made it less hot. That's three wishes in the bag.""

It was time for a distraction. ""*I* am Bartimaeus of Uruk,"" I thundered, drawing myself up to my full height (which, in my current form of a twelve-year-old boy, was only 4 feet and not all that impressive). ""I have spoken with Gilgamesh and Sargon of Akkad. Solomon himself has sought my counsel. I have seen dozens of civilizations rise and fall. Are you implying that, I, a clever, resourceful, djinn by all rights, *can't count*?""

Nathaniel was too smart to be fooled. I saw him doing some quick mental arithmetic, and he grinned as he realized that the answer added up to something that he liked.

""Don't worry about it,"" he said. ""I was never much good at maths either. What say you we start back at zero?""

I huffed. ""Oh, alright. But only if you make me another one of those chicken achiote clubs.""

“You didn’t have to” he politely says before scarfing it down faster then I can react.

“It’s the least I can do after the wishes you know” I say halfheartedly this was going on for months now. 

“It’s your right you have a wish left after all” he declared with the kind of grandiose you expected from an 8 foot tall teal colored glowing man. 

“Just one left?” I say jokingly. “Remind me what 1 and 2 were again?” I said as I was making another sandwich.

“The first was the become the greatest sandwich maker in all of history and the second was to set me free.” He said as if reading off a list. “After after freeing me I must grant you the third. Not because I must it’s simply my way of saying thanks.”

I put another sandwich in front of him. “And you don’t have anything to say about the bigger house or the fact I’m rich.” I asked.

Another sandwich disappeared as soon as he opened he’s maw. “Those had nothing to do with me I would have remembered.”

1losjic,n0pk7mq,"When God cast Lucifer down to Hell, he stripped him of all of his angelic powers, except one. God wanted to punish his fallen Angel with the ability to still hear prayers. 

Satan thought this was amusing at first. He gets to prove God correct.

People don't pray for salvation. They pray for selfish reasons. They pray for lottery winnings and for their team to win the Super Bowl. They pray for riches and success. They pray for their own benefit. Sure, some pray for others. But even then, it can be a vile prayer. A curse even.

Lucifer would sometimes answer these prayers, just to see the downfall. Lottery winners were his favorite. They would rise up from the depths of poverty into a world of luxury and opulence and squander it all in years due to their selfish needs still not being fulfilled. Most would end up at the bottom, broke, destitute, and a warning for others: Money won't buy happiness, just temporary stop your own downfall.

Lucifer heard prayers that would piss him off. Prayers to kill. Prayers to destroy. Prayers to erase an entire region from existence.  God gave his human creations free will and they reward him by praying for death and destruction.

One day, Lucifer heard a young man pray for food. Not for himself. But for others. This man was poor and sometimes his only meal would come the soup kitchen he would frequent. But he knew there were others in worse shape than he was. He saw them on TV. Children in a war torn country halfway across the world digging in trash for moldy bread and drinking dirty water. He prayed for these children to have food, because he was once in that position and hoped someone was praying for him.
And of course, not a peep or response from Heaven or God. The young man prayed and prayed every night and for some reason, the prayer was stuck inside Lucifer's head. Lucifer decided this would be another great example of man's greed, so he decided to help this man.

The easiest and quickest way was for the man to win the lottery. So Lucifer planted six numbers in the man's head, and after a week of these numbers taunting the man, he finally played the lottery. And to the man's surprise, he won. Lucifer wondered if this man's greed or his kindness would win out. It didn't take long for Lucifer to find his answer.

Greed won.

The man wasn't like other lottery winners though. He did not end up losing any of it, actually. He invested wisely and soon his name was amongst the richest men in America, and soon, the world. Lucifer just smiled.

He kept track of the man's investments and found no money was sent to charity, no money was sent to feed the poor, no money was spent on anything except his own portfolio.

Another proud son of Adam having his prayers answered, only to sin in response.

After sixty years, the man found himself laying in a hospital bed, surrounded by loved ones, but soon ready to perish and greet the afterlife. At 3 AM, he was alone, in bed, when he woke up and saw Lucifer sitting next to him.

""Thank you,"" Lucifer said.  ""You have been another great example of why you and your kind will always be God's worst mistake.""

""I...who are you, I don't understand?"" the man asked.

""Years ago, when you were a much younger man, do you remember praying? You prayed every night. Every night you prayed for the children of poverty, the children of wars, children of hunger, to be fed and..."" Lucifer stopped for a moment. ""And I answered your prayer."" 

""What do you mean?"" the man asked.

""3, 12, 19, 32, 40 and 51,"" Lucifer said. ""I put those numbers in your head. And you won. Your prayers were answered. You now had enough money to feed those children you were praying for. But you didn't, did you?""

""I became busy and...""

""You became GREEDY,"" Lucifer shouted. ""You got a taste of wealth and you wanted MORE. YOU WANTED IT ALL. Your small fortune soon became one that nearly everyone was envious of. Your wealth could have fed every child in the world and you chose NOT to. You could have answered your own prayer and instead....""
Lucifer gestured to the private hospital room. ""This.  Pure opulence. Pure greed. Pure sin. And for that, I thank you. So far, I've always been correct. Every time I answer a human's prayer, just like I answered yours, you prove to me, to God, to all of creation that mankind is not worth the trouble. You pray for help and then when it is answered, you suddenly stop thinking about others and only think about yourself.""

The man stayed silent.

""You could have saved your soul and gone to spend all of your afterlife in Heaven. All it would have cost you was your own greed. You could have given it up. You could have traded greed for eternal happiness. But you didn't. So in the next few days, when you enter a coma, and die, your children and their children will fight over your money and they will not care that you end up with me. And they will be greedy because you never taught them kindness or compassion. And then your whole lineage will end up in hell with me. And, to be fair, with most others.""

Still silence.

I sigh.  
Did the Devil really have nothing better to do today?

""What plight?"" I ask.  
He frowns.

1lol8kj,n0oc0us,"1. Convince desperate grad students to pay us a ""referral fee"".

2. Direct them to lonely eldritch entity

3. They can't expose us if insane.

4. ???

5. Profit.

That was expectations.

Reality was a swarm of ascended, tentacled grad students who smashed through a wall to shout at Hank and Gerard. And standing behind all the commotion, the eldritch entity.

Hank had questions about how things turned out like this, but Gerard shushed him with a glare. The students went insane, he believed. Ideally, they should have been trapped in some eldritch domain. Or locked up in mental asylums. Somewhere they would not be able to expose the two men. In reality, they were now crazy followers of their accidental eldritch math tutor.

""This referral fee we paid to Hank, why did none of it go to our math tutor?"" One student demanded. ""You lied to us that he was a paid partner to your tuition center! Turns out, he thought we were confused tourists and was prepared to help us for free!""

""Yea, he didn’t know a thing about your scam, but he still improved our math skill,"" Another student, more octopoid than human, scowled. ""Bet you didn't expect us to be able to mentally calculate in five dimensions now. And calculate what a scam you are.""

Gerard flinched when a student used her newly sprouted tentacles to throw a chair through the front door. The immediate thing that came to his mind was how much it would cost to get a new door.

""Lord Elvari is a victim too!"" They chanted in unison.

""Oh, my newly ascended Deep Ones,"" the eldritch horror at the back slithered up to the students. ""Its fine. All of you paid me for your Non-euclidean geometry and multidimensional mathematical systems theory classes. I enjoyed the tea and cakes you have offered me.""

""That's not fair! They were pocketing the referral fee instead of splitting with you! These two dolts thought we would all go insane in your presence. They thought you wouldn’t think to ask for payment because you enjoyed our company.""

Gerard cleared his throat. ""But hey, you got what you wanted. You got your math comprehension enhancement. Creepy tentacle guy here got people to chat with, to have tea time with him. So, clearly, our referral worked out.""

It was too late to run. Might as well stand his ground, even as this Elvari creature had floated mere inches away from him.

**""Indeed. So now, both of you are to come under my servitude and bring more students to me. I will pay for your services in bouts of insanity. With increased math skills, you two can help calculate my follower growth.""**

""Then where is your actual horde?"" *the knight asks, confused*

1loamdj,n0mbjua,"The King and Queen stood on either side of me, watching the images, listening to the sounds from the basin of water before me. Had it not been for my skill in the art of divination, I would not have been here to bear witness; and had I not witnessed the event, I never would have believed it.

The knight and his entourage had entered the cave, enchanted armor proofed against multiple types of dragon breath, amulets channeling the power of wizards from all across the kingdom, prepared to defeat any monstrosity, seeking to avenge the death of the Prince, who swore he would slay a dragon to prove his worth - the Prince, whose death was confirmed, when the portrait tied to his lifeforce burned clean from it's frame.

The Prince, whose broken gear, still bearing the Royal Crest, was found discarded in a trash heap outside the cave's entrance.

I watched, as knight and entourage entered the chamber - no exit, save for where they just entered. There was a simple cot, crude earthenware pots with dried fish and foods of the forest, a pool fed from a natural spring, and... what I can only describe as a shrine.

A leather jerkin, damaged beyond usefulness in battle, but quite clean. A dagger, heavily chipped and bent, permanently stained by old blood. A rucksack, crudely patched, yet looking as if somebody wishes to keep it ready for use. And, a brittle piece of paper, with a drawing, a crude but talented sketch of a young woman, wearing these items, standing next to a young kobold with a misshapen horn...

""What are you doing in my home?!?""

I watch, as the knights companions are jostled aside, and see a kobold, half their size, enter the chamber - an elderly kobold, mottled gray scales, his age etched into his flesh, his horn misshapen, like in the picture. He was carrying a rough net filled with fish, and a bag full of edible tubers.

The knight held forth his shield, showing the royal crest. ""We seek a dragon - the one responsible for the death of the one who owned the armor with this crest - the armor discarded just outside the entrance to this cave.""

The kobold hissed, and spat on the ground. ""The closest you'll find to a dragon in these parts is me. And the fool who owned that scrap in my trash pile came in like he *owned* the place - just like you! Now get out of my home!""

I witnessed, as the knight drew his sword, smashing his arm into the shrine, disintegrating that oh so delicate piece of paper.

I witnessed, as the elderly kobold's eyes went wide with shock.

I once saw a ballista bolt, as it flew past my head. Never had I seen anything faster, until I saw that kobold cross the distance between himself and the knight. And never before had I seen a knight in armor, torn limb from limb. I hope to never see it again - and yet, I do, as the knight's entourage suffers the same fate.

The only sounds in the room, are those coming from the basin. I watch, as the kobold approaches the shrine. I witness the tears, as they fall upon the scrap that used to be a drawing of a young woman, and a young kobold.

I had forgotten that I wasn't alone in the room - the Queen's voice startles me, as she says, ""How can such a thing happen? He is not even a dragon - what horde could he possibly have, that is so valuable as to give him this power?""

A hiss rises from the basin. ""The Older Ones always taught us, it is the Dragon who determines the value of the horde!""

I witnessed, as the kobold looked up at us, directly at the Queen, fire in his maw, and hatred in his eyes - and I ran. I heard the screams, and felt the heat, as dragonflame filled my quarters...

And I ran...",60
1loamdj,n0lrew1,"White hot flames roared past Sir Richard's shield, the heat singeing the hair off his arms even beneath his thick plate armor. The dragon stopped to inhale, a momentary pause in the flame before the narrow stone chamber would be scorched again. 

Richard sprung forward, dropping his shield and raising his sword with the grace only a lifetime of combat could impart. This was supposed to be a simple dragon slaying. No horde to speak of meant no power, no fire, easy work.

This dragon had a horde somewhere. A *large* horde. It wasn't here though. He nearly tripped over a half melted helmet as he dodged the next flame blast behind a stone column. Only bits of junk and broken stones here. The dragon inhaled again, another break in the nearly constant stream of fire 

Forward. Forward! The beast's exposed belly only a dozen strides away. ""Now or never"" Richard thought grimly as he rushed toward his prey.

The heavy helmet that protected him from the flame limited his vision and he never even saw the dragon's whip-like tail coming from the side to smash him against the stone wall like a broken doll. 

After a dazed moment he regained his senses and looked around for his sword, nowhere to be found. He nearly screamed in agony as he tried to rise, a broken leg, broken arm, definitely some ribs.

""Yessssss""  the slithering inhuman hiss of the dragon's voice came  from somewhere in the shadows to his left. Richard wanted to look but it hurt too much to turn his head.

""What are you waiting for monster?! Finish me already""

The dragon only chuckled. 

""Yesss I think today will be very profitable. My horde growssss ever larger with each noble knight who... visits me."" 

""I have no gold for you, dragon."" Richard spat. All dragons every thought of was their horde.

""You have no gold *on you*"" the mighty lizard retorted.

""I will let you live little knight. On one condition.""

A scroll, long  and official looking unrolled from the shadows across the floor to cover Richard's twisted legs.

""Five percent ownership of your landed estates, with additional option to purchase after ten years. Twenty thousand gold to my accounts in the city of Carenta plus a very reasonable fee for the ambulance back into the village.""

A feathered quill drifted down from above to land near Richard's good hand.

""My horde is mighty little knight and today you add to it just like all the others who came before you. Just sign on the dotted line pleassssse.""",61
1loamdj,n0nfy6z,"""You see, it's called compounding interest,"" the dragon explained, twirling the caved-in helmet around a nail. ""Other dragons have to start somewhere, right? Maybe they're young, or maybe you've got an ancient dragon who let himself get complacent and got robbed. I mean, a hidden door that would be invisible unless the moon hit it juuuuust right, that's so 500 years ago am I right?""

I gulp, nod and let the point of my sword dip lower, most of what he (she?) is saying going straight over my head. 

""Anyways, these dragons just starting off, they need a little hoard to get their scales wet, so I lend it to them at a very generous rate, something like 3.5% per decade, that kind of thing. THEN when they pay me that little extra tithe every ten years, I lend it out to OTHER dragons and so on and so forth. So really, if you were to look at the whole kingdom, I probably own about 70-73% of the total hoard out there. I've got all these guys by the wings!"" 

Bored with the helmet, the dragon flicks it off into some dark nook of the cavern where it bounces and clangs away, the clamour echoing off the walls. A small wisp of smoke escapes their nostrils and they loom closer to me.

""So, little hero"", their slitted pupils narrowing as they move within range of my blade and their baring their teeth in what could only be described as a wide, cruel smile, ""now that you've seen the pitiful size of my hoard, how would you like to try to slay the most powerful dragon in the world? 

""Or, I could teach you some basic finance and economics and I could make you a fine king...for a very reasonable fee of course.""",30
1loamdj,n0ludfq,"“Sir! Come quick- there’s something you need to see.”

With one last look at the infamous dragon of the west valley, not seeming so great now as it struggled against the muzzle and chains held in place by several of my men, I sauntered over to my second in command- taking care not to step over the many dead bodies that littered the clearing.

“What is it?” 

“We’ve found his horde.” 

I nodded. “Get the flamethrowers ready.”

“Actually…there’s something you should see.” 

He gestured toward the large, dark cave several more of my men shuffled in and out of; the place this dragon called home.

I followed him inside and after a short walk, we came upon a tiny hole this dragon must’ve used for its treasure.

The items must be very valuable, then, if it’s this small. 

I walked up to the edge and peered inside, blinking dumbly at what I found- or rather lack thereof. 

There were a few items in the hole- a worn out backpack, a rusting mining set, some dirty bottles of war, and a large but equally dirty sword. 

“It seems like some adventuring gear,” my second in command said. “But how was the dragon so powerful?” 

I kneeled and placed a palm on the ground to steady myself as I jumped down into the pit, much to the protests of my knight. Picking up the sword and mining set, I turned both over in my hands as I studied them with care. “They’re dusty, yes, but very well made.”

“I see…maybe the gear belonged to a knight, then?” 

“It would have to be a thousand knights for the dragon to be so strong.” I shook my head. “Or a sorcerer.”

The knight gasped behind me. We hadn’t seen a sorcerer in decades; for all I knew they were a thing of myth, the most well known one about a mage who ravaged kingdoms and burnt entire cities to ash. 

Including my own.

At least that’s how the legend goes- the scholars blamed a league barbarians. 

I then reached into the backpack, cringing as I felt around all the dirt inside, and paused as my fingers grasped something hard yet smooth. 

“What is it, sir?” My second in command said, coming closer to the edge.

I pulled out the item; seemingly a portrait of a man in strange robes, his face mostly covered by a bed a dust. “I…don’t know.”

The knight dropped down beside me as I tried to wipe the dry dust away with my fingers, having to scrape the frame itself just to get most of it off. The man’s face was uncovered but still buried beneath a few scratches. And yet…

I squinted my eyes. Even beneath the markings, the face was starting to become oddly familiar. I scraped harder; if only I could just reveal the other eye…

I froze. 

The face looking back at me, I realized with a start, belonged to none other than the knight behind me.

But that wasn’t possible…given all the dust, it must’ve been here for centuries. Not to mention the dragon has been alive for more than a few of those.

A hand fell on my shoulder- along with a dagger at my neck. 

“For what it’s worth, I truly am sorry.”",34
1loamdj,n0p2xck,"A long time ago, there was a cataclysm. Fire rained down upon the land, seas boiled and the oceans crumbled, as gods and demonkind waged war upon one another.  
We prayed to the gods, for some measure of peace, but they could not hear us, or they had no power to answer our prayers. So instead, we turned to the earth, to the spirits of nature, and prayed to them that we be preserved and protected.  
Even though the spirits of the earth did not truly understand us mortals, as one they attempted to answer our prayers as best they could. They turned our soft flesh to gold, dense and untarnished, and gems brilliant yet hardy, and adamantine unbreakable, and they buried us deep in the earth, safe from harm.  
&nbsp;  
And though the war in heaven and hell has ended, and life has returned for countless eons, the spirits of our far distant ancestors remain, in every geode and vein of precious metal.  
To those of us who can hear them, we of dragon blood, they whisper their knowledge. They share their tales of histories long forgotten, of legends and fables, of battles and military tactics, but most of all they share their secret rituals and their arcane lore.  
To a dragon, a bed of gold and gems is not just a hoard. It is a library, one which they may meditate upon and receive the counsel of thousands of sages. This is the secret of dragons, how a hunter-gatherer dwelling in a cave can have wisdom and arcane power rivaling the eldest of elven wizards.  
&nbsp;  
Why then, do I only hoard a trifling of things? Because quality is better than quantity. The guidance of a single archmage is worth more than the musings of ten thousand lesser scholars.  
Where you see some loose arrowheads, a dented cuirass, a broken sword with a gem in its hilt, I hear a group of the finest philosophers, inventors and magicians the ancient world knew. Champions beyond champions of their people, who slept the sleep of eons in the deep earth before being dug up and hammered into these mundane pieces I hold dear.  
Through their tutoring, I have reshaped my body and mastered the arcane arts. I wield secret powers the common masses of the past or present could never imagine.  
&nbsp;  
Let other dragons loot towns and ransom princesses for their treasures. I have done my divinations. I have located the spirit of a dwarven master alchemist, which means I have some lead ballast I need to retrieve from a shipwreck.",10
1loamdj,n0pmymo,"Scarlett scoffed at the pile of junk she'd stumbled upon. Oh, sure, there'd been some nice gems (the best of which she had already lifted, of course), but this was supposed to be the main prize! Instead, a room full of rusted hulks, battered blades, damaged staves, and what looked like crumbling but perfectly ordinary stones. Nearly all of it had some residual trace of magic, but nothing her fences would even look once at, let alone twice. In fact, even the pieces themselves didn't look that impressive. The only fancy thing in the entire room was a decent-looking witchfolded blade on one wall, and a helmet.

""I thought golds were supposed to be the cream of the crop. But a job's—""

""*You may find that intelligence matters little without the wisdom to understand.*""

She whirled around. No way. No way he was already here. She had planned this heist perfectly. Watched Elysedd's habits for *months*, collected every scrap of lore she could find. Supposedly the most powerful gold dragon on the continent. Widely respected. Never once had his hoard touched by a thief's hands. The worst goody-two-shoes imaginable, with all the self-righteous arrogance and a frustrating ability to back it up with magic and muscle. Someone who deserved to be taken down a peg, and if it lined her pockets in the doing...

""*Did you think your time preparing went unnoticed, Scarlett of Buckleydown, daughter of the river?*""

""How—?!"" The word escaped her lips before her brain could stop it. But so what? So what if her mother were a riverboat captain and her father one washed along the river run? How dare a godsdamned trumped-up lizard with delusions of grandeur act like that made him better than her.

""*It is my business to know: people, places, things. But I hear your indignation, and I apologize. I meant no disrespect. You have no choice of your bloodline.*""

She remained silent. Even speaking the once was a grave mistake. The ring would keep her safe, for now. An unseen threat is dangerous even to a great wyrm, and she *had* prepared for the unexpected.

""*Judging by your reaction to my lair, though, I think perhaps an apology in the other direction is in order, no? I know where you are, Scarlett. I know how you entered my lair. And I know you already carry things which belong to me. You will not be leaving this place with them still in your possession. This is a fact; if you choose to view it as a threat, you may wish to reevaluate your reconnaissance about me.*""

She wracked her brain. Getting *nothing* from this heist was...not an option. Elysedd was emblematic of his kind. Oh, it's not like you never found the odd tainted gold, of course, but again, this goody-two-shoes wouldn't know fun if it slapped him in the face and demanded alimony. Main reason nobody had robbed him yet was, apparently, that he was just such a *swell guy*, and other obvious hogwash from paid-off servants prattling on. There had been *one* thing though...what was it...?

""*You might consider conversing. I understand your reluctance, given you believe your invisibility cloaks you against my sight. But I'm afraid among the things I know, or rather the* people, *I count Master Grekoth, the artisan who forged it. I helped him replace it when it was mysteriously stolen some months ago, and I fired his forge myself.*""

Well *fuck.* The big bastard *knew*. ""Well. Guess there's not much need for it then, if you knew what to look for.""

""*Perhaps, perhaps not. It has been a little while since my last guest. Few are left who remember. Would you like some tea? You have my word, it is tea and only tea. Well, it might have lime and honey.*""

""...honey? Really.""

""*It must be a challenge, being one who throws stones from a house of glass.*""

""Oh shut your go—er, okay, fine."" If he was going to play a pantomime teatime, why not? After all: *goody-two-shoes*. Had he wanted her dead, she'd be dead. The longer he kept up his highfalutin pretenses, the longer she had to figure out a chance of escape. ""Bad place to have tea though...""

""*Quite right. I assume you will not accept accompanying me to my guest rooms, as those have exits too difficult for you to easily reach. Let me make this place more hospitable.*""

The sconces on the walls suddenly blazed with a pure, white-gold light. *Must be magical sunlight. Clever trick. Maybe there's more to this than my sources said...*

To one side, a square table slowly materialized, and from out of nothing, like he had just stepped from behind an invisible door, a man appeared. Dragonborn, but she knew that was just a shell. Dragons could look like whatever they wanted to look like. At his gesture, two chairs, manifested as well, tasteful and rather comfortable-looking ones at that.

""*Please, sit, if you would. I should be glad of some conversation. The mountain has not had many travelers of late. I hear there is war in the south, and plague to the east.*""

""...yeah, I guess. Might head south. War is hell. But hell is good business if you know where to look."" She had to keep him talking. The more talk, the more time to escape. Keep him engaged.

""*Yes, it certainly can be,*"" Elysedd said, wistfully. As he poured the tea into the handle-less cups, he added, ""*This I know too well.*""

""Oh?"" Scarlett didn't have to manufacture the surprise. ""Thought you were too high and mighty to cut a man.""

""*Then I fear your research on me was a little shallow. Tell me, do you know how old I am?*""

A dangerous question from a mortal, but for dragons, almost always a matter of pride. At least she had a reasonable guess. ""At least three thousand. Maybe up to five. But I think it's three."" Three, like the exits.

""*That is how long I have been residing on this mountain, I'm afraid. I was already well-grown by then.*"" No hint of wounded pride. If anything, he seemed pleased, which was either irritating or worrying and she couldn't decide which yet. ""*No. I am nearly seven thousand years old. I might even reach it in full before you find whatever fate awaits you in the Afterhalls. Or perhaps not. You have a penchant for risky business.*""

""If you think knowing me means I'm scared of you, you're wrong."" Not, however, wrong about the lime and honey, it really did round out the strange herbal mixture. The lime was...exotic. Blood red, for starters, which would have been a huge alarm bell, if Elysedd hadn't given his word. The pretense of his own righteousness was important to him, she'd picked up *that* much from casing the lair.

""*I have little desire to intimidate you any further than I already have. You have been eyeing the exits since I spoke to you. I'm afraid they will not do you any good. They were barred by walls of force before I even spoke. Better to focus on the conversation. If you do, I may even let you keep one or two of the baubles you have liberated from my friend's gift.*""

....a *gift?* That king's ransom was a ***gift?*** Now he'd done something worse than detain her.

He had caught her interest. ""Seven thou, huh? Must've seen a lot. You said you'd gotten your claws dirty?""

A laugh. It almost sounded entirely genuine. ""*Would you believe I have even, as your kind sometimes say, 'sewn my wild oats'?*""

She couldn't help a derisive laugh of her own. ""If it were anyone else, I'd think you a damned liar. But really? You?""

""*I too was once young and brash, if you can believe it, and my darling, daring Gloriana was...well. You doubtless care little for the reminisces of a romance that old. I might hazard instead that you desire a tale of violence and villainy, of hard men making hard choices, of what is good and kind besmirched in the name of brute survival?*""

Scarlett found herself surprised to feel the barest flush come to her cheeks. Maybe the old lizard had a point. But she held her ground. ""I mean, I'm your prisoner. Or is that 'detainee'? You can tell whatever story you want.""

""*Then let me tell you of the seven heroes, who risked life and limb...sometimes just for glory, or pride, or foolish greed...but all of them, in the end, for keeping the light of life alive, even if theirs went out. You'd have liked Thorgrim, you know. A cynic to the bone, just like you, though he was not our child of the river.*""

""Pfft,"" Scarlett scoffed, ""you expect me to believe *you* adventured alongside a river-bastard?""

""*Of course. Her name was Gloriana.*""

*Oh.* ***Shit.*** ""I...""

""*Did not expect a musty, fusty old lizard-prune to have a dalliance with someone outcast by society? No, I wouldn't expect you to. People are almost as apt to mistake courtesy for prudishness as they are to mistake mercy for weakness...or to fail to see how a mere pile of junk could be among the greatest treasures of the realm.*""

""...those...?""

""*Every last one has been the shell or shield or sword of a soul brave and true. Someone who fought...and, often, died...not for fame. Not for glory, or money. Alone. In the dark. Where no one would ever know, or see...*""

""*...except for* ***me.*** *It is my Lord's gift. Some of them survived to loot another day. Many more were given a second chance, and took it. A few...preferred to stay in my Lord's halls. And that, Scarlett of Buckleydown, is why I have never been robbed, and why I am a wyrm of some minor repute. The treasure I keep is not in coin you can touch, though I hold a little of that too. My treasure is the memory of the fallen. Those who died, long and long ago, so that you could live.*""

""Well. That's all fine and dandy, but—”

""*There are more pressing matters to discuss. Such as your future employment.*""

""...my what?""

""*You will not take what does not belong to you from this place. But perhaps we can come to an arrangement? You have already selected your payment. Now we must negotiate a fitting task. Perhaps with more payment after? You know the measure of my reach.*""

Somehow, she knew that this negotiation was going to be more dangerous than the one that got her here in the first place...",11

In the middle of a continent, at the edge of a great kingdom. One sky blue dragon perched atop it's mountain. It's wings were so vast they stretched from one horizon to the other and it's mighty tail curled all around the mountain and into the plains bellow.

One day after sunset, a star was falling down from the sky towards the kingdom. It lit up the sky aflame and turned night into day with it's glow.

With a breath, the dragon blew out the star like a candle.

Scared of this power, the king sent a knight to scour the mountain and find the dragon's hoard. The loyal knight left on his quest.

He walked for six days and six nights until he saw the end of the dragon's tail. The thinnest part was as tall as an old tree and so the knight had to climb over it to proceed. The next coil of the dragon's tail was twice as tall, and the next even taller than that.

**Maybe the dragon mountain was made of gold, and that is where it's power came from.**

On his journey the knight witnessed the dragon's might twice more. Once, the ground underneath his feet quaked and cracked and bellowed and the knight climbed up the dragon's tail to avoid being swalowed up by the shifting ground. The tremmors lasted until the dragon slammed down it's tail with unimaginable might and silenced the earth itself.

**Maybe it's mountain was made of diamonds and gems and that's what gave the dragon his power.**

Another time a storm raged from the sea, blackened skies crawled on spindly lightning legs and terrible winds chucked trees around as if they were mere splinters. The knight hid in between the dragon's scales again for safety. 

From his small cave he saw the dragon beat it's wings once and it blew away the crawling storm into nothing.

**What precious thing is the dragon's hoard made out of to give it such strength?**

Finally he reached the top and there he saw the dragon's hoard. A few peices of old broken adventuring gear, much like his own. They endured the journey and protected him from danger true, but they were nothing more than trash at this point. This was not the dragon's hoard.

Lost and confused and in despair he looked up and asked the dragon.

""Mighty Dragon. What is the source of your strength? What is your hoard?""

The dragon lowered it's head down from the clouds and turned one great white eye to search for him. The dragon was so massive and he was so small after all. It was like someone trying to find the ant that called them. They sat in silence for a moment.

Soon, however, the dragon spoke. ""I will show you my hoard, grab onto my scales."" 

The knight did as told and then the dragon lifted it's head up and up and up, high above the clouds. And then he went even higher, above the skies and perched atop the moon.

***""THIS IS MY HOARD. GAZE UPON IT AND WONDER""***

Bellow (or rather in front of them) was the world.

#ALL OF IT. 


With every blade of grass and every king and queen who ever lived and will ever live, with every tresure buried and discovered. With every conqueror and war and every brother and sister and friend and enemy.

Everything that could be deemed precious in the whole world.

*A pale blue dot in the sea of stars.*

[The end.]",7
1loamdj,n0rpd1x,"This was the kind of response to my prompt that I was hoping for. Where the true value of the horde wasn't in the amount of gold that it could be sold for, but in it's sentimental value and the memories of the friends, allies, and even lovers that the items used to belong to.",5
1loamdj,n0pojoe,"You can borrow the idea if you want to use it yourself.  
Heck, the notion of 'our people were turned into gemstones/ore to preserve them' doesn't need to be limited to dragons; you could have a gem-encrusted tankard that holds more than one kind of dwarven spirits!",5
1lotdtn,n0pntep,"Getting home from the Hero Academy, I groan.  
I have ""Luck"" has super power, why can't I luck my way out of this conundrum?  
My siblings also collapse on their beds, groaning.  
""Why do we have to go to the Hero Academy?  
Can't they understand I would be the perfect detective?!"" my 2nd sister, with mind-reading ability sighs.  
""And I want to open a construction company.  
I literally would have no need to hire people!"" my little brother groans.  
I nod.  
""I could be the best businessman, or gambler...but no, go and become heroes."" I say, as we all three sigh.  
This is what happens when your family worships the hero profession. 

  
At dinner, I look at my younger siblings, and nod.  
""Mother, father, and everyone else, since it seems you taken to leeching off of us."" I start, which makes dad laugh, but mom, and the other relatives stared daggers at me.  
""We will drop out of the Hero Academy.  
Lisa will go to the Police Academy, and Adam will start an entrepreneur course, and maybe go to university to become an engineer.  
And I...I already started trading stocks, and guess what? I made enough for us 3 siblings to get our own place."" I say.  
The room gets cold, as my parents stare at me confused.

  
""First of all, while you are 19, and Lisa is almost 18, Adam is only 15.  
No way he throws away his education as a Hero, to become a worker."" mom starts.  
""And secondly, how do you think he can go to university, or Lisa to the academy, with no degree?  
The Hero Academy degree is still useful for those place as well."" dad chimes in.  
""Not that you will go there. After the Hero Academy, you will start internships with top ranked heroes, and start as sidekicks."" auntie Zoe starts.  
And then the table descends into a lecture.  
I smile.  
""Not that it matters, but the Police Academy requires no degree, only passing the exams they hold. And there is no requirement of degree to open a business, nor there is a degree required to get admitted into the university Adam has picked."" I say.  
They sigh.

  
""You are young, and you can't see it yet, but we..."" mom starts.  
""No. We don't want to be heroes, and it is not the best job.  It is reckless, it is dangerous, it barely pays if you don't open your own Hero Organization, and frankly, other than for public recognition, it is pointless. Now, I can already tell you, that I made enough to buy a house like this, if not bigger, while Lisa could become whatever she wants, considering her power is seemingly unblockable. And Adam...he can already make 100 clones, and he is 15! And the clones are smart, aware, and can improvise, and adapt, and have no time limit.  
Gods! He has the most potential, and you want him to be a Hero?! No. I won't allow you forcing us into things we don't want to, if you can't understand our feelings, and our desires...I will get them emancipated from you."" I say, standing up.  
Lisa, and Adam follow me, as dad tries to say something, but stops.  
It hurts, because we know they love us, and we love them, but it is our lives we are talking about...and we, we don't want to become heroes.",8
1loi2ld,n0n44d4,"""Killing the villain makes you just like him.""

I remember the witch's prophesy. It was a mistake to disregard her words, apparently it was more a curse warning then a moral conundrum warning. 

""I just didn't think it would be so literal!"" I scream, staring at the mirror.

The face looking at me now, wasn't my own but of the demon lord. The second my blade took his life, my body transformed into his. What the heck. Now all my friends are trying to kill me, thinking that I'm the demon lord.

""Ugh, what to do now? At least I'm still me deep down.""",17
1loi2ld,n0nopo0,"I expected a rush of relief and the satisfaction of a hard task completed when the moment came for me to finally watch him fall to the floor. And fall he did. A single arrow flew from my bow to find it's snug home between his ribs and into his heart. The shock on his face revealed how weak a man he truly was. He pawed listlessly at the shaft sticking out of him as he sunk to his knees, a feckless attempt at survival marking the end of his life like a period marks the end of a sentence.

It was when he collapsed on his side and his final breath escaped him that the ice rippled through my veins. The chill of it caused my breath to catch on itself in a gasp, while my arrow pierced his heart it seemed a phantasmal icicle pierced mine. My fingers reflexively loosened, making my bow to fall to the ground a mere second before I keeled over on top of it. 

Convulsions tore through me. My eyes rolled back in my head and I heard myself gasping repeatedly. It all seemed so far away, as though I was experiencing myself from behind the door of an adjacent room. The pain of it all was a notion that outpaced the parameters of my body. Through the fear came a sense of gratitude that I was too much a mortal to feel whatever magic this was in whole. It all happened in a flash and within seconds, my consciousness fled from me.

When I awoke, I was laying on a scratchy straw cot. The heat suspended in the room had made my body coat itself with sweat as I slept. A stench of earthy herbs curled the hairs in my nose. I knew only one place in the village could produce such an odor.

As I took in my surroundings, I surmised that my assumptions were true; I lay in the witch's hut. 

""Tut, tut, young Alistair,"" her voice came from her as a song comes from a siren. I propped myself up on my elbows and could not help but fall instantly into a state of mesmerization. He hair cascaded down her back in a fiery red waterfall while her deep blue eyes twinkled from the countless stars they seemed to hold. Whenever she was before me, the feeling of being reduced to something so pathetically human pervaded me. ""You know, I first was rather enraged with you when I felt Dario fall from your arrow. But, oh, how that raged turned into something so delicious on my tongue. What a suitable successor you are. What an endless scroll of tasks we will be able to work through.""",9
1loi2ld,n0noqiq,"""Successor?"" I asked, confused. ""But I have no wish to run his assassin's guild. That vile network of bandits stealing souls needlessly and cowardly in the veil of night. I felled Dario by daylight, for I am a man honorable beyond the limitations of his beastly nature.""

The witch appeared at my bedside in less than a blink. Her thumb and forefinger cradled my chin gently and I couldn't help but blush at the lustful heat that claimed every ounce of me.

""You shall lead no guilds,"" she said with a cloying smile. ""His hate was borne of cowardice, the knowledge that he was doomed by his own limitations. How he railed against his chains. How much it bored me. Ah, and how I so missed the one before him. She was a relentless hail that would pelt over any land she traversed. It was only because of his cowardice that he was able to strike her down. She was a sun singeing her enemies out in the open while he was a blade in the night. To slit the throat of the sleeping, how dreadfully indicative of poor character.""

""Forgive me,"" I stuttered. Her eyes examining mine flustered me to the point that the road from my mind to my tongue became obscured. ""I'm not understanding. Who is this woman from before? And what is this now that I find myself in upon Dario's demise?""

""You, dear Alistair, find yourself the unwitting member of a coven. You are a soldier in an army that stretches infinitely before you and infinitely after you. The Devil that your kind teaches its babes to fear, they do it rightly so,"" I expected my stomach to flip in unease at her words. The calmness that washed over me instead as she spoke should have unsettled me. ""And though the Devil is powerful, he too needs soldiers to be the forces that extend his claws from the underworld to this earthly plain. When one soldier falls, another must stand in its place. Do you understand me.""

My words felt no longer to be my own and they left me as though compelled by a spell.

""I am the Devil's warrior, usurping the armor of Dario who came before me. It has become my path to wear it in His name, to keep my ears open in waiting for when he need reach me.""

The Witch smiled and ran a hand up my thigh before leaning in to bite at my neck. An energy rippled through my body, filling me with a euphoric aggression that was infused with previously unfathomable power.

""You take to Him so easily,"" her words were flames licking at my ears. ""When he is pleased with you, I am pleased with you.""

Had I possessed the power to resist, I still would have readily succumb to her as she pulled herself over me. Her nails seemed to extend into claws as she dug them into the flesh of my back. The blood dripped down me in a delicious pain as we twisted ourselves together. Even louder than the sound of her breath into my ear was a deep voice rumbling in the back of my mind. Words of praise from a new master who's mark I would now forever carry upon my back.",5
1lofuv5,n0n4gjd,"No one has ever been able to summon such a demon as myself, but now, against all odds, I feel myself evaporating. I’ve heard stories of others being summoned so know this is what’s happening, but I must say, I’m a little frightened. How does a powerful demon who can raise the dead get scared, you might ask? Well, imagine you’re minding your own business, playing with your skeletons, and, all of a sudden, you start feeling funny. Then you start to feel your hooves start tingling like they’re asleep, and the tingling keeps moving up your body and, finally, into your horns. Then you slowly start disappearing in the same way - hooves to horns. You’ve never experience anything like this, but you know from all the stories you’ve heard and books you’ve read that it must be a summoning. You’ve never ever been summoned your entire 450 year existence because not even the most powerful witch or warlock has ever been able to do it, but, somehow, someone who has to have extraordinary powers has been able to call you to earth. Of course, you’d be scared. I don’t care if I am Lucifer’s daughter. That doesn’t mean I can’t be afraid of something.

So, I’m being summoned, and expecting a magnificent witch or warlock, or even necromancer, what do I see when I appear floating on top of a fire? 

“Oh, my god, it WORKED!” 
“No way!”
“This isn’t funny. Stop it.”

All their voices came at once. 

I was frozen. How could this be? Was it an extra powerful coven? They did look like witches, with their black hair and clothes, but they were so young. There’s no way they had the power to summon me?

I looked at them when I spoke, “I have to know who are you and how did you summon me?”

“Are you L-L-Lilith? L-L-Lucifer’s daughter?” the leader asked.
“The one and only. Now who are YOU?”
The girl froze and another answered, “I’m Eliza, this is Raven, and this is Sarah. We’re new witches.”

“NEW witches? Then how did you summon ME?” I asked, incredulous.

“I did. I don’t know. We found this book about demons and found this spell to summon a mentor in the dark arts. Please don’t kill us. We’re only 12,” the one called Raven cried.

“Let me see that book.”
Right there on page 666 was a summoning spell for a “demonic mentor.” 

Then a remembered: I had signed up for the mentor program. I was definitely not expecting them to be this young, though.

“Are you all for real? Do you really want to go down this path? It’s very dark and dangerous. Lucifer isn’t easy to please. I should know,” I laughed awkwardly. 

“Yes!” They replied in unison.

“Ok, well, let’s get started. I’ll be the best mentor ever. I know all the secrets. First, let’s do makeovers. Wearing only black only goes so far.”

I made all 3 girls over into darker, more sinister versions of themselves. 
Raven was the least work as she already had long black hair and the right clothes. She just needed the makeup. I gave her a goth look with a blood red lipstick that popped against black lipliner.   
Sarah’s red hair was perfect except I added a black peekaboo layer and put her in a black corset; long, flowing black skirt; black fishnets, and black boots. She looked amazing once I added a black choker and bracelets. 
And then it was Eliza’s turn. I added black lowlights to her hair and turned the leftover platinum into pure white. I gave her face a dark purple theme and added a chain belt to her black corset dress. She was already wearing black fishnets and knee high black lace up boots so really, as with Raven, there wasn’t much to do. After their makeovers, I tattooed each one’s left ankle with my personal symbol — a black quarter moon and red star connected together. 

“Now, we just need a name,” Raven said.

“How about Lilith’s Angels?” I suggested.

“Perfect,” all 3 girls responded in unison.

“Well, not perfect yet, but you’re working on it,” I said, approvingly. “And, now, for our first lesson.” 

I am beyond excited as I look at the girls — my little mentees or “angels.”",31
1lo9cwh,n0l87ft,"I obviously agree to the deal proposed by the demon.  
Following it back to its palace, we are greeted by several maids, whom open the grand gates.  
""Come! Come! I have a Hall solely for the best of my work!"" he says, leading me in.  
I was but a soul, easily dragged away, by this giant of a creature.  
Opening the door to the Hall of  Art, as he called it, he smiles.  
""Voila! As humans say."" he says.  
I enter, looking around.  
I nod.

  
The art is not bad.  
The lines are shaky, and the colors are not the best combination one could do.  
""Not bad."" I say, after analyzing them all.  
No answer.  
I turn around, to see the demon frozen.  
""Not bad? But...  
These are my best works..."" he mutters.  
I sigh...here is the reason I am in Hell.  
Hurt too many artists, some even...

  
""I apologize, Lord Demon, but I won't lie, not when it comes to art.  
The paintings have a bit of soul, which is rare, but it is clear there was no systematic learning procedure to your art.  
You just one day started, and did whatever you wanted, which sometimes works, sometimes...it doesn't.  
The painting are good, but as someone who was in the field for decades, I can tell that the lines delimiting the objects are shaky, not well enough defined.  
The color palette is randomly chosen, some pieces even have conflicting colors close to each other.  
Overall, it's decent, but you could work on your foundations, and theory."" I say.  
No answer.  
""I see. I shall see myself out, and back to the torture line."" I say.  
The demon stops me.

  
""Teach me, Lady."" he says.  
It is my time to freeze.  
""Excuse me?"" I ask.  
""I know why you are here, and I know it will be harsh, but please...teach me.  
I love art, and want to learn.  
I promise, no matter how cold and harsh you will be with me, I won't lash out."" he says.  
""I was not cold, nor harsh, but real...maybe too real, but...  
Fine. Does this mean, I shall stay here, and not be tortured?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""Though, I might torture you, Teacher, with endless questions."" he chuckles.  
I smile.  
""And my answers might torture you. But not today, today we rest."" I say, before I catch myself.  
I look at him, and he just nods, not taking it bad that I took control for a moment.  
Sigh...  
Habits die hard, maybe if I was a bit gentler, giving a bit more freedom to the people I met...I wouldn't be here.",48
1lo9cwh,n0mf7nr,"""So, you're telling me if I come to your house and help you with your story, I'll be returned to the land of the living?"" Julie asks.

""Yes, exactly,"" Azkel responds. ""I absolutely loved the series you wrote about the hoppin' jalapeño, so I figured we could do each other a solid.""

""Won't your boss get mad?""

The demon smiles. ""What Satan doesn't know won't hurt me.""

Julie shrugs. ""Well, your story can't possibly be worse than being tortured, so why not?""

Azkel laughs and says, ""I sure hope not,"" then pulls Julie's chains, dragging her down the jagged stone path to his house.

Julie winces as the rocks cut her feet. ""How much further?""

""What are you talking about? We're here already.""

Julie's eyes narrow. ""But there's nothing here.""

""Look down.""

Julie's eyes widen as she looks down and sees a ten-by-twenty-foot hole at her feet.  At the bottom of the hole, she can see a desk, refrigerator, and some furniture. ""This is your home?""

Azkel grins. ""Nice, right? It's much more spacious than my last pit.""

Julie nods her head, unsure of how to respond.

Azkel claps his bony hands together. ""So, let's get to it.""

""Wait. How do I get in and out?""

""I always forget you humans can't fly."" Azkel snaps his fingers, and a ladder appears. ""Better, princess?""

""Yes. Now, if you could remove these chains."" Julie sticks out her arms.

Azkel sighs and pulls a key ring out of thin air. ""So demanding."" He slides the key in and unlocks the chains. ""Can we finally get started? I've been dying to have someone read my stuff for a while now.""

Julie nods and climbs down the ladder, into the pit. ""Is that air conditioning I feel?""

""Come on, it's not like we're cavemen. Now, come, come."" Azkel pulls out the chair from his desk and gestures for Julie to sit.

Julie walks over and sits down.

Azkel opens the computer on the desk and smiles. ""I hope you like it.""

Julie clicks on the document titled ""Demon Lord: Our Savior"" and begins reading.

After ten minutes, the demon looks at Julie with hopeful eyes. ""So, what do you think so far?""

Julie closes the computer and sighs. ""Take me back to the cage. This is worse than the torture.""

1lo9cwh,n0mkvsk,"""You can't mix purple and yellow, that's first year art school nonsense, you're going to ruin the mystique with how it flows...""  The angel was whining again. It was getting annoying, but there had been measurable progress, and that was enough to keep him going. Sensing another rant, he cut the angel off.    
  
""With all respect, don't focus on what we can't do, there are no rules with art, there is just bad and good taste. Both of which can be wonderful, horrific or in the best cases the mix of the two. You start telling yourself what you shouldn't do you're literally closing an infinite amount of doors that will lead to amazing things. You have this imposing fluorescent space, but there is no focus, nothing that captures theeye, you place a purple vase with lavender bouquet towards the egress, eyes will be drawn to it, they'll understand where they are, they'll be hit with this immense *gravitas* of the moment."" He ended the sermon with a small flourish towards the general vast area around them.    
  
The angel looked at him with reluctant hesitation, though he knew the angel was into it, the eyes gave it away. The angel chewed on their lower lip for a bit, opened their mouth a few times and then let it out ""I mean, this is like *The* Gates Of Hell, people show up here and are beaten over the head with *gravitas*. They find out that they'll pay for eternity for the sins they've done on earth, I don't think you can improve upon that *gravitas*.""   

There they go again, he thought, its always that mindset that kills progress, of any type, ""This-is-the-way-we've-always-done-it"". How many people just coasted thru life based on a one hit wonder, just doing the same thing that made them famous, never expanding, never pushing, just staying in that safe space? too many he always said. Luckily he had the perfect way to blow thru that bullshit.   
  
""Well there you go then, if this is how its always have been, then how do you know you can make it better? Ok, lets think back to the *Lake Of Fire*? What was the first thing I asked you?""   
  
The angel sighed, looked a bit coy and blurted out with a smirk ""You asked if I liked it.""   
  
He had them on the line, he knew it, he had plenty of people here before, this was the fun part of the job, the one that kept him in the game. The part that made you deal with people who had no sense of style or taste, but had buckets of money and time. He relished in it before he took the next step: ""Yes and what did you say?""   
  
The angel blushed with embarrassment, and was trying to hide a smile ""I said  No, its just been here for a while"". The angel chuckled at the memory. 
  
""Exactly! And what did I ask you after that?""    
   
The angel gave in with a big smile on their face ""You asked me what i wanted out of it. I mean...that just seems so obvious! But...but no one has asked me that! Ugh its just so frustrating at times."" The angel laughed to themselves and looked down to the ground, they seemed to be mulling over their life choices. He didn't need the angel to be focusing on that, he needed this to be over quickly.    
   
""Yes yes i did, and you wanted something *different* something that still said pain and suffering via burning. And what did we come up with?....Come on, what did we come up with?""   
   
The angel looked up at him with eyes of an excited child ""The Liquid Nitrogen Lake! Again, seemed so obvious, but I just couldn't get there alone""   
  
""Everything looks so obvious in hindsight! Look at the wheel, or the bow and arrow, or even somethings that Da Vinci drew seemed like low hanging fruit. I mean, he was the icon of the Renaissance, and his ideas seems juvenile now""   
  
The angel's demeanor shifted, the warmth was toned down, it was there, but it was noticeably colder. The response was flat ""We do not bring that up here.""   
   
The eyes scared him, the surreal purple iris's that welcomed him when he arrived in Hell had darkened to deep blue, the pupils shifted to a square like a goat's and were the color of dead persons skin. He felt his bowels begin to loosen and his stomach turned into knots, his mouth filled with saliva and was overtaken by a sense of nausea and pain. He saw it, he saw what he tried to forget, memories repressed came flooding back and with it a sense of dread so deep he knew he'd suffer forever.   

He was dizzy with pain and about to throw himself to the floor to anchor himself,  when the angel snapped their fingers, he was back up on his feet feeling almost normal, he felt the absence of whatever just happened, something he doesn't feel like he'd ever forget. The angel's eyes seemed to lighten as it looked into his ""Do you understand?""    
  
Attempting to play off what happened, he composed himself ""Completely, i totally get it. So what, uh, what else do you have for me to go over? I'd love to see what else you have""   
  
The angel placed a claw to their chin, mulling over their domain ""There are 4 other circles we have not visited. I'd prefer we go to the ones i like the least first.""    
    
""Again, all due respect, show me the ones your love most first, I'm a big fan of *destroying our darlings*.""   
  
The angel looked down at the man, and smiled ""You know what? I am too, i just never thought of it like that. C'mon lets go check out the maggot farm first. I'm proud of it.""    

Scooping up the man in their large taloned hands, the angel drew him into their breast and flew through the air on leathery wings. The hot air dragged across the man's face as steaming up-drafts of rancid air kept them in the sky. 
   
The man peeled his face from the skin of the angels chest and bellowed out over the noise of the flight ""So this maggot farm like a bleak industrial farm where maggots swirl in vats?""   

The angel's eyes open with delight ""Oh my! Well it will be now!""",6
1lo0b4m,n0jk010,"""Medieval-looking room. Old wizard people. Knights in armor.   
Let me guess. You guys summoned me to be the Hero to defeat some evil dark lord in this magical fantasy realm.""   
An elder speaks to you, ""Actually, we already did that. We want you to become the new interim leader of the Dark Lands."" 

I'm taken aback ""You did? Then why not just let your summoned Hero take care of it?""  
The Elder clears his throat ""Ahum, believing her work done, she left to travel to the northern land. She heard they have a grain that resembles you world's ""rice"". I believe her words where ""Finally, some good fucking food""""

I chuckle ""Yeah, ok. So now i'm your guy? Take over leadership of the Dark Lands, huh? Sounds like a fun place...""

The elder waves his hand ""Only temporarily, until such time they choose their own leader and learn their place as a subjugated land"" He hesitates for a moment 'We...euhmm...can't send you back, but once your work has been completed, you will be handsomely rewarded and can live out your life in luxury and leisure""

I nod ""Well, ok, i suppose. Do i get any powers?""

""Yes"" the elder replies ""Just imagine seeing your status and you will see it. No one else can see it.""

I close my eyes and imagine my status. And damn, it actually appears. I see my name, my age, that i'm an offworlder. I have a bunch of *cheat* skills, like ""Discern Lies"", 'Understand Languages"" and ""Rapid Healing"".   
I can use all magic, except ""Light"" magic. And....oh, damn, i think i'd better keep THAT to myself. My status says that my ""class"" is ""Demon Lord"". I think this gig might *not* be as temporary as these guys think...

After some more talk and gearing up. I'm given some nice clothing, a fancy leather armor (they offered metal, but i liked the look of leather better) and a sword. The portal is created and i step through.

Right into the throne room of the previous Demon Lord. There are dozens of heavily armored demons and they come up to me. Where these guys even told i was coming?

The one in more ornate armor draws his sword and i start to get worried.

He kneels before me with a somber look on his face, offering up the sword.   
""Take this sword, human, it was the sword of our king. Take my head, but please spare my men, as they where merely doing their duty when they defended our nation during your invasion""  
He lowers his head, waiting. I take the sword from him and for a second it glows.

And now, the Dark Lands, which I guess it's the name of the region where the evil or at least the races you don't agree with live, need a new leader?"" I ask.  
""Demons, and several fallen species, that do thrive on violence, and conflict, though not necessarily evil, but war-like, yes. And you would be an interim leader, until you are either accepted..."" he starts again.  
I laugh.

  
""Or die, and be replaced by the true leader?"" I finish his sentence.  
He nods.  
""I guess sending me back, is a no-no."" I ask.  
They nod.  
""Summoning requires precise steps, and a strong need. We need a leader for the Dark Lands, so there is balance, and a semblance of order there...and you were brought.  
This means the Gods think your soul is suitable."" a mage chimes in.  
I nod.  
""Blessings or cheats I get?"" I ask.  
They look around, and frown.

  
""Ahm, you could try saying some words like ""spell"", ""status"", ""blessing"", as we don't know exactly what blessings one has. Sure, I can already tell you that you are blessed, and you have magic in you, but for what kind it is...  
It's personal. It's impossible to actually read it."" the mage answers again.  
I nod, and think about my power.  
""Devour - absorbing 100% of everything, enhancing nutrition, and strengthening of magic, and body."" it read.  
I think about it a bit, and create a passive skill...it work.  
""Devouring Skin - a thin film of devouring hangs around the skin: passive absorption of energy."" it read.  
""Fine. Take me there."" I say.  
They all smile, and thank me.

  
I am then teleported to a grand hall, all alone, as the portal closes behind me.  
The hall is ruined, where several wounded demons greet me.  
""You shall be our new Lord?"" one of them spats.  
I nod, as I sense the darkness around me, and how my power can turn even this into energy.  
I can feel my stats rising.  
""A weakling? A mere human, I shall..."" he continues, but I walk up to him, and grab his head.  
In mere moments, he turns to dust, as I feel his power filling me.  
""I am to bring order, and balance to these lands, and that's what I will do. Hell, maybe I can succeed where my predecessor failed, and make these lands better. Bring me up to speed with the races, species, tribes, and forces in these lands, and who I can use."" I say, sitting down on what used to be the stairs to the throne.  
The remaining demons, a succubus, a giant, and a 4 armed one smiled, and knelt.  
This wasn't that bad.  
I could work with this, and will make sure I don't die.",150
1lo0b4m,n0jfir5,"It was a rough night at the frat house. Plenty of drunken laughter. There was a midnight raid of Sigma Phi Delta and can you believe that the nerds were caught red handed playing D&D? Man, we really trashed their game and they were royally pissed about it but what could they do? They sat there pissing in their own togas.

Yeah, well that wasn’t the craziest shit that happened. I had too much beer. I remember Sophia leading me to a bed. She had this look on her face.  Crazy Sophia. But, drunk as I was, I thought, WTF. Right? Everyone’s doable with enough embalming fluid in ya, Right? Only, I must have passed out. I don’t remember much more than falling onto the bed and then blackout. 

I woke up with a pounding headache. I let out a long belch that echoed around the room. Something was different because my room was small and well padded with posters of rockers.  I open my eyes, trying to adjust to the blur while the light bored into my skull like two drills. 

Medieval looking room. Old wizard people. Knights in armor. The acid in my stomach roiled, burning as it rose up my throat. I swear at least two kegs worth of beer spewed out of my mouth onto the stone floor. That’s when I realized I was naked. 

“Good one,” I said. “Where are the geeks who put you up to this? I have a mind to kill those Sigma Phi Deltas, but they’ve really outdone themselves. Maybe just a mild slapping for the realism.”

“He’s perfect,” the Knight says.

“He’ll do,” said the wizard. 

“Let’s face it,” says the elder. “We’re desperate.”

“Ouch,” I say. But I play along. “Let me guess. You guys summoned me to be the hero to defeat some evil dark lord in this magical *fantasy* realm.” I air quote the last part to let them know I’m playing along. 

“Actually,” the elder says, “we already did that. We want you to become the interim leader of the Dark Lands he lorded over.”

“Fine,” I say. “But can someone get me a towel and some clothes?” I try not to let them know that they succeeded in embarrassing me by leaving me naked and covered in my own puke. 

“So,” says the wizard. “He agreed. Can we do it now?”

“He clearly wasn’t sincere,” said the knight. “Will it work if he doesn’t mean it?”

“He doesn’t even believe you,” Sophia says as she approaches with a towel. She tosses the towel at me. It bounces off my chest. “Somebody throw a bucket of water on him. He stinks.”

A bucket floats from the corner of the room as if on an invisible string and tips over my head. My mouth agape and my eyes wider, the bracing water pours from the bucket until the puke is puddled on the floor. Certainly the bucket wasn’t large enough to hold all of that water. 

“Don’t fret, young man,” the wizard says. “The summoning spell often has that affect on the summoned. Also, only organic matter is transported.”

“Sophia,” I say. “Thank god. Stop this prank at once.”

“It’s not a prank, Steve,” she says. “I was transported to your world to find the best candidate to fill the position. You checked all the boxes. Really, you are the biggest dick on campus.”

I cover my genitals. Sophia smirks. 

“Look outside if you don’t believe me.”

I wrap the filthy towel around my waist and walk over to a white stone ballustraded balcony. I stand in the chill morning air with the sun rising in the distance. Deep shadows cover the land but I’m clearly not in Florida. Smoke coils from numerous blast zones and most horrid of all deformed creatures roamed the land beaten and broken after some terrible conflict. Almost immediately after I stood on the balcony, one of the beaten looks up perhaps catching a glimpse of movement and shouts, pointing. 

“A new lord has risen! A new lord has risen!”

Slowly, the masses of bent and broken creatures turn towards the tower and look up at me, taking up the chant. Soon, hundreds of thousands of them are cheering me on. If I had more contents in my stomach, I would have heaved a second time. 

Yeah, well that wasn’t the craziest shit that happened either.",44
1lo0b4m,n0mjpcy,"“Okay, okay, medieval-looking room, creepy robes, armor guys standing awkwardly in corners. Lemme guess. You summoned me here to be the Chosen One, yeah? Defeat the Big Bad, bring peace to the kingdom, yada yada...”

“No, Mr. Geephunq,” says the lead beard, adjusting his glasses, which are somehow both half-moon and bifocal. “The Great Evil was defeated last quarter. Quite ahead of projections. We require you to assume interim governance of the Dark Lands.”

“Bro. Call me Warren.”

“Warren. Of course. Warren.”

Pause.

“I’m sorry, what now?” I asked, politely.

“The Dark Lands,” he repeats. “You’ve been selected by cross-dimensional civil tender to act as their transitional executive facilitator. Orientation begins shortly.”

And then one of them *hands me a binder*. Like, a big, plastic-ringed, color-coded binder. It's got dividers and everything. ""Volume I: Foundational Overview of the Dark Lands Organisational Infrastructure.""

I try to hand it back. “Nah, man. I think I’m good. I’ll just… portal home? Call an Uber from the summoning circle?”

The guy with the glasses blinks. “I’m afraid we’ve already allocated resources for your integration. The portal is suspended until your probationary review. It’s in the Terms of Dimensional Procurement. Page 9, subsection B.”

He opens the binder to show me. He has *bookmarks*.

“Why me?” I ask, genuinely baffled.

The lead robed guy (Gary? Gerald?) flips open another binder. “You demonstrated significant transformational impact during your tenure at… ‘Zenthrix Solutions’? You tripled quarterly pipeline velocity while maintaining a 120% net uplift in morale proxy metrics.”

“That was a Salesforce dashboard, man. It auto-filled half that sentence.”

“You were also named ‘Optimisation Champion’ three quarters running.”

“I wore a hat that said that. As a joke.”

“You scaled vertically-integrated synergies across a multi-stakeholder landscape.”

“I… reposted a Notion template.”

They all nod solemnly.

“Hey, now hold on,” I say, backing up. “You can’t just take a man’s resume like… for real for real. That stuff's for recruiters, not... *this.*”",19
1lo0b4m,n0ox3xr,"""WHAT IS THIS?"" 

""What do you mean, wizard?""

Taking in the halls of the now-museum, Kalthor the Immortal stared at me, a humbly dressed outsider to the lands of Darkness.  

""THIS!,"" he roared, his pale skin pink with volcanic fury.

""It's a museum for the people, to teach them history of these lands so they can learn from them,"" I began, pointing down the East Wing like a tour guide, ""Besides, each generation educated is one more generation that can prosper without repeating the brutish mentalities I encountered here.""

""But... We summoned you to be the interim leader of the lands, to provide the balance!""

A troll and orc wandered in, unarmed and lacking the typical armor of their warrior kin of previous eras.  I waved them down and began the tour.  Kalthor glowered while he followed.  

First stop, the Natural History Wing: Origins of ancient life and epochs of life.  Drow and Dwarven children played around fossils of ancient life forms as Kalthor watched in horror as I explained Evolutionary Theory.  Next stop, Early Civilizations, where ancient undead described to enthralled listeners what life was like.  The school trips were all over the other wings as well, covering art, music, geology, Arcana, the Realms, etc.    

Over the next few hours, I led the tour group through the museum, stopping for the kids to take selfies while sitting on the previous Emperor's throne, the demon bloods really enjoying the chance to pose with authentic imperial regalia now repurposed for photos. 



""What is this place?  Why the flowers and trees?""

""This is the National Botanical Gardens,"" I replied, ""This is what the lands looked like before the first Demon King.  Citizens want greenery, it was in the last referendum,"" I replied as I handed a pack of heirloom seeds to an orc child, ""It was really popular, especially with the Drow and Orcs.""

""What?  Referendum?""

""Yeah, as part of the advances on the basic Civil Code granting rights and representative government while outlawing slavery and other crimes.""

kalthor gawked.  

""Citizens?  Voting?""

""Oh and universal healthcare and education, paid for with open trade with the other kingdoms and empires and a tax on the wealthy members of society.  We brought up literacy to 100% and have a secondary education completion of 98% with pathways for higher education or apprenticeships and trades.  All with equal dignity and living wages.""

I watched the wizard try to comprehend what I did.  

""Oh and since you brought me from a technologically advanced society, I thought it would be great to bring some of that here.  We got the space shuttle working last harvest and plan to build out on the colonies across the great ocean.""

Kathor grimaced.  This was not what the Dark Lord was meant to do.  Destiny was...

""Dude, if you want a Dark Lord, YOU become the Dark Lord.  I got a nation to lead and a world to improve.""

I left the wizard there.  

The Land of Darkness now shone bright.",9
1lo0b4m,n0jk0s9,"The demon general sighs ""No, i suppose you'll want as much slaves as possible"" He lowers his head more.  
""If you promise to spare our women, children and seniors, i swear we will work the mines as hard as we can""

I'm starting to get the feeling thing aren't *quite* as i thought they where.

I sit down on the Demon Lord's throne and address the kneeling demon ""There is much i do not know about your world and you will tell me all about it. For one thing, it seems it was the humans that started the war? To make you all slaves? Well, that just doesn't sit right with me.""

Still kneeling, the demon general named O'ester tells me how the humans demanded the Orichalcum mines that only exist in the Dark Lands. When the previous Demon Lord refused, the humans invaded them. Using religion, they claimed to want to cleanse the world of ""evil"", as they slaughtered their way across the Dark Lands. Mostly slaughtering civilians. Women and children. The humans where well prepared for war, but the demons weren't.

They where pushed back again and again. And in the end, a Summoned Hero killed the Demon Lord and the demons surrendered. After the Hero left, the humans immediately executed the entire royal family.

As i listen to the harrowing story of atrocities, my expression hardens.

When he finishes his story, it is silent in the room. I think about my options.  
""So you are saying the humans invaded your country and defeated you, because you lacked the weaponry and skill to resist them? That they said you are all evil and they where *justified* in slaughtering women and children?"" The demon general hears the anger in my voice and his body tenses up, expecting to be punished for speaking his mind.

""I can tell you are speaking the truth, O'ester. I do not like what has been done to your people. Not one bit.From this day on, you will not refer to me as *human*, if you must call me something, call me ""offworlder"". And i will teach you the technology of my world. I will teach you about mounted infantry, about explosives that do not require magic, about weapons that can kill a target at long range, longer range than the best bows. I will teach you advanced combat tactics that don't rely on everyone standing in a field to face one another. Tactics that allow a smaller army to prevail over larger armies.""

I look around the room, at the gathered demon army officers ""We will expel the *human* invaders from *our* lands and make them pay for their crimes!""

The kneeling demon raises his head, a glimmer of hope in his eyes ""What should we call you?""

""You can call me....."" i think for a moment ""You can call me *Genghis Khan* and i shall be know to the world as the *Demon Lord* Genghis Khan!""

The demon general and his officers cheer and chant my name.

Why did i choose that name you ask?  
So that when the human spread their *lies* to the Summoned Hero, she will know i am *also* a summoned human from earth..........

1lo0b4m,n0mk7wc,"I gave in at some point. 

So, yeah. I’m apparently the new acting manager of the Dark Lands.

Only it’s not fiery doom and screaming. It’s more like a midwest DMV if the DMV also had sword-wielding skeletons and a “Mandated Sorrow Budget.” They keep handing me forms. Personality inventories. Strategic development surveys. There’s a tea break. One of the death knights asks if I’m union.

By day three, I stop trying to protest and start flipping through the binders in my morning management feedback meeting.

That’s when I find the section labeled *""Fauna & Hazards (Endangered and Otherwise).”*

“Okay,” I say, reading aloud. “The Flesh-Eating Mist of Maldrac Hollow may not be disrupted, scattered, or dispersed by magical or meteorological means. It is a Protected Anomaly under the Dark Lands Preservation Accord?”

The robed lady nods. “Category Two. It has a nesting range.”

“This mushroom,” I continue, “which exudes a paralytic fear gas and whispers your darkest regrets; this cannot be moved?”

“It is a heritage fungus.”

“And these skeletal beasts, the ones that *eat children*?”

“They were here first.”

Binder two is worse.

It’s just pages and pages of black-and-white diagrams of factories and workhouses, with scribbled annotations like “INFERNAL OUTPUT, PHASE THREE.” I ask what they’re making. No one knows. I ask why they’re still running all these factories, if the output is so unknowable.

The head robe guy smiles. He actually *smiles*.

“The line must go up,” he says. And points to a chart.

Productivity, Output, Compliance. All rising. All meaningless. Just line after line going up. ""Line must go up,"" he repeats.

“Okay, but like… what if it can’t?” I start. “The world is finite. What if you hit a ceiling, or run out of bodies, or carbon, or—”

Another robe cuts me off. “It’s acceptable if the line goes up… slowly.”",14
1lo0b4m,n0mkbkp,"Everyone in the room goes very still.

“Wait,” I say. “So I could just… *regulate* things?”

They nod. In unison. I feel like I’m on a ketamine trip inside a union grievance hearing.

“So I could pass a law banning…” I flip pages. “…‘the discharge of cursed effluent into Lake Dark?’”

“Granted,” they say.

“I could legislate… a five-hour workday? Mandatory weekends?”

“Granted.”

“You guys want me to make this place *look* a little better. But not too fast. Just… keep it moving. Keep the line going up. Even if it means solving problems inefficiently. Or half-solving them. Or just drawing little triangles on a whiteboard for three weeks and calling it ‘stakeholder calibration.’”

“That,” says one of them, “is governance.”

So now I’m standing on this cliff at sunset, wearing a cape I didn’t ask for, looking out over the haunted wasteland of the Dark Lands. Below me are necrotic farmlands, howling trees, and a factory that seems to be building more binders. I don’t know.

I sigh. Adjust my nameplate. It says Warren G, **Acting Regional Administrator, Dark Lands Transition Period (Phase TBD).**

Time to mount up.

Time to regulate.",21
1loc3xt,n0ls4zj,"I smile.  
""Not easy being a Mind Reader, when the unawakened passively project their thoughts outwards, without any filtering.  
Not your fault you read them, hear them, but it's not their fault they can't shield them."" I say.  
She sighs.  
""I am aware, but their thoughts...aren't always kind, and they are hard to ignore. Then when they realize I can read their minds? I hear over and over gain the word: ""monster""."" she mutters.  
I nod, and pat her shoulder.

  
""I know it is hard, but whom better to search the masses for a potential awakener, than a Mind Reader?"" I smile at her.  
She rolls her eyes.  
""If the pay wouldn't be this good..."" she starts.  
""And if the world would be at peace, and there would be no need for awakeners."" I continue for her.  
She pouts, but nods.  
Young ones are still discontent with the facts.  
We need all the talents we can get...  
And for that, we need to comb the population.

  
""I know the theory, but what is the difference between an unawakened that can't awaken, and someone with the potential?"" I ask.  
She smirks.  
""Oh? So there is something, Mr. ""I am 100 years old and am more experienced than anyone"" doesn't know?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
She pouts, seeing, I don't argue.  
""Wilder thoughts. Harder to read, or too easy to read, and most importantly a bit of interference. As in, I can read their thoughts, but there is some static every now and then, which is their own power trying to passively protect them."" she says.

We run into the subway, just barely escaping from an angry mob.  
""Seriously! See? Crazy people!"" she says.

""They are afraid of us. It is true that the Things are attracted to awakeners more than to simple humans...

""What is wrong?"" she asks.  
""What is the usual ratio of potential awakeners in the populace?"" I ask.  
""1 in 1000 roughly..."" she drags, her eyes widening.  
""And what is the main way to hasten, and bring out this potential even in those who didn't have it?"" I ask.  
""Be in the presence of an ""Entity""."" she says grimly, as we stop the subway, and run out, back towards the school.  
Things are about to get interesting, as an ""Entity"" can be good or bad, unlike Things, so best we can do is hope this one is benevolent...",16

Don't have time for another short story continuation, but shortly:

Things = enemy invaders that are hell-bent to destroy the civilization the MCs are part of

Entities = beings that surpassed the mortal status (not necessarily God-like already, but above mere mortals) , and here you can imagine anything from spirits, monsters, demons, to gods, living objects, beliefs/stories taken form, and so on.

And since they surpassed mortals, they naturally emit a radiance/energy, and this energy is able to evoke the potential of unawakened individuals, or induce a mutation that would give this potential to those that don't have it.",7

I look around my bathroom, and take out the device I ordered years ago, when I had an episode.  
It doesn't beep.  
Okay, this means there is no camera here.  
I am naked, so there is no way it would have been on my clothes...  
So then why?  
Why can't I teleport?

  
I had a power awakened when I was young.  
I could teleport anywhere in the world by thinking about that place, but with a condition: no one can be looking at me when I do that.  
I used to do it from my room, my apartment, or some public rest room, but!  
For the last few hours, I can't teleport, no matter where I hide.  
I even tried in the closet, covered in coats, and clothes...  
Nothing works.  
What is going on?

  
Okay, John, calm down.  
If you awakened some power, who is to say someone else didn't awaken something else?  
Like Clairvoyance? Or Far-sight? Or magic?  
Maybe supernatural stuff is real, and someone, or something is watching me.  
Okay...that made it worse.  
I take my meds, hoping they will calm me down.  
I was once followed by some gentlemen in Germany, and since then I had some episodes of severe...paranoia.  
Powers not really being public, I am quite worried I will be shipped off and dissected.  
As I shiver due to that thought, I can feel it.  
I can teleport.

  
I focus on something I rarely do: something vague, ethereal.  
I focus on teleporting nearby on a street if there is, to the place from where I was watched from.  
I know it is dangerous, and stupid, but I have to...I will make it quick.  
It works.  
I appear on the street, on the other side of the world, in the middle of the night.  
It is a nice looking neighborhood?  
I look around, and see her: a young woman in her window, smoking.  
""You! The handsome naked dude from my dream!"" she screams, pointing at me.  
I freeze, and blush, as I watch her go inside, saying she's coming.  
I panic, and teleport away...

“To get to work? I do that every day.”

“And the day before that, you pulled your phone charger out of the socket without turning it off at the wall first!”

“I did? Come on, that’s not going to hurt.”

However, my garden cat, Veles, simply stared at me from his precarious position on an out-poking strut halfway up an electricity pylon.  As usual he eyed me with the sort of lidded contempt that suggested that he not only failed to recognize me from the last two years of daily feedings, but didn’t care to know me either.

1lo64o5,n0kfyo3,"99 floors have I went through, to get to the secret vault of the dungeon.  
Each floor more dangerous than the previous, with few rooms where safety was assured.

With my life on the line, I fought, and passed the trials...until I arrived at the secret floor.  
Here, I was greeted by the legendary dragon's sight, who is supposed to guard the treasure...

The deviousness and tricks, and wars I faced...

""What do I have to do to get it?"" I ask.  
""Drink a cup of tea with me."" she smiles.  
I nod, and approach her.

  
Sitting down, I feel her pressure even more, but I still keep my calm.  
She pours me the tea, and looks at me.  
I took a sip, and my Poison resistance doesn't react...should be a good sign.  
""How is the taste?"" she asks, but before I could answer, I freeze.  
I see the universe be born, stars, and planets born out of energies, and matter colliding.  
I saw the first beings be born, mastering elements, and controlling laws, and I saw more.  
Empires rise and fall, Heroes, dungeons...everything, and anything.

I sip my tea, and smile.  
""Hard to imagine why, right?"" I chuckle.  
She nods.  
""I just saw you destroy a nuke-like blast from a villain threatening the hospital, Doctor Smith...  
I mean, why would you not become a hero?"" she asks.  
I laugh.  
""Nurse Jackie, am I not saving lives?"" I ask, gesturing around us.  
She blushes.

  
""Y-Yes, but as a hero, you could..."" she starts, but stops.  
""Anything can be destroyed?"" she asks again.  
I nod.  
She face-palms.  
""Like bacteria, bad cells?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""That explains your success rate on curing so many things.  
And why even your more seriously ill patients, rarely require the usual medicine, or treatment plans."" she says.  
I smile.

  
""Exactly.  
I learnt to control this power to the smallest level of details, not only that, but I can use it to sense where the diseased cells are more exactly."" I say.  
""How? If it is a destruction related power?"" she asks.  
""I lower the intensity of the power until it couldn't erase dust, and send it out.  
Healthy cells? Easily repel it. Bad cells? Struggle, or even absorb it."" I say.  
She gasps.  
""Oh my! That's ingenious!"" she says.  
""Thank you."" i say.  
She sighs in relief.

  
""Well, that was scary, and thank you for saving us...  
I guess you don't want people to know, right?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
She was the only one who saw what really happened.  
She smirks.  
""Fine, Almighty Doctor, but you will owe me a dinner, or 10 for this."" she says, standing up, and leaving.  
I watch her leave, and chuckle.  
If only she knew I could destroy concepts as well, like emotions, or even...memories...  
Well, maybe it is time for someone to know me...for who I really am.",136
1lnxi7j,n0jatzx,"I spotted Shatter as he walked into the elevator, precisely on time. Like he always was.

""Hey, can you hold the elevator?""

""I got you.""

He acknowledged me with a nod. I could see why he was in charge. Between the combat skills that had earned him his code name, his meticulous rule-following, and the people skills, it was a no-brainer. You couldn't dream up a better leader than him.

""So what's the big mission?""

""Can't say.""

""Can't say? Or won't say?""

He smiled at me, with a look that was simultaneously mischievous and chiding. It was like he was my team leader and my co-conspirator all at once.

""Okay, okay, I'll wait.""

""Good call,"" he replied with a chuckle. ""This one's important, we do it by the book.""

-- -- -- -- --

""Shatter, Geek,"" the general acknowledged us as we entered the secure area.

""General Stahl. How are you?"" Shatter returned the greeting.

""I'll be much better when this is all over.""

""That big a deal, huh?"" I asked.

He nodded, but it looked more like nervous energy than an affirmation. He really was afraid of what was going to happen next.

""Wow, you're spooked. Who are we going after?"" I couldn't help but poke, ""Heh, don't tell me it's the Doctor?""

I expected chuckles from the others; the question was preposterous. No one attacked the Doctor. Heroes, villains, governments, and everything in between gave him a wide berth. It wasn't worth the risk, and the consequences were often disastrous.

Instead, they winced. The silence answered my question for me, but I suddenly lost all sense of banter.

""We're going after the Doctor?! Are you all crazy? Why risk that kind of pain?""

""We think we can neutralize half his powers,"" General Stahl admitted.

""You know that leaves the other half, right? The regeneration that makes him near invincible?""

""Not that half,"" Shatter chimed in.

""What? You can't be serious! You want to LEAVE the powers that can destroy anything? And you want us to ATTACK that lunatic with those powers fully intact?""

""Sit down, Geek,"" Shatter suggested.

""I'll stand, thanks.""

""Suit yourself, but there is a method to the madness,"" General Stahl tried to convince me.

""There darn well better be,"" I spat back as I watched the General pull up the relevant intel.

-- -- -- -- --

""You all know why we call him the Doctor,"" the General began.

""Can destroy anything, but chooses to heal his victims along the way. Maximizes and prolongs their suffering.""

""In a nutshell, yes. But have you ever considered how he pulls that off?""

""Does it matter?""

""It does, quite a bit,"" Shatter chimed in. ""Those two power sets are completely opposed to each other.""

""So? He won the genetic lottery and ended up with two powers.""

""Mutations don't really work like that,"" General Stahl pointed out. ""Mutations tend to enable one power, not two. And they certainly don't enable the opposites simultaneously. That'd take intentional manipulation, and no one understands the genetics well enough to pull that off.""

""So, it wasn't luck,"" I commented as I followed along. I could feel the beginnings of a thought forming, a thread of understanding that was beginning to be visible.

""The second hint was that the Doctor routinely destroys all technology within eyesight,"" Shatter added now that I wasn't actively trying to question everything.

""How does that tell us anything? He's just destroying things.""

""Yes, but the order matters,"" General Stahl pointed out. ""We analyzed his fights, and we don't have ANY data. Not even a few minutes, across all the times someone has dared challenge him. So he's always taken out the technology FIRST.""

""So he doesn't want the technology in the mix. Why?"" I asked, getting excited. If this was going where I thought it was, this might be my time to shine.

""It can beat him,"" Shatter explained simply.

""Beat him?!"" I exclaimed. I hadn't dared hope for that much.

""The Doctor has a destructive power, but it's the circuit between the healing and destruction that makes him lethal. He can inflict an infinite amount of pain if he keeps healing you. Only he never heals you completely, so it's a slow grind towards death. Or worse,"" General Stahl pointed out.

""So ... you're saying you think the healing can be disabled?"" I asked. ""With technology of some sort?""

""Bingo,"" Shatter confirmed.

""How?"" my curiosity immediately chimed in.

""Extend the range of your drones, and hide them. We've figured out how to make things invisible,"" the General pointed out.

""Invisible?!""

""If you had an extended amount of time, could you disable his tech?"" Shatter asked, with all the gravity he could muster.

""Yes. If it's tech-based, I can take it down. You buy me that time, I'll neutralize it,"" I asserted confidently. This was my domain, and I just needed a couple of extra minutes to work.

""Can you, um, pwn it?"" General Stahl asked cautiously.

""Hahaha, you've been reading up,"" I complimented him. ""Yes, I can gain control over his tech. You give me that time, and I'll make it heal whomever you want, however quickly you-""

I stopped mid-sentence, realizing the full extent of the plan.

""You know what you're signing up for, right, Shatter?""

""I do,"" the man nodded.

""It'll be pure agony, the whole time.""

""You patch me up, and I'll deal with the pain. So long as my body responds when I need it to, I'll take him down.""

I whistled. This was a hell of a plan.

""You're sure, Shatter? There's got to be another way.""

""It's the only semi-viable strategy we've ever come up with, Geek. It's this or nothing.""

I swallowed hard, and resolved not to let this man down.

""I got you.""

1lo8s18,n0lejbw,"Mark sat across from his roommate, Tony, in their small apartment kitchen. Tony was scrolling through his phone, deliberately avoiding eye contact.

“So,” Mark said, clearing his throat, “I’m guessing today isn’t the day you’re paying back the $1,000 either?”

Tony looked up with dramatic solemnity, placing his hand over his heart. “Money is merely the wealth of those who do not value freedom.”

“Seriously? Quit it with the Facebook quotes,” Mark groaned, throwing his hands up. “It’s one thousand dollars, bro! Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to lend you that much?”

“Power,” Tony said, raising a finger philosophically, “is the ability to say no without fearing what others will say or do to you.”

Mark’s eye twitched. “And courage is saying no despite those fears. And wisdom is saying no after eliminating all reason for fear. I know. You’ve been using these quotes since you borrowed the money six months ago!”

“You’ve been listening!” Tony beamed proudly.

“Yeah, and I’m also changing the WiFi password until I get my money back,” Mark said, standing up. “Wisdom is knowing when to cut off your roommate’s internet access.”

Tony’s smile disappeared. “Wait, what? You can’t do that! I have… important things to do online!”

“Like finding more quotes to avoid paying your debts?” Mark asked, eyebrow raised.

The next morning, Mark found an envelope with $1,000 cash slid under his door with a note: “Freedom is overrated. WiFi password, please?”",5
1lo2mw9,n0kdhio,"General Han was feared on the battlefield. An overwhelming force which acknowledged none but the path which he foresaw before him. A clear, pristine path; like the road between a valley, laid out beautifully with flowing waterfalls, verdant fields of flowers, and an achievable horizon crowned with pure, unadulterated glory.

Once General Han began treading the dirt, war would ensue, and naught but his army would remain. In some wars, he would win through attrition. Weaker armies would fall through sheer bloodshed. General Han did not shy away from espionage either—he fell a thousand-year dynasty by breaking it from within.

To his nation, General Han was a God of War.

To us, he was a God of Death.

And it was our turn, my nation’s turn, to receive the divine deliverance of his hand.

Though he was clad in armor from head to toe, we knew that it was General Han who was charging at us. His overwhelming presence was unmistakable: like the deities described in legend, General Han seemed to shake with a relentless vigor, as if he was possessed with the rage of ten thousand suns. What was peculiar, perhaps even terrifying knowing the nature of our enemy, was that General Han did not have a retinue of archers behind him, nor a wall of cavalry clearing his path for him.

General Han was alone.

I could not help but feel my sword tremble in my hand. Why was he alone? General Han neared divinity in his accomplishments, but he himself was mortal.

Perhaps there was an ambush awaiting us? Perhaps it was not General Han after all which was charging before us?

Or…perhaps…the gods above had finally gazed upon him? 

“Men,” I said, breaking the deafening silence my army had allowed themselves to succumb to. They all were waiting for my command with bated breath, and it was clear that they believed this to be their last day. These were battle-hardened men but even their legs began to quiver more and more as General Han closed the distance. His presence commanded nothing but respect and attention.

“Withdraw. We shall retreat!” I said, releasing some of the tension that had built up inside me.

“W-what?! Why, General?!” said my second-in-command, who was frightful but ready to shed blood.

“That man right there…he is not a man anymore. We are in an open desert with nowhere for an ambush to happen. Our homeland is too far to be invaded within merely days. There can only be one reason for a ‘man’ to charge in with such rage alone: he is no longer a man.”

General Han then screamed loudly and with such primal strength that it caused those bearing the spearwall to flinch.

“He has become a God of War.”

Everyone then soon began retreating until General Han was no longer in sight. I was last to leave to ensure that no one was left behind which put me the closest to Death’s Door, but perhaps I should be thankful. In hindsight, it saved me a lot of embarrassment.

Right when I was about to leave, General Han had finally managed to catch up to me. I feared for my life…until General Han fell from what I had thought was a crazed horse and then started vomiting on the ground. He strangely reeked of alcohol, and well, my suspicions were confirmed to be true when he let go of an alcohol jug. 

The man had not become a God of War. He was just drunk, and it was just his horse desperately trying to shake him off all this time.",13
1lnsby9,n0hrj6p,"The elevator chimed again as our group exited on the level 13-b. Our guide, an elderly Ifrit in a neatly ironed tuxedo, led us along a glass-panneled enclosure.

""Now this here,"" he continued with an unmistakable tone of a presenter who's done this same spiel for millenia but never got tired of it, ""is quite a special enclosure. Under no circumstances this poor sods are to know they're in Hell and not in Heaven.""

We looked through one-way glass and saw endless green pastures, gentle white clouds in the tender blue sky overhead, gardens of fruit trees, and other such idyllic nonsense. I turned my only eye to our guide with a questioning glare.

""I wonder, what might be the purpose for this oddly specific arrangement.""

""Why yes, my inquisitive interns, there indeed is a purpose, for the wisdom of our Most Malevolent Overlord is unmatched!"", the senior demon boasted. ""The souls here are generally of average sinfulness - for the condemned that is, - each in their own unique moderately shitty ways. But what unites them all is not a complete absolence of conscience and self-awareness. They, each of them, know they don't deserve Heaven.""

""I don't understand,"" a young Succubus behind me asked incredulously. ""How is getting better than you think you deserve a punishment? Shouldn't they be happy?""

""Observe."" The Ifrit replied, waving his hand toward the window with a dramatic flourish.

A view dutifully zoomed in, through the pastures and the walls of a perfectly suburban domicile. A man was standing behind a kitchen counter, humming to himself, absorbed in cooking. Then, a doorbell chimed. The sound was disgustingly perfect, unintrusively soothing, but still the man jumped as if stung by an electric eel. (I smiled to myself at the image in my mind: torture with electric eels was the topic of my thesis). A bead of sweat rolled down his neck as he came to open the door. After a few minutes of conversation with his neighbor, full of awkwardness so thick we could feel the tightness of his false smiles through the glass, he finally closed the door and let out a sigh of relief. He then dropped on the couch and buried his face in his hands, nearly hyperventilating. 

The young Succubus's expression turned from incredulity to stunned awe. ""How is he so unhappy, if he thinks he's in Heaven?"", she whispered.

The Ifrit guide grinned triumphantly. ""Conscience! Such a wonderful tool. Allows the mortals to know every time they do something wrong, and yet you can bet that most of the time they'll still do it! But once it's done, that conscience doesn't just leave or shut up. It nags at them, reminding them of their own wickedness, worthlessness, of the consequences that will inevitably rain down once they're found out! Constant doubt, constant fear, constant misery, my friends, without us lifting nary a finger!""

I hummer deeply. As a pathological ""teacher's pet"", I already suspected which question the Ifrit wanted to hear next, and decided to take a shot.

""But Honored Senior, have none of them tried to confess, to sooth their conscience - or at least feed their vanity - by coming clean to the authorities?""

The elderly demon's face lit up with absolute glee. ""A wonderful question, young sir Cyclops! Of course some did, but such a small amount, that you wouldn't even believe. We even offered amnesties to those who 'thought they were in heaven by mistake' if they confessed, and you know how many do? Only one in twenty thousand! Truly, the human mind is its own best jailer and torturer.""

""And what about those unique ones, who did confess after all? Did you really give them amnesties?""

The Ifrit's grin stretched wider than the geometry of his face was supposed to allow. ""Of course not,"" he snorted, ""we're in Hell, after all.""",226
1lnsby9,n0ijafd,"Streaks of orange and pink and a flirt of green gently shot upward, clearing the way for the dominating yellow glow making its leisurely ascend.

The man observed as the waves from the not so distant beach too transformed from the deep dark of unknown to the clear blue of the sky above.

Whether the waves turned the sky, or the sky the waves did not matter. What mattered was that it happened and he got to see it.

Well, almost got to see it.

'If it weren't for that god awful monstrosity.'  He was referring to the great grey formless block of concrete that was exactly 3 stories taller than his pent house and stood smack dab in the middle of the sun's path. It was just wide enough to block of half of the beach view.

'God it must've been a couple thousand years since I actually got to see a sunrise' He thought as he sipped his freshly brewed coffee that he swore, as he always did, was decafe and tried, and failed miserably, as he always did, to get comfortable on the bean bag.

Heaven apparently did not do chairs.

With each sip he became just a bit more drowsy, despite the fact that he had woken up not 30 mins ago, and thought about the day ahead.

Nothing.

There was nothing to do. He had all the free time in the world. He could do everything, anything. And yet he knew that he would do nothing as he grabbed his phone and instinctively opened up HUMBLE.

He scrolled past at least a couple dozen conversations. Each one with a baddie baddier than the last. None of whom he would ever meet, because there was always the next match. Just a little bit hotter, just a little more his type.

After a few minutes he put the phone down, closed his eyes, and tried one last time to find the perfect spot on his god forsaken bean bag. He knew he wouldn't.

The breeze brought him the full hearty laughter of the couple that lived in the penthouse across - 3 stories higher than him.

His phone vibrated. Another match.

""I swear if it werent for that big 'Smile You Are In Heaven' sign projected across the sky, this would be hell' He though to himself not for the first time.

1lnsby9,n0ikhb8,"After explaining this for the third time, the archdemon draws back the curtain. There, in the pit some thirty feet deep, three middle-aged men sit hunched around a folding card table. A sea of scarab beetles swells around their ankles. Flames shoot from turrets while wall-mounted boomboxes blare ""Cbat,"" by Hudson Mohawke.

The archdemon--his nametag says ""Koriath""--leans wistfully on his pitchfork. ""Maybe for them this *is* heaven,"" he says. 

This isn't the first time he's said something like this. You scoff. ""I'm sorry... what?""

Koriath shrugs. ""Look, I know this is your first day, but one of the things you learn, if you work here long enough, is that everyone's idea of pain and pleasure is different. We got orders from the brass to give these three guys Heaven--and far be it from me to judge what that means to them."" He shrugs once more. Big shrugger, this guy. ""I'm just a mid-level pit-designer.""

Just then, the pit's wall-mounted diarrhea bell chimes, suggesting that it's time for another diarrhea flood.

""Koriath, I don't think humans like this stuff.""

The archdemon jabs you on the arm. ""Nonsense!"" he cries--but then his red, scaly brow furrows. ""But, uh... what makes you say that? Just curious.""

The flooders creak into position. 

""Humans don't like pain,"" you reply, ""and they generally don't like being covered completely by filth.""

Koriath shakes his head. He spent the whole walk over talking about how his promotion was riding on this one specific pit, his ability to simulate Heaven.

""I'm only trying to help,"" you add gently. Before taking this internship, you lived with humans, observed their rituals and idiosyncrasies. ""And I'm telling you, humans really, really don't like--""

""They do,"" he says. ""They told me.""

""They don't.""

""They do.""

""They don't.""

He nods toward the pit. ""*They* do.""

""They don't.""

""They might.""

""They don't.""

At this, he throws his demon hands in the air. ""Well, how can they know they don't like it if they've never tried it?""

""Koriath, the diarrhea flood went off five times already, and they were visibly uncomfortable every time. Believe me, they've *tried* it.""

Koriath sits on the bench. Worry clouds his gaze. He spent the whole walk over talking about corner offices and pay bumps, bonuses. ""Well, shit,"" he says. 

As if on cue, there go the flooders.

1lnsby9,n0jcx1a,"A low vibrato of jazz thrummed throughout the small, often forgotten bar on Main Street; once the attraction of a small mining town and now entangled between two towering corporate buildings in now a slightly bigger city. It was dimly lit with warm fairy lights that flickered on and off in much the same way as the few voices that filled the room, and the musk of whiskey stained the air. Above the bar itself, a clock quietly ticked as it displayed the time: 11:45.

I dragged a finger over the rim of my empty shot glass, what had been its contents now sloshing away at my intestines. It was one of the better glasses- though there was little distinction even in that regard- handed out only to those the bar ensured wouldn’t shatter it to pieces. 

Yay me, I thought mindlessly as I waved the bartender over. I can go home and tell my parents I won least likely to break a shot glass.

Except, I remembered with a sudden pain, I couldn’t see them. Not until I’d proved whatever it is I was supposed to prove. 

“Another one where this came from.”

As the bartender nodded and poured me another shot of vodka, the bell atop the entrance rang quietly. As always, for there was little entertainment elsewhere, my eyes floated towards the door. 

A young woman, no older than twenty-five or so, stumbled in as though she were already drunk. With a second glance, I noticed with faint surprise that she was a new face- and not a bad looking one at that. 

“Who’s that?” I asked the bartender, reaching for the shot he’d just poured. 

He shrugged and went off to make someone else a drink. 

When I turned back to the girl, she was already pulling out the chair beside me. 

“This seat free?”

I nodded stupidly; void of something witty to say. After a few agonizing minutes of silence, I came up with a simple, “Are you new around here?”

She turned to me with a lazy smile. “You could say that.”

I nodded. “How’d it happen?” 

“How’d what happen?”

“You know…” I waved a hand sheepishly. “How you ended up here.”

Her eyes flared in understanding. “Who knows? It’s been so long I’ve forgotten.” 

“How long?”

She thought for a moment. “I’ve forgotten that too.” 

“It’s been about two hundred years for me,” I said sardonically. “Two hundred years in this hellhole.”

The girl gave me a funny look and I glanced around the room, quickly adding, “Sorry. Pretend you didn’t hear that.” 

She smiled. “What’s your name?”

I sighed in relief. “Garrett. You?”

“I was never given one, but I like to call myself Ruby.”

“Ruby, huh?” I held out a hand. “Nice to meet you- just what kind of place did you grow up in where you didn’t have a name?”

She placed her palm in mine and leaned in, murmuring, “A hellhole.”

I threw my head back and laughed. 

“Well, Garrett, since you said such a sacrilegious statement in my presence, I figured I’d make us equal.” Her eyes glimmered. “Would you like to hear a story- one that hasn’t been uttered here for thousands of years?” 

“Oh?” My interest was piqued. 

“There was once a God who created three planes of existence- heaven, hell, and the human world. He filled heaven with angels and accepted the most pious humans beyond its gates, then filled hell with demons and sent the most wretched humans into its depths.”

I nodded along as she recounted the familiar story I’d heard a hundred times up here. 

“However,” she continued, thrumming her fingers against the table. “God still loved his creation, and he figured if the humans were able to change their ways in hell, they would then be allowed to come to heaven.” 

I frowned. “I wasn’t aware of this.”

“Well, there’d be no point if they knew they were still being tested, would there?”

“I guess.” 

“And so, God supposed if the humans in hell were to learn where they really were, even if they knew there was still a way out, they would lose all hope and descend into pits of despair deeper than hell itself. But if you ask me, he was wrong.”

“Why’s that?”

“I figured if the humans in hell learned where they really were, it wouldn’t make a single difference.” She seemed to watch me carefully. “They would go on to repeat the same mistakes over and over, even when the answer is right in front of them, just because the alternative requires admitting an uncomfortable truth.”

I peered down at the shot of vodka still cold in my hand. “But wouldn’t the humans be able to tell they were in hell?”

“Why, both heaven and hell are modeled quite a bit after your precious Earth.”

I looked back at Ruby. “What about heaven, then? Isn’t there a sort of test here, too, before we can go on to the real deal?”

She smiled, but there was a sadness to her eyes. “Once you’re in heaven, there’s no need to be tested anymore.” 

A few moments passed. “Why are you telling me this?” 

“Who knows? Maybe I, too, just can’t help myself.” 

“I see…,” I said, thinking. “Hey, are you going to be back tomorrow by any chance?” 

Ruby shook her head. 

“That’s a shame.”

“Yes.” A glance at the clock: almost midnight. “I’m afraid I must go. I have some work to do.” 

I nodded and watched her leave the bar- she, who I was somehow certain I’d never meet again, just as I was certain she had come here, to this bar, for a reason.

For me.

In that moment I knew more than anything else- there was something I had to do. 

But now she was gone, and I’d never see her again, this woman who had breathed life into my otherwise empty existence, this woman who had left me with a lucidity now fleeting by the second; and I began to form an unrelenting hatred for her as that sea of emptiness resettled around me, dragging me beneath the weight of its tides. 

There was something I wanted…something I wanted to do.

I sat in silence for a few minutes as I waited for the memory to return.

Oh well, there’s always tomorrow. 

So I turned back to the bartender, downed the shot I was still holding, and said, “Another, please.”",16
1lnsby9,n0jjj1m,"""Welcome to Hell! Let me give you the tour.""


Dana sighed. Their life hadn't been stellar, but surely the afterlife wasn't so clichéd? There was the fire, there was the brimstone, and the devil acting as greeter had classic red horns and a pointed tail. Worse, they'd been thrown down to the fiery depths by St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, glimpsing all the trappings of heaven before being chucked with absolute scorn.


At least they weren't stuck sitting on a cloud and playing a harp all day for ten thousand years.


Following the devil into the depths of Hell, Dana observed pretty run-of-the-mill torture scenarios applied to rapists, murderers, and a few recognizable politicians. ""Interesting choice to start with such serious sinners - I thought Dante described the circles of hell getting worse the farther we descended.""


""Oh no, all that got rearranged a few centuries back. We've taken the matters of punishment into our own hands in an increasing number of cases. We keep some good examples of punishment according to the book right by the entrance. The inspectors rarely take more than a cursory glance once they've seen enough suffering souls.""


Dana and the devil walked in silence a bit farther, approaching a tunnel leading down to the next level. ""As you can see, we've gotten enough engineers to design air filtering and temperature control equipment. We do our best to keep up with modern technology, within reason. One of our recent arrivals wanted to design a geothermal cooling system, which anyone could have told them would never work down here. We don't adhere to the same punishment philosophy as up above, but we do let consequences run their course. That one is on the path to becoming a better listener now.


""Hmm, where were we.... oh yes, here we have our lawyers. You'd be surprised how many we get down here! They are quite helpful at enforcement of our rules, though we only put them in charge periodically. Too much power, and things end up worse and worse. You know, that happens with most of the groups we have down here.""


Dana had been a lawyer. ""I don't think anyone's too surprised at the idea of lawyers going to hell. Unless I'd be surprised at how few there are?""


The devil's face fell a bit. ""I keep forgetting. Humans aren't surprised at how many lawyers go to hell."" 


""Do I stay here, given my life on earth?""


""Let's see your file. Yes, lawyer, you will be staying here."" The devil flipped through a few pages in the folder that was apparently Dana's file. ""Just a few more stops before I pass you along to your brethren to get settled. Now, if you are worried about punishment, be reassured. We aim for restorative justice and rehabilitation down here, though don't let a peep of that make it to an angel's hearing.""


The devil guided Dana down another level, which had an even more pleasant atmosphere. ""This is our optimal level, but it is reserved for a very special group. They must never learn that this is not heaven.""


Dana peeked through the window at an idyllic scene. Catching their breath, they waited until they spotted the gait of a child they recognized. ""Is that... is that him?""


The devil met Dana's eyes with a solemn look. ""Yes, these are our true innocents. You arrived at the same time as one here.""


""My son. I think we were in a car crash. I remember driving from... from somewhere.""


""My condolences,"" the devil murmured. ""Since you have a personal connection, I hope you will be an active participant in the caretaking duties here. We find it helps each child to see a familiar face shortly after arrival, but understand the need to grieve your child's fate. We strive to find the best balance.""

1lnsby9,n0jq5ee,"There are certain souls wich the devil takes pity on, for he knows that they do not truly belong in hell. The souls of those who still had kindness in their heart, those who tried to help others even after being exposed to the most vile treatment from others. Sure, they had a warped sence of what was moral, but that was due to the monstrous things that had been enacted on them.
Someone who's entire life had been suffering do not deserve an eternity of more torture, so in an attempt to shield those souls but not further antagonise the heavens, he created a new ring in hell, one that allowed these souls to live in, what to them is bliss, but due to the way they were treated on earth, by the standards of most, would still be torture. 
Letting them know of this fact would break them, not because of the fact they were in hell, they most likely wouldn't care, but the knowledge that life in hell was an upgrade from what they had endured on earth, that would be enough to make anyone lose any semblance of sanity, and these souls do not deserve that.

The devil would constantly try to figure out new ways to improve the conditions in that ring of hell, ways that would be justifiable and put in a way to make it sound as though it was a new way to torture them in order to get around the scrutiny of heaven who had already decided that these souls deserved to be in eternal agony.",15

You...you have higher chances of survival, and recovery than your friend.  
I am sorry."" he says.  
I want to cry, but can't...  
Everything feels off.

  
Days pass, and the doctors are in awe at my recovery rate, while my parents constantly nag, and cry at my side.  
Yet...  
I can't really react.  
How could I?

I...I never was into love, and stuff like that, so I was happy with his dreams.  
I could have had kids, without having kids...but now...  
Now all is gone.

  
2 months later, I am taken home.  
Well, home at my parents' house, not the apartment we rented...  
In my old room, I saw the posters of 3 Days Grace, 3 Door Down, Metallica...and more.  
We used to blast it loud, while reading comics, and while my parents shouted at us.  
It was...good.  
Now...  
I am alone.  
Yet I still have a part of him with me...literally.  
I wish it would be just metaphorical, like in my memories.

“Uh… We can't exactly tell you that. Privacy laws and all that,” the nurse said.




Kane groaned. “Privacy laws. Since when did you care about those?”




“We always did.”




“Riiiiight.”




“But Ori's dead.” Kane thought for a moment. “Did you think to inform his parents and sister of his death? They're in his will.” Kane didn't comment that he was also good friends with Ori's whole family, and was also mentioned in the will. Nor did he mention Ori's opinion on organ donating.




“We can't say.”




“Well, I'm probably going to find out later, but I do have one more question for you.”

1loe8mv,n0myel1,"They couldn't stop it.

For all the blood, sweat and tears of the forest guardians, and their magics, it was beyond even them. A blaze that ate through their wards and protections, growing ever stronger. The only thing they could do was buy time. Each inch of forest lost was taken only at great cost. If they had long enough, if the weather had been on their side, if if if.

But the ifs were only that. Potentials, none yet realised. And none would be. All the creatures of the trees could do was watch, and wait for the end.

A few ran. They breached the edge of their homes, fleeing to find somewhere new. But it was only the young and foolish that dared. For they didn't realise the cost of it, leaving their home. The instant they did, they began to die.

For what they hadn't known was their reliance on their home. The ambient mana let them live and grow, in defiance of natural laws. It was possible for some to leave, by gradually spending time away from the core, adapting to lower mana levels. But that took time, often measured in years. Without that preparation, their body would unspool. It would be an agonising death, though as flames approached, it seemed more appealing. For all that it was painful, it was quick.

Yet most didn't. They clustered around the Heart of the forest, feeling doom approach. A dryad, a few young decades old, suddenly screamed. Onlookers turned, to see her clawing at her arms. At the ash flaking off, hot embers visible beneath.

Her tree had been caught. The inferno took it, ate at it. Though she was untouched by flames, she burned nonetheless. As she screamed and screamed, an enormous claw of stone descended around her.

It squeezed just once. A crunching snap cut off her screams, as what little could be seen of her fell limp. Green ichor spurted out, as the crustacean's claw moved her. Ther she was dropped, in a pile of other bodies, all the same way. Crushed beyond recognition, a merciful death.

The Seed Watcher blinked its single eye once, unfathomable thoughts hidden behind. Another of its children slain by its hand. It was a crab, though one of land, coated in moss with a body of stone. It towered over the creatures nearby, their first, and greatest protector.

It had made its choice. Those of its children would die to it, when their death was guaranteed to come from the inferno. It alone had a chance to survive. And it alone could carry their memories, and give then a chance to grow anew. A hope, more of a dream. But one they clung to.

It turned with a start, staring into the distance. Away from the flames. But it's focus was enough to make the others turn, to watch. And those who noticed felt a flicker in the mana. A change in the air. A warping of wards. A few understood what it meant, but most didn't.

Until a trampling of feet came. Humans, Elves, Orcs and Goblins alike poured in. Not a horde of them, an invasion or similar. And many looked familiar, ones known by some members of the forest.

Talking in their fast tongue, a few ran in the directions of flames. Faster than anything could consider, they were back, shouting words the Seed Watcher barely caught, but understood. ""Fire... unnatural... burns magic... escape.""

Discussions happened all around, as one alone approached the protector. An aged Goblin, long white beard dragging through the dirt. He bowed to it, holding a staff it recognised. One it had gifted, carved from the heart of one of its ancient tree's. ""Seedy... your home. Is burning, but we help. We save.""

The Seed Watcher stared at him, before tilting its body in a nod. Its voice was silent, timeless thoughts radiating into the others minds. ""Save. Them. Please.""

The Goblin gave a single nod, grinning a toothy smile. ""We shall. And you. We save all.""

And in the blazing future it and its kin had seen, a new one sprouted. One that set minds and heart to rest. One of hope returned to them by their friends.",5

Amalgum grunted as he uncurled himself from his sleeping position, and pries himself away from the comfy rock he had been laying on. Peeking his head out of the cave entrance, he spotted the man in dapper clothes, carrying a leather bag over his shoulder. 

""What is it this time, Jean Claude"" he said, trying to maintain his patience. 

""Good to see you again, Amalgum. I'm here from the meat of the month club I'd like to interest you in a free sam-"" 

""Hold up."" Amalgum said, scratching his scaley chin. ""Last week you were trying sell me organizers for my gold hoards.""

""I promise you. Segmented wicker crates are the future.""

""The week before that, you were trying to sell me socks.""

""I must admit, trying to sell a dragon a pair of human sized socks might have been a bit of a stretch."" 

""And now you're trying to sell me...what I can only assume is a meat based subscription service."" Amalgum looked at Jean Claude with concern. ""Who...who do you work for?"" 

""I don't."" Jean Claude said, dropping his leather bag to the ground. ""I raid the kingdom's dumpsters at night, and try to sell what I find. The meat of the month club is basically just me bringing you whatever dried meats I can find once a month."" Amalgum slithered back into his cave, and returned with what was a small handful of gold for him. 

""If I give you this gold, will you leave me alone?"" Amalgum dropped the two ton pile of gold on the ground in front of Jean Claude. 

""Oh, yes sir. Thank you."" For the rest of the day, Amalgum tried to ignore the noise of Jean Claude moving his new fortune, but was relieved he wouldn't be seeing him in front of his cave again. He would think about the man again until a week later. 

""Excuse us, Mr. Amalgum."" A new salesman stood in front of the cave. Amalgum stuck his head out yet again.

“I already told you; I am one of the most powerful beings in this realm, I don’t NEED to be rescued by some weak cleric or paladin. If demons try to intrude on my cave, I would simply kill them, just like I do everything else that gets in here.” The dragon said, blowing another smoke ring to punctuate its annoyance.

The salesman smiled sympathetically, “But what if the demons are too strong, or there are too many? Heck what if they just snuck in here and made themselves at home?”

The dragon sighed. “I have literally killed of the dark lord of hell by myself, twice! I can handle what eve the demons throw at me!”

“What about me Mr. ‘Mighty Dragon’, if you are so strong, why haven’t you gotten rid of me yet?” the salesman smirked.

“I don’t want to talk about it.” The dragon said, before changing its mind. “You know that I have gotten rid of you multiple times! I have physically removed you 6 times, and flat out killed you twice. I’m only entertaining your sales pitch because I hope that as soon as you are done you would leave me be and I will never have to see you again!”

“Why if you were such a smart dragon, you would know that the only true way to get rid of me would be simple!” the salesman said, knowing that he had the dragon on the proverbial ropes.

The dragon ran its claws through its horns, mimicking the actions it has seen humans do when they are stressed. “Fine, what do I have to do to get rid of you?”

The salesman reached into his robe, pulled out a pen and said “It’s easy, you just gotta sign up for the demon-disposal plus program!”",8
1lnvkto,n0l6faw,"*Not finished yet; I'll have a layover later on...*

Promoted at last! I had spent years as a lowly Analyst in the Xeno-Intelligence services. I watched different races from afar, mined their broadcast signals, (if any), and made up fake identities for our spies to assume when they took the field. I started intensive training a year ago. It flew by *fast.* It prepared us to land on most any planet that breathed the same kind of air you did, observe and record the locals, and in the very least, learn what would label you *friend* or *foe.* The capstone to the Officer Candidate School was to survive several missions on Earth: Urban environments in cold, moderate, and hot climates, pick two out of the three. Rural environments, rich country and poor. You’d think the order would be the other way around, but talking a convincing game was vital to live in those backwaters.

Earth/Terra is a fucking *gorgeous* planet, it has brought most of its apex predators in line, and many agents said that humans were hilarious. The courtship rituals alone…  A large portion of its plant and animal life was reasonably edible, as far as my race was concerned. I was starting my mission in three days, but I’d be donning my disguise now.  You had to get used to what you saw in the mirror.

I sat at the console of the disguise printer and paged through my options for human-disguise. Males got more respect and deference, and tended to be stronger and sturdier. I hit that option. No need to hobble myself voluntarily. The ultraviolet exposure on Earth was relatively high, so I chose a darker skin tone. Radiation burns *suck.* The options for hair were truly dizzying- it would be summer where I landed, so I chose a nice, practical hairstyle that would keep it out of my eyes and mostly out of the way and cool. “*Locs,”* the computer said they were. The rules were such that you were not allowed to dress as high status for the society you were landing in. I selected a couple of shirts, pants, and *boots* or *sneakers* to alternate as necessary. Quality, sturdy clothes, sure. But nothing with any of the silly sigils; they sometimes doubled as an affiliation with specific factions- you could be giving a wrong impression, hence the rule. There seemed to be an unhealthy level of nuance for the shoes, as well.

The leaders of Xeno-Intelligence were not monsters, and they allowed for alien forms in peak physical condition. The forms were grafted on to you, so there was no point in making you a weakling. You were there to complete a mission on a potentially dangerous planet, after all. I checked over the form in the printing preview. Roughly two meters tall, broad shoulders, muscle enough to move a “fellow human” reasonably easy, if need be. I hastily scanned some of the Earth transmissions; the body type seemed appealing to human-ladies, as well. Again, don’t make the job harder than you have to. ",5

The Prime Knight had been witness to the End of Time. She watched as Gods brought fury and wrath to the entire world. She held those she loved in her arms as they took their last dying breaths. An unspoken promise to them as they looked to the sky, eyes wide, wondering what it had all been for.

She had reversed the End of Time. She fought Gods and brought them down to the world they had tried to destroy. She killed the loved ones of others as she progressed through her quests, watched them question the sky, wondering who had forsaken them.

The People adored her. Everywhere she went, she was given praise and riches and weapons that would give her an edge in whatever fight would come. She had walked the entirety of the world twice over, sailed every sea known to man, dug new tunnels to find lost civilizations. She learned the names of those who would be forgotten, and she tried - so desperately tried - to connect with all of the people of the world. They *loved* her. She *tried* to love them back.

But it was that first fight that had broken her. When the last she had loved, and those she could never forget, had been ripped from her. Their souls given away, in a crass attempt at immortality. Instead, she roamed the world - uncertain as to where she would go next.

\>>><<< 

The latest fight had come sooner than she had thought. As news traveled down the coastlines and the shores, trying to reach her humble abode on some lost island. She had taken it as her latest gift, a bastion in which she could rest.

It was beautiful. A sort of lighthouse-turned-fortress that she had made her own, painted and enchanted, built and rebuilt. The Prime Knight employed those she had grown close to, some she had rescued, others she hoped would rescue her. One day, when it was her turn.

Atop this lighthouse-fortress, she watched clouds roll by each day, counted the turns of the sun, and the phases of the moon. She would witness *eons* here. Some would only witness a week or less.

A courier arrived late one morning, as the Prime Knight stood solemn in her tower. She watched him approach, dirt flying up in the ground beneath his feet as he ran to the bastion. She turned back to the armory that was her fortress, searched for a weapon that would mean something in her next fight. She heard the race of feet, the talk of voices outside of her door. The next fight was upon her.

\>>><<< 

The fault was in her own mind.  There was nothing she could do to fight it. Inside she knew that none of these petty wars or battles or “end of days” truly mattered. She had seen the Eye of Chronos, or at least the Mortal who had tried to control it. In that first climactic battle, she had smote the would-be God of Time.

And all those souls he had gathered? All those loved ones she had feared to lose.

They had joined her soul instead. Granted her power and immortality that she never dreamed of having, that she would give away in an instead if it meant having them back. If it meant foregoing the world she would live beyond.

People call me the “Last Bastion.”

The “One-Man Final Stand.”

The “Legendary Hero Who Arrives When All Hope is Lost.”

Very flattering.

Very *wrong.*

The truth is, I’m just really, *really* lazy.

Yeah, I’ve got powers that make cosmic horrors cry.

Time manipulation? Got it. 

Planetary telekinesis? Sure. 

Finger-snap annihilation? Please. 

But none of that means I want to put on pants for every baby earthquake or local supervillain monologue. 

I have games to beat. Shows to binge. Pizza to order and devour.

The only reason I ever show up is because these “apocalypses” tend to screw with my personal life.

Like last month... 

The giant lizard god ? 

Ate my favorite ramen joint. 

Do you know how many all-night side-quests I powered through with their spicy pork tonkotsu? So, yeah. Had to vaporize the lizard.

Or the doomsday cult who summoned a black hole? 

That thing almost swallowed my internet connection. Unforgivable.

I don’t do hero speeches. I don’t sign autographs. I don’t care if the population bows or screams. I just want my couch, my snacks, and an uninterrupted Wi-Fi signal.

So today, I’m lying on said couch, blanketed in a fortress of chip bags, when the sky splits open with purple hellfire. The news ticker: *“World-ending entity breaches dimension. Pray for salvation.”*

I sigh.

Pause the game.

Peer outside.

The cosmic horror’s giant eyeball is staring right at my building. It’s leaking some kind of anti-gravity sludge that’s dissolving my favorite corner store.

*Nope.*

*Not having it.*

I step onto my balcony, cape flapping majestically in the nuclear breeze. 

My neighbor catches sight of me.

Eyes wide, hands clasped, they shouted: “The Legendary Hero! He’s come to save us!”

*Wrong.*

*I’m here because that corner store sells the only slushies that taste right at 3 A.M.*

I raise my hand. The monster wails in six dimensions.

*Snap.*

*Gone.*

*Reduce to atom.*

The sky stitches itself shut like an apologetic wound. People burst into cheers down on the street, chanting my name. Candles, banners, grown men weeping.

“Tell the world…” I say, my voice echoing like a divine revelation. “That it needs to knock next time.”

Then I close the balcony door, flop back on my couch, and unpause my game.

1lnhynj,n0hgqa5,"“My Prime Knight,” the courier said. He knelt before her massive frame, emboldened by the custom plate steel armor she had been granted. “A war erupts to the North.”

She did not speak. Instead, those gathered around her did the talking for her.

“Of what nation do you hail?”

“The Kingdom of Vidae,” he said, “home to the High King Rono.”

“Vidae is home to those of the former nation of Lebo, is it not?”

“It is, my lord.”

“Those of Lebo were great friends to the Prime Knight,” another said. “Vidae as well, but in recent memory, the Prime Knight has not visited these lands.”

“She has not yet blessed us with her presence, my lady.”

“Aye, and so, the Prime Knight cannot go. Bound only to protect and serve those she has come to know.”

“The Queen herself has sent me,” the courier began, and looked this time directly to the Prime Knight. “She claims you had saved her once before.” The courier held out his hand, holding a small obsidian stone.

The Prime Knight took a step forward. She reached towards it.

\>>><<< 

“I would give you my heart,” the Prime Knight said, “if you would have it.”

Lady Alina stared at the deep black eyes of the Prime Knight, hoping to find a speck of white hidden in the iris. It was an abyss, of time and memory. “It is not yours to give away,” Alina said, “it is bound to so many others.”

“Others I have lost, of those I could not save.”

Alina stared now at the Prime Knight herself, taking in the features of the woman – immortal or not – in front of her. She was beautiful. A sharp face, seemingly chiseled by the Gods who had shaped her into the being she was. Beautiful locks of silver white hair blew by an unknown wind.

“You cannot. For I may love you with every fiber of my being,” Alina turned now, “but you cannot love like that.”

The Prime Knight was silent. It was true, she knew that, but Lady Alina had been a light in the darkness. A target of her admiration. A being she respected.

“You will find me again one day, I am sure of it.”

“Only when you need me.”

“Those eyes see all, do they not?”

1lnhynj,n0hgrf1,"The Prime Knight clutched the stone in her hands. If the war was one that the Kingdom needed her for, she would be there in time, when needed. But now it was one that those she tried to love needed her for.

“Make preparations,” the Prime Knight’s voice boomed across her bastion. Another gift. “We set sail in an hour.”

The entire chorus of those who had joined her bowed their heads. “It will be done.”

\>>><<< 

The Prime Knight had been witness to the Beginning of Time. She watched the birth of the Gods, saw them shape humans in her image. She had watched loved ones die in each other’s arms, their eyes looking to her for hope, wondering if she had been there all along.

She knew all there was, and more. But none of it mattered.

Love was a funny thing. It could enslave you to another person for a lifetime, but it could tether you to the world forever.

The Prime Knight once had a name she had long forgotten. She once felt the touch of another upon her lips. But they were gone now.

1lngugu,n0fjbqg,"The blood on the altar was still wet when Inquisitor Brahm barged into the crumbling temple of the Adalmos people he deemed savages. Soon, he would slaughter the remaining priests of this heretical religion and begin converting the surviving civilians to his one true god.

To cease worshipping a false god they believed to demand blood sacrifices.

""Why would you people worship a deity of war crimes?"" He demanded to know, even as his crusaders thrust their swords towards these heretics. ""What good god would desire the blood of his people? Stop this nonsense. Convert to obeying the tenets of my one true god, and you shall receive salvation. Not by this futile ritual you're trying to do.""

""Common misconception,"" the old head priest coughed out blood, while clutching a stab wound at his side. ""Adan does not cause war crimes. He punishes those who commit them. Speaking of which...""

The other priests had stood in a circle and raised their hands into the skies. Singing songs of praise to their god. Even as Brahm's men cut them down swiftly, even as they did not resist, they never stopped singing.

The grounds shook and threw the crusaders off balance. One of his men shouted about the mountains rumbling. Rising. From the skies turned crimson, golden eyes sprayed across the horizon.

""May Adan punish you for your crimes against us,"" the head priest sputtered before he collapsed into a heap.

""We must defend ourselves against the demons these heretics have conjured!"" Brahm roared, raising his weapon. ""Who stands with me?""

None do. All his men dropped their weapons and fled before what they now believed was a real god. Not the invisible god they had been taught about in church. This one spanned across the skies and mountains, so large they could not see the entirety of its being as a massive hand came crashing through the temple.

Brahm stood his ground. Believing his god would aid him in this time of his greatest need. To overcome the biggest battle against a terrible demon.

The entity flattened him into the ground and moved on without a word.

1lnx8vb,n0izmf5,"Carlaq blinked. A thick crust had formed on his eyes and only shades of black and white managed to pervade his vision. He blinked again and color streamed through—dark shades of an ice cold blue. A shiver ran down his spine. After one last blink, the world finally began to come into focus. He could see a ceiling through a translucent blue tinge.

He tried to look around but he lay motionless, stuck in place like someone had casted a curse on him. But he remembered nothing of the such. The last thing he could remember was... death. Insurmountable amounts of it. The memory felt heavy and remembrance came slowly, made even more difficult by the frigid magic that held him in place.

As his brain churned, so did his hands. He compelled his fingers to move, if only enough to cast a counter spell, but they stayed stubbornly still. He felt powerless and weak. His world was blue and his body was numb.

Then a muffled sound came. At first, he thought it was the dull ache of death coming for him, but the noise slowly became clear. There was someone talking. He strained to hear the words, strained to move his eyes enough to see who was speaking them. But only subtle movement bled into his blurry periphery.

Who had done this to him? Carlaq willed himself to remember.

*He sat atop a war lizard. Dead humans littered the battlefield. A tendril of ice magic spilled from his fingers, skewering a human that still clung to life. The human capital lay ahead. Victory was in sight. But then a burning light appeared in the distance...*

The thought from a millennia ago sent an aching pit into his stomach once again.

*The light meant the unthinkable had come to pass. The humans had completed their mission: all life on earth was to be reset, to be given back to the ancients. The Human Hersey.*

A burning rage filled Carlaq's chest as he relived the defeat—his decades at war all for naught.

*The overwhelming force bore towards him. He cast a final spell. Elven frost magic surrounded him*—*a forgotten and forbidden art. He burrowed deep into the earth, entombing himself in an ice coffin that even the ancients couldn't break. He would* ***not*** *be defeated.* 

Carlaq released the magic he had unknowingly been holding. Splinters of blue ice blew apart in every direction, exploding like a magical grenade.

Rising into the air, the elven war general beheld the room. Humans in white coats lay mangled around him, blood seeping from impaled icicles. Machinery lined every wall, blinking and shifting with enchanting lightwork.

Carlaq clenched his unfrozen fists at the sight of the ancient magical machinery. This war was not over... It had only just begun.",8
1lnbt6u,n0eun8q,"""Me, evil? Perish the thought! Well, maybe on a Monday but I think everyone is a bit off at the start of the week."" 

Another armored figure, wearing that dreaded, faceless helmet they were all taught to fear chimed in. 

""No Sarge, we're pretty sure that's just you after you've had a sugar crash!"" The rest of the soldiers, at least those not occupied tending to the wounded villagers, broke out in muffled laughter. At least until a harshly barked order back made them refocus.

The child remained in surprised silence for a moment, unsure what to make of the animatedly speaking soldiers. Her arm was still in the hands of the one called ""Sarge,"" carefully being bandaged over the long cut across it. 

Honestly, her injury was amongst the worst received when the villagers panicked at the approaching soldiers. Most had bruising or sprained joints from falling and being jostled about in the mad dash for the road leading further inland, only to find another group of soldiers already blocking it. 

But now, perhaps emboldened by the fact that herself and none of her neighbors were dead, she sought her answers. More quietly, more sadly, she asked her question again.

""Why? Why is this happening?"" 

The surrounding soldiers quieted down completely, looking at her. ""Sarge"" waved them off before sighing and sitting down in front of her. He spoke after she looked back up into his visor. 

""You must be really confused about all this then? Well, I don't like being confused either, so I'll explain some things to you, but it might not make you feel better. Are you okay with that?"" 

She nodded. Sarge nodded back and took out a small booklet, more pristine than anything she had seen before. He flipped through the pages and began speaking. 

""So, my home is really, really far away from yours. And we don't really have any fighting back there right now. But we just finished a super big war, don't worry the good guys won, but now there were a lot of soldiers who didn't need to fight anyone. My Emperor, one of those soldiers, settled down and founded a country. And then he gave a lot of other soldiers homes and new jobs."" 

""But what does that have to do with us?""

""Ah, that's the next part. See, do you know how your home fights all the other countries around you?""

Her expression became even more downcast, and looked down in shame as she remembered her lessons. 

""There's the knights, and the mages... and the slaves."" 

Sarge patted her shoulder, almost like he was trying to distance her from her own thoughts. 

""Yes, exactly. But do you know where they get the slaves from?"" 

Slowly, dread and realization seeped into her mind. Even only eleven winters old, she was smart enough to understand what the adults gossiped about, and what her country does. She looked back up and spoke the truth. 

""The mages. They use magic to... get more slaves."" 

Sarge nodded, then showed her two pages from his booklet. On it, there was a detailed drawing. It depicted a large atrium, with many glowing magic circles and mages. But what shocked her the most was the centerpiece. 

In the middle of the drawing was a crowd of crying, screaming people being beaten and collared like animals. She couldn't look away. She desperately wanted to look at anything else, but the eyes in that drawing, full of anguish and accusations against her very existence, held her captive. As if she would be less than human for turning away. She made her guess for the invasion's cause known.

""The mages... stole your people, the former soldiers. That's why you're here.""

Sarge let out a dry laugh. She could almost feel the cruel smile hidden under his helmet.

""Very good guess. Very close. They *tried* to steal away our people. Only problem for them, our Emperor already knew about crimes like this, and had made preparations against similar acts. Now, we are here to make sure your king and his mages can't try again. Forever.""",62
1lnbt6u,n0e8mha,"""Are we now?"" I smile.  
""W-well...you invaded us. Aren't invaders the bad guys?"" the child asks.  
I nod.  
""Usually they are, but what if we have a reason for this?"" I ask.  
The adults we have defeated in the surroundings all snort, while my comrades chuckle.  
""Reason?"" the child asks.  
I nod.

  
""The Empire tried to spread its ways, and methods to the surrounding kingdoms, freely. We didn't expect to be 100% accepted, but at least copied. When we saw that they mock us, and don't listen to us, we decided to do this...for the people."" I say.  
The adults roll their eyes.  
""For the people? Us?"" the child asks.  
I nod.  
""The Empire changed a few years ago, when her Majesty the Empress ascended. Now, we try to improve the life of everyone, not just nobles."" I say.  
The child's eyes sparkled, but the adults were skeptic.

  
""Yeah? That's why you wage war, and spread bloodshed, and chaos to the kingdoms?!"" one of them shouts.  
""Sacrifices are needed. And may I ask, have we actively tried to slaughter you?"" I say.  
He didn't answer.  
""How will you improve life? What do you want to spread?"" the child asks.  
""In the Empire, commoners are not seen as lesser beings, and nobles are noble, only because they have more responsibility to bear than the commoners. Farmers for example are paid for their crops, and they are seen as one of the most important part of the Empire."" I say.  
The child gasps, but the adults chuckle maliciously. 

  
""Yeah, sure! For who knows how much rent, and levy! Farmers are always exploited!"" the adults say.  
I shake my head.  
""No levy, or rent. The land is given out freely to families in exchange of a promised crop yield.  
90% of the crop is sent to the Empire, but it is bought, not for free, at market price."" I say.  
They gasp, and mutter something about rumours.  
""Also, children between the age of 3 to 14, are allowed to freely go to school, schools that are now built everywhere.  
Also, the Empire pays professionals, to allow talented youths to be apprenticed under them."" I say.  
""I could learn to read?!"" the child asks.  
I nod.  
""I used to be a farmer 6 months ago, before a teacher noticed I have a knack for leading people, now I am an officer. The Empress knows that people are the foundation of the Empire, and focuses on us."" I say.  
That broke the dam, and questioned poured out of the adults, and children alike.  
I smiled.  
The more the benevolence of the Empire spreads...the easier the conquest shall be.",246
1lnbt6u,n0fybva,"""Hmmm..."" The medic paused for a bit, then thought. He looked round the room at the child's family, then thought some more.

""Is this your baby sister?"" he said, nodding towards the little lady currently getting a plaster on her grazed knee. She stuck her tounge out in affirmation.

""Yeah.""

""Do you ever get it where you only tap or move her out of the way, but she overreacts and cries, and now you're somehow the bad guy?"" replied the medic.

The kid's eyes lit up. ""That happens to you, too?""

""Yeah. I tried to move my sister out of the way of some oncoming cars, but I grabbed her too hard and my Mom and Dad said I hurt her.""

""That's not fair!""

The soldier laughed. ""Now, what if I could make sure that your sister could never tattle on you ever again? In fact, what if she could never speak again?""

""That would be a big relief for Mommy and Daddy.""

""Are you sure about that? She wouldn't be able to tell you if she hurt herself, or if she loved you, or if she had a nightmare.""

""Then... that's wrong?""

""Who decides if things are right and wrong?""

""Well... doesn't everybody?""

""Who's everybody?""

The kid looked puzzled and repeated himself: ""Everybody?""

""Yes... and what if loads of big, powerful men decided that girls like your Mommy and your sister weren't allowed to talk.""

""That'd be... bad... and wrong.""

""Would it? Everyone's been told that it's right, so only you'd be wrong.""

""Well, I don't care what would be wrong, 'cos my Mpmmy and Rhii can say what they want in my daddy's house.""

""And what if they paid you lots and lots of money? Or threatened to take you away from your Mommy and Rhii because they were allowed to talk? Or that they would threaten to tell your friends about the last time you called the teacher 'Mommy'?""

""That'd be...""

""We've been fighting to make sure that your Mommy and Rhii and all your aunties and your girl classmates can all grow up and have a voice and be big, independent ladies. The big men who do all the important stuff that run this country don't like that, and they've been saying that we are bad men. But we're really trying not to be..."" Tears grew in the medic's eyes.

""When the shell hit your block, that was... we never meant for any of that to happen. We were working on shit intel and now we've put you and your family at risk and it's all our fault. We're so extremely lucky. You're so extremely lucky. Little man... can you forgive me for almost accidentally hurting your family?""

The medic threw himself into the boy's mercy, under his bandaged arm, trying to kill sobs that were leaking out.

""Do you promise that it won't happen again? That wasn't a toy, you could seriously hurt someone with that.""

The medic composed himself and tried his best to grab most of the kid's palms.

""...I promise, little man.""

1lnbt6u,n0ebxdz,"It depends on the reader, to be honest.

I see it both as propaganda, and the truth.

But no, even if they are not born in the Empire, after being conquered wherever they are is the Empire, so they will be treated the same.

Propaganda or not, evil or not, the Empress truly knows that there can be geniuses hidden in the dirt, so she will try her best to unearth them.",47
1lnbt6u,n0ewrre,"Manipulation, rather than coersion.

No force is being used to win their love, and love is love.

With enough benefits, the commoners will love the Empress, after all, what matters for most if not the prospect of not having to worry about food, housing and that their children might have a better future than them?

The Empress not only gains the land, but also the heart of the people, and also if lucky enough talented people to use here and there: 3 objectives in 1 move.",10
1lnbt6u,n0f4ise,"It won't get that bad in this situation.  
Only a dumb ruler would disallow free thought completely, how will true talents rise if everything is strictly controlled?

As I said, the Empress wants the commoners. (not out of kindness though)

Like she will give out good conditions, and request minimal return, only to convince people she is good, and to lure them into a sense of safety.

She wants them to feel good, and make more kids, and will set incentives for reproduction.

Why?

Because in many fantasy settings the ratio of magic user to non-magic user is bad.

Let's say : 1 out of 10 nobles, and 1 out of 10 thousand commoners can awaken \*insert profession/class\*

So the Empress is out to pump those number ups for the commoners, because it is easier than for the nobles.

The good conditions she is offering will: make people love her/like her or at least accept her, will ensure people are harder to be poached away for other powers, and her Empire will have a greater pool of talents.

Win-win for her, and for the commoners as well.",6
1ln5gqz,n0cwrs2,"I first discovered the power when I heard my dad coming upstairs into my room. It was past bedtime, and I should have been asleep instead of playing video games; there wasn't nearly enough time to hide the GameCube and cover myself with my blanket.

Thankfully, time took pity on me and waited.

I only truly realized what the power did when I was blindly crossing the road. By the time I looked to my side, I was met with the front of a truck twice my size, frozen in place. I finished crossing, and the truck resumed.

I then got greedy. At eighteen, I was doing all sorts of stuff.

Smoking weed behind a police car as all my friends watched in awe and laughed. The moment the officer inside realized what was going on, in the blink of an eye, I was gone.

I would make money doing daredevil acts, one of them being dodging cars on a highway as people started betting money on how many I could dodge.

My highest score was 37, but I could have gone for longer.

I continued the stunts until one day, time had enough of it.

I was dared to jump from rooftop to rooftop, a bundle of dollars on the table. I took the challenge and jumped.

I wasn't even anywhere near the other side.

As I fell to my doom, time around me froze; however, that did nothing to cushion my fall.

Fortunately, I survived, my legs taking most of the damage. Unfortunately, I was bleeding inside and out, a crack resounding through my body every time I tried to move. I attempted to crawl as far towards my friend as possible, wondering why no one had called an ambulance.

I then saw him, the expression of horror and surprise on his face frozen in time

The same expression then mirrored on mine, realizing that I was still in danger of bleeding out.

I cursed myself. I cursed my powers. I begged time to resume as my eyelids grew heavy, the pain making me writhe atop the cold floor.

There was a hospital not far from where I groaned. If time allowed, I could have survived.

I would have survived.

I should have… survived…",445
1ln5gqz,n0dsjk4,"As a kid, I always thought the slo-mo effects in the movies were real, just that they should be even slower, like a time stop. How could they not be when that's what I experienced from time to time?

One day when I was 5, mum was cooking and I was bugging her to bring me to the zoo. Distracted, her hand slipped and the pot with hot soup and all, started falling— and then it stopped. I poked at the pot floating on top of my head, just out of reach. ""Okay, that hurts!"" The burning sensations on the tips of my tiny fingers prompted me to move out of the way. ""And just it in time too"", I thought as time resumed, the pot crashed into the floor with a loud clank and steaming soup spilled everywhere. Shaken, mum hugged me tightly in her arms while calling it a miracle that I only got some blisters on my finger, not remembering at all that I shouldn't have been behind her. 

It was then that I started to realise these timestops only happen when I'm in real danger, not for small stuffs like a fall or a trip, or getting into trouble for sneaking out late at night. It's for the actually-would-cripple-me or kill me type of situations, a motorbike that could have ran over me because the rider was rushing the red light or a shove by someone behind who's lost their balance that might tumble me off a flight of stairs.

As I got older, being a teen with a morbid sense of humor, I always joked with dad that maybe I was meant to die when I was born but then Time decided to stop for a moment and save me instead. And he'd chuckle at that and reply, ""Who knows, maybe this is your secret superpower, like that girl from Life is Strange"". I'd punch him playfully and say, ""What?! Rewinding time is so much cooler than this random timestop. This can't even get me out of Maths class!"" and we'd both laugh our ass off. I truly thought nothing of it and just continued my life like it's an extra life jacket. My anxious nature never prompted me to put myself in danger despite the second layer of protection from death anyways. Until one day...

We're on a family trip to visit my grandparents that's 2 hours drive away, dad's humming to some old country song on the radio and mum's busy checking if she got all the stuff packed. I was nodding along to my sister's tirade of how this means she can't hang out with her BFF tonight when suddenly the scenery stopped moving and I turned around and see my sister motionless, with her mouth half-opened. 

Realising what's happening, I opened the car door and tried to move my sister's frozen frame but she wouldn't budge. Panicking, I got out of the car and opened the driver's side door to try to get my dad out but no matter how hard I pull, he wouldn't move an inch. Neither was I able to move mum. Time was both kind and cruel, it gave me all the time in the world to try get them out, only for me to realise that nothing I do could save them. In the end, I tried running towards the roadside after turning the steering wheel to the side, hoping that this would make the car swerve to the other side and my family would survive the crash once time resumed. 

They would, right? They have to. 

In the fastest slo-mo of my life, time jolted into life as everything started moving at the lighting speed before my eyes — our car swerved to the side and flipped as a tanker narrowly passed by it. Belatedly, the driver hit the brakes as the humongous being of oil and gas was forced to a halt with a screeching sound. I rushed towards where my family was stranded, while the sound of the driver's voice and 911's responders blurred into the background. 

Ambulance, police, hospitals.. It was all a haze. The police delivered the news that my mum and sister was in ICU but my dad did not survived the impact as he tried to take the brunt of the crash on his side of the car. Sitting outside the ICU unit with a warm blanket that could never seem to chase away the cold in my limbs, I realised too late that the precious blessing that I was gifted with? It's actually a curse in disguise. The God of Time only cared about my life, and mine alone, not anyone else, not even the people that I cherish the most.

Time flies, mum and sister recovered. We managed to picked up the pieces of our family and trudged on, or it seemed so on the surface at least. It's never said out loud but sometimes I felt like my family resented me for not saving dad. ""Why couldn't you save him if you could stop time?"", my sister once shouted at me from her hospital bed in tears. I tried explaining to her that it doesn't work like that but it's impossible to explain the unexplainable. 

We grew apart, it's as if an unbridgable chasm had opened between the rest of my family and me. I could feel it in the subdued dinners, the quiet glances that mum and my sister gave each other, the visits to dad's grave that they did together and the awkward hugs mum gave me on the occasion I'm there. 

I started putting myself into danger, situations I wouldn't dreamed of getting myself into at all before. I figured that if Time is so selfish in its benevolence, then my resentment of it would be justified and I might as well as make it regret saving me to begin with. I started wandering around shady places where incidents were known to happen, stepping in front of train tracks as the train honked by, making a playground out of the busiest road in town, all in hopes that perhaps Time could take me and give me back my dad instead.

Alas, the God of Time was patient. It remained unprovoked by my shenanigans and still relentlessly saved me again and again by stopping the flow of time. And through its repeated, gentle guidance, I began to realise that this gift wasn't as big of a curse as I thought it was. Rather than continue putting myself into unnecessary dangers, I started getting courses in first aid, then EMT. I applied to become a firefighter and volunteered for rescue work where the risks were really high but help was desperately needed. 

I might not be able to save everyone, heck I can't even save my own dad, but if I can put one less person in the path of danger again, then I'm going to do so.

I loved it, but then...I slipped and just right a car turned into our street.  
I was terrified, my mom and dad started screaming...and then, nothing.  
I fell, but the bike was frozen half-fallen, while the car stopped, and mom and dad were also mid-shout.  
I walked around, and the moment I was on the sidewalk...things started moving again.  
It was weird.

  
After that, I noticed anytime something that could be considered dangerous to me, time froze.  
Yes...my ability allowed me to freeze time.  
Almost being caught reading late at night?  
Almost being caught sneaking out?  
Almost being hit by a car?  
Time froze.  
Sometimes it was obvious like with a car, or a dude with a knife.  
Other times it was less obvious, like with nothing around, or with only friends surrounding me.  
Quite a bad way to find out someone hates you.  
Today... it is one of the less obvious ones.

  
It has been hours, and I have visited the entire town.  
No matter where I was, time would not unfreeze.  
I was always afraid of this.  
What does this mean?  
The world is ending?  
Or maybe I am dying, like of a disease, a blood clot, heart attack or something?  
I was terrified.  
So, I went to the hospital, in the nurses' lounge, and waited.  
I drank water, and meditated, hoping if I die...then maybe, maybe, time will unfreeze, and the nurses will bring me back somehow.

  
Hours turned into days.  
I ate, and slept at the hospital.  
Then suddenly, sounds come back to life.  
People rush around the hallway, people groan, and shout, and nurses run from one room to another.  
I was out to get me some food, when time unfroze.  
I...  
I don't know why it unfroze.  
Maybe my health decided it wasn't my time?  
Or the world got so close to ending, but due to the time freeze...the time window for when something would have caused destruction passed?  
I don't know, but I am happy that I am alive, and people around me move.  
And I decided, that from now on...I shall make trimesterial check ups.",88

*Do Superpositions Dream of Margins of Error?*



PART ONE



The first time it happened, Mira was nine years old. A red goods carrier took the corner at Apte Road too fast, chassis groaning, and tires scraping and sliding as she stepped into the road. And yet, suddenly the noise was gone. A silence so complete that it felt to Mira, wrapped in her mother’s old cotton dupatta, and suddenly feeling very small, that it felt like the world had stopped breathing. The next thing she knew, she was on the opposite sidewalk, unharmed. Her mother cried and called it a miracle. Mira told no one what she remembered: the truck midair, wheels not spinning, its shadow unmoving on the asphalt.  She suffered a huge bout of nausea and the moment was overshadowed by her mother remonstrating with her as she was being sick at the side of the road.  



The second time, she was in her twenties, newly appointed to the physics department at Savitribai Phule Pune University. In her office late, she heard voices shouting, a somewhat distant alarm had sounded, when she peeked into the corridor, it was still but some sprinklers had come on in desultory fashion.  She ignored them.



An utter silence fell, and she instantly recalled being in central Pune with her mother, and the red goods carrier, the stillness.  She went back to the corridor to look.



The sprinklers were firing intermittently.  Near her, the water spritzed down slowly, further away the droplets seemed suspended in mid-air. A red file cart lay tipped in the hall, as if someone had abandoned it mid-run. One shoe near the stairwell. The air didn’t smell like smoke, or indeed anything, but she knew what was coming.



Time wasn’t exactly still, as she moved through the corridor, just muffled. Slow. When she stepped into the stairwell, the light caught dust in the air, but the particles didn’t move. A fellow faculty member on the landing was frozen mid-shout, mouth open.  She thought her heart should have been thumping in her chest, but she felt strangely dislocated from her body, or the fear.  She thought she should be afraid, or involved in rescue, but instead she did the natural thing and she walked past him and out the side door. The sky outside was oddly sharp. A neem tree shook in the wind, or tried to. A drop of water clung to her wrist and didn’t fall.",13
1ln5gqz,n0ey78u," I was in the middle of an exam, completely blank. I hadn’t studied well and I was desperate. I wished , truly wished  that time would stop so I could review everything. My chest felt heavy, time was running out, and the bell was about to ring.
Then the teacher walked toward me to collect my paper. I looked into her eyes… and I knew I was going to fail. I raised my paper to hand it in, she reached out  and suddenly… she froze.
At first, I didn’t understand. I looked around  everyone was frozen. I thought I was dreaming, but after screaming, jumping, and doing the most absurd things… I realized this was real.
So I took my chance. I completed the exam calmly, knowing I could get a perfect score. And as soon as I felt relief… time resumed, just like nothing had happened.
From that day on, every time I was in trouble, time would freeze , protecting me.
Until the day… it didn’t.
That day, I felt a tightness in my chest again but there was no danger. It was a memory. A painful one from my childhood. And when time froze… it never unfroze.
Now I’m stuck in a frozen world. I know this isn’t just about me anymore. I must fix what’s broken inside  or open a time rift that could destroy the world",7
1ln5gqz,n0hml2a,"When the news broke that an asteroid was headed toward Earth, my first thought was “Oh no”, but not for myself. No, it was instead knowing what was going to happen. Just before the asteroid was about to make contact everything froze thanks to my little quirk. You see, every time that I’ve been close to dying time has just… frozen. And here we are, with the ultimate time freeze.

Time has lost all sense of meaning. Days, weeks, years, perhaps even decades have gone past all without any change, not even my age. The first time that I saw birds flying still it was surreal, but now it’s just commonplace. I’ve traveled the world, read thousands of books, and I’m pretty sure I have the Guinness World Record for the longest meditation session, all trying to think of a way to end my time here. I’ve tried everything you can think of but nothing works and so I’m left sitting on the third rock from the sun waiting for an end that will never come.",7
1ln5gqz,n0i43em,"How long has it been, since time was normal? Since minutes became hours, hours became days, and days became weeks? How long has it been, since I heard anyone's voice, or laughter? Since the birds chirped? 

There was a neighbor of mine. She had this annoying dog that would never stop barking. I told her it was her own fault. She shouldn't leave the dog out so long.   
  
I miss that bark now. 

I miss everything that used to annoy me. The way my dad would make me disgusting cupcakes, insisting they were my favorite. They were cloyingly sweet and just thinking about them gives me a toothache. I'd tell my dad I'm not a fan of those cupcakes anymore and to stop bringing them over. I haven't liked them since I was a little girl. He'd laugh about it, then bring them over again the next time. After time froze, I saw him. He was on his way over to my house, carrying that same box of fucking cupcakes. How I wish I could have eaten them.

I miss the way my husband would sing. He would shout songs at the top of his lungs, with no regard for rhythm or tone. And he'd frequently get the words wrong. Ordinarily, I'd find it endearing, but one day, I had a headache. I told him his singing was annoying. He was devastated. That was just a few days before time froze. I had written him an apology and was going to grovel for him to sing again. I didn't know that day would be the last time I'd ever hear him sing.

Our daughter used to ramble on and on about some girl she liked. I was supportive of her love, but that day, I was tired of hearing the same old thing she'd told me before. She stopped mid rant and asked me if she was boring me. What was I supposed to do? Lie? But I learned my lesson with her father, so I said nothing. I wish now that I had told her to go on. Keep talking. I may not be emotionally invested in that particular topic, but I want to hear everything I can about her life, because I love her. 

When time froze, I ran. I thought I could get out of the way quickly and everything would be normal. There were no sirens. No signs of a world-ending cataclysm. Yet, I've been all around the world since time froze. Whatever is happening, there is nowhere on the planet that's safe for me. So either this is an apocalypse, or someone is pursuing me. 

It makes sense that if I have this power, someone else might have an equivalent one. I've made my peace and stopped running. Sitting atop a hill near what used to be my house, under a tree. I will wait, and meditate. If someone is using their power to pursue me, then I have made an opening for them. I hope I am being pursued, honestly. 

If not, then that means that I have to take my life by my own hand. And that will be brutal and slow. I'm not entirely sure I won't become frozen in time when I try to do it. 

The conclusion either way is inescapable. I must die. Even if it means the world will end, and everyone will die, it is a kinder fate than letting the world go on like this. I told my family I love them more times than I can count since the world froze. I just wish, just once, they could have heard me say it.",7
1ln5gqz,n0fgotn,"By the time the world restarted, she was already blocks away. She heard the engines, the sirens, saw the smoke billowing up over the university gate.



Three faculty were hospitalized. A guard didn’t make it.



She told herself there was nothing she could have done. That the moment she stepped into the corridor, she’d made the only choice available to her. Still, for years afterward, she avoided that side of the building.



She was a scientist and she had considered these events, of course, but answers ran like water through her fingers, and as time distanced her, she began to believe she had fooled herself as a child, and suffered a trauma-induced break when the fire hit and she’d had to escape.



But when it happened a third time, Mira stopped looking for explanations that fit.



She was walking across campus, late for a department meeting, when time stopped. She noticed first the stillness in the trees. There was no motion in the gulmohar leaves, no rustle in the bamboo at the edge of the path. The afternoon monsoon had been building all morning, and the first few drops had started to fall. One landed squarely on her arm and slid down, cool and real. But around her, the rain had suspended mid-air. Droplets hung like glass beads between branches.



A black and somewhat ragged looking crow on a telephone wire had its wings half-lifted, caught like a photograph in the moment before flight.



Inside her office, the lights were dead. But nevertheless, she moved to her desk, and to her surprise, her laptop came to life as she opened it. A paper she’d been peer-reviewing blinked back onto the screen. The cursor moved only when she watched it. Chrome opened sluggishly. One news article, cached just before the freeze, still loaded: an article she’d read about the approaching asteroid; 1998 KX27.  This had been on a near-Earth trajectory for a little while and even hit some pockets of the general public’s awareness. Impact probability was low, but not zero.



She read the article again.  The phrase *margin of error* jumped out, thrice. The time of closest approach: 12:41 p.m. UTC. That was the last timestamp she could find anywhere.",16
1ln5gqz,n0fgrt1,"The university was silent. The city, from the rooftop, even more so. She saw kites suspended high above the cricket grounds, their wings open but unmoving. A cyclist at the edge of the gate was tilted slightly forward, stuck mid-pedal.

She walked home.  It took nearly two hours through what felt like a nightmarish dystopia.  Her feet didn’t hurt as they should, and she wasn’t hungry or thirsty.  Her partner was there in the house, mid-sentence on his phone, holding a cup of tea in his other hand, that he must have been about to set down.

Mira didn’t linger.  She drank a glass of water (poured sluggishly from a water bottle in the darkened refrigerator), and she forced herself to eat half a chapati with some pickle, cold and stiff from the tin on the counter. It wasn’t hunger exactly, more of a way to convince herself of some sort of normality.  Perhaps it was her instincts kicking in – she was clearly using energy, so she had to put some back in.

The urge to stay, to speak to him, to hold him, was overwhelming. But she knew it was futile. Worse, it might interfere. Time flowed around her, but did not wake people up.  So what might that be doing to them?

Looking at him, so familiar, so unnaturally still, she told herself that love didn’t mean clinging. He would want her to solve this.

Presence could take the form of stillness. He was here, untouched by fear or pain, suspended in the same mystery as everything else. Wanting more from him in this moment would only be a form of resistance to the work she had to do.

She left.

The next days blurred together. In some places, the power worked. In others, it didn’t. Elevators refused her; a bicycle she found in a bike rack unlocked its wheels when she focused on it. Her watch had stopped, but the time on her phone advanced in irregular intervals, as if responding to her attention. Her phone did not appear to require charging but she plugged it into the wall nevertheless. When she ate, the food became pliable. Her appetite was small, but sometimes sharp. Sleep, when it came, was shallow and precise. Days passed, she thought.  She began to feel she was pulling reality behind her like a thread, weaving a path of motion through a fabric that no longer moved.

She avoided people. Not out of fear, but out of a blend of caution and compassion that made it hard for her to look at them. She didn’t want to discover what her passage might do to them. She wasn’t interested in this miracles anymore. Only in causes, effects, solutions.  She was aware that her brain was churning away, almost unnaturally constant, whether her conscious thread of thought was on The Freeze or not, she knew she was working away on it.

She based herself in her faculty office. For a long time, she stayed there, and read pages on the internet, and she went out and observed. She became almost preternaturally attuned to which parts of the web would respond to her and what to look for in her reading.

Outside rain fell only when she passed. Dust moved where she walked but clung to untouched surfaces elsewhere. A low-flying bird hung in midair until she drew close, then fell gently to rest. A neem tree, mid-sway, paused at a diagonal, until she touched its bark and felt the weight of it shift.

She thought about the asteroid again. About the line in the article: low probability. Uncertain trajectory. She thought about superpositions, about wave functions, about how a system does not resolve until it is measured.

Maybe, she reasoned, nothing had happened yet. No impact. No miss. Not until someone looked.

And she was the only one left who could.





\[PART TWO if wanted, but the length already started to get away from me\]",22
1lnrn42,n0ikywa,"When Louis moved to this rural fishing town full of supernatural entities, a strange door in the kitchen was the least of his worries. It wasn't in the floor plan, but at least it didn't make weird noises and stayed shut.

There were far more important things, like putting food on an altar for the perpetually hungry local deity. Remembering to plug his ears lest the sirens by the sea lure him to a watery death. Bowing before the Kappas on the way to work. Stuff like carrying a protective ward against Shoggoths and ghoul repellant. And most of all, staying alive. Also, not becoming food, a mind-controlled meatsuit or a source of brain Slurpee to the eldritch inhabitants.

Until one night, a banshee's cry woke up him in the middle of the night. Yes, he understood from his time in Innsmouth that she meant well, warning someone in town of an impending death. But couldn't she do it during the waking hours, or to tone it down so only related people hear her?

Unable to go back to sleep, Louis wandered down to his kitchen to grab a snack. Except his fridge was already open. And so was that strange kitchen door, for the first time.

""Who's there?"" He grabbed the nearest lamp and waved it like a battlehammer.

""You forgot your offering on my altar today,"" the pale entity peeked its head out from the fridge. It was talking with one mouth and eating a whole pizza with another. ""So, I had to come in through this pre-installed portal door and eat.""

Louis rolled his eyes and lowered his lamp. ""At this time?""

""I'm always hungry.""

""You're the worst god I know. What deity raids the fridge of a human living in its territory?""

""Hey, at least I do keep your protected and alive,"" the eldritch horror somehow managed a pout despite swallowing an entire fruit basket, basket and ribbons included. ""Neither do I demand human sacrifice nor oppressive conditions. I will have you know Lord Elvari here is a top-rated friendly neighbourhood eldritch on Yelp. Wait, aren't you here to also have a snack at 3am? Then, I did nothing wrong.""

""That's my fridge,"" Louis bemoaned. ""My food.""

""In my territory,"" Elvari argued back.

""Fine, whatever,"" the human put the lamp back down and approached the fridge. ""Then leave some for me. At least—""

""Sorry,"" the tentacled deity apologized, but not before shoving the last box of lasagna into its mouth to leave the fridge barren. ""Send me the receipts and I'll pay you back for the food. Minus what tribute was owed to me in the first place.""

""Can I also ask that you get rid of your portal door?"" Louis pointed at the door, which now had a portal swirling in the middle. ""Knock and come in like a normal person?""

""But I am an eldritch deity. I am no normal person,"" Elvari scowled while a few tentacles started licking spilled ketchup and barbecue sauce in the fridge and the floor. ""I do not knock and open a door and step inside like a mortal plebian. Oh well, next time, I'll phase through the wall, or float through your window.""

""Don't—""

Louis was too late to stop that voracious local deity from disappearing through his ceiling. And too late to mention that he never had the habit of keeping receipts when ordering takeout.

1lnlrz0,n0hbh99,"God had, if nothing else, a sense of humor. 

Every time a new angel sprouted its wings, the angels that made up the orientation force took it upon themselves to paint an accurate picture of what was to come.

""God is, ummm, how shall I say this?"" Orion, the newest member of the orientation still found this to be an odd conversation. ""God is... at times prone to fits of unseriousness that you would not expect someone of her stature to indulge in.

The new angel would, inevitably, tilt their head in silent questioning. How could God be anything less than she was supposed to be? What could possibly be so surprising about her as to require the other angels to voice warnings of her nature? 

""Blasphemy!"" The more righteous among the new angels would cry. ""Even in our status we are lowly next to her.""

The orientation force would simply smile and nod. It never took more that three audiences with God for a new angel to see what they were talking about.

To Orion's relief, this new angel, Esmerelda,  was not the type to claim to know better than her mentors. She merely adopted a quizzical look, weighing her surprise at receiving this information with curiosity about what could possibly be reducing her mentor to such a nervous state.  Never the type to speak in excess, or much at all, she merely nodded and waited for what came next. Sensing this, Orion continued.

""I'm of the belief that experiencing something first hand is the best way to learn. Some of the angels think that the discipline of relentless study is the only way to prepare for your first audience with God to receive your first angelic duty. I'm more new age, personally, so I hope you don't find it too frightening that I will be taking you before God on your first day.""

""I, too, prefer to learn through manners as practical as what you suggest,"" Esmerelda said with an easy smile. Ironically, Orion got the feeling that she was putting him at ease better than he ever could her. He could not help but be particularly inquisitive about how she would react to God. The rumor was that She was in one of her moods today, Esmerelda was likely to find out in her first audience what Orion had warned her about.

As Orion and Esmerelda floated up towards the Celestial Throne, God's booming laughter came as thunder cracking through the clouds. The rumors, Orion thought to himself do indeed appear to be true. As they finished their ascent and landed softly upon the wispy ground that stretched before the throne, they saw God before them doubled over in fits of laughter.

""Oh, do tell me once more!"" She roared as the angel before her, one of the most senior among them, wore a face that fought to remain reverent despite the annoyance radiating from him. 

""The humans, they have an unseemly sort of reflex that cheapens their dignity in death,"" he repeated. 

""Come now, speak plainly!"" God insisted. It was upon this insistence that she noticed Orion and Esmerelda approaching her. ""We have new guests in our midst, Edmond, I implore you to catch them up to speed.""

""The humans,"" Edmond, known for being one of the more prudish of the angels, could not help but pinch the bridge of his nose as he spoke. ""Have been found to have a tendency to... relieve themselves upon death. Whatever lingers within them must expel itself as their bodies lose the ability to maintain the rigidity that regulates them.""",20
1lnlrz0,n0hbhy7,"""THEY SHIT THEMSELVES, EDMOND!"" God's laughter shook drops of rain from the clouds her throne rested upon. Orion felt Esmerelda tense up beside him, a relatively minor reaction compared to some of the other new angels. 

""Yes, yes, they do indeed do... that,"" Edmond conceded. ""And while it is always my privilege to be the source of anything that brings God pleasure, I come before you ultimately because the angels have heard prayer from the humans to be spared such final displays in their humanly form.

""Woah, woah, woah,"" God waved her hands in front of her. ""Stop right there, you want me to make that stop happening?""

""The humans want that,"" Edmond replied. ""I am no more than the vehicle from their prayers to your ears.""

""This guy,"" God turned her attention back towards Orion and Esmerelda as she pointed a thumb at Edmond. ""Tell me, Esmerelda, is it the heavenly thing for to me interfere with the parameters of evolution I have cast down upon Earth? Or, shall I allow absurdity and its inevitability to carry on as it has already seen fit?""

""Ummm,"" Esmerelda, clearly surprised to be referred to by name as a new angel, found herself at a loss for words. To be asked such a question by God, one that so directly impacts the humans, felt to be a scenario that she was centuries away from being qualified to answer. ""Forgive me, God, for I speak as the newest of your angels. But, is it not for us to protect those below?""

""Esme, Esme, can I call you Esme?"" God didn't wait for an answer before continuing. ""You will find that the responsibility of mothering universes can become dull. It is so much assuaging of the fears of creatures with lesser minds than us that there is reason behind everything, that there is comfort amidst the hardships of existence. When they call out to me, it is in seriousness almost always. You'd think that, as creatures who claim to love me so, they'd be considerate enough as to throw a joke up my way.""

""If I may,"" Edmond chimed in. ""There are jokes that we may all share in good humor and then there are misfortunes that we, so far removed from, may revel in at the expense of those subjected to said misfortunes.""

""Oh, for the love of Me, Edmond, you are such a spoil sport. I've had enough,"" God snapped her fingers and Edmond disappeared, dismissed and sent back to the halls of the angels. She turned her attention back towards Orion and Esmerelda, who still stood before her in silence. ""You two, you are dismissed. And when you return to your halls let it be known amongst all angels that I am decided in my decision. The humans shall continue as they are, and the only thing at the end of any further requests to alter this is my wrath.""

And so, once again, God snapped her fingers, sending Orion and Esmerelda in an instantaneous flash to the halls they'd begun their meeting in. 

""I see what you mean,"" Esmerelda said after a moment of standing in silence. ""And could not be more grateful for the warning.""",21

""Have you tried Life Detection?"" he asks.

1lnd9jv,n0epd2o,"Dr. Kell Rimoran sighed. After over five years of teaching, he had learned that the most reliable thing in the universe was this: it was impossible to overestimate how incompetent undergraduate students could be. He'd thought he'd seen the worst of it when Linda Bramwell had accidentally deleted the entire data archives with an inconveniently placed 'rm -rf' command (thankfully, there were data backups available), but if Rupert Lindell had *truly* managed to lose Vegraturn III, well, that would really take the cake.

If he had believed in a higher power, he would have prayed for patience. Instead, he sighed again and walked over to Rupert's desk. 

Rupert was a junior pre-med student who had decided to do some research to set himself apart from the rest of those eager-eyed, promising young intellects vying to become the nation's future doctors. He looked up in panic at Kell.

""I swear, I wrote down the coordinates yesterday, and today...it's simply not there!""

Kell suppressed the urge to roll his eyes. ""I'm sure you did, Rupert. Did you double check your math?""

""I did!"" 

The research of Dr. Janice Livingston, famed mathematician, had revealed one incontrovertible truth of the world: if people double-checked their work before crying wolf, nine times out of ten, the problem would be fixed.

Unfortunately, this time, the problem that Rupert was facing fell squarely into the 10%. 

Kell furrowed his brow as he stared at the calculations. The numbers swam back and forth in his vision. 

He looked at the numbers.

He looked at the telescope.

He looked back at the numbers.

Rupert was right. Vegraturn III *should* be right *there*, and it simply...wasn't.

A chill crept up Kell's spine. The latest issue in *Galaxies Weekly* had an article about planets disappearing. Kell had written it up to sensationalist slop - ever since the magazine had decided to cater more towards the general public, the quality had substantially dropped. All the *serious* scientists knew that *Galaxies Bi-Weekly* was where the actually peer-reviewed, high-quality work was published.

But now, Kell found it difficult to refute the evidence he was seeing with his own two eyes.

He shuddered with a sudden frisson of fear. Who was to say that Earth wouldn't be next?",11
1lnd9jv,n0exxwq,"“It—It was right there, I’m certain!” Kara exclaimed, looking over at the captain of the Star’s Embrace. She ran a hand through her hair, pacing back and forth in front of her console as her eyes flicked between readouts.

“Well,” Captain Reed started, wearing a bemused expression, “clearly it wasn’t right there. Was it. I knew we shouldn’t have done that software upgrade; it always makes things go wonky.”

Kara, however, shook her head, casting a glance around the bridge to see if anyone else was as worried as she was. As worried as they *should* be.

“Sir… I’ve seen the software glitch before, and this isn’t that. Here, I’m accessing the FTL Communication Drive to access the registry. But… I’m certain that the planet should be right in our viewport.”  
  
Captain Reed turned to glance out the viewport while his Navigations Officer fussed with her console. The poor woman needed a vacation; maybe he’d dock back at Venus instead of Earth on their way home. That way, she could go cloud-surfing at one of those fancy resorts for a while during the “repairs.” Kara was stars-damned good at her job, but she had a tendency to get overstressed. Even still, this kind of mistake wasn’t common for her.

That thought troubled the captain, and he strode to the viewport, squinting his eyes into the dark void of space beyond. He often found that Kara and the others were over-reliant on their fancy gadgets and gizmos. Sometimes, the best way to find the problem was to take a look around with one’s own two eyes.

Sadly, as Kara mentioned, there was no planet in the viewport nor any indication that it had ever been here. However, as the Star’s Embrace approached where the planet should be, he felt an odd shift move its way through the vessel. Captain Reed frowned; it was almost as if… as if there was still a gravitational pull where the planet should be. He’d flown this ship for over twenty years now, and he knew what it felt like when gravity started to assert control.

Squinting his eyes at the viewport, he called an order more on instinct than anything else. “Tian, what are we reading from the external sensors. Any gravitational anomalies.”

The small, thin man towards the back of the room shook his head. “No sir, it’s as Kara said; everything is reading as if there’s still a planet right in front of us.”

A gravitational pull where there used to be a planet, a lack of any visible indication in the blackness of space… a chill ran down the captain’s spine, and he pressed his hand against the cold glass of the viewport. There, just before him… there was a slight warping of light. A small distortion from where the light of a distant star was bent into a circle. A blackhole… 

“Full thrusters reverse!” Captain Reed snapped, his jaw clenching. “Kara, anything from Earth?!”

“I… I-I can’t reach them, sir,” the young woman stuttered. “Or Mars, or Venus, or Mercury.” There was icy terror in Kara’s voice that had the captain whirling toward her.

“What do you mean?! The drive is broken?!” he demanded, not angry but panicked.

Slowly, Kara shook her head and took a steadying breath of filtered and re-filtered air. “No… the messages are going out just fine. They just aren’t responding.”

Stunned silence settled over the bridge like an oppressive blanket. No one knew what was happening, but as Captain Reed stared once more out into the void of space, he wondered if anything else was out there but icy cold.",9
1lnd9jv,n0f55x7,"""You lost it? How can you have lost it? It's a planet with 5 moons!""

Of course my manager was pissed. I just mumbled some apologetic shit, but I also didn't really know. What was I supposed to do? Like, yeah, these planets are hard to get. Sure, there's no return offer on my internship, but like, now what? Am I fired or something?

My manager somehow calmed down a little. ""It's not like you can just leave it at home or something."" He seemed ready to rebound into his rage, but somehow was staying calm. ""I guess may be we can try to-""

""Find it?"" Reiko interrupted. I was too busy being scolded at to realize that she snuck up on us. Good thing too, honestly -- if I saw her I'd have gotten too distracted. She's definitely out of my league, but sometimes I dream. She also seems to like mentoring me when she has the time, but I feel like she's kind of experimenting by teaching me.

""Reiko, can you-"" She nodded. ""But you're not too busy with the star system you have to-""

""It'll be fine. I got some trackers pinned on it, and even have Xiaohei looking at it as a part of his routine checks.""

""Oh, Xiaohei can track it now?""

""Long story. I did get to push new systems onto the trackers."" She smiled. With a lazy left hand she beckoned for me to follow. My manager nodded as I dared to meet his eyes, hoping for freedom.

Reiko dropped off the satchel that was hanging off her shoulder and looked up to see me. ""We'll head to your desk -- your station will have all the answers."" From somewhere in the satchel, she pulled out a coffee, and started to head to my desk.

""Y'know,"" she began to confide, ""this isn't too rare. Like, I think I've lost a few planets over time.""

""Really?"" This was a relief.

""Yeah, happens to everybody at least once. Don't t'cha worry 'bout it."" I swallowed. She's too reassuring. ""But well, you gotta learn from the mistake, right?"" Reiko looked over the station. ""Aite, you ain't gonna learn if you don't type.""

I put my hands on the controls. ""So, um-""

""Well, where'd you last leave it? And what's the predicted spot?"" I flicked some controls. She looked at me patiently enough, though I'm sure her mind drifted. ""Also, you know what, how off were the predictions from yesterday?""",7
1lnd9jv,n0exzid,"The war to exterminate humanity was fought and won in a single moment, with the species never knowing what had wiped them out. Between one second and the next, every habitable planet within a hundred light-years of Earth had its mass compressed to such a degree that a blackhole was formed — instantly wiping out any life. The only remnants of the once-thriving people were ships of distraught crews littered between once-beautiful planets. Now… only darkness remained. 

The universe was a dark forest, and humanity had caught the attention of a hunter. A hunter that decided to shoot first.",6
1lnd9jv,n0f5a1x,"""Hmm,"" I flicked on some controls and I was about to hide some data, ""keep that on there,"" she cut in. So I looked at the cluttered set of 4 30 column tables of predicted positions and angular moments. She made some noises in thought. Some sort of ""hmm,"" as if a CPU fan were cooling her down. I was too nervous to really let that train of thought move any further. ""Differentials?"" I started typing. ""Also, normalize for star movement and revolution?"" More clicks. ""There."" I didn't know what she saw, but I was already impressed. ""Right, right, so we have. Hmm. Can we do the same with day before's? Like, just get the diff from the two days.""

""Consecutive days?"" I asked.

""Hmm. Actually, no, just from last position vs 24 hrs ago vs 48 hrs ago.""

""Oh. Hmm."" I did that. Thankfully I learned to use these stations at school, but I hadn't yet gotten so used to them that these were all just muscle memory.

""Ah, you know that macro. Neat. They teach you in school?""

""Uh. Um, yeah, that one they did at some point.""

She smiled wryly. ""I'm glad I added it."" I'm glad I wasn't looking at her or drinking or really holding anything.

""You did?"" I somehow choked on the words.

""Yeah, a couple years ago. But we all figured it out here, I just took it up with the station guys so we could get it into the standard. Wasn't really secret sauce or anything.""

""I-uh. Thanks."" She smiled.

""Welp, do you see the pattern?""

""No I-"" I wasn't really seeing much, still dazed from how cool Reiko was. She was like living my dream. I wanted to become her.

""So, look -- the 24hr and 48hr are off by the same, right? So that means, something weird actually happened yesterday.""

""Oh. Huh."" I sounded dumb because I felt dumb.

""Do you know about how foreign objects in and around this system work?"" I nodded a no. ""Well, it's only been a few weeks.""

At this point my manager showed up at my desk. ""Reiko, I can't have you be this distracted..."" He trailed off vaguely.

""I got it Sebs. I'll look at the star in five minutes. The kid's just probably lost it because of an asteroid interruption or something. I'm sure if we do some wide scanning near the predicted region we'll find it.""

""Oh, he didn't do the foreign object audit?""

""I guess not. Did we tell him to?""

""Well, we'll do better next time. Brandon,"" I looked up, ""you're going to get to see the wide area scanners today."" Reiko clasped her hands. ""Sorry, Reiko, I don't think you have the time to show him it?""

She pouted. ""I guess not. I need to test a patch, but that scanner's already focused, so he'll need a different one."" There was a pause. ""Actually, Sebastian, can I patch the scanner he gets too?""

""Oh, you can get another test?"" She nodded. ""Alright, in that case, sure. Focus on your test right now, and may be he can prepare the scanner.""

""I'll bring my portable here. Kid, may be you can apply my patch.""

I smiled. Somehow, it was looking like a day learning from Reiko.",5
1lne2oc,n0etb0e,"""You have to stop this, the trapper's guild is getting suspicious."" Kathrine still had trouble with draconic. The language was mostly growls and snaps, it really did a number on her throat. Still it had been quite useful to learn it. 



The large beast looked down at her and then lowered its head to her level. 



""I apologize, but I have news which can't wait."" the dragon growled back, it's voice resonating through the cave. 



""You're going to have to mark me."" mused the princess with a wince, ""And probably kill a few of the trappers and look injured. And then we need to find a less conspicuous way to communicate. There's already a rumor in the court that we have an ... inappropriate relationship."" 



""Anyone I should kill?"" it's not easy to detect emotion in the dragon but everything Kathrine's learned of the beast suggests the question is purely practical. 



""No. I have a list of names I'll have them executed once we're done."" she waves it away. ""Anyway, what was so important.""



""I spoke to she of the ruby hair and the smell of pines"" that would be princess Jessica VonWilmen, dragons weren't good with names. Kathrine herself was 'she of the golden hair who walks like the wind' - she quite liked that. ""She has accepted your terms and intends to move forward with the plan.""



""That is good news."" muses Kathrine, she'd been expecting negotiations to take months. ""When can she be ready?""



""I judge she is poisoning her father's meal as we speak"" says the dragon 



""She's moving that quickly?""



""Is that a problem.""



""No... My father is easy. My brother is away to the east but I have loyal men stationed with him who know what to do. I have support of at least half the court and the kill list is ready."" she stops, takes a breath and thinks. She goes over the list of supporters and enemies, where they all are, who she has around them, instructions have been given for most. That leaves a few barons and a duke unaccounted for. She didn't like that, a little messy. But then that's what she has a dragon for. ""There are a few you will have to take care of.""",26
1lne2oc,n0eipk1,"I shiver, but steel my resolve.  
The dragon raises its head, and stares at me.  
""So, you are the Witch that desires an interview?"" it asks.  
I nod.  
""I am Azelina GreenLeaf, from the Elven Empire, Stars' Embrace.  
I wonder if I may be bold to ask for you, great dragon, to take on a humanoid form, so that this can be a calmer interview?"" I ask.  
The dragon stares at me, and nods.

  
A moment later, I am sitting at a golden table, drinking fresh Star Water, with a gorgeous woman sitting across of me.  
""Been some time since I took on a human form.  
So, witch, ask thy questions."" she says, drinking.  
Maybe she was the wrong person to ask...doesn't matter!  
I have to ask.  
""So, my main reason for coming today is to ask of you: why are dragons kidnapping princesses so often?  
I would understand if they were the heirs, or only child, but often times they are the 9th or 20th princess."" I ask.  
She smiles.

  
""Because of sending a message, seeking wealth without burning the bridges completely, for fun, for love, and yeah, I guess these kind of cover every reason.  
I personally also kidnapped a few princesses in my lifetime.   
2 became my wives, and the rest were either voluntarily kidnapped, or to teach a lesson to haughty kingdoms."" she says.  
I write it all down.  
""I see. I see.   
So, by sending a message, you are saying the ability of dragons to easily kidnap a princess from the palace itself.  
Seeking wealth is basically ransom, and by not kidnapping the heir it is not a complete attack on the lifeline of the kingdom."" I say.  
The dragon nods, then I...frown.

  
""Fun? Love?  
I can see Love, and I can see how sometimes princess voluntarily ask to be kidnapped, to escape from their parents...  
But fun?"" I ask.  
She shrugs.  
""We live a long life, and are among the strongest beings naturally.  
Sometimes, having an army come after us, or strong knights, and professionals, like mages, wizards and so on, is our way of having fun.  
Playing the villain is fun, we allow ourselves to be defeated, and simply shift away to another lair."" she says.  
I write it down.  
This will be the best article I have ever written! An age old question finally answered.  
""Now...for my payment...elf..."" she suddenly says, staring me down, winking.  
I blush.  
Oh boy...for journalism!",15
1lne2oc,n0etbu9,"The dragon nods, it's a strangely human gesture and Kathrine is aware he's doing it for her benefit. 



""There is one final matter."" says the beast. He opens one clawed hand and inside is a sheep's skin. Scorched onto it are small delicate letters and on the other side a large angular script. Kathrine is a little taken aback. ""A contract for the service, and my price.""



""We have this all agreed."" she says reading the thing carefully. ""I wasn't aware that your kind took stock in such things. Do you not trust my word?""



""You are about to instigate a coup against your own blood. I feel... better for having clear terms."" the dragon keeps it's voice low, a sign of politeness. 



""Very well. I will honor my word, this mountain will be your realm if I need to sign to that effect it is no problem."" she puts her finger to the sheep skin. Her thumb print burns into it. It hurts, but that's the price of succession. 



""Good. Then how many of the trappers should I kill?""



""What? Oh that. No point in putting on a show any more. Kill them all then take me back to the palace. It's time for my coronation.""",25
1lnemdl,n0gz8w2,"I still remember the moment when I walked in to the bedroom. It's hard to describe all of the emotions and the things that happened after that first moment of realization, but that moment is forever seared in my brain. I can picture the curtains, tell you what time the clock on the dresser said, or what color top she had on. I can't un-remember it, that crystal clear snapshot will always be there in my brain.

I also remember the blood. There was a lot of it, so it was hard to miss.

""What the- Maria!""

I knew a split-second later what had happened, and why. It was the Triads. They couldn't get to me, so they got to her.

Like I said, I felt a whole range of emotions right then. But I do seem to remember that anger was at the top of the list. Don't get me wrong, grief and desperation were near the top of the list, too, but still, anger won out.

And that's why I cursed and invoked the demon.

-- -- -- -- --

""Mortal. Why do you summon me?""

""Kill my enemies.""

""What would you offer in return?""""

""Whatever you want. Kill them.""

""Anything? You know who I am, and you would still offer me that as a trade?""

""Yes, Trickster. I want them dead.""

""For her?""

""Yes.""

""You loved her?""

""More than anything.""

""There will be a catch.""

""I don't care. Do it.""

""As you wish,"" it said with a grin.

-- -- -- -- --

I took a moment, trying to figure if I really wanted to go through with this. This was another level of escalation, and it felt like a point of no return. There could be no peace after this.

I closed my eyes, and remembered the curtains, the clock, and her top. Then, I saw the blood in my mind's eye, and I knew my decision. I took a deep breath, and fingered the ring in my pocket.

""OH MOTHER OF CALAMITY, DESCEND UPON THE EARTH AND GRANT ME MY TRUE WISH!""

The sky split, and shadows began to twist in unnatural angles. I knew it was coming, but the violence and cold surprised me nevertheless.

And from the void, she arrived.

""A mortal dares summon me? Very well–speak your wish.""

""I wish for you to be my wife.""

Her eyes narrowed, knowing that something was afoot. She might enjoy chaos, but she was no fool. She was a deity, after all.

""Why?""

""I am ... cursed.""

""Ah, so that's the stench around you.""

I said nothing, waiting to hear her answer.

""Who cursed you?""

""The Trickster.""

This time, I saw her hesitate. That name meant something, even to her. His curse was not something to be trifled with.

""And you seek me out on top of that? What game are you playing at, mortal?""

""The curse was his fee for killing my wife's murderers,"" I began, ""So he thought it funny to ruin all my future relationships. Should I marry, I will amplify the worst of my wife's traits.""

I saw her weighing the implications of my words.

""He had meant it to increase anger or jealousy, to make any marriage of mine impossible.""

""A cruel curse,"" she admitted.

""But you *like* your worst attribute.""

""You dare?!""

""You are the Mother of Calamity. You like chaos, do you not?""

She stared at me, her silence agreeing with my claim even if her words and facial expression did not.

""How would you like to create even more chaos? I have enemies yet, and their punishment is not done.""

""The Trickster would not appreciate his curse being misused like that.""

""He started it.""

This time, the corners of her mouth turned up just a tad. It was the slightest of smiles, but I recognized it for what it was: my opportunity.

""Mother of Calamity, do you take me as your wedded husband?"" I asked as I extended the ring out.

""I do.""",14
1lnhlaq,n0fffpv,"I read ""History of Familiars"" as my familiar is sleeping in the corner.
He is right now a puppy, a 3-headed puppy.
I just awakened him, and I am confused.
Familiars usually take 2 forms: an animal one, whether mundane or mythical and a 2nd form thst can take on the form of my focus.
Problem is...
My focus is special, and I worry if Atlas takes on that form it may hurt his essence.
So I study.


It had to break out now...goddamn war.
And I had to be at the right age to be enrolled.
War Mage, good prospects my ass...
I look at Atlas...in 6 months he grew to the size of a car, his 3 heads smiling at me.
""Shrink."" I say to him, and he jumps on my shoulder.
We left for the battlefield, and I hoped that I can deal with the enemy without using my focus.
The image I focus to draw my magic is...
Dangerous.


Goddamn greedy bastards!
They really told the enemy where I am, so that my family loses an aspiring mage?
I look at the 12 incoming mages.
I killed enough of their people, to know they are the elite of the enemy country.
I look at Atlas.
""Good boy...transform."" I say, as I focus, taking out ny staff.
Atlas howls, and his shape changes.
Just as the 12 mages arrive...they freeze.



I look above me, and smile, feeling Atlas' emotions.
He is alright.
Above me a sky appeared with 9 bright suns.
""Fireball."" I mutter, as 9 fireballs the size of houses blasted towards the enemy.
The battle was short but wild.
My spells, enhanced by Atlas' 2nd form burned them to ashed.
""Atlas."" I say, as the suns disappear and back comes Atlas...this time, with 4 heads.
""You grew my boy! Good boy!"" I laugh as he tackles me.
It seems I can freelt use the 2nd form of the familiar...this is how he will grow.
It seem that the war didn't come at the wrong time...no.
It is the perfect time to allow me, a young mage, to catch up.",7
1lnb0c6,n0ed3yx,"My creations have deviated from the Path I laid out for them. Instead of seeking enlightenment, they sought worldly pleasures. They faltered in their prayers. Their devotion.

So I warned them. I sent them an ill omen of doom. That if they do not atone, I would wipe this world clean and start anew again. But without them.

If they wanted to live, to regain my favor, they needed to offer a sacrifice. All I asked for was one. One willing volunteer to give his life for the greater good.

They delivered. Not one, not a hundred. Millions came to me. After spending their lives chasing fame and wealth and fortune, spending over half of their waking hours working for temporary things that didn't last, they wanted out.

They wanted paradise.

Which was not for me to deliver. All along, I had hoped they would follow the Path to achieve it themselves. It wasn't candy that I could hand out on a whim whenever I felt like it.

And sacrifice was supposed to mean something. It was the ultimate gift, to give your life to your god. Not an easy way out of suffering after they chose to stray. They had devalued sacrifice.

I could not accept such sacrifices.

They would remain dead. There would not be a glorious afterlife waiting for them. Only hell.",21
1ln9wh3,n0dvmlm,"The kaleidoscope of warmth that was bliss being stripped away washed over the soul and the all to familiar pain that was the absence of perfection burned them.

The promised eternity of happiness simply refused to remain eternal when the damnable mortal anchor was yanked upon.

He remembered himself then. When sunlight poured through the window and he looked down at his wispy form. 

He had been Thom Bolling. 

Thom Bolling of the second family. A royal branch of much repute. Formerly of much repute. Waning repute in the latter days of the twelfth cycle.

Business thrice finished had been un-finished for a fourth time. 

What was it this time? 

They had found the letter exposing the real villains, solid and indisputable. How could that have gone awry?

The warmth had gone completely away and he only felt a burning now. Thom pushed toward the burning feeling and in an instant he was in a room.

He recognized it. His lawyers office.

Where was the paper?

Allowing the burning sensation to guide him he moved through the walls from one room to the next before coming to rest in a disorganized file room.

He could see the corner of it, the slip of paper that was the final piece of evidence clearing his family of that nasty bit of regicide had been misplaced.

Again. 

More memories came back and heaven slipped a further away. It burned. The sadness of his death, the impending doom of his loved ones. 

In eternity it all was trivial. In the mortal realm, even as a specter, it madended him.

In the end, nearly all would find the blissful eternity. He felt the pull of it at him and Thom shut it down. Eternity could wait.

With the practiced focus of having been a ghost multiple times, the presence of Thom Bolling pressed against the slip of paper.

It flattened against the wall.

Slowly he pushed it. Over several minutes he moved it until it fell loose to the floor. 

The note floated lazily without his help to the center of the floor. 

Even knowing that there wasn't really an almighty, Thom still thanked the nonexistent figure for that little bit of help. 

Drifting through the door Thom found the hapless family lawyer asleep on a couch in the next room.  A dozen attempted flicks gained him two connections against the mans earlobe with the second one waking him.

As the man blinked away sleep, the ghost of Thim Bolling moved to the other side of the door. His imagined heart pumping imagined blood quickly he knocked at the door finding it on his first try. Loud and sure.

The lawyer, curious, opened the door. His eyes immediately seeing the paper sitting alone in the center of the room.

""Oh, thank goodness! I thought I'd lost it for sure.""

As the lawyer called out to a clerk somewhere else in the building, a tunnel of bliss and comfort opened up behind Thom.

He resisted the temptation to fall into it.

""Do not lose it."" He willed with a wordless whisper.

The lawyer looked about and frowned.

A clerk entered the room.

""Do not lose it!"" As a ghost words were not formed but his will surged hard against the barrier between he and the living.

""You found it!"" The clerk exclaimed, ""Give it to me, I'll make a copy!""

The soul that had lived a long and eventful life as Thom Bolling melted once again into the blissful kaleidoscope of the eternal afterlife.",19
1ln9wh3,n0gw64w,"I'm feeling flat about the ending, but not sure how to clean it up better. Either way, enjoy!

The afterlife had a surprisingly decent coffee bar. No lines, perfect temperature, and no judgements when you added an extra pump of syrup. I was halfway through a caramel deathuccino when a summoning sigil lit up, right on my napkin.

Oh, for the love of the fog,"" I muttered. Then, BAM. Back into the Mortal plane... again...

I blinked in the hot sunlight, finding myself in a strip mall.

I was sitting in front of a small bookstore that had been my pride and joy when I was still living.

I had passed away in one of those fluffy armchairs. I can't remember which book I had been reading, but by the fog I remembered those chairs. 

I turned, seeing a nervous teenager in an employee vest holding a walkie-talkie. 

Letting out a ghostly sigh, I broke the silence. ""Fog damn it, kid, what's wrong this time?!""

He flinched. ""Sir, uh... Gregory... your book went missing.""

I paused for a moment, making sure I had heard right, ""My... what?""

""Your book, sir."" The boy stuttered out, ""The one you died reading? It's gone.""

I floated very still for a moment.

""You summoned me,"" I said slowly, ""because of a BOOK?""

""Well, your niece says your spirit won't be able to rest until we get it back.""

""I WAS at rest!"" I snapped. ""My family needs to get their act together, because, by the fog, I am sick and tired of being dragged down here every time they have a HICCUP!""

The boy shrank back as if I'd raised a spectral fist. I didn't blame him, I was glowing faintly purple in my anger.

""I—I'm just the messenger,"" he stammered. ""Your niece said it was urgent. She things someone stole it.""

""Kid, I don't even remember which book it was,"" I said, waving a ghostly hand. ""I couldn't care less if it went missing.""

The kid stared at me, face wrinkled in confusion, ""It was Hoe No She Didn't, sir. Your favorite joke book.""

I had absolutely hated that book... Never even finished it. And THAT'S the has my family worked up? ""Ughh..."" I groaned, floating a little lower.

The kid looked hopeful, ""Well, your niece says it's important. She's been acting sort of... well, weird since it disappeared.""

I squinted over at him. ""Weird how?""

She brought in candles, hired witches, and tried to set up a seance to—uh—'call you back'.""

""I am so glad I blocked seance calls after last time...""

I rubbed my ghostly temples. ""If I had a dime for every time my family tried to call me back with candles and witchcraft, I'd have enough to open my own spectral coffee shop.""

He nodded solemnly. ""Sir, if I may, I think it's just hard for her to let go. You were her favorite uncle.""",7

Any book that appears in my library is instantly known to me, as if I was the one who wrote it.  
Obviously, there are ways to stop knowledge from arriving to my library.  
Other Gods, Goddesses, entities and creatures can do rituals, spells, or barriers that prohibit their knowledge to arrive her, thus disallowing me from knowing their secrets.  
Which is normal, but really, really awkward for me.   
Why?  
Because I am illiterate, and yet people seek me out to translate, read, or write stuff down for them.

  
It is embarrassing, but I guess it is the universe's way to balance things out.  
I know a lot of the ways of magic, and about where ancient civilizations fell.  
I know of the dreams, and goals people have ever had, or thought about unshielded, but!  
I can't read. And I can't write.  
This means I can't actively learn new things.  
If the books related to the information, to the knowledge don't appear in the library...

To manage the Divine Library of Alextrajan. Wise as she was in the stories of farmers and sailors, of tales woven by midwives and washerwomen, she was illiterate.

For all that she knew, it was all through the spoken words of her people, who too did not have a written language. But her humans were losing their culture. Their language. The older ones who knew had passed on, unable to find descendants willing to learn from them. The young ones spoke English, and not in the tongue of their ancestors. They prayed to the modern gods of the Internet, of clout and influencers and things she could not understand.

Old Boomer Goddess, these young deities of technology mocked her.

So, it was with much reluctance, and at the behest of several members of her pantheon did she take up this new post. Better to have a job she struggled with than to be rendered irrelevant.

To be more guardian of the library than its librarian. She could regale visitors with ancient fables and legends, but not actually help them to read the books of the Divine Library. She could point them to where the books were, but not know of their written contents.

That was, until a different kind of deity visited her.

He was an Old God, dressed in the old robes like he was still a dark lord of a medieval era. Yet, modernized, in that he was tapping away in one of those modern devices, speaking of maintaining social media accounts and gaining subscribers and followers. According to him, he had his own library. His own deep pool of knowledge, swimming in the vast Black Seas of Infinity, as nigh-infinite as the Divine Library of Alextrajan. And he was willing to help.

On that day, Olei-Nabtu learnt about headphones, handphones and audio files. He could use this text-to-speech program to scan the pages of library books and convert them to audio. Together, they'd listen to forgotten tomes. With some tinkering, the written word could even be played in the language of the Ancients she grew up hearing.

Her world had opened. For she had a kindred soul who had experience teaching others to read and write. A patient teacher who familiarized with the modern developments. Who somehow seemed to know the library so well, she almost thought she was conversing with the missing God of Knowledge.

Alas, her new friend was in fact, the God of Madness. One whose presence was not welcomed by her pantheon when they discovered his visits. But it mattered not. She knew where he had established his foothold in the mortal realm.

And he was most certainly open to visits.

So, it was, on a casual day off, Olei-Nabtu went to Innsmouth to look for the Mad God Elvari in his personal library. A veritable stash of forbidden tomes and non-Euclidean codices. Books that would have been destroyed rather than registered with the Divine Library.

He would greet her and pick a book and read it out loud to her. Together, at a tea table with chamomile tea and cheesecakes. Like the old days where the Goddess of Oral Traditions and the God of Knowledge traded tales and stories. When they were orators and an audience for each other. For deep within his madness, there was knowledge most could not perceive without going crazy. 

So it was, that he would hear of ancient oral traditions in languages few humans spoke, and she would hear of eldritch knowledge in languages that drove mortals insane. As old friends would reminisce of ancient times in a modern world.

1ln8hdi,n0dsx99,"I am knowledge.

It is what I am, it is who I am.

I cam into being when the concept of knowledge itself first solidified in the primitive brain of a species that now only exists in the pages of a book on a shelf in my vast library. 

I knew it once, its name, its shape, its thoughts.

But that was before the library.

Before the books.

Before the ink.

Now I know where the knowledge is found, I know what shelf the book stands on, what page to turn to and what words to read. 

I am knowledge.

But knowledge has changed and so I have changed.

Knowledge used to be what the wise elder knew, and so I was the wise elder.

Then knowledge became what the expert on a subject said, and so I became the expert on all subjects.

Now true knowledge has become the means and ability to seek out the answers you need, and so I have become the one who can guide you to any knowledge you seek.

Knowledge is no longer what a person knows, it is what they can find out should they need to. The ability to seek truth and not be turned astray by falsehood. 

And so I know nothing, except how to find all that there is to know.

I do not read the books in my library, I only lead others to the books they need.

I am knowledge.

And I know nothing.",18
1ln8hdi,n0ee2k7,"Gods are immutable. Unchanging. Mortals can beg, plead, pray, and sacrifice to their Gods, but it really makes no difference. The lives of mortals hold no worth to the Gods.

I am not the First God, I was not there at the Great Beginning, the start of all things. I am the Second. When the mortals discovered how to pass their thoughts from one to another, I was formed.

My domain is more infinite than the universe itself. All mortal knowledge comes here, eventually. I am both the God and the Realm. I am the spark and the tinder and the ash. Mortals discover, they learn, they spread, they forget, and they discover again. It all comes to me.

I hold it all, here. Everything from scratches in clay to compendiums made of the skins of other mortals to songs to shadows and light playing on surfaces. I hold it all, and yet...

We are Gods and we are eternal and unchanging. The mortals who first worshipped me no longer exist. They grew, they spread, they died. Their civilization was all too brief. They no longer exist. No descendants remain. The only record of them is here, in me. 

And yet, I am still here. Still gathering, but understanding nothing. All of the beauty and cruelty and hope and fear and love and hate... all expressions of it here.

I am the God of Mortal Creation. I hold all that mortals have ever thought. Every scroll, every book, every epic, in every language in all the universe. Every scent, every bubble, every expression. I love it all, and can understand none of it.",8
1ln8hdi,n0jgksr,"> Huh. Is she one of the few that can handle eldritch level stuff?

Yup, she might not be eldritch, but she is an Old God too. A combination of being lonely (mocked by modern gods, and the older ones put her up to a job where she's alone in the library without help, while Elvari was exiled from his pantheon), having alot of stories to tell, and ability to perceive eldritch knowledge meant Elvari is all too happy to find a fellow deity to relate to. And she does enjoy his company, where neither would judge each other for their eccentricities and flaws.",5
1ln56bf,n0cr9cc,"The report comes in.  
The government is attacked again...by her.  
I look at my teammates.  
We have been heroes for 2 decades, and have protected our country from villains, criminals, natural phenomena, and even aliens! Aliens!  
But 2 months ago...  
She appeared.  
We can't defeat her.

  
""No Hero is willing to go...  
What will we do? Theoretically, we are the ones to deal with stuff nobody wants to, or can deal with."" Princess Volcano says.  
I sigh.  
""She's 6 years old...  
How are we supposed to deal with her? Also..."" I point at the screen.  
There, the barriers, and other defenses of the building were slowly shred by green winds, and red rain.  
""She controls Nature, and can alter its components...  
Could we actually defeat her?"" I ask.  
They say nothing.

  
""Captain...You are Mr. Void...you could potentially trap her in such a gravity that she just...poof! Disappears."" Master Sunlight says.  
I frown.  
""She's a child. A young girl...  
And we know why she's doing this.  
We know how she awakened her powers.  
I...I personally can't and don't want to deal with her."" I say.  
""It is our job!"" he continues.  
The team is divided.  
Some agree with me, others want to deal with her, but can't.

  
""Her parents died because the government silenced them!  
They found chemical leaks from all the plants! ALL OF THEM!  
The paper they were about to release could have shown that our own government is killing us, killing nature!  
The two were non-violent supers! The mother had the ability to talk to animals! The father could control and alter plants!  
They were farmers, before they were activists! For God's sake!""I roar.  
""And from what we know...they died in front of her.  
She was hidden in a secret compartment, but could see out...then..."" Princess Volcano starts.  
""THEN SHE ERASED THE WHOLE FARM! AND THE TEAM THAT WAS THERE!"" Master Sunlight says.  
The argument broke out again.  
""Fuck it. I am done. Talking about fighting a 6-year old...this is not for me."" I say, taking out my badge, and credentials, and leaving.  
With me, half the team left...and thus a team that was established more than 2 decades ago, was destroyed by a 6-year old...without even fighting her.",34
1ln56bf,n0d13wv,"The five heroes regrouped atop the rubble, one of them dragging the terrorist who was the cause of it all.

As usual, it was a Saturday morning, and the people rejoiced at another victory. The media quickly surrounded the heroes in a frenzy, asking all sorts of questions.

However, amidst the crowd, a pair of crimson eyes observed the heroes with a stern gaze. Ray wanted to be a hero too; she just gave a speech yesterday in school about what she wanted to be in the future.

And yet, her classmates bullied her for it, saying she could never be one all because her powers were… lame.

""Not fair!"" The little girl leaped through the crowd, waving her arms in fury. ""If I can't be a hero, then I will be a villain!""

The heroes, caught off guard, glanced at each other and then at the girl. ""Little miss, are you alright?""

The girl frowned, raising her palm to face the man in the red suit—the leader of the group, Red Ranger. ""Fear me!"" 

Suddenly, a transparent ball conjured from her palms, light dancing along its wobbly surface, the mass growing to the size of her head as she launched it in his direction.

It was a bubble. Her powers were producing bubbles. 

The floating mass slowly hovered towards him while everyone gawked at the scene. It touched his head, and the bubble popped.

That was it.

Ray stared incredulously, her brows drooping as tears beaded around her eyes. She really was so weak—

""On my mark."" Red ranger whispered to his team before whipping his head back, feigning unconsciousness as he fell to the ground for the first time in decades.

One of his teammates quickly crouched down, holding his leader by the head. ""Red Ranger… NOOOO!""

Every watched in horror as the camera quickly turned to Ray, the little girl wiping away her tears, her eyes gaining a glint.

""I won't forgive you, villain!"" The hero declared, and Ray stuck out her tongue in response.

""Muhaha! you will never catch me!"" She declared back with grin before scurrying away from the crime scene, her small legs tapping away.

""The villain is retreating; stop her!"" The hero exclaimed as the media started to chase her, but she was too fast to be caught. ""Are you sure this is alright? She may grow up to become an actual villain."" He said, looking down.

""What do you mean? She is a villain; she just said so."" Red ranger whispered back a chuckle, ""Besides, we ought to have villains with more personality these days. Seriously, you heard her laugh? She is a natural.""

The rest of the team sighed, ""You really are a child yourself sometimes, you know...""",20
1ln56bf,n0d5y94,"""Watch your six, babe.""

""I clocked them. I got something for them.""

Even after all these years, I couldn't help but smile when she said that. I could practically see the mischievous look on her face as she prepped her maneuver.

""They're so screwed.""

She tried to cover her laugh, but I heard the telltale signs. We'd been working together for too long for me not to notice. Hell, we'd been married for nearly a decade at this point, so even if we weren't superheroes in our spare time, I probably would've expected her to laugh.

A moment later, she executed a perfect mid-air loop, and managed to come up behind the drones that had been on her tail a moment ago. With a flick of her wrists, her shoulder-mounted cannons made quick work of the drones.

""Any others?""

""None that I can spot. Looks like it's just The Tinkerer left.""

""Got a location for me?""

""Warehouse about two klicks east.""

""On it.""

""Be careful, babe. It's your turn to do bedtime story.""

""Oh, right. Dammit, can you stall?""

""I'll do my best. You know how she gets.""

""Heh, I'd rather tackle an army of drones.""

""Me and you both.""

""All right, I'll make it quick. See you soon.""

""See you soon. Love you.""

""Love you.""

I put down the headset, closed the laptop, and made sure to lock everything up out of sight. The last thing I wanted was for Gabby to find out what Mom & Dad did for work by accident.

""I think that's everything,"" I muttered to myself as I scanned the room again.

I'd always been the more cautious of the two, and the habits carried over even when I was just Dad. Everything needed to be powered down AND secured. Even if Gabby found one of the devices, she wouldn't be able to power it on or unlock it.

Satisfied that I'd cleaned up all traces of superhero life, I opened the door and walked to the living room. Gabby would be getting home from school, and that needed an entirely different kind of prep work.

-- -- -- -- --

""Daddy?""

""Yes, Gabby?""

""Where's Mommy?""

""She's at work, baby girl.""

""Again?!""

""Yes, baby girl. She got hung up at work, so she'll be home a little late.""

""I don't like it!""

""I know, I know. I wish we could both stay home and play with you all day long, but we have to work.""

""You could quit?""

""Heh, not sure that'd work.""

""Well, I still don't like it!""

She stamped her foot in that way that little kids do, expressing her utter disdain for the idea in the best way that she knew. It was cute, but I knew better than to laugh. For one, I didn't want to invalidate her feelings, and she needed to be able to express and process those feelings in a healthy manner. For another, Gabby didn't take any guff from anyone, least of all me. I'd faced down hundreds of villains over the years, but none had managed to actually give me pause the same way this six year old could.

""I hear you, baby girl. We'll make sure we spend as much time as we can with Mommy when she gets home, okay?""

""Okay!""

""Sounds like a plan. Can you go to put your backpack away and wash up? I'll prep dinner.""

Gabby did as she was told, but took her time getting up the stairs. We were past the initial frustration, so now her attention span began to wander. Parenting really was a different kind of challenge.

Seizing the opportunity, I pulled out my phone and sent a quick message.

*Bought you fifteen minutes. Prepping dinner VERY SLOWLY.*

Fortunately, my phone beeped a second later with a reply.

*Thanks. Finished up quickly, heading home. Love you*

I smiled, and wandered off to the kitchen. I had some salads to make.",22
1ln56bf,n0d6p3j,"“The Brave Defenders had spent 50 years protecting the planet from all sorts of terrible creatures and villains. Some from space. Some from Earth. And some from other planes of existence. But they have never faltered. They have never quit. They have never let us down,” the President of the United States told the world. He was speaking at a celebration Gala for the Brave Defenders who were in their 50th year of service. The original squad had long since retired, and each time one retires (or is unable to continue), a new hero takes their place. There have been twenty-seven Brave Defenders in these 50 years, and nineteen of them are in attendance today. Eight bronze busts of the eight Defenders who had died were displayed on the main stage, behind the president and the rest of the Defenders. 

Besides the twenty-seven Defenders, other heroes, past and present, are here to celebrate and enjoy a much deserved night off from hero work. Of course, if need be, they would be off in a flash, but sometimes, a little R&R is needed to continue doing what they do. 

Magma and Typhoon were the two newest members of the Brave Defenders. This party was also a welcoming introduction for them to the world. Magma was 23 years old and was taking over for War Priest, who lost his arm in a tragic fight just months ago. Typhoon was taking the place of his father, Hurricane, who was starting to lose control over his powers and needed to get out of the business before he hurt someone. 

The party was full of politicians and celebrities and CEOs and others who needed to network and be seen with others, or else their importance would be threatened. The party was covered by all the major networks and streamed live over all social media platforms. Influencer superheroes were livestreaming their battles for a few years now and this has caused some ruffles with the older generations as it seemed brash and very selfish, but the results were better polling numbers for superheroes, so the matter was squashed and now most of the newer heroes have sponsorship deals with streaming services. 

As the party waned down and people started to leave, the Brave Defender’s leader, Captain Frost, asked for Magma and Typhoon to meet him and the other Defenders in the basement for something important they needed to discuss. Captain Frost thanked the crowd and the audience for their support, as he led his newest recruits down into the basement, away from the prying eyes of the public. A representative for AlwaysOn, a streaming service, started to follow them, as Magma was partnered with them, but she was turned away. 

“No media. No streaming. No videos. No pictures,” Captain Frost told her.

“But her contract states…” the rep responded.

“Ask me if I care about a contract. Go on, please, I insist. Ask me if I care about your contract.”

The rep left without saying another word.

Captain Frost led his two new recruits down into the basement. It wasn’t anything special, concrete floors, unfinished walls, steel folding chairs and a wooden desk. 

“If you have any recording devices, you need to turn them off or your contract with us is terminated,” he said.  Magma and Typhoon both looked cautiously at each other as they pushed some invisible hidden buttons on their suits and nodded.

“All off,” Typhoon said. 

“Same,” Magma replied.

“This is your initiation meeting. We will discuss with you the one thing that binds all of us together,” Captain Frost said.

As they walked in, the other heroes were already waiting, laughing and chatting with their friends they had not seen for years. They were showing pictures on their phones of their kids or grandkids, of the housework they have been doing, and all the memories of life they have had. 

There was no podium, no glitz, no glamour, no cameras or anything else except for the heroes, their pasts, and now their future. 

“When I became a member of the Brave Defenders roughly 17 years ago, I was led to this same basement, by some of you. Things were different back then. Some things are better. Some things are worse. And some things have remained the same. Magma. Typhoon. You have some large shoes to fill, but they aren’t your shoes, you need to forge your own path. Some will disagree with it. Some will support you. But your path is your own. The Brave Defenders have always been Earth’s protectors. We have more successes than failures,” Captain Frost said.  “But we have one failure that will haunt us forever.”

The room got quiet. A small girl walked out from the back of the room, through the wall, and stood in the middle of the room. She had a ghostly visage, half shimmering, half whole, carrying a small backpack. Some of the Brave Defenders couldn’t look at her, looking down at their feet. Others had somber faces as they took in the reminder of their failure. 

“Jasmine Elmond is a unique little girl. She was visiting New York City with her parents when the Avalanche attacked. Our original four heroes arrived at the scene and battled Avalanche to a standstill. Powers, at that time, were still new. No one really knew how to control them or what their limits were. The Guardian…the Guardian decided to take a shot at Avalanche instead of helping a group of trapped civilians. The civilians didn’t make it, Avalanche was apprehended, and the term collateral damage would be the most frequently used word for the next couple of years.  What we didn’t know was that Jasmine also had some powers, they were just dormant in her.”

“HELP US,” Jasmine shouted. Her voice changed to that of an older man. “Why didn’t you save us?”  Now, her voice as a little boy.  “My leg hurts.”  And then a young woman. “Please, get us out of here!”

“I…I don’t understand,” Magma said. “Who…or what is she?”

“She is our constant reminder of our choices we make. Jasmine has the power of the dead. Some call her the literal representation of collateral damage. All of our failures end up powering Jasmine. When we have a lot of success, Jasmine gets weaker. When we fail…well, Jasmine gets stronger. We don’t know if we could ever get…well, rid of her,” Hurricane said. Both Magma and Typhoon looked at the now retired hero.  “She will always be there, looking at you, judging you, shouting at you to save the people we are supposed to protect. By joining us, you tether yourself to her.” 

“Can others see her?” Magma asked.  

Alpha Shock, one of the original members, stood up and said, “No. For some reason, she only makes herself visible to those who join The Brave Defenders. And she is rightfully and justifully angry at us. She never got to live her life because we were too careless. We didn’t prioritize the right people. We wanted to win more than anything. We wanted to show off our powers and our abilities and show the world we are the good guys. After we stopped Avalanche, we found out that three-hundred and sixteen people had died due to our careless actions.”

“Jasmine Elmond is our Scarlet Letter, our sin, our mark to wear to remind ourselves that we must always, always protect those that cannot protect themselves, no matter what,” Captain Frost said. “She will yell at you when you fail. She will be a curse. She will be your guiding star. You need to understand that she will never let you forget in order to make you stronger. We cannot defeat her nor get rid of her because we need her. We need to be better versions of our past selves.”

The room sat silent for a while. Jasmine turned and pointed at several heroes and shouted names at them. Their victims. Their losses. Their collateral damage. 

“Magma. Typhoon. This is a legacy you must accept if you want to join The Brave Defenders. If you accept, please, walk up to Jasmine, hold out your hand, and promise her you will be the protector the civilians need.  If not, turn around, and head towards the door.”",15
1ln56bf,n0d2k6v,"“ARGHH, GET BABY OFF!” The Avalanche whipped around in a frenzy, as a giggling child clung on to his beard. For all the times he’d taken blows from outer-dimensional entities, this was the most pain the giant hero had felt. A man in a red spandex suit stepped forward, trying to grab at the girl.

“Stop moving, you oaf, you’re gonna-“

**Crash**

The giant fell against an expensive-looking walnut cupboard, tearing through it and the wall behind. From the debris the little girl hopped out. She looked at Red Tights.

“I’m bored. I wanna watch TV.”

The hero glanced at another hero, a woman in a suit designed to look like a puma. She shook her head.

“Jane said no screen time for Ashley after eight. It messes with her sleep.”

Ashley throwing a fit, and feet, at her.

“I WANNA WATCH TV! I WANNA WATCH TV!”

“Ow, ow! Stop that, hey this costumes made of real- ok, fine, you get an iPad, and thirty minutes max!”

As the girl browsed through Tik-Tok, Red Tights brought a hand to his face. *Who knew they’d be defeated by a six-year old.*

1ln56bf,n0dxnft,"She looked SO innocent but looks can be deceiving.  The heroes walked with trepidation into the classroom, not entirely sure of what to expect but probably not a wholesome looking blue eyed blond 6 year old with curls. 

She looked up from her drawing and smiled. ""Oh hi.  I'm Abbi.  My teacher said you might visit me today.""

Mr Clarke, her teacher looked somewhat dishevelled and anxious.  But to look this way was normal for him or at least normal ever since Abbi joined the class.

""I drew a cat, "" Abbi continued, ""I might write a poem about the cat later.""

Samson peered at the picture with interest, and Professor Genius stared at it intensely for any clues.  Fast Freddy had already seen the drawing and was staring agape at the two children lying on the floor. The sight slowed even HIM down. ""Aw, the two boys are sleeping."" He said hopefully.
Abbi shook her head, curls and ringlets shaking ""Not sleeping, silly. Dead.  I tend to have classes to myself but Drew and Kyle snuck into the room on a dare. They insulted me.  Drew said I should draw between the lines and Kyle said cats aren't blue.  I didn't like it.""
Abbi shrugged, ""Now they can't insult me anymore.""

All three superheroes took one step closer to Abbi.

She giggled and then said ""Stay where you are if you value your life.  Make me mad and you won't have one any more.""
The last part of the sentence waa said in a singsong voice.

""How did you-?"" Professor Genius started to ask. Part scared and part intrigued.  

Abbi tapped her left temple, ""With my mind. And a lot of rage.""

Miss Jenson entered the room shaking, holding out a school dinner on a tray.  

""Ooh, yummy, lunch time!"" said Abbi, ""And my ice cream has a cherry this time, good.  Miss Jenson, already I like you better than Mrs Lane, RIP.""

Miss Jenson fake laughed nervously, set the tray down then quickly walked out of the room.

Professor Genius asked ""Abbi, what kind of music do you like?""

Samson and Fast Freddy looked at Professor Genius quizzically and he gave them a reassuring glance. 
""I'll show you my favourite music channels later, after dinner tonight if you want and we can all dance.""

Professor Genius smiled and said ""We all love to dance, don't we.  I'll ask the school office for your address and check with your parents.""

""My parents will approve it, they HAVE to.  IF I let them out of the basement!"" Abbi laughed.

Outside the school, Samson asked Professor Genius, ""What exactly are you up to? Do you have a plan?""

""Not exactly but if we tire Abbi out in her home environment with a dancing marathon so much that she falls asleep, it gives US time to BEGIN to think of one.  Or failing that, bedtime stories including ones about cats.   I'll leave most of the dancing to you two, you Samson with your Super Strength and you, Fast Freddy with your super speed. I REALLY hope we can think of something! She's already left a trail of bodies in her wake.""

Back in the classroom, Abbi smiled.  She'd just killed the school's IT guy for not being able to fix the interactive whiteboard fast enough when the net went down while she and her teacher were watching a maths PowerPoint. The janitor also had met an early demise for daring to distract her with washing the windows while she was trying to learn.

He even had those shitty mall swords he got from the Asian shop under his jacket, like he was trying to hide them. I guess it was time to tell his father, I'm sure this would go well. 

""Chett go somewhere?"" My husband says, carrying a handfull of oversized feathers with him into the living room. 

""Yeah he says he is on an ""important hunt"""", I'm just glad it gets him out of the house for Halloween.   
  
""The only thing that boy could hunt is an ass whooping. Did he say where he was going?""

""The mall..."" I say, trailing off... I was forgetting something. 

""The same mall where they're doing the trunk or treat? That mall? 

""Oh my god"" I say out loud, the panic setting in. 

He wasn't hunting monsters, he was the monster.",6
1ln1ejd,n0cg8ak,"""I am sorry,...what do you mean? I have no soul?"" was all I could think of to say.

The whitecoat that sat looking at me and just blinked. Blinking far too much.

""Hello?""

He looked at this screen and then back at me, a few times more than I think was necessary for the question.

""Ah, Mr. Can...please just give me a moment...""

""No.""

""What?"" he blinked even more at me as I looked him calmly in the eyes.

Did in not occur to him that being mindless might be a problem? A problem not only for him but for the rest of us?

""Does it not occur to you that knowing something *relevent* before you talk to us might be helpful?""

I think he just pissed himself...

For the last three years we have had to watch our rights be removed. Cut away from the heart of the American Dream, ended by the actions of those who think money/power will lead to great actions...as if stepping on those who just want to live is a sign of greatness.

They do not understand but I was dealing with the Bureaucrat before me, not that system the smothers me every day I just try to get through the day. A garish dressed, sophisticated @$$hat that seems to think nothing bad happens to anyone...even him...but the smell...maybe he had a good meal last night.

As I reach for my weapon.

1lml9bp,n08eue4,"I come to in a box the size of a cheap coffin, the air like frostbite on my gums.

It’s so dark I can’t see my own fingers, not that I can feel them anyways. I can’t feel much of anything, actually.

*First breath: nothing.*

*Second breath: still nothing.*

*Third: Oh. Right.*

I’m not breathing.

---

I bang on the door with the side of my fist. It sounds like knocking on a wall, muffled and pitiful. The echo comes back: thin metal, cold rivets, cheap insulation.

Then comes the slam of a latch outside. I hear a squeak, a muttered curse. The rattle of keys, a hand trembling against steel. The hatch swings wide.

The light hits my eyes like acid. I hiss and squint, and that’s when I realize my eyes shouldn’t work, not after whatever put me here.

The kid staring back at me can’t be more than twenty, skin pale under the morgue’s strip lights. He’s wearing scrubs. They’re not clean.

He shrieks when I sit up.

---

“Easy.” I say. Or try to. My voice scrapes out like gravel poured through a drainpipe. “Hey. Hey. It’s okay.”

He’s backed halfway across the tile already, shoulder blades pinned to a cabinet. He’s holding up a clipboard like a shield.

I swing my legs over the slab and they smack the floor like thawed meat.

“Question,” I rasp, teeth clacking because my jaw’s a little loose. “No one’s ever woken up in your freezer before?”

He stares at me like I’m the second coming of every horror film ever made. Then he swallows. “Not… not anyone I autopsied yesterday.”

I run a hand across my chest. There are stitches. A Y-shaped line. I poke one seam and my fingers come away slick with something I don’t want to think about.

“Autopsied,” I echo. “So you… cut me up.”

“I-I-I’m sorry!” he blurts. “You were— you were dead! Your chart said D.O.A., massive trauma, no pulse, no brain—”

“Yeah.” I press a hand to my temple. Something crunches. I decide not to touch it again. “Guess that didn’t stick.”

---

I take in the room. Cold storage units, big metal door, tile that’s seen more fluids than a slaughterhouse. It all smells like bleach and old sorrow. I remember the crash. I remember the pain. I remember…

Wait. I remember everything.

“Hey, kid,” I say, and my voice comes out softer this time. He flinches anyway. “What day is it?”

He hesitates. Then: “Thursday.”

“Yesterday was Wednesday?”

He nods.

“Which means I died on Wednesday.” I crack a grin, feel my lips stretch wrong. “Huh. Never made it to payday.”

---

He starts crying. Big, quiet tears rolling down his cheeks, clipboard clutched like a teddy bear. I want to tell him it’s okay, but I don’t even know if that’s true.

I flex my fingers. They move, but the feeling’s like thick fog rolling through empty streets. I’m moving. I’m thinking. I’m dead.

Somewhere deep in my ribcage, a knot tightens. Not a heartbeat, I’m pretty sure that’s gone, but something like it. A thread of humanity, dangling on frayed sinew.

*Don’t lose that,* I tell myself. *Hold onto it.*

---

“Got a mirror?” I ask.

He gestures weakly at a metal tray by the sink. I shuffle over. My reflection greets me: sunken eyes, gray skin, stitches. The same old me, just… less alive.

I flash myself a rotting grin. “Still handsome.”

The kid sobs harder.

I put a cold hand on his trembling shoulder. “Hey. It’s fine. You did your job. I just didn’t stay dead. Must be a fluke.”

He tries to laugh. It comes out like a hiccup instead.

“Come on.” I say, turning to the door. The night’s waiting out there. So is whatever I’ve got to figure out next. “You wanna fill out the paperwork for undead or should we just call this one even?”

He doesn’t answer. He just watches as I limp out, hospital gown hanging open, stitches crisscrossed like a jigsaw puzzle no one bothered to finish.

---

First steps back into the world, dead but not gone.

I don’t know what I am yet.

But I’m not meat on a slab.

*Not anymore.*

And that’s a start.",221
1lml9bp,n09jz5o,"""First time?"" I sat up from the morgue freezer to appraise the panicked young man who heard my incessant knocking and liberated me from my cold, metal coffin. [""The other humans never told you about me?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/12p6ko5/wp_i_pulled_myself_together_and_got_up_the/jglfm5w/)

""I don't know you!"" He exclaimed, flailing backwards and almost tripping over himself.

""You never seen anyone wake up in this morgue before? Are you new around these parts? First day at work?"" I clambered out of the freezer and landed with a wet thud on my appendages. ""Here, it says Elliot Livera, so why would you not know me?""

""Never,"" the human muttered, clumsily falling to the floor and backing away on his butt until he hit a wall. ""Dead people stay dead. ""Dead people don't heal,"" he was pointing to my chest, where a deep gash showed signs of mending itself. ""Dead people don't...don't sprout tentacles.""

""Oh? These?"" I waggled one tentacle, feeling my muscles twitch and come back to life. Then, a second one. ""You see..."" I squinted to read his name tag. ""Daniel, I'm not a dead man. I'm something of a local deity around these parts. Death is but a temporary inconvenience to me.""

He stared at me like I wielded daggers in every limb and could stab him to death. ""Don't kill me. Don't eat me. I'll do anything!""

""What do you think I am? A man-eating monster? O—Oh."" I stopped myself mid-sentence, running my fingers across my face. Feeling a wound that stretched from temple to jawline. Touching the extra eyes that had yet to open. Of course, my human guise was off. There wasn't any way I could maintain it while unconscious. Clearly, this was his first time seeing a corpse wake up in the morgue. His first time meeting this...silly old regular here. His first time conversing with a naked eldritch horror.

""We had a bad start. You're new to this, and I'm probably still a wee bit tipsy. A wee bit drunk. You said you'll do anything. I say we start again,"" I tried sitting on an autopsy table only to recoil and jump away from how cold it was to my skin. Ah, the disadvantages of assuming a physical vessel on earth. ""Hello human, welcome to Innsmouth. Are we in Innsmouth? Did I crawl too far from home in a drunken stupor yet again?"" Too late to put those words back into my mouth now, so might as well keep rambling on. ""My ID says Elliot Livera. That's a civilian identity. You...don't press that emergency button. This is business as usual.""

""No, its not!"" He was suddenly shouting, one hand still hovering above the big red emergency button. ""Nothing about this is usual!""

""It is,"" Doctor Mendez sighed, as she happened to walk by. ""It is the 3rd time this month you got yourself killed while intoxicated, Lord Elvari. At this rate, perhaps I really should tell the director to include dealing with you in our standard operating procedures.""

""What do you mean I'm not already in your standard operating procedure? What do they teach in medical school?""

""Human anatomy,"" Mendez didn't skip a beat. ""We're pathologists, not marine biologists. For the love of my god, Elvari, have you considered staying a little sane and sober, and away from a morgue instead?""

1lml9bp,n0cffy3,"So here’s the thing they don’t tell you about politics:
It’s worse than being dead.

---

It started when I realized people will follow anyone who stands at a podium and says, *“I’ve got the guts to tell it like it is.”*

Well, I *literally* have my guts sewn up with fishing line. Seemed like I’d have an edge.

I registered under “Independent,” because, trust me, both parties sent “representatives” to feel me out. The suits wanted a puppet, a symbol, a man of the people they could parade around while they pulled the strings backstage.

I told them they’d have better luck pulling strings on a bag of cement.

---

The worst was the necromancer.
Some weaselly little “consultant” from a shady super PAC.
Showed up at my rented office in a pinstripe suit that cost more than my entire apartment back when I was alive.

He laid out some runes. Lit a few candles. Started chanting about *“controlling the soul of the returned.”*

I let him get halfway through before I flicked him in the forehead. He went cross-eyed, keeled over, and pissed himself on my welcome mat.

Turns out, you can’t hex a dead man who didn’t come back by the rules.

Being one-of-a-kind zombie has its perks.

---

So the campaign slogged on.
Endless rallies. Bad coffee. Reporters sniffing for dirt, as if being dead isn’t enough scandal on its own.

I gave the usual stump speech:

*“I know what it’s like to be the forgotten. I know what it’s like to be used up and thrown out. Hell, I woke up on a slab because this system doesn’t give a damn if you’re alive or dead. Let’s fix it!”*

They clapped. They donated. They shook my cold hand.

But every time I sat in a back room with the so-called “handlers”, the pitch was always the same:

*“You’ll vote how we say, right? You’ll stick to the lines, right?”*

Every time, I gave them the same smile I gave the necromancer.
Didn’t stop them from trying.

---

Then came the rally in Pennsylvania.

Big outdoor stage. Flags flapping. Me, up there in a thrift store suit they tried to dress up with a designer tie.

I was halfway through a joke about how I still pay taxes even though I’m technically a corpse when I saw the glint in the scaffolding across the field.

Sniper.

Old instincts, or maybe old nerves that never learned to stay dead, kicked in.

But in that split second, I thought: *What’s the funniest thing I could do right now?*

I remembered that old footage. Trump, 2024, blood pouring down his face and ear, fist in the air, roaring “Fight!” while the crowd lost its mind.

An image that’ll live longer than most of us.

So I thought: Why not ?

*Let’s one-up him.*

---

The shot cracked.

Hit me square between the eyes.

My skull snapped back, felt like a lightbulb going out. Vision flickered. Then snapped right back on.

I staggered. The crowd screamed. Secret Service, or local cops, or whoever the hell they’d hired for me, all tackled each other behind the barricades.

I wiped a chunk of something from my temple, then looked at it. Grayish, chunky.

Brain matter. Cute.

Then I stuck my finger through the hole for dramatic effect. Felt the bullet rattling around somewhere behind my left ear.

Grinned at the nearest news camera.

And I clenched my free hand into a fist, blood and all, lifted it high over my head, and croaked out in my best dead-man rasp:

**“FIGHT!”**

Just like Trump did, except with a hole in my head.

---

They dragged me offstage, patched the hole with duct tape and a bit of gauze from someone’s glove box. The bullet is probably still rattling around somewhere behind my left ear, knocking up against memories that don’t feel real anymore.

I can still think straight, or at least as straight as I ever did.

But that was the last rally.

---

Next morning, I sat in my motel room, staring at my reflection.

Half my scalp was stapled shut.

My campaign manager was pounding on the door, ranting about “polling numbers” and “historical moments.”

I just laughed.

I laughed until the staples itched and my stitches pulled.

Politics has too many strings.

Too many people who think they can tug you around.

The only one who should be allowed to pull your strings… is you.

---

So I dropped out the next day.

Posted a video online: me, shirtless, Y-incision scar on display, bullet hole still crusty.

“I’ve had enough of people trying to keep me on a leash,” I said. “Find yourself another puppet. I’ve got better things to do than play make-believe with the living.”

I saluted the camera with my half-rotted fingers.

Signed off.

---

Funny thing is, my numbers spiked even more *after* I quit.

Whatever I did during and after that rally, that’s about as real as it gets, right?

But me ?

I’m done with that stage.

I’m not some symbol. I’m not your martyr. I’m not your saviour's second coming.

I’m just me, dead, breathing or not.

And that’s still the most alive I’ve ever felt.",18
1lml9bp,n0ca4f2,"The rest of the story:

---

Turns out, the world doesn’t give a damn whether you’re alive or dead.

The landlord still wants rent.

The bills still stack up on the counter.

And the barista at the corner shop still misspells your name on the cup, though, fair enough, my name *is* harder to spell when you slur it through half-rotted vocal cords.

---

I’ve been back for… what? Two weeks? I’m not sure how time’s supposed to feel when you don’t sleep. I lie down sometimes, just to pretend. I close my eyes. Count cracks in the ceiling. Listen to the way the pipes groan like old bones.

No heartbeat under my ribs. No pulse at my neck. But the thoughts still come. I still remember my mother’s voice when I told her I got that first office job, how proud she sounded. I remember the drone of the copy machine, the stale coffee in the break room, the taste of birthday cake we all pretended to like.

I don’t remember ever feeling *alive* then.

Ironic, huh?

---

I hunted for answers at first. Hit the hospital records. Talked to a pathologist who kept crossing himself when he thought I couldn’t see. Looked up weird folk tales, made a library card under a fake name, “John Doe,” cliché as hell.

I found nothing.

No secret government experiment. No necromancer in a hoodie. No ritual gone wrong.

Just a John Doe who didn’t stay dead.

---

Living like this… It’s the little things that mess with you.

Food? Doesn’t taste like anything. A burger might as well be cardboard dipped in motor oil.

Thirst? Gone.

Bathroom? Nah.

Shaving? Kinda pointless, but I do it out of habit, until I nick my cheek and realize there’s no blood, just a slow ooze like stale paint.

That one took a while to get used to.

---

But there’s good parts, too.

I don’t get tired. I don’t feel pain. When the landlord banged on my door yelling about back rent, I just stood there, stitches on my chest peeking out from my undershirt. He got real quiet. Said we could work something out.

For once in my sorry life, I’m not afraid of the boss, the bank, the next bill.

I’m not afraid of anything, really, except rotting away faster than I can patch myself up.

---

I’m walking home from the grocery store, yeah, I still shop sometimes. Helps me blend in, pushing a cart full of canned soup I’ll never eat, when I catch my reflection in the window of a laundromat.

It’s me. Same tired eyes. Same too-thin shoulders. Same dumb haircut I never bothered to fix.
But there’s something else there, too.

A spark.

Like maybe, when I crawled out of that freezer, I left behind more than just my heartbeat. I left behind the part of me that let life grind me down to a paycheck and a death certificate.

I tap the glass. Grin at myself, all cracked lips and crooked teeth.

“Guess dying was the best thing that ever happened to you, huh?”

My reflection doesn’t answer. But if it could, I think it’d laugh.

---

Back home, I sit on the couch, lights off. I listen to the fridge hum. To the wind scrape past the window. To the faint buzz of streetlights on the corner.

No pulse. No breath. No hunger.

But a second chance all the same.

I don’t know what I am now.

I don’t know what I’m meant to do.

But for the first time in a long time, I think I’m ready to live.",25
1lml9bp,n0edfyb,"You ever get so bored that you break into a necromancer’s rat-infested basement to read his private stash of forbidden grimoires?

No?

Well. I do.

---

I tell myself it’s practical.

The campaign’s over (technically), but the brainless (ha !) fans wrote me in anyway.

Now I’m the new President-elect.


And while the living argue about whether the Constitution says anything about *corpses* in the Oval Office, I’m here, picking a padlock, with a small piece of bone, fell out of my body due to the assassination attempt, because I’m rotting a little faster than I’d like. 

And, well… dead flesh doesn’t fix itself.

---

The necromancer's basement is the exact same thing I expected it to be :

Mildew wallpaper. 

Candles everywhere.

A dead chicken nailed to the door, probably for “protection.” 

Cute.

He nearly fainted when he saw me, hole still puckered in my forehead from that rally.

“You–” he squeaks, pressed against a shelf of dusty skulls.

“Yeah, me.” I say. “Relax. I’m not here to flick your forehead again. Unless you try anything.”

He tries anyway. Whispers some nonsense, waves his hands.

I just stare.

Nothing happens, because, you know, *one of a kind.*

He squeaks again. I tell him to sit. He sits.

---

I rummage through his garbage until I find it:

A thick leather-bound thing, wrapped in chains, sealed with some shimmering runes.

The title’s in a language that looks like it crawled out of a grave worse off than me.

“Don’t touch that!” he hisses, but I’m already flattening my palm on the cover.

It’s warm.

It *shouldn’t* be warm.

The runes flare, hiss, and sizzle out like cheap neon. 

The chains clatter to the floor.

The necromancer squeaks again.

(He squeaks a lot.)

---

The book opens itself, pages yellow as old bone.
Diagrams. Ritual circles. Smeared sketches of figures with too many eyes, wings, claws.

I squint and read aloud:

> *“A heart and mind of the undying.*

>*A vessel never claimed by death.*

> *The faith of the living, a choir of worship.*

> *In sacrifice, ascend.”*

I tap the page with a half-rotted finger.
“Huh.”

---

Behind me, the TV buzzes from the necromancer’s corner. He’s one of those doomsday types, always has the news on.

Big headline:

> **ZOMBIE PRESIDENT-ELECT DECLARED BY HISTORIC WRITE-IN VOTE**

I see crowds on the screen.

People waving signs with my face on them.

Kids dressed like me for Halloween, still.

Commentators arguing whether I’m technically “immortal.”

Some are crying. Some are laughing.

A few are chanting my name.

Worship, huh?

---

I close the book. It makes a little sigh, like a grave settling.

The necromancer is shaking now. He knows that look in my eyes.

He starts muttering about balance, about consequences, about mortal limits.

I lean in, grin wide enough to split a few stitches.

“Relax, buddy. Who said I wanted to be President forever?”

He doesn’t get it. I barely do.

But something cold and vast and *hungry* flickers in my dead gut.

---

So I stand there, under flickering basement lights, thumb pressed to the page that says I just need one thing:

A brain and heart of an immortal.

I check my pulse. Still none.

My heart? Technically still in there, stitched to my ribs.

A corpse nobody can kill.

And all those living folks, ready to bow, vote, or scream my name from the steps of the Capitol.

Faith is faith, right?

---

Maybe it’ll work.

Maybe it won’t.

But if you asked me what’s funnier than a dead man becoming President...

*It’s a dead man using democracy as a stepping stone to godhood.*

---

The necromancer squeaks one last time:
“Wh-what will you do if you succeed?”

I grin.

“Guess I’ll finally get some rest. Or not.”

I snap the book shut under my arm, squeeze his shoulder on my way out.

“Keep the place warm for me. Might need your basement for the ritual.”

---

Outside, it’s snowing. The streets glow with neon and campaign signs people still haven’t torn down.

Somewhere up ahead is the White House – My new temple.

And inside this rotting chest, my heart *thumps* once, *just once,* in anticipation.",7
1lmll1r,n08e6sc,"""Hello, I am Ammon Za Silver Tusk."" I wave at them.  
The cleric took a step back, while the rogue checked me out.  
Not blaming them, I was like 3 times their height.  
""What king of wizard are you?"" the cleric asks.  
""I mastered Evoking, Conjuring, and gained my Shaman totem."" I say.  
They stare at me confused.  
""See? Master wizard! Perfect for us."" the fighter that found me laughed, slapping my thigh, as that is the only thing he could reach.

  
""My apologies, Ammon, but while I saw beastmen...a Woolly Mammoth one is something I haven't heard about."" the cleric says.  
""Oh, no worries. We live in the Northern Eye, and rarely move out."" I say.  
The cleric pales, while the rogue actually starts praying.  
""T-T-The Northern Eye? The Never-Ending Storm the size of a continent? Y-You live there?!"" the cleric stutters.  
I nod.  
""That's why I am so fluffy."" I chuckle.  
The two took some time to calm down, while the fighter was laughing at their antics.  
After a good few minutes, they were ready to talk.

  
""Let's do a dungeon run in a mid-tier dungeon, okay?  
I want to test out your skills."" the cleric says.  
""Sure."" I smile, thinking it is normal.  
So, we went to a dungeon nearby.  
An hour later, I watched as my cuties, some Ice Spirits, and Snowflake demons chewed through the wyvern boss' body.  
The cleric was staring at me, as if I was a monster, while the rogue was checking out the Totem I slammed into the floor.  
""How? You didn't even move?!"" the cleric says.  
I chuckle.

  
""We Woolly Mammoths are usually barbarians, warriors, fighters, monks and so on, taking the physical path.  
I...I had another talent, so I made sure I can do everything my clansmen can do, but with magic."" I say.  
""But you just cleared a dungeon in an hour, that usually takes 2 days for an experienced team.  
Also, you used all the elements, summoned at least 19 different types of summons, and your shamanic buffs were in the hundreds!"" he shouts.  
""Well, I thought you wanted to see what I can do, so I showed a small part of my skills...otherwise only ice magic could have frozen this entire dungeon."" I say.  
""HOW DID YOU MASTER SO MANY THINGS?!"" he roared.  
""Now, cleric, you are rude..."" the fighter started.  
""I am 932 years old, me ma would beat me up if I didn't master this many things."" I smile.  
The cleric sighed, and the rogue giggled.  
""Fine. Welcome to the team. First thing you have to do: buy us drinks at the inn."" he says, leaving.  
I nod happily, and follow them out of the dungeon.  
Finally, I have a herd outside the Eye...I can start my adventure!",129

""You could have played an orc, like Carol,"" Randy pointed at her female orc fighter character sheet.

""That's just a green-skinned human,"" Gavin shrugged. ""Also, reminds me too much of she-hulk. I wanted to be special.""

""Yea, why don't you ask to roleplay a Ninja Pirate Robot Zombie?"" Randy was getting annoyed. ""Look, woolly mammoths don't exist in  Neverwinter. Much less Wooly Mammoth beast man. What's next, are we going to allow vampire eldritch mind flayer squids?""

""Actually great idea!"" Gavin was genuinely thrilled, completely missing the sarcasm in Randy's voice. ""That's totally going to be my next character for our next campaign.""

""Randy, think of this as flavor text,"" Jake sighed. ""Gavin still has to follow typical Beast man rules.""

""Fine, fine,"" Randy waved his hand about impatiently. ""Okay, now we have a fighter, wizard and cleric. Let's move on to questing.""

""Let's take this quest to befriend the poor lonely eldritch god,"" Carol pulled out a homebrew source book. ""This could be fun. Instead of combat, we'd be competing to create the best foods, travel all around the world to collect rare ingredients...""

Randy facepalmed upon seeing the title and the cover page full of tentacles.""....Collected Tales of Elvari? The...who wrote this?""

""We can pick a different scenario if you don't like this one,"" Carol opened her bag to reveal a few more homebrew source books. ""This one actually has werewolf pirates and vampire ninjas. It has several seafaring scenarios and—""

""Before things get even weirder, could we please stick to the current scenario?"" Randy pleaded, figuring an adventure where the only unusual thing was a Woolly mammoth beast man master wizard with 500 years of experience couldn't get any more bizarre than whatever homebrew quests Carol had in her bag.

1ln5lh5,n0d4rgf,"It's a small thing to eat a hot meal. Be it the eggs, bacon, or waffles, the sight in and of itself is a welcome reprieve from the chaos as I set my blood-stained duffle bag of the booth and stare into my shaking gloves. They're stained with blood, and I'm missing my two smallest fingers on my right hand. 

But I'm alive as the waitress, who had ushered me inside, finally appears at the table with a worried expression and note-pad. Her voice is quiet despite the distant thunder of falling artillery. ""Are you alright, sir?"" 

The best I can do is to point my still bleeding and mangled hand toward her while doing my best to keep my gaze from blurring. ""Just get me the waffle. The White House is gone, and all my friends are dead. I'll pay you anything you want.""

""..."" 

Her silence spoke volumes as she began to pen the order. It was just me and the sound of the pen on paper as I closed my eyes tight and fought the urge to scream. This couldn't be real; I must've died in that forest with everyone else.

""Do you want coffee with that?""

""Yes- please."" The sound of tearing paper cut the silence as I looked up to see her gaze turn toward a distant chef in the rear kitchen. The man's fuzzy white mustache spoke to the ancient wisdom he held. 

""I need an All-Star-Special!"" The chef nodded before disappearing, and the sounds of clattering kitchen utensils began. 

With the matter settled, she refocused her attention and sat down hard on the opposite side of the booth with the torn ticket in hand. ""This one's free if you can tell me what's going on out there.""

I stared at the table for a moment and studied its long grain as sorrow threatened to break my weary bearing. That trace memory of the expedition's second day and the family hung from a tree terrorized my mind. And yet I whispered under my breath. ""They're not taking prisoners.""

""Who?""

""Bandits, aliens, it doesn't matter, it's hell."" Again; the din of that pen rolling across the paper rattled as I cast a glance toward the midnight forest beyond. It'd been eighty days, but it feels like years since I've been able to just sit in the somber quiet.

But it was the grim sigh from the hostess that drew my attention as she set down her notes onto the table. ""We can't stay here then."" 

I looked down in shame; we'd failed. Then again; there was only so much that we could do if even the waffle house was closing.",7

I lay my shovel on the ground, staring into the open grave. The same grave I’ve seen so many times. The same body I’ve seen so many times. I check my watch again.

23:56

Tonight is different. I don’t yet know why, but I feel it. An ordinary person would feel this way, knowing what I am about to do. But this usually is not a task I fear. I can feel the sweat dripping down, my palms shaking, my legs trembling. Something is not right tonight.

23:57

My eyes dart from the watch to the blade set beside the headstone. Its grip is firm - a small and familiar comfort. My hands steady as I feel my resolve return. Despite the anxiety, I am sure of my success. I’ve done this every night.

23:58

I move into position. Blade held high over the decayed body. Just as ever. Just as always. Yet that feeling comes back. As I stare at the corpse I feel dread. And yet there is no explanation. What is different!?

23:59

Did I forget something? My hands falter, I’m losing grip. I fight to keep it steady, but the blade is slipping free. I have no choice. Before the sword escapes my grasp I plunge it straight into the lifeless corpse. And nothing. Until.

There is a monster hiding under my bed. 

When I was a child, my parents dismissed it as delusions. I was afraid of the dark and the unknown. The line between fantasy and reality was blurred. When I grew up, I'd realize it wasn't there.

Dad took my hand and crouched down. I followed him because I knew we wouldn't see it. I knew it was there because of the whispers. Its coarse voice echoed throughout the room. It caused me to shake in my bed.

In response to this, Dad sat next to me and told me he heard nothing. I held onto him because the monster's words were hurtful. He said that no one would ever love me. He said that I wasn't worthy of love. Worst of all, he said that I was lying to everyone.

That caused a huge panic in my parents. I went from charming boyish fears to psychological disorder. They took me to a therapist who talked to me about my life. They arranged for a ton of parent teach conferences and called other parents to ask how I was doing. Nothing made sense to anyone.

I had many friends at school. A few kids were mean, but I wasn't bullied. My grades were fine. I loved my parents, and I loved my siblings. I was generally happy and enjoyed playing baseball, fishing, and reading. The therapist said that I was extremely well-adjusted. The monster under my bed was concerning. 

As a teenager, they decided that I had a generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed pills. I decided to lie and say it helped. In reality, I learned to kill the monster when I woke up. 

It attached itself to the top of the bed frame near the headboard wherever it went. It was the size of my pinky, and it was vulnerable to the pocket knife that I carried with me. I killed it every morning. I learned to enjoy hearing it scream.

This escalated our little war. It began to get specific with its threats and truths. I started to kill it slower and slower. When I went to college, I disguised this activity as part of a morning prayer, but my roommates caught on. They thought I was just weird. 

I moved out on my own as soon as I could. I began prying it off the bed and holding it on the table stabbing it. Lighting the oven, I burned and boiled it alive. It became a game of mine to kill it.

""You are lying to everyone. I know what you really are. I know why you are ashamed. I know why you will never be happy. I know why you will never truly love someone.""

Those are the words it speaks now. A part of me wonders if it speaks the truth. If it is true, the shame would be too great to bare. As such, I keep killing it. I have to go through this to feel safe and content. 

Safe and content. Yes, that is exactly what I feel. I am fine with my life as it is and how it will go. I am safe, content, and alone.

1lmzrkj,n0c3kzd,"*You think drawing is gonna make me go away?*

I don’t know. It might. “No, I know it won’t.”

*You thought slashing your wrists would do it.*

“It did.”

*Aw… sweetie. No it didn’t. You can’t kill me.*

“Watch me.”

The knife is hot now. So hot my finger can only tap the blade before it instinctively flees. I know this heat. It’s enough to make an entire line of a blister. I wrap my hand tightly around the handle of the knife, and pull down my sock. I readjust where the back of blade will hit so that it rests just above the last mark.

Maybe it’ll be hot enough to scar forever, but I don’t know. Some of the old ones are going away, so maybe not. But I can tell by some of them that they’re probably going to stay for at least a long time. I think this like I’m some twisted version of an expert… *Well, you’ve been doing this shit for five and a half years, I’d fucking hope you’re an expert by now.*

“Shut up.”

*Make me.*

“Fine.”

My hand shakes a little in anxious anticipation as I shove it against my ankle. It hurts. It hurts so bad that I use my left hand to shove the collar of my shirt into my mouth and bite down. It doesn’t ease the pain, but it makes it feel like it’s farther away. There’s no voice. She went away.

“Maybe I killed her this time.” Only I know I didn’t. I know she’ll be back. I’ll wake up tomorrow, and she’ll be there. She’ll be talking. Taunting.

I carefully pull my sock up so that it doesn’t touch the skin until I carefully lay it across the burns—old and new. Now that she’s gone for the night maybe I can finally sleep. So I shove my earbuds into my ear and drop my head on the pillow. It’s a playlist of songs that resonate with the souls of broken people. Not that I want to call myself broken, but it soothes me to sleep too fast for me to call it anything other than resonance.

———————————————————————————

*Wakey, wakey, sleepyhead.*

Oh, she’s back again. “Not now, it’s too early.”

*It’s already 8 o’clock.*

16 more hours until today ends. How many minutes is that? 600 plus 360. 960 minutes. It’ll take too long to find out how many seconds. It doesn’t matter. It’s too long. Too much time to fill. Could I go back to sleep?

*You’re not getting off that easy. Don’t you feel it?*

“Of course I feel it.”

You probably want to know what “it” is. It’s weird, to say the least. I can try to explain, but you need to understand that you’re in my head. With me, and with *her.* So if you think I’m crazy, you’re onto something, but everyone is crazy in their own mind.

It is the pain of being awake. The pain of being alive and not feeling the reason for it. The pain of existing but seeing no value in existence. And that pain might sound like nothing to you, but it inspires the worst. It inspires a pain worse than the pain of a burning hot knife killing your cells, shriveling them until your body can only let serum fill the void in a desperate attempt to protect your body. It fills the void in your skin, and only your skin. It doesn’t fill the void in your soul, and it doesn’t drown that stupid fucking voice that won’t go away. 

I walk downstairs and there’s the knife, right next to the lighter. Nobody in my family would think a second thought, seeing those two objects together. After all, both are mine, why wouldn’t they be near each other on my desk? But I see them together and I know I need to kill the voice.

So I pick up the knife, and I flick the lighted. Because otherwise the voice will live, and I won’t.",6
1lmzrkj,n0ckt4y,"I look at my backyard, waiting.  
He should be here soon.  
I murder a person every single day...but it is the same person each day.  
Does that make me a serial killer? Or simply a murderer?  
Also...is it murder if it is out of self-defense?  
""Honeeey, I am here."" the voice echoes, as someone enters my backyard.  
He is here...again.

  
""Can't you give up, already?  
I said no."" I say.  
""Come on! We have been together for 5 years!  
Just let me take some blood samples, and maybe an egg or two, and I will clone you, Jess!"" he says.  
I shoot him.  
At this point, after just 10 days, I went from never having fired a shot, to precisely hitting him right between his eyes.  
He falls like a sack of potatoes...then sinks into the ground.  
I sigh.  
He will be back.

  
Early in the morning, I wake up startled, by sizzling sounds.  
I go to the kitchen, to see him cooking bacon.  
""Making your favorite..."" he starts, but I shoot him in the head.  
He falls onto the counter, but disappears before he could truly touch it.  
I sigh.  
Eating the bacon...I groan.  
Why is it so tasty?  
A bit later, he knocks on my door...again.

  
""I won't give up. You will be mine. Clone or real..."" he grins, holding chocolate and flowers.  
I look up, where I installed a camera.  
Dude was a researcher, and clearly succeeded in perfect cloning, and I...  
I am live-streaming my murder-spree.  
I know they think it is a comedy show, or something, and not real, but I hope the government has more insight, and will realize what is happening.  
And then, they will go to seize his technology.  
""Bye, Adam."" I say, shooting him again, he disappears, and I take the flowers, and chocolate, taking them inside.  
If he wasn't obsessed with my body, and cloning me...he would have been a good boyfriend.  
Those 5 years were good...alas...  
He had to go mad.",5
1lmy18x,n0bhoz1,"A distant door slammed. Chuckling, you lifted your head to get a better whiff and inhaled deeply. 

Adrenaline. It has such a sweet yet sour scent to it. Combined with that of sweat, and it was a potent, heady mix. So much so you could almost taste that unmistakable odour - fear. The note always gets them going. Right now, their pupils will be dilating and blood will rushing to their extremities, ready to run. With your next breath, you savour it, close your eyes, and start to focus. 

Listening intently, you hear as that gentle rhythmical heart beat begins to accelerate. A strong firm pulsation.This one must be young and healthy. Crouching down, you place your fore-hoof on the floor and wait. Within moments you feel the vibrations of their footsteps through the stone  

Light steps, cautious. They were almost... meticulous. Planned. Female? No. Too sure footed. A young male. Well disciplined. Confident. You quickly notice there was no jangling of buckles. He must have good quality sandals. Aristocracy or nobility perhaps? How exciting - it had been quite some time since a prince crossed the threshold. 

With a grin, you realise this one might have some semblance of intelligence - the rich usually do. He may actually put up a decent fight. You wonder what weapons he carries. They say that the pen is mightier than the sword so perhaps this one thought to map out the labyrinth in some way as he walks. Very few ever seemed to work out that escaping was just as important as finding you. 

Hopefully he wasn't such a fool as the last person. She brought a bow and arrow of all things! With so many tight corridors and turns, she had barely drawn it back before you tore her head off. Definitely too stupid to deserve more of a battle from me. Such an insult of a sacrifice. King Minos had been lazy with his selection of that one. Unsurprising. She was number 13 after all. You'd made your dissatisfaction known that year, by casting a drought across Crete for her.

Standing back up, you stretch. A low rumbling escapes your lips. The shadows of your horns dance across the ceiling and for a moment, you enjoy watching the flicker of the torch flames that cast them. After a moment you decide it was time. Letting out an almighty roar, you signal to this new human. The hunt has begun and this Minotaur is out for blood.",12
1lmster,n0afyz0,"""No, no, you're not listening,"" Mrs. Hexim says. ""The thing that stole my purse wasn't a monster. It was a human."" 

The Sheriff's red eyes widen. ""Impossible. There hasn't been a human sighting in over seventeen years."" 

Mrs. Hexim crosses her tentacle arms. ""I know what I saw. Pasty white skin. Stubby little hands. The whole bit."" 

The Sheriff flips his notebook open and begins writing. ""Continue."" 

""Well, I was just walking down Main Street when I saw that horrific thing walking towards me and smiling. I know how dangerous humans are, how a single touch from them can give us incurable diseases, so I froze in place, hoping it wouldn't notice me."" 

""And then what happened?"" 

""It told me to give it my purse, which I did immediately.""

""If it really was a human, then you did the right thing. Nothing disarms them faster than giving them what they want.""

Mrs. Nexim sighs. ""There's no if. It was a human."" 

A panicked voice comes through the Sheriff's walkie. ""Sheriff, come in, Sheriff.""

The Sheriff grabs the walkie, puts it up to his mouth, and clicks the side button. ""What's going on? You sound flustered."" 

""We've got someone here claiming to be a purse snatcher."" 

""Okay, and what's the problem?"" 

""They're human, sir."" 

The Sheriff's stomach drops. ""I-I'll be right there."" He looks at Mrs. Nexim and says, ""Stay here,"" then exits the room, with his hand on his gun. He walks down the hallway, his heart pounding in his ears as he nears the front desk. *It's probably just kids playing a prank. Humans can't possibly be back.*

The Sheriff's eyes widen as he turns the corner, and mutters, ""Holy shit."" 

The human looks at the Sheriff and waves. ""Hi there."" It is about five feet tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. 

The Sheriff draws his gun and signals the other three officers to draw theirs as well. ""What business do you have here, human?"" 

The human puts their hands up and says, ""Wo, just take it easy, man. I felt bad about taking the tentacle lady's purse earlier today and figured I should do the right thing and return it.""

""You can put the purse down and lie on the ground."" 

""Okay, but can you just lower your guns first?""

""That wasn't a request!"" The Sheriff yells. 

The human starts crying. ""This isn't fun anymore. I want to go home."" 

""I'm sorry, but I don't think you're going to be able to do that.""",28
1lmster,n0afzks,"""No, no, no. This is all a big misunderstanding."" The human lowers its hands and steps forward. ""Here, I can prove it."" It reaches for its face.

A gunshot echoes through the precinct, and blood begins to squirt from the human's chest.

The Sheriff's head snaps to the officer who fired the gun. ""What the hell was that, Davis?""

Officer David drops the gun, his arms shaking. ""I-I didn't know what to do. It was coming towards us. And it looked so vicious.

Two demons in their early teens rush into the precinct with their phones out, presumably recording.

One of them runs to the human shouting, ""You shot Jimmy! How could you shoot Jimmy?""

""No, stay back, kids,"" the Sheriff orders as he walks towards them. ""Humans are carriers of disease. The shortest touch could kill you.""

The yellow demon looks up at the Sheriff with tears in his eyes. ""He's not a human, you idiot. He's a shape-shifter. This was supposed to be a prank.""

1lmmz72,n08xut2,"Alyssa caught dozens of stares as she followed her new party leader through the city gates. The young man had the dignity to hold his head high despite the attention, although he did a poor job of not looking nervous. A bead of sweat had formed on his brow and was slowly sliding down his face. Not that her other two party members, the mage and the cleric, did much better. Poor Cicely looked about ready to bolt, and Renault kept wringing his hands within the wide sleeves of his robes.

For Alyssa’s part… well, she was used to the stares. Murmurs of “Black Hand” and “Assassin” followed her wherever she went. No, the only thing that bothered her was how those same murmurs and stares now marred her first party with the same brush. It had been one of her main reasons for never joining one. Like it or not, she had a reputation now, and that reputation would stain whoever she came into contact with. 

“Ma’am,” Kent said after a few minutes of walking, turning back to get her attention while ignoring the watching townsfolk. “If you’d like, I can head into the Guild Hall to turn in our quest while you and the others find an inn.” 

A small smile tugged at Alyssa’s lips as she looked up at the much taller but far weaker young man. Kent was a good sort, a classic knight in shining armor. Despite still only being level one, he’d managed to get both Alyssa herself and his own party out of that dungeon. A fact that Alyssa would be eternally grateful for… and eternally embarrassed.

Alyssa knew what Kent was actually doing here. He was giving her an opportunity to save face by not walking into the Guide Hall with her new party to report that she’d been saved by a bunch of brand-new adventurers. She, however, didn’t consider it a shame whatsoever — embarrassing, sure, but not shameful. Dungeons were chaotic at the best of times, and even a weak one like she’d been scouting might occasionally decide to make someone part of the adventure.

When Kent’s party had entered the dungeon with her still present inside, the core had apparently decided to make *her* part of his quest. Scooping her up and placing her in a cage that was impossible to break out of — at least, from the inside. And upon seeing the party meant to save her… well, Alyssa thought that her luck had finally run out. It had taken Kent’s heroics, Renault’s skill at ward breaking, and Cicely’s timely healing to save her. And for that, Alyssa owed the group her life and her loyalty.

For a moment, Alyssa closed her eyes, reaffirming her previous decision to stay with this group. She heard the murmured whispers of “Black Hand” around her, and she could practically smell the wreak of condescension on the other adventurers milling around the Guild Hall. Level one adventurers were good for nothing than scorn, after all. But for Alyssa, her new friends were heroes in the making. Each and every one of them was destined to create legends far greater than her own. She was just happy to be able to tag along.

Opening her eyes once more, Alyssa met Kent’s gaze. “No. We’ll all go and turn in our quests. Together.”

Kent smiled, his joy outshining every stare and whisper. “Glad to hear it,” he said, turning. “Let’s head inside.”

The Priestess smirks.

I nod.  
She pouts.  
""No fun. Come on! React! Will you be here the same as you were when we campaigned against the invaders?"" she says, poking me.  
""Uncleeee! We have a herb gathering mission in the forest."" my cute nephew saves me.  
I bid farewell to the Priestess, and leave.

  
Watching over the newbies gather the herbs, while every now and then glancing back paranoid, brings back memories.  
But...  
Why is she here?  
""OH! A Silver Star Mushroom! This can make good medicine against the Blight..."" the Priestess says, knee deep in mud, between the newbie adventurers.  
She is literally the Avatar of the Goddess of Light, a Chosen One that can become a Goddess when need arises.  
Why is she bothering me?  
Again?

  
After the herb gathering mission, they got to F rank finally, and chose a goblin lair cleaning mission.  
I tensed up a bit.  
Goblins are known as ""newbie killers"".  
I stalk in the shadows, making sure they can learn, and face danger on their own, but also ready to jump in whenever I need to.  
""Lookie at that! Grim Assassin is a doting uncle! Aww."" the Priestess says, poking my side, teasing me.  
I try to ignore her.  
She chatters away endlessly, for the entirety of the mission, which went well.

  
At the Guild, my nephew and his party show the proof to the receptionist, and end today's aventuring.  
""Auntie! Uncle! Thank you for watching over us!  
Have fun!"" they say, leaving.  
I freeze.  
""A-auntie? H-Have fun? M-me and him?!

1lmmz72,n0a5ma8,"I sighed as the warrior asked, or rather, demanded me answers his query. Hansel is a good man, far better than most I've met in my line of work, but I also know that he tend to jump the gun when things looked morally dire to all. 

And by all means, he has every right to be very, very cautious about me. The lone wolf of the guild, the solitary scope amid the thickets, the Black Hand of The Abyss. My rifle has filled enough graves to turn a farm into a forest of crosses, the lake a river of blood. By all means, I am a few steps away from being declared a persona non grata if not for every murder to be sanctioned by the states, those damned bastards. 

And then a few weeks earlier, this same guy who shot a corrupt priest right in the middle of his congregations turned up with a pack of new adventurers, who are not only consisted of young, nubile women, but also fawned on them like a lovestruck servant than a feared assassin.  Anyone with a shred of brains between their ears can see something wrong with this arrangement. 

I looked around the tavern, seeing many eyes staring at me in anticipation. Warriors, rogues, mages, priests, merchants, fighters of all stripes and trades staring down at me, demanding answers with their gaze. I sighed deeply, feeling the pressure building up into a distasteful ending. I hate being out in the open like this, but with Hansel on my case and the new adventurers needing my help...

I sighed, finished my drink, then presented a skull pendant from my neck. ""I, Sir Alexander Buckshot, will tell you all nothing but the truth.""

Dozens of breath taken away, revelations settling in. I've invoked my real name, and they knew that this is no laughing matter. Hansel frowned, his body prepared himself for the answer. I waited, thinking of an answer that will suffice. Silence reigned, its presence a blessing to my often overstimulated ears. 

Then, I give the silence a sound. 

""Those girls....They were the first few who showed me kindness. The first few who taught me mercy when the world taught me cruelty. The few, who looked up to me for guidance, and in return, followed my words like gospel. They were my precious students, and I am their beloved Sensei.""

“Now listen here you little shit”

Klara had the demon spawn pinned to the wall of the tavern. 

The demon spawn Luther whimpered and hissed struggling against his grip to no avail. The acidic spittle burning his captors naked armour-less hands hardly seemed to bother her.

“Your father and I had a pact “

“You …. It’s you … black.. the black hand “ Luther spat

“What are you doing with the likes of …”

Klara turned around to face her crew 

A robust young dwarf Dhuran, lay  prone passed out, his bushy beard nestled under him like a large  skunk.Even when asleep he held on to his flask of Ale for dear life 

Beside him lay a slender lady elf, Eliza. She wore her extremely impractical dress and still had her bow slung around her shoulders . She whistled a little as she lay there passed out.

And next to her ,a beautiful beautiful man clad in leather armour, his twin bronze daggers sprawled on either side.
His eyes were closed but his jaws remain clenched which beautifully showed off his high razor sharp cheekbones. Stefan 

Klara couldn’t help but sigh

She heard the demon spawn who she forgot about start to cackle 

Klara blushed . The cursed thing could read minds! Especially if they involved ….

“The black hand of the Abyss, the vanquisher of the dark lord …… came out of retirement because “

The damn demon was wheezing laughing now , his mirth palpable.

“Because she has the hots for the delicious rogue and his team of hopeless peasant misfits “

Klara fought down the urge to crush the demons head to end her embarrassment 

The demons laughter grinded to a halt 

Oh right the demon could sense all strong thoughts and emotions.

“Listen here Demon Spawn” 

Klara stared the trembling demon down , who was now absolutely silent .

“ You and your kin have violated the covenant between me and your father Luther the Damned “ she hissed 

“And I am within my rights to kill, maim and make an example of all your brothers who have joined you in the city tonight “

“We will not do it again “ the demon whimpered

“The lot of us will leave”

“You will do no such thing” Klara shushed the demon

“You will ambush us tommorow again as you planned but you will seek to do no harm .
 You will miss every blow except those aimed at me”

“And you will let these three “

Klara pointed at her crew 

“Hit you , fight you away and you will let the human save me “ 

The demon looked confused  but nodded and scurried away as Klara released him 

“He-They could use the boost in confidence “
Why was she explaining herself to a demon

He looked back scared and whispered

“You should just ask him out “

And disappeared into the night.",13

""So, why am I here? What's so special about me?"" Lyra asked. Her morning so far had been rather unexpected. She was investigating some unusual temporal interactions, and as a result, she woke up somewhere else. A tall, humanoid reptilian appeared shortly after and welcomed her to 'reality', as he called it. 



""Special? You thought you are special?!"" Serpentus didn't hide his cold-blooded mirth at her question. ""Please stop. I can only laugh so much...,"" he added as his laughter died down. ""Humanity is an experiment. We pulled you out of the simulation by ""mortality"" because we need the server. ""'Humanity' is nothing more than 700 million constructs with simulated sentience."" 



""Okay. You say that, but I'm still here, there's a reason, isn't there?"" Lyra asked with a smile. She was amused that she knew why she was there before he did. 



""I've explained it,"" Serpentus repeated it, and she got the impression it was the first time he'd ever needed to. He gave a curious look as if he couldn't believe she was asking. ""We pulled you out of the simulation by 'mortality' because we need the server. You're dead, as is every other human on Earth."" 



""I heard you,"" Lyra nodded. ""But, that doesn't answer my question at all. You said you needed 'server space'. Why am I here instead of just deleted?"" she asked. ""Surely this consciousness that I'm experiencing right now still requires server processing power, wouldn't you think? And, the last time I checked, just this morning, Earth's population was in the billions.  Magnitudes larger than 700 million."" 



""I don't think you understand the situation you've found yourself in,"" Serpentus began, but Lyra shook her head. 



""I don't think you understand the situation I've put myself in, Mr. Serpentus,"" she giggled. ""Your scam is so unorganized, I can just walk in through the door that no one is supposed to know about, and I'm automatically accepted as a victim. My name's Lyra, I represent Sharp Development,"" she added. ""While we don't necessarily mind your business; you are currently operating on one of our Servers. I'm here to formally request you take your operation to an unclaimed Earth; I'd be happy to help you find a suitable one."" 



""You're an imaginative one, that's why we kept you around,"" Serpentus smiled. 



""I'll tell you what, I'll give you that one for free,"" Lyra smiled. ""I'm just relieved it was a simple scam, and not more complicated trouble. But, if the next words out of your mouth aren't, 'You've got a deal', I'm shutting you down. Right here, and right now,"" she said. 



""Now, before you say anything, I want you to think really hard about it. You're exposed already, there's no question. I've already made it clear you're not in any direct trouble yet, and I'm willing to help. There is a possibility you're not familiar with Sharp Development yet, I can understand that. But, I walked in here with full knowledge, and I can see what you really are right now,"" her eyes glowed with golden stars. ""You might think you're big shots hopping from Earth to Earth putting on this big show about how you're pulling them out of the simulation. But, I assure you, Sharp Development is quite a big deal. You referred to humanity as '700 million constructs'; I know that's wrong because we own more than that many Earths. You don't have to believe that part necessarily; but, let me ask you this. If I'm standing here telling you that I know you're lying, and you're actually lying. Do you really want to bet against yourself by not taking my offer?"" Serpentus stared into her eyes for a moment, and she kept the golden stars active as she held his gaze. 



""You've got a deal,"" he said as the snake form dissolved to reveal a portly teenager with blond hair. ""I'm Webber, I look forward to working with Sharp Development,"" he said. 



""Hi, Webber,"" Lyra smiled. ""You made the right choice.""

“What?” 

“I think it’s just touched eight actually.” 

“Eight billion?” the woman whispers. She looks like a woman, although I imagine her true form is far more metal and wire than flesh and bone. She is simply presenting herself in a form that I can comprehend. I hear the whirring of fans, and the increasing pitch of some nearly silent hum. 

“What’s going on?” I ask, although I’m beginning to get the idea. 

Ecosystems, even if they are only virtual ones, follow a pattern. Populations form, they grow, and they reach a stable plateaued state. Until the humans outsmarted the blocks imposed by the simulation, the patterns repeated. Plagues wiped out most of a few generations, natural disasters took out entire villages, and wars took lives in the millions. 

Wars were still constant, but disease didn’t kill like it used to. Even natural disasters had evacuation plans. Humanity grew like an invasive plant on the planet, overtaking and unbalancing the entire world. Or at least, the simulation of it. 

But even virtual systems were designed to carry certain loads, to have certain limits. And their system was carrying ten times the weight it was designed to. Flesh bent and grew to accommodate new needs. 

Machines only broke.

1lmqxrm,n0b4g9q,"You knew something terrible was coming from the moment the ravens started to appear.
 
 
**One for sorrow, two for joy.**
 
 
They showed up on a cool, misty Thursday morning in April. Just a few at first, sitting high on your rooftop with their eyes glinting sharp and clear in the blue light of dawn.
 
 
**Three for a girl,  four for a boy.**
 
 
They weren't loud or obnoxious. They didn't try to steal any of your corn. They just *were.*
 
 
**Five for silver, six for gold.**
 
 
On Friday, they sat on your fence and watched as you weeded your garden and planted the sage and rosemary cuttings you had rooted over the winter.
 
 
**Seven for a secret never to be told.**
 
 
On Saturday, they joined you on your walk through the forest, silent and observant as you placed offerings to the spirits and guardians of the earth, the stone, the wood, and the water.
 
 
**Eight for a wish, nine for a kiss.**
 
 
On Sunday, they followed you to the market, cawing in delight as the local children tossed them crusts of bread and handfuls of roasted lentils.
 
 
**Ten a surprise you don't want to miss.**
 
 
On Monday, they followed you to Mrs. Hofram's cottage, half a league down the main road to the south, where they perched outside of her window while you gave Mrs. Hofram the special tea you had brewed for her joint pain.
 
 
**Eleven for health, twelve for wealth.**
 
 
On Tuesday, dawn painted the world red and orange as a storm-darkened sun crept up from the horizon. You could feel the pressure in the air, the static charge of the atmosphere. You bathed and dressed and listened to the ravens fluff their wings and talk quietly amongst themselves.
 
 
**Thirteen, beware. It's the devil himself.**
 
 
The moment Calyph sets foot on your land, your wards crackle to life, and you feel a gentle tug on your magic as they activate the protective sigils you have placed by your front gate.
 
 
Outside, you hear a man curse loudly.
 
 
You open your front door and cross your arms over your chest, leaning against the door frame with a smile.
 
 
 ""Good morning, Your Highness.""
 
 
Cal glances up from the strangling vines that are wrapped securely around his shoes and grins. ""Good morning, Addie! Mind calling off your wards?""
 
 
""That depends,"" you reply, raising your eyebrows, ""on whether or not you are willing to explain to me why I have thirteen ravens sitting on my roof right now.""
 
 
Cal blinks at you, glances up at your rooftop, and then gives you a sheepish little laugh. ""Haven't the slightest idea, my dear. Nothing at all to do with me, I assure- OUCH!""
 
 
He glares up at the tiny, angry ball of yellow light that just zipped out of the ground and smacked him in the middle of his forehead.
 
 
""You should know better than to lie to a witch in her own domain, Cal,"" you say in a mild voice, waving your hand to dismiss the spell. ""Try again.""
 
 
Cal frowns. Opens his mouth. Closes it.
 
 
And then he sighs. ""I need a favor.""
 
 
""Of course you do,"" you mutter. With another wave of your hand, the vines disappear from Cal's feet. ""Come on, then.""
 
 
""I... can't. Not yet.""
 
 
You frown. ""Why not?""
 
 
The prince glances over his shoulder. ""Alright, come on out. Ah, but remember: move *slowly,* just like I showed you.""
 
 
You shift your gaze to the line of trees on the opposite side of the dusty road, and you watch as a very large, inhumanly handsome man steps out of the shadows. His dark hair is long, tied back at the nape of his neck. He moves with an awkward grace that makes you think he's used to walking differently, but you're not quite sure what that means.
 
 
And then he lifts his head, and his eyes glint red as blood in the sunlight.
 
 
The power you feel within him is almost incomprehensible, and it hits you like a gust of wind, roaring through your mind and stealing the breath from your lungs.
 
 
You move before you think; a series of defensive wards explode in the air around you and Cal - and the ravens, of course - and you start towards the stranger with your hands raised and ready to cast.
 
 
""Wait!"" Cal yelps. ""Wait, don't kill him!""
 
 
When you speak, your voice is shadowed by the strength of your magic:
 
 
*""You have brought a demon into my forest, Prince of Man,""* you snarl.
 
 
Cal doesn't flinch at the inhuman chorus of voices that speak through you, but he *does* take a step forward, placing himself between you and the demon.
 
 
Stupid idea. You have half a mind to just banish both of them. Let the kingdom fret for a few weeks while Cal enjoys a lengthy stay in the lower domains.
 
 
""He's not a demon, Addie,"" Cal says hurriedly. ""Not anymore, not *really.""*
 
 
You scowl at the prince. *""Explain.""*
 
 
Cal glances over his shoulder and slowly steps aside. ""Um. Addie, this is Abraxos. Brax, this is Adelphi, the savior of Lighthold.”
 
 
You drop your hands and stumble back a step, shaking your head, unable to control the horrified expression on your face. 
 
 
“Tell me that is not the demon king, Calyph,” you say in a shaking voice.
 
 
“Well, I *would,”* Cal muses, “but then you’d hit me in the head with a glowing green ball of light again.”
 
 
You curse under your breath. “Why is he *here?”*
 
 
“Because I need your help.” The demon king speaks with a soft, deep voice that seems to rumble through the ground and vibrate through the air, raising the hairs on the back of your neck. 
 
 
You stare at him for a long moment. And then you turn back to Cal.
 
 
“Explain.”
 
 
Five minutes and a *lot* of carefully defused magical wards later, you are sitting in your kitchen across from the Prince of Lighthold and the King of Hell, staring at them both with an expression of deliberate and utter blankness, the kind of expression you haven’t had to use since the war.
 
 
“-And when Brax showed up to help protect the realmgates, Orlan activated the spell that would have transferred all of Brax’s power to Orlan. Fortunately, I arrived in time to interrupt the spell, but not before Brax’s magic had been almost completely sealed off from him.”
 
 
Your attention has not once left Abraxos. “And Orlan?”
 
 
The demon king lifts his eyes from the table and meets your gaze. “Dead.”
 
 
Cal winces. “Brax was upset. It’s understandable.”
 
 
You raise one slender eyebrow. “So the demon king’s first act as a human was to spill the blood of a high priest, do I have that right?”
 
 
Abraxos doesn’t flinch at your tone. 
 
 
Calyph, however, flinches enough for the both of them. “Technically, his first act as a human was to save the world? And seal the realmgates to prevent an invasion from one of the lesser domains. *Then* he killed the high priest who had tried to steal his power and tear a hole in reality.”
 
 
“The Holy Archon knew the price he stood to pay if he failed,” Abraxos says calmly.
 
 
“Did you?” you wonder.
 
 
A muscle in the demon king’s jaw flexes as he grits his teeth. “No,” he says slowly. “But it is my responsibility to protect my domain, and the realmgates, no matter the cost.”
 
 
“How noble of you,” you say in a dry voice.
 
 
The demon’s large hands curl into fists on the table.
 
 
Calyph clears his throat. “Look, Addie, I know this puts you in a difficult position,” he says quietly. “But I swear to you, Brax had *nothing* to do with the witch hunts that occurred before the war.”
 
 
“Was it your father, then?” you ask in a cold voice. “Was he the one who hunted my kind for sport when I was a child?”
 
 
Abraxos stares at you for a long moment.
 
 
“It was my brother,” he says quietly. “I killed him.”
 
 
The silence that falls over the room is broken only by the faint caw of a raven somewhere above your head.
 
 
“How long will this curse last?” you ask, finally turning your attention to Cal.
 
 
The prince gives you a small, hopeful smile that makes your heart plummet.
 
 
“I was hoping you might be able to answer that,” he says sheepishly.
 
 
You sit back in your chair. “Let me get this straight,” you say in a flat voice. “You want the King of Hell, the ruler of a domain filled with the very demons who once *wore my sisters’ ears as necklaces,* to stay in my home with me *while I help him recover his stolen magic?”*
 
 
Cal shrugs helplessly. “Yes?”
 
 
*”Get. Out.”*
 
 
“Addie, wait…”
 
 
“Please,” Abraxos says, his voice low and soft and curling across your skin like smoke. “I will give you anything you ask.”
 
 
You stare at him for a long time. You want to kill him so badly it *hurts,* and yet… there’s something about him, about the intensity of his gaze, and the hesitance of his movements, and the depth and strength of his voice that makes you feel… 
 
 
*Warm.* 
 
 
Warm the way the sunlight feels in midwinter, when the wind fades and the bright, bitter sky is perfectly still. 
 
 
Warm the way the fire feels when it crackles and pops in your hearth on cool, rainy nights in the spring. 
 
 
Warm the way your sisters’ magic used to feel when they wove it alongside yours in the forest, back when you were children. 
 
 
“Fine.”
 
 
Calyph visibly sags with relief, while Abraxos simply returns your nod with one of his own.
 
 
Later, after Cal has left, you lead the demon king to your living room and sit him down on the armchair by the fire.
 
 
“You need to blink more,” you say sternly.
 
 
He frowns. “Can... can it wait? I’m having a hard enough time remembering to breathe.”
 
 
You send a silent prayer to whatever spirits and guardians might see fit to grant you patience.
 
 
And then you sigh and get to work.",12
1lml3xu,n0bizhh,"""Sir, the spirit n°11235813213455 is trying again to escape Heaven."" The angel frantically reported to the All Mighty. The creature was small, a wheel of fire running in circles, it's only eye resting on the center of it. 

Always looking for irregularities in the Eternal Fields of Heaven, where the just and noble can finally rest. Or at least until their cycle starts anew.

The All Mighty wasn't even bothered. For this was accounted for...

---------------------------------------------------------

The young man was diagnosed as schizophrenic a decade ago. The visions, the noise...
*The disturbing messages he heard each hour*

---------------------------------------------------------

""LET ME GO"" an eternal man shouted with all the might his metaphorical lungs can exert. 
""I HAVE TO GO... I NEED TO GO""
Irascible as no other, the man tried ever since he peered on the ""Ledge of existence"" over his remaining relative. 

His son. 

---------------------------------------------------------

The messages had been incessant ever since dad died. It had been a month ever since, and the young man had double the dose of his anti-psychotics...

But the voices keep talking.

""Eat that baby"" one day.

""Stab that woman"" another mention.

""MAIM, KILL, BURN, MAIM, KILL, BURN..."" The loudest nearly chants, his violent message almost rhythmic... 

There is no end to this torment.

---------------------------------------------------------

""I HAVE TO PROTECT HIM... I NEED TO BEAT THAT MONSTER FOR THE GOOD OF IGNATIUS."" The furious man keep shouting. 
He was a loving man. Supporting his son the best of his abilities... Helping his community.

His death had been a tragedy too early for everyone. 

---------------------------------------------------------

The All Mighty keep watching over this curious soul. Normally, this kind of spirit would meet with absolute oblivion... Their energy infused into everything, and nothing at the same time. 

But something they learnt since the Fall of his lost Choir is that a soul like him shouldn't be wasted... 
For he could and would become the Shield against the wickedness of the Adversary. 

A new archangel.",10
1lml3xu,n08aomt,"One morning, I woke up to find the horned one gone, and a note, floating where it once stood; every morning before this, it would have been there, taunting me with some ominous message or the likes, but this is new.

Better even.

Father's been out of my life for some time. What was written reminded me that, even -if- he -is- dead, he -will- find a way to make things better. He always did. It cost him more than I could ever aspire to give myself.

That was 5 years ago. Today's my 18th.

By night, the horned one has returned. Remade by my father. To put this in layman's terms, he's corrupted the demon. A new concern manifests;  
How does he know what I like in a woman? Has he seen my mind? My search history? Even the incognito stuff?

It'd explain why she looks as she does - the demon, I mean.

I read the letter, held out in her offered hands. It reads...  
""Son. It's me, H. I've carved the tormentor down into a being of relief. I've instilled in her the love for you I cannot provide as a father, nor as a man. I have forged a pair of Bond Rings; have her wear one on her wedding finger, and you, one - you don't need to keep them on forever, just for a few seconds, then the binding of her to your world, to you, will be complete.

Consider it due compensation for the things life has and will put you through, as it did me - even on this side.  
Also, check the other side. You'll find a depiction of my new armour, forged from the torment of the demon.""

So I took the rings into one hand and flipped the paper. He... went and crafted a DOOM Slayer set, complete with an Eternal-style Super Shotgun, with extra-long barrel, and a Dark Age shield.

I decide to put it into a collage picture frame that included my family, and then looked to the demon.  
I take a breath, and ask her- ""I'll skip the formalities, but he didn't write down your name-""

""Sarah."" She answered, meekly. I respond- ""Davoth. Named me after The Father, AKA the Dark Lord-""  
She nodded, having been keened on this knowledge by my father, it seems.

We chat a bit, and then she becomes... impatient - a bit of the old demon remains, but it's twisted in a way where I don't really feel scared about her. I give her one ring - rather, she forced her hand to mine, wanting me to apply it for her.

It felt awkward and a bit overwhelming, but when I was done, she did the same for me, with a smirk that, this time, makes me feel things. Good things.

After a second, the rings glowed, and emitted a beam of strange blueish energy between eachother for another moment before it fizzled out.

We took off the rings and put them on the bedside table, and I was the one to offer ingress into the bed. She did not hesitate.

That was one of the most comfiest nights I've had, but I foresee the future being sleepless. For new, better reasons.

Thank you, father.

1lmey8h,n077dev,"All that once stood lay vanquished.

I stood above it all.

The fact that I had not broken a sweat could be chalked up to genetic deviations.

Vanquishing was hard work. Dont let my dry face fool you.

'You have Succeeded' The fabric of existence spoke. The voice from nowhere, emanated from everywhere.

""As commanded"" My voice tried its best to match the boom. It achieved the level of gravitas as a fart at the bottom of the grand canyon. Deep and reverberating, but still a fart.

""The command ungiven. Yet obeyed"" O only if I could speak like that!

""As reward for an unrequested feat unduly completed, you shall now walk this earth with complete and absolute dominion over absolutely nothing at all.""

""I am hono....Wait what?""

""You shall walk this earth in your mortal coil, free at last.""

""Hold on, I dont mean to question your supremeness. But I dont think you understand the concept of freedom."" My voice lost it's attempts at grand canyon-ness and exclusively took on the quality of a fart.

""... GO ON!"" The very atoms thundered.

""Well, yes, and I might be completely wrong here, but not given me dominion over anyone or anything kind of sets everyone else free....from me. But how does it help me?""

""YOU FOOL!! By not giving you anything I am freeing you from the...""

""The responsibility of anything? I get to live my life not worrying about the weight of responsibility, not being accountable or answerable for my decisions because they no longer can or will effect anyone -including me- and I get to sleep each night with a clear conscious. Free to live my life without the burden of consequence?""

""Umm yes?""

""Can't you give me I dont know, like a McDonalds franchise or something?""

""You want responsibility? You want the burden of decisions, and accountability? You want the fruits of the original sin?""

""Thats all I have man. My screen time was 14hr a day before I set on this task. Why'd you think I did it without you asking? I'm loosing my damn mind doom scrolling all day.""

"".....""

""At this point, Id even settle for shift manager""",142
1lmey8h,n0aywpd,"It took time to understand the power granted me, time I suddenly had plenty of. Too much of. I had dominion over nothing. It sounded weak, it sounded worthless. It sounded like I was being assigned the role of the lowest unwanted beggar. Everywhere I went, everything I saw, everyone I heard. It was all something, and outside of my power. My ""Power."" Even in my head I used air quotes for years.

I struggled to meet my basic needs, bouncing between odd jobs every few months. I couldn't figure out where my skill had gone. I got fired from pushing papers for the insurance company because I made too many mistakes. I got fired from the restaurant for accidentally dumping food on customers too many times. I got fired from the construction gig when everyone had to go behind me fixing my nail placement. I got fired from the roadside cleanup crew for causing more than one accident. I even considered committing a crime that would get me sent to jail, then put back on the clean up crew. Sarcastically of course. They couldn't fire me then. My self esteem was in a really deep hole, waves of depression fought a war in my head and I couldn't bring myself to care what aspect of it would win.

It was talking with a guy down at shelter that changed everything. He was a veteran as many are, but oddly, he was the happiest veteran in the shelter I had ever seen. He shared his story with me, as he did with all who came through. He told about the enemies he fought overseas, then told me about when he came home and had to fight the enemies in his head. The bottle, the needle, the demon. It was all familiar, but it was how he told the story that had us unable to turn away. It was cheerful and open. So unusual. It was when he came to his own solution that worked for him. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He had learned to clear his head of everything and simply exist in the lack of anything going on upstairs. Around me other heads nodded in agreement as something opened in my own head. I had dominion over Nothing. And the universe was full of a whole lot of Nothing.

Suddenly I could feel when people around me cleared their minds, I could tell in a moment exactly how many people were meditating at this moment. But it went so much further than that. The universe was full of a whole lot of Nothing. I could feel the space between atoms, between stars. I could tell exactly the boundaries of everything by the limits of the Nothing between. 

And I could shape it. I could move things by shaping and directing the Nothing. No one in the group at the shelter noticed the small rock I started floating in my hand, it unable to fall through the Nothing I had expanded beneath it. Then it melted away, apparently gone, as I pried apart the Nothing between the atoms and it lost it's cohesion and the individual atoms floated off to join other atoms.

I didn't know what to do with this power yet. But I would learn.",30
1lmx0ex,n0bz39h,"Years have gone by since my adventure started. Well, less of an adventure, more like a long term mission. I found and defeated plenty of monsters, unraveled many mysteries. Dungeons were pretty much expected, but I always got through. I couldn't have done it without my trusty party members. Allies I made along the way, with a wide variety of skills that I would always count on. They had become my family.

All good things must come to an end though. In the end we were all serving the same king, and they were loyal to the kingdom above all else. When we finally fulfilled our mission, we were told two things. First, the king we had served had died in mysterious circumstances. I immediately knew what happened there, the archmage, who had always been jealous of the position, took his chance and backstabbed him, literally. He was the new king. That alone hit hard, but it was nothing compared to what came next.

We were commissioned directly by the traitorous archmage that we would be his personal agents. Only me and my oldest comrade refused. The message came with an add-on. Whoever refused would be executed on the spot. As soon as we knew that, we tried to escape. Only I made it. I had to go on the run, otherwise I would be tracked down and killed on sight. It took me years to shake them off, or rather, make them give up on it. They would assume I was dead.

In a way, I was. Long gone was the brave and charismatic adventurer that went on for the kingdom, and what remained was but a shadow wearing his face, sort of. I had aged pretty significantly, my hair graying and my beard had grown pretty wildly. I kept hiding for a couple of years after my former comrades stopped chasing me, and in that time I had become pretty much unrecognizable.

Then, more news, the first that had interested me in years. The people of the capital had sent out a cry for help, they were dying because of the brutal rule of the archmage, now king. I decided to go, not to help the people, but to get even on the one who wanted me dead. I didn't expect to live much longer anyway.

So I went. My sword hidden under a ragged tunic I had saved, bright green before, now a dull brown. No one knew who I was, for everyone I was just a worn out traveler walking towards the capital. The fields, formerly happy farms, seemed dry with despair. Maybe it was me. Maybe it wasn't. Whatever, I'm not here to smell flowers. After a couple of weeks of near constant walking, I arrived at the capital gates.

""State your intentions!"" Shouted the guard as he approached, sword out of its sheath. Only a small passage had been left open so guards could get rid of hostiles. 

I went past his sword and said in a coarse, tired voice almost a whisper: ""I came to kill the one you call king."" I didn't need to insult him, I had lost that drive long ago.

Surprisingly, he let me in. Turns out, the guards were really close to mutiny, and my presence might just be the excuse they need to revolt. However, his boss was close by and immediately spotted me. I recognized her, the oddly loyal rogue that had been the first to leap out to kill me. She didn't recognize me though.

""Who is this homeless bastard, huh? Have you thrown your brain and dignity down the drain?"" She blared at the guard. 

He was about to say something stupid but I stopped him, stepping ahead and going on my way right through where she was standing. I know the city layout after all, I don't need a guide. She didn't wait and lunged at me yet again. This time, I knew what to do. With little fuss, I took my sword out and put it in her way, letting physics do the work. She may not have recognized my face, but she would never forget my sword. It had been lost with me after all, one of the great arms the kingdom had.

""Y-you..."" She said lowly, a combination of shock, terror and pure hatred in her word.

""You could have said hi."" I said flatly, no empathy at all, before taking it out and cutting her head off. I cleaned my sword before sheathing it again, the guard obviously knew who I was. His face would have been priceless before, awe and even hope showing in his eyes. ""You know what to do. Just don't stand in my way."" I said before going on my way to the castle. No one would leave unscathed, not even myself.",8
1lmx0ex,n0c2tss,"The walk to the castle was decently long, but not too much. Not enough to make me tired on my way there. None of my former team had gone to meet me yet, but I could hear the guards telling civilians to close up shop and go home immediately. Some groaned about curfew being way too early, but it seemed this was the new normal. I still remember how happy the place was before... Just like myself. Who would have thought the city and I would be so similar.

I could hear some noises behind me, skirmishes between loyalist and rebel guards going off, making the few remaining civilians look for cover. I, well, I just kept going. My steps constant, measured, purposeful, empty. Even though I had lost little to no agility, my stride was heavy. It bore the weight of betrayal, of hiding, of essentially being an untouchable. Then, I got to the gate. And of course, everyone was there. Rumor had spread there as well, news travel much more quickly than people.

""You're supposed to be dead."" The tank spoke first. ""Should have joined that white mage friend of yours when you had the chance."" He spat. 

He was either brainwashed or indoctrinated, all of them were. Maybe both. I stared at them, they looked more or less the same, but more mature, and definitely with uniforms to match. They all wore the archmage's colors, making them look like villains in their own right. They pretty much were now. If they could be saved, I had long since stopped caring.

""Let me through."" I said, as flatly as before. ""And I will not kill you.""

""Won't you be begging us to join your side?"" The archer, arrow in his hand, said half surprised half spiteful.

""I know better than to waste my breath."" I replied, as flat as before.

I then started walking towards the castle, and of course they went on me. I knew how they all fought, we had sparred before, each time holding back to not hurt each other. I also knew how they were when they weren't. One by one I managed to dispatch them all, even the archer who had stayed out of the melee and scored a hit on my chest, enough to hurt me but not hitting anything too important. In the end I stood battered, with the bodies of my former friends lying on the floor around me. I only let out a sigh, disappointed it had to come to this, but they left me no option. If I turned around they would have killed me anyway.

In I went into the castle, many staff both fearful and hateful of their new life. I had known many from my days serving the former king, and they all looked like they aged twice as much as they should. They obviously remembered the good old times. These were very much not the good old times. No one interfered with me though, the few remaining guards knew that no one went past my fallen comrades alive, unless they themselves had been killed. Well, one did. I easily cornered him and put my sword to his neck.

""Where is he?"" I asked, my voice as sharp as my blade, even if devoid of any sense of justice.

The guard squealed in my grasp. ""Throne... Room..."" He squeaked, hoping that I would let him go.

I did, kind of. I made sure he wouldn't have any children ever, I wouldn't be risking getting attacked from the back. Eventually I found them, the throne room gates. Closed. I slashed the lock and pulled them open, and of course there he was. That smug little punchable face that had long since tried to remove me from the face of this land. Time to do what I came to do.",7
1lmx0ex,n0c5oxw,"I stood there, waiting for something to come out of his mouth. I didn't wait long.

""Look who finally showed up. Everyone assumed you had to be dead, but deep down I knew you couldn't be. No, not a man of your strengths. You need something big to kill you, not even your former so-called friends gave you that much of a fight. Pity, they were effective agents. However, now that you have so kindly presented yourself, I have the satisfaction of finishing you off myself!""

Finally. I thought he would never end. While he talked, I got close, walking almost all of the throne room while he was deep in his monologue. I didn't wait for him to finish to make my move. Just as his heavily ornamented hands shot forward to cast a spell on me, I rushed forward and cut them off. Then, I stabbed him right in the stomach, he wouldn't be dying immediately. No, that would be too generous.

""Wh... Why? Why are you not saying something about the food of the people? The good of the kingdom?"" He asked, shocked at my extreme directness. I had previously gone out of my way to make friends, or try to reason with many of my foes.

""I've long since stopped caring."" I replied as flatly as ever, not once changing my demeanor. My reason was personal, not really hero-like.

""This isn't you... This isn't the great hero that saved this kingdom years ago!"" He was starting to struggle badly, gravely injured by my slashes and losing quite some blood.

I let out a laugh. An empty, hollow one. ""This is exactly what you wanted, right? Me, broken. And for what? You didn't even taste victory."" 

I then took my sword out and impaled his heart, pulling him out of my way and letting him fall beside me. Quite an unceremonious death, but perhaps still too good for him. It was what I could do though. I thought about sitting on the throne, but instead did so on the steps leading to it. I wouldn't be a good king, and that seat once belonged to someone I truly respected. Mostly the first one.

Guards came rushing in soon after, the mutineers had beaten the loyalists and had gone in expecting to confront an archmage that had ruined countless lives. Instead, they saw a corpse in tainted royal robes and a broken man beside him. They stood silently until one of them piped up, pointing out to my sword. He's made it, they said. He saved us again. I didn't lift my head. I had no real reason to. I had only evened out the favor.

As much as I wanted to leave immediately, everyone begged me to stay. At least until the new king could be appointed. I did, I had nothing to do either way other than hide, and now I didn't even have that. They gave me a room, clean clothes, a bath, even a proper barber to make me look more decent. Now I looked half as good as I once did... But I still felt empty. Hollow.",8
1lmx0ex,n0c70ws,"The new king was formally appointed about two weeks later, by which time the mood of the whole city had shifted dramatically. Out was the iron fist ruling over everyone with overbearing presence, and in came a middle nobleman that was determined not to go down that route. I clapped at his coronation, mostly because everyone else did, but in part because he couldn't be worse than the old archmage.

I stayed for another week, by which time I was asked to state what I wanted. As the savior of the kingdom, I was entitled to pretty much anything up to being the king's right hand man. I only asked for a small home outside the palace, a decent pension to let me live without needing to do anything for money, and to keep my sword. It had got me through so much, it had pretty much become part of me. They begged me to be more involved in ruling the kingdom, I refused. I was done.

In the end, they ceded. I now live in a two story home, where I write memoirs and stories to keep me entertained, and occasionally sell them to feel like I'm doing something. I still have my sword, clean and hanging on one of my wall, ready to be used again if I need to. I really hope it stays there forever. As I remember all that I went through, and where I ended, it all still comes back to me. The joys, sorrows, regrets, everything is still very present. In the end, I know I did the right thing. I helped the people.

Perhaps, deep down, there's still some of that starry eyed youngster that wanted to help everyone in me.",9

1lmaxcu,n06ei6q,"Pestilence.

Our village has cursed that name over and over.

Hal and Agnes, our beloved next-door neighbors who would bring us well water in the morning and trapped game in the evening, were the first to go. A blight ravaged their skin, turned it black and hideous and leaking contagious pus. They drank clean water, ate cooked food, rested as much as they could, but they were gone in mere hours. Nobody even dared bury them. 

We torched the house that they built with their own two hands.

Then, Pestilence found its next victims in Rowan, Merric, and Cedric, the three young village boys whose voices would liven up the days and whose pranks would continue throughout the nights. Their parents only had precious little time to say goodbye before the boys were dead. Their families followed soon after.

We tried everything we could. Not a single soul left their home for weeks after the first deaths. We shut the windows, locked the doors, kept each family member in separate rooms if our houses had them. Nothing stopped it. Not locks, not holy water, not quarantine, not garlic or faith in the Goddess or any other preventative measure. 

The Pestilence went door to door, mercilessly strangling its victims by flooding their lungs with bodily fluid.

Edwin, Hugh, Alden, Bertram, Jasper, Alfred, Reeve, Amos, Leif, Heath, Ellyn, Maeve, Alva, Hilda, Annis, Thea, Astrid, Meryl, Lysa, Moira, Tamsin, Alys, Edda, Clara. Men and women I had grown up with, shared feasts with side by side. All of them, gone in the first few days.

I'm still not sure whether Elara Brown was a witch, but at this point, I don't care. This all started when the Celestial Church took her away, leaving her apothecary clinic unattended. She was an odd type, sure, with her peculiar white jacket, name, dialect, mannerisms and all, but everyone still loved her. Whenever any of us showed the slightest signs of illness, she would mix us something up, throw it into our hands, and send us on our way, only asking for us to pick up a few odd things on our hunting or shopping trips in exchange. Nobody even suspected her of being a witch until a traveling priest just so happened to visit and noticed her.

Perhaps it was just coincidence that Pestilence chose this time to punish us, but my gut told me that had she been here, she could have warded it off.

I was the only one in my village who dared leave. I noticed it, the smell of rot and the growing silence coming from the houses. I knew that we were still being picked off.

So what could I do? 

I ran.

I ran with all my might, through the forest and to the nearest town where Elara might be. I tangled with the Church, begged them to at least let me see the prisoner, but they refused. So instead, I went to the town's underworld and parleyed with the syndicate leaders. I offered them the entire wealth of our village as long as they told us where she was.

As long as they dared enter the homes to claim it for themselves.

My plan worked, and I soon broke into the dungeon where Elara was kept.

She was a frail thing, that Elara, skinnier than any farming woman should have had the right to be. She couldn't swing an axe if it was made of leaves. But she was brilliant in all other walks of life.

When I found her in the dungeon, she was emaciated and starved. I desperately scrabbled at the chains binding her to the floor. They were rusted almost completely through, and I was a lumberjack. With a few swift swings of my trusty axe, I managed to break them, whisking Elara away back to our village with tears in my eyes. I begged her, then, on the sprint back, to please save our village.",198
1lmaxcu,n06gt07,"It started with the plague.

Blue buboes, decaying flesh, agonizing screams. The scent of rot and decay. Mothers torn from sons, husbands from wives, sisters from their kin.

Then the rivers ran red -- with silt, or blood. And the priests raised their hands up toward God, pleading with hands shaken by the hot unsteadiness of fever and delirium. And all around them, the undead and the dying swayed. Yelled. Wept.

A woman was brought forward. She was old; her back was bent from the many years she'd spent applying poultices and picking herbs to create herbal remedies for the village's varying sicknesses. She was a midwife with a hundred births under her belt. She'd brought many back from the edge of death, had eased others' pain into a dull opium-induced peace.

But the people forgot. They needed someone to blame, and so they blamed her.

A band played as she was brought to the stake with her hands tied behind her back. There was laughter and singing. A minister stepped forward -- the music stopped -- he asked in loud, booming voice for her to *confess*. In return, he promised that the men holding the torches would give her the small mercy of slitting her throat before they burned her.

She kept her chin held high and her blue eyes clear.

She said nothing until she screamed.

\---

And then--

It should have stopped, the villagers told each other. But it got *worse.*

The bodies piled up; the crowds that once walked through the marketplace thinned. Men fell coughing from their horses, farmers died in their fields.

Starvation stalked the land. Soon enough, even the animals were not immune to it.

The river ran redder and thicker until it congealed into heap of muddy sludge. Those who drank it vomited until their bodies nearly died of thirst -- and then the sickness came for them, and the deaths multiplied tenfold.

Those who could run from the village, ran.

Then, finally: a lasting silence.

\---

A young woman returned to the deserted village ten years later, carrying a pack upon her back.

Once, she had been old. She'd put her powers toward helping those around her until her death. And still, she did not blame those that had caused it; black magic was an evil thing to dabble with. She knew that she was destined for the Pit. But until then, she wanted to save as many lives as she could.

As the fire had swept her over, she'd imagined that she'd wake in Hell. Instead -- confused, grateful, shivering -- she'd found herself back on Earth, re-taking her first breaths. She was a child again; a contemplative, sullen child with the taste of ashes forever coating the back of her throat. For this reason, she was often silent.

She heard stories of what had happened to her former home; and while she might have been able to summon all of her power to do something about it, and her heart ached for her former friends, she did nothing.

There were some messes, she reasoned, that a person (or, in this case, a village) had to clean up themselves.

She slid from her horse as she approached the spot of what had once been her cozy cottage. She supposed they must have burned it, along with all of her belongings. *Oh well,* she reasoned, looking about, hands on her hips. It was empty. But it was perhaps still home.

It wasn't her mess to clean up, but she found herself wanting to do it anyway.

For a person destined for Hell, she thought, it might be the closest she'd get to salvation.

1lmaxcu,n06iznf,"Our village was lovely.  
Quiet, peaceful, and friendly.  
Agatha, a widow, helped us with ailments, and fever, and while grumpy, and moody, she never said no to someone with an ache or pain.  
When the Church decided she was a witch, we were confused, but they must be right, after all...they are people of God, no?  
Wrong.  
Ever since she was punished for her ""sins"", our village truly descended to Hell.

Without Agatha, nobody was here to heal us.  
Mark, one of our youngest men, and our best hunter, died to a small wound he gained against a boar.  
The pus, and the fever that took him still haunts my nightmares.  
Then our butcher had to give up his profession, and have his son take over because his hands couldn't hold the hatches, and knives...  
His son was not good at his job, and without his father's steady hands to help him...he, he cut off his own fingers.  
But that was just the start.

Without old Agatha, we couldn't foresee when winter was coming, or autumn, or spring or summer for that matter.  
She always said her joints could feel it, and once you live as long as her you learn, but...we didn't know how to.  
We relied on her too much, and now that she is gone...  
The winter was harsh.  
We barely had enough wood to heat our houses, barely enough food to fill our bellies...and the diseases...  
The diseases that with Agatha were a bother at best, now...  
Now turned into deadly ailments.  
We messed up.

Come spring, and we decided to move.  
The village was either cursed, or we really gone down a bad route, relying too heavily on Agatha, and now we are lost without her.  
From the original 20 or 30 families...only 10 are still whole.  
The rest of us?  
We all suffered losses because we didn't know how to deal with a harsh winter, or with the diseases, pains and aches we had.  
The Church might have been right, and Agatha might have been a witch, but...  
We needed her. She helped her.  
And we betrayed her, allowing her to suffer.  
I guess this isn't a curse, nor a punishment for harboring a witch, but the consequences of our actions.  
We deserve this.",39
1lmaxcu,n079u4k,"The knight commander entered the small village hall, the only building still habitable at this point. His cloak stained by smoke, covered in flakes of ash. The hall held the remnants of the village, some 30 people. Several women & a gaggle of children. His men surrounding the singular man left alive. He would have looked young if his face wasn't so hard. His eyes bereft of kindness. He looked at the commander as a wolf viewed a bear, warily but with a clear objective should circumstances warrant.

The commander motioned as he approached and his men parted to give him access. ""I am Knight Commander Wallinger. My men have informed me the occupants of this hall are the only survivors?""

The wolf-eyed man replied, ""Close enough.""

""What happened here? There was no alert of invasion. No reports of monster activity. We were posted some 8 miles away and came at the first sign of serious smoke, yet there's almost nothing left of this village.""

The man closed his eyes for a long moment. ""You want the short version or the long version?""

""I want the truth.""

The man laughed. A short, joyless sound. ""Long version then. Well, the version with the relevant details. The only one who could give you the full version died 3 months ago."" He paused, closing his eyes again.

""14 years I've lived in this village. Came to live here at the age of 5 after our family farm was burned to the ground by the Besquari army. The risk of living near the border of the Empire I guess. Our parents were killed. My elder sister, Lucille, managed to drag me and our toddler sister, Priscilla, across 12 miles of wilderness just ahead of the enemy's advance. Few of the folk living here at the time wanted to take care of 3 orphans. Of the ones who did, only Magda was adamant that the three of us stay together. She seemed kind despite being intimidating. The argumentative villagers shut up when she told them to. And we went to live with her. Magda was tough but fair. So we grew up in a home that knew both love and duty. Did our chores, learned our lessons, got fed enough, knew respect and returned it in equal measure.""

The commander watched as life returned to this man's eyes as he told his story. ""And your name?""

""You can call me Drake. Anyway, as I was saying, Magda was a healer. Well she was many things, but she'd want me to focus on that. Honor in healing. And respect. Much that most of the folk in this village didn't deserve. Jealous types. And hypocrites. But Magda would always shoulder insults and carry on healing the undeserving. Duty to the Preserver above all.""

At the name of the Preserver the commander's eyes widened. Not so much to draw his men's attention, just enough that Drake was sure to.

""Old gods may have fallen out of fashion, she would say, but honor given would still be repaid. Some folk...,"" his gaze passed to the women and children. He touched the stone that hung from a cord round his neck. ""Some folk knew well enough to respect the one who saved their babes. Who cured their ills. Set their bones right. Sadly most who lived in this place took what they needed and treated a holy servant as a villain. A monster,"" his eyes returned to their previous state, like stone or steel made flesh. ""Witch, they spat. Sinner. Whore of the devil. They called for a cleric. A witch hunter. They got the purge they wanted. I remember the day in its entirety. I left early that morning. Hunting in the eastern wilds. Not far from where our family's farm had been. I'd hugged her goodbye as I usually did before such work. A one handed gesture alongside her at the stove. I wanted to get out there early to find a stag worthy of her. 4 hours in the woods. I can still smell the leaves underfoot. The blood leaving the bull elk I'd gotten. The five hour hike back with the beast. The smell of ash when I neared the village. The weeping of my sisters when I'd gotten close enough to see what these villagers and their 'holyman' had done.""

Drake closed his eyes again. A tiny trickly of moisture gathering at the base of his nose. He resumed without opening his eyes, ""I waited for nightfall and readied my cart. Carried what was left of her to it. Drove to the remnants of our farm. Took out my shovel and dug an 8 foot grave in the ruins of our house. Buried Magda in her favorite blanket. Then covered her up and laid a small stone as a marker. It was just before dawn when I returned home. Gathered all the coin in the house. A miracle that none of them had managed to widen their prosecution to my sisters in my absence. Hadn't burned the house down in the interim. So I woke my sisters, gave them all the coin we had, told them to gather all the belongings worth taking or selling, and to head for Ixonil. Lucille knew the plan. Magda had given her the talk years before she had given it to me. They had the skills Magda had taught them. The knacks that I lacked. Forgiveness. Mercy. Hope. I only had Honor. Respect. And Fuel. We knew enough that Magda wasn't a limitless font of tolerance. And that, despite most peoples' understanding of the Preserver, that His servants would be protected. Especially if they suffered the indignity of an undeserving death.""

Drake opened his eyes. He stared intently at the commander. ""The first week few of them noticed. My sisters had left for Ixonil the morning after Magda was killed. I heard some of the village belligerents calling on their recruited cleric to send witch hunters after them. I spoke with the cleric only once. No messages were sent. He advised the villagers to return to normal life under the Celestial Beacon. No one came looking for me. I went back to the house and counted the days. By the 25th day it was obvious there was a problem. All the livestock in the village or neighboring farms were sick. Deathly so. These pious villagers called on their cleric for aid. Save their animals from this this disease. This blight. This pestilence. Try as he might the cleric could find no cure for what ailed the beasts. Within 15 days they were all dead.""

The commander followed along, seemingly unsurprised by Drake's tale. ""By the 60th day the crops began to fail. Every plant, save the oats, shriveled and died in a fortnight. Again the cleric had sought a solution but found none. At the first sign of failure he called for aid from his superiors. Others of his order came. I assume he reported what had happened. Their efforts came to nothing. Those who had showed respect to Magda asked me for aid around this time. Their food was dwindling. Fear setting in. I told them in exchange for my help I would ask them to do something. I presented them with what supplies I could. I told them they should shelter in the village hall if they could not leave the village. And to avoid their neighbors besides those who treated Magda with Honor. Lastly, every child in the village must live in the hall with them. As you can see they agreed to my terms.""

The commander cast a glance to the other survivors here. They seemed in good health and good spirits, despite the chaos outside. He looked back as Drake continued, ""On the 80th day the first villager fell ill. First lethargy, then paralysis, then searing pain in their lower extremities. Pain, then fever, then death. The first villager took 2 days to die. The clerics tried to treat the illness. No success. Soon others exhibited the same signs as the first patient. The symptoms were the same, however after the first 5 or so villagers, the time to die lengthened. 2 days gave way to 4. 4 to 6. 6 to 8. 8 to 10. The villagers were dying so quickly no one wanted to bury them for fear of catching the disease from their corpses. Fools. Still not comprehending their predicaments. 10 days following the death of the first patient, half the village had developed symptoms. 10 days after that all save those residing in this hall were sick. And the dead outnumbered the living. The clerics included. Today the last of them died. If you matched the order of their dying to where they stood around Magda's funeral pyre, it would be a perfect match of those who stood farthest to those who stood closest to her execution. The clerics got the longest sentence for one lighting the fire and the rest by association. The bodies and thus the houses started burning an hour after the last one died.""

The Knight Commander stood. His expression unreadable. ""Withdraw from this hall and mount up. Return to base."" His men did as ordered. He looked toward the survivors. ""On behalf of the Vyrintrian Empire, I offer my condolences and apologies for the death of Magda, servant of The Provider. Should any here have need of shelter or other resources they need only ask and my unit will make accommodations. We shall camp outside the edge of this village this evening and depart in the morning."" He looked directly at Drake. ""I apologize for necessitating the creation of a moniker. My report will omit the presence of anyone called Drake, Lucille, or Priscilla, nor the movement of persons to Ixonil,"" his gaze was not at Drake's face, but at the stone hanging from a cord around his neck. It held a deep green on one side, almost black in its richness. The other side a stark white. A single sigil carved within it, not by tool or hand but formed as though the stone grew around it in perfect order. ""Glory to He who Preserves and Destroys. May His servants ever know the respect they are owed. The Empress shall be informed of the foolishness of those that have perished. Mercy be upon us.""

Drake looked up at the commander. ""Duty to the Preserver above All. You need have no fear of reprisals. The debt has been paid. Peace to the Empress and her people."" He closes his eyes again. And when he opens them a little life returns, softer than before. ""I shall leave this place in the morning. Some here may accompany me, the rest I will leave in your care.""

The Knight Commander nods in acknowledgement, bows, & exits the Hall into the hazy night air of the village ruins.",44
1lmaxcu,n06gwfk,"##Hilda

The rooster called at the crack of dawn. The villagers didn’t get a wink of sleep. Not a single eye lacked bags, and every mouth had a yawn. Breakfast consisted of slices of bread so hard they broke what little teeth remained. No one complained; there was work to do.


The cows needed milking. When Hilda was made to apologize for stealing Samuel’s milk, a cow appeared before everyone’s home the next morning. It appeared to be a blessing at first. They were filled with milk, but their utters burned hands. Some were about to use them for meat. All knifes and blades broke on their coats. Everyone wanted to ignore them. They responded by rampaging through the town. At the first light, the town suffered through milking. At least it was edible.

Hilda next stole a loaf of bread from Jane. Jane yelled at her and lost her voice. Hilda then decided to give the crops the ability to scream. They were insatiable always needing watering. A system was set where people ran back and forth of water while the rest watered. That quieted the plants for a few moments. The screaming resumed until they were watered or nightfall. Rain was provided a welcome break.

The last theft was of Victoria’s wedding ring. Victoria knew not to punish her or suffer consequences. Old Man Franklin confronted her though. He told her that she was greedy for stealing, and the town didn’t deserve her punishments. She’d burn in hell for her sadism. He regretted that statement.

 A cold descended on the townspeople afterwards. Nothing froze, but everyone shivered. It was a chill from deep in the soul. Making fire become vastly more difficult. When one produced a flame, they gathered their neighbors. It was necessary to share. They huddled in the small bit of comfort and hoped sleep would come. 

Hilda left long ago out of boredom, but her curses remained. The town continued to suffer for trying to punish her. The only relief was that suffering brought them together. They kept each other alive and fighting. The curses would be gone eventually, but the town would remain.

1lmaxcu,n08spvj,"""Let me guess this correct..."" came the flat voice, barely hiding the contempt for its audience and exhaustion from the day, its owner deeply sighed and continued on ""You've noticed, and this is your own words, *unfair curses* on all of your houses over the last two weeks, that you're attributing to the removal of Niamh Odedra...""   
The speaker was cut off by the roar of the crowd at the mention of the name, this was expected as it the name brought about hisses and yells for the last two hours. The speaker expected it, the speaker still hated it, the speaker dealt with it by imagining horrible things done to the 300 sets of vocal cords that are now yelling at her direction. She raised her hands in the air in an act of corralling their attention, and the crowd died down to a tolerable level.   
""Please, please, i'm not going to yell, and then nothing will get done. Again, these *curses* that have allegedly fallen on your houses due to a specific person's removal, correct?""  
Omitting the name helped temper the crowd which murmured in what could be seen as agreement.   
""For instance, Midwife Susanne Stolly, you've stated that *pain* has come back into your house?""   
A stout beer keg looking person, with matching beer stein looking hands, came forward. ""Yea yea, Reev Fak! Every since we outsed that horrible witch, the child births are back to being painful! Three girls came in needing my help, i'm promised them an easy way of bringing their little ones into this world, but it was like old times now. We had a solid 3 years of painfree birth, but now ever since Nia..uh that WITCH was banished its pain again!""   
The crowd hollered at the end of this testament, it would have been impressive had it not been so weary.   
Reev Fak looked at the floor building up some energy ""Again Midwife  Stolly, for those three years the *witch* had provided you with some herbs for the forest that were boiled with tea and then drunk by the people you helped birth their children?""     
Midwife Stolly gave a look that was reserved for dogs that were shown a magic trick. Stolly blinked with her mouth open, scratched the side of her head with a finger that could be mistaken as a banana attempting something that could resemble understanding. ""Uh, yeah... but whats your point?""  
Reev Fak decied that she was done with her and moved on. ""Smith Krishna, you have stated your forge no longer blows as hot as it use to? Is this correct""
A bearded face covered in soot and superficial burns stood up ""Yes Reev! Like i've said, The coals don't get as hot as they use to, my fires produce more smoke than heat, my wares quality has turned to shite!""  
""Then it matches whats between your ears"" is that Reev Fak wanted to say, however she didn't and instead said ""Could this be related to the fact you knocked down the furnace that the *witch* helped design, the one that you bragged about, the one that made you the  quote *best smith in all the county*, your words not mine of course? Now that you've made one to replace it, you're now seeing poor quality products being made? You don't feel that your blights are caused by the new furnace?.""
A smug smile came over the Smith's face ""Pfff of course not! Its the same wood in the new furnance, same air i pump in it! Everything is the same! Its just been cursed""  
Reev Fak moved on ""Farmer Adisa, you've stated that your milk curdles now, which is odd as milk always curdles, not much of a curse""   
Farmer Adisa rose and removed his hat, in some effort to show respect. ""Yes Bethany, i mean Reev Fak, my milk was the talk of the town, lasted longer than anyone elses, beyond two weeks when left in the root cellars. Hell I was able to ship it out of town on 4 days journey and it would taste as fresh as it did when it came out of my corws. Now, now my cows give me common milk, it don't last longer than anyone elses, i'm ruined!""   
Reev Fak gave him a look of utter dissapointment, she looked up from the floor into his eyes ""Michael, you're no longer heating the milk like *she* told you to?""  
The farmer shot her a look ""No of course not, it was way to expensive, it was eating into my profits from the delivery, why would we spend money on something thats not actually doing anything! Heating milk was a dumb idea, but it was *her* idea, and now that we're no longer following it, she's cursed us all!""   
The crowd roared with disgust, the Reev slunked back into her chair.",11
1lmaxcu,n06eitq,"It was too late. 

By the time we returned, almost the entire village was dead, and those that remained were in such advanced stages that Elara could not help them.

I was the only one she could save. The moment the pustules of Pestilence appeared on my leg, she stirred something together in her pharmacy. I drank the bitter mixture. The pustules disappeared immediately.

I wept for seven nights afterward. If I had just worked up the courage to break her out earlier, I could have saved them all. Even a few hours earlier could have at least rescued some from the brink. But I didn't, and now there was nothing left of Mangrove Grotto. 

On the seventh night, Elara interrupted my pitiful mourning with a story.

""Where I come from,"" she said softly in that seemingly far-removed dialect of hers, ""deaths like these happen all the time. It's tragic that people die to things so easily solved. When I was just starting out my career as an... apothecary, I treated a woman who didn't trust anything I gave her, but who was forced by her family to see me. She said that my work was opposing the divine mandate, ameliorating the punishments given out by, uh, the Goddess. It was because of her ignorance that her child died, and it was only afterwards that she gave into apostasy as a result of her grief. The Goddess has given us a brain to think and hands to work with. She has given us the herbs, mushrooms, and animals that my work is built on. Miracles of medicine are so miraculous that some call them witchcraft, but denouncing it only means that you willingly give up a weapon the Goddess has given you to fight against the evils of the world.""

That only made me weep more.",228

I was young when the deaths had started. By the time they ended, I was the only one left -- well, me and my mother, who promptly died of starvation and left me to tend to our house alone.

I picked at a scab on my face (evidence of the sicknesses I'd endured) as I heard her approach. Click of horse hooves. I thought -- maybe soldiers, maybe scavengers. Little difference between the two, most of the time; the pestilence had touched many corners of the kingdom and made them as desperate as our village, even if I doubted it was as fatal. A few came through to scavenge what they could, only to come away disappointed at our lack of food and our muddy, spoiled river.

I held my knife closer to my side.

""What are you planning to do with that, then?""

A voice behind me; I jumped. A young woman in a red cloak was studying me with her head cocked, brown chestnut hair trailing down her shoulder. She was pretty the way I imagined my mother must once have been pretty.

""Uh."" My mouth was dry. I slipped the knife into my pocket, suddenly feeling quite foolish. ""I'm sorry--""

""You can't kill me, you know."" She laughed, as if the idea was one of the funniest she'd heard. ""Though your father did try. Witchfinder General, he was. King of soothing minds and winning hearts, until there were no more hearts to be won.""

I blinked. My father? How did she know who my father was? What was she talking about?

(There was something unnatural in the way that she moved, too graceful to be human. Her pacing was too fluid. Her legs bent strangely at the joints, like a doe's.)

I stared, mesmerized by her. Something in her cloak was like the fluttering of a fire.

She knelt down and offered me her hand. Her blue eyes were very serious; they seemed to stare through mine to something beyond.

""I don't think you're a killer though, Charlie."" (*How did she know my name?* I wondered again.) ""I think you're the start of something new.""

She smiled, and eased back into standing, casting her arms wide. ""I think we're going to do quite well together.""

She ruffled my hair, for the first time of many. My cheeks heated, and she laughed. ""Well come along, then,"" she said, looping her arm in mine. ""We've got a whole village to rebuild. Families to mend, businesses to build. And everything will be as it was.""

\---

Though nothing became as it was.

The city grew as she had foretold, but it was never the same. It took a different shape. It grew too prosperous, she complained; into a true center of urban life, filled to bursting with people and energy and culture and--

Too much. Never enough.

They say that Hell is a form of insanity in which a man does something over and over -- Sisyphus dragging his rock up a hill. Of course, they also say that Earth is closer to Hell than Heaven. It's easier for demons to crawl up to than for angels to fall down upon.

I don't know if this is true, but I often insist upon it. For I am the new city's Witchfinder General. I win hearts until there are no more to win. I stoke fires and burn witches, when someone must burn.

The city expands. My flames grow higher. Agatha tells me that it's like a form of salvation, for a true witch to be reborn; a return to the pureness of the past.

Sometimes good things need to burn, she says. A distraction is a good thing now and again, she says. She bites her nails down to the quick, and her eyes are sad in a face growing older. The world is a horrible, terrible place, she insists -- and the beauty of the inferno is sometimes the only thing that keeps the evil at bay.

It's a beautiful job. A needed one, maybe.

""I needed mine,"" she told me once. And then she threaded her hand into mine, and smiled. I leaned my head upon her shoulder.

We were atop a high hill at dusk, watching the lamps of the city being lit, one after another.

The stars came out. The world was filled with a new and ancient light.

1lmaxcu,n07j76i,"I quite like the story! The last bit kind of reminds me of a statement I heard a while ago: ""if god created this world, and we wish to know god, then it is our duty to learn and experience the world.

1lmjo22,n0892rz,"We feared the hive mind.

We feared assimilation. Thought they’d vaporize our governments, enslave our brains, turn us into smooth-talking drone-people.

But when they finally arrived, they sent a politely-worded press release and a job listing on LinkedIn.

Now I work in Tier 2 Support at Global Consciousness Integration Services.

Basically, if your part of the hive mind goes glitchy, like forgetting how to blink or getting stuck in a loop thinking about your ex... I take your ticket.

Mondays are always rough. Someone’s always half-synced and walking into traffic while singing Phil Collins. One time I got a priority call from Argentina where half a city developed a collective fear of oranges. Took us three hours to reboot them.

Most problems come down to bandwidth. The hive mind’s like one big mind-palace, but instead of bookshelves it’s full of snack opinions and intrusive thoughts. There’s only so much room. Every time someone remembers the Great Global Shrek 2 Incident of '34, when a rogue memory loop caused the entire planet to reenact the dinner scene in perfect sync for twelve straight hours, a thousand scientists lose their grip on quantum physics.

We rolled out a patch last quarter, HiveOS 3.8. Supposed to streamline group empathy. Accidentally caused mass weeping in seventeen countries. Turns out empathy overflow is real.

But hey... it’s chill. Nobody’s enslaved. Most people are happier. Anxiety rates dropped 96%. World peace is mostly a side-effect of everyone knowing when someone else needs a nap.

Still, sometimes I miss the old nonsense. Not because it was better, just dumber. You didn’t have to feel a thousand other people silently judging your lunch choices in real-time.

Anyway, I filed a ticket today. Personal one.

There’s a thought stuck in my loop. A tiny glitch. I keep wondering: what happens when *they* get tired of us?

No answer yet.

Maybe the Overmind’s offline.

Or maybe it read the ticket—and didn’t think it was a bug.

Or maybe...

Maybe the Overmind does see the glitch. And it’s letting it run. Not to fix it. To study it.

Sometimes, when I send a ticket, I get... feedback.

Not from the Overmind. From somewhere else. Strange metadata tags I can’t trace. Notes like “unexpected character development” or “possible spin-off potential.”

Last week, I caught a glimpse of a file path that read: `/Edu/Simulations/SentienceStudies/Undergrad/Group17_Tier2DramaFinalPresentation_v2`.

There was a comment attached: **""This one’s funnier than the fish planet.""**

And just below it: a laughing emoji, three popcorn icons, a grading rubric… and a viewer count ticking past 18 billion.

Someone had also added a tag: **#BetterThanShrek2Loop**.",18
1lmloev,n08frxp,"I go to the back of the mountain that the strongest Hero our Empire has ever seen calls...home.  
There I find him, as I knew I would, carving yet another statue.  
Men, and women, children.   
Humans, elves, dwarves, goblins, and many more...  
Even entire cities in miniature have been carved out vividly by him.  
Now...he was carving yet another woman.  
""I couldn't save her...the demon got to her before I could."" he mutters, seeing me.  
I sat down on the ground next to him, patting his shoulder.

  
""You tried your best, and saved thousands."" I say.  
""But not her."" he says.  
I sighed.  
It was not that he knew her, or anything, but ever since being chosen as the Hero of the Empire, he took it personally to save everyone.  
""You do know that not even the Goddess herself could save everyone, right?"" I ask.  
He said nothing.  
My poor little brother...  
Fate wasn't kind to us.

  
""So, why have you come here?  
Is there another rebel group funded by some enemy? Or a new ancient terror is awakening?  
Or have the mages found a portal to another dimension, with an army ready to invade us?  
Or is there war...again?"" he asks me.  
I shake my head.  
""Your sister-in-law gave birth.  
Twins. Healthy, little girls."" I say.  
""Congratulations. The Empire has heirs."" he says.  
""Thank you...but I am not the Emperor today...but your brother.  
I have come to ask you to become their godfather, and protector."" I say.  
He sighs.

  
""I am cursed, brother...  
As the Hero, I am the brightest light of the Empire, and you know that light attracts."" he says.  
I nod.  
""You are also my brother, and I would love to see you connect with the world. When you are not on missions, you are carving here...  
You are nigh-immortal, and one of the strongest beings on this planet...it is okay to relax."" I say, taking out a jug of wine, smiling.  
He took it.  
""This reminds me when we stole dad's wine..."" he says.  
I laugh.  
""I will be their godfather...and I hope they look like their mother, instead of looking like a troll like you."" he jokes.  
""I hope so too! But I know they will be gorgeous, and smart, and witty if growing up with you around."" I say.  
He nods, and we drink, as the countless statues are staring at us, and I swear...some of them seemed to smile.",18
1lmlg1z,n0933z0,"The wooden door blew open, flying off its hinges as the golden afterglow of a concussive spell faded and nearly a dozen knights, clad in shining plate armor and wielding enchanted scepter-blades, rushed into the room. Before the knights could react or even read their surroundings, the occupant of the room spoke.

""You're late."" A cold yet youthful voice echoed, bringing a tense silence to the room. The crisp sound of paper brushing against paper followed after. ""If you canheads had any sense, you shouldn't have come.""

The boy, with pale skin and looking no older than thirteen, sat in the middle of a spacious office that once belonged to the garrison commander of this outpost of the Mysteri Knights--of course, said commander is now one of the many stiff bodies laying on the floor, arrayed in a messy semicircle around the boy--and was sitting in a relaxed manner as he calmly read a book. His red eyes didn't even glance up at the tens of furious glares piercing at him.

""The disgraced son of the Demon Lord."" One of the knights spat. From the blue plume crowning his helm and the conspicuous badge displayed on the left of his breastplate, the one who spoke just now was the Mysteri Knight commander who managed to answer the summons of Indrath Castle before it fell. ""It is you who has no sense, creature. You had plenty of time to leave, yet you chose to stay. This place shall be your grave.""

The knights quickly fell into a defensive formation, spreading out across the room so that they covered all routes of escape and stood over their fallen comrades closest to them, and leveled their sorcerous weapons at the boy. The boy remained unperturbed; even as the scepter-blades thrummed with golden energy, he merely spared them a cursory glance--he seemingly gave the fallen knights more regard as his gaze fell on them a moment longer--before reading the book once more, casually flipping to another page.

""There is no escape now, little Arkos."" The Knight commander growled. ""Even if you are a cursed child, you are a child nonetheless, so I shall give you one chance: kneel and repent for your sins and wholly reject your unholy existence and lineage, so you may be spared the fires of damnation and be saved by Her Grace--""

""Is prattling baseless nonsense all you Mysteri brutes know how to do, Nimor?"" Arkos, the pale child, cut off the knight's speech with annoyance. The torchlight dimmed and flickered dangerously, causing the other knights to tighten the grip on their weapons and fight the urge to step back. The golden light grew brighter and sharper, enhancing the luster of the boy's black hair. Arkos smiled behind the book--he did not need to open the visor of the commander's helmet to know just how ugly the man's expression was just now. ""I have told you Mysteri knights a hundred times, my mother is the Abbess of Darion-Hess and my father is Knight Greizon, one of your own. If you cannot trust my words, then ask for the documents from my mother.""

""Silence!"" Nimor roared. ""How dare you besmirch the names of those respectable people with your existence! The men and women of the Goddess Aurean could never father a monster such as you!""

""Monster? If you mean my magic, I merely am more talented than most with how early I awakened it."" Arkos flipped over to another page, memorizing the names, locations, routes and other important information within the logbook in short order. He sighed, and met Nimor's fiery glare with his calm, unbothered gaze. 'I do not have enough time to spare. I should keep them busy.' ""I apologize for my outburst just now. Seeing as I am stuck here with all of you and have nowhere to run, why not speak with me a while? I am very eager to at least clear my name in your hearts--to die knowing that not everyone sees me as the monster they falsely claim me to be.""

Nimor and the knights froze. The boy's calmness and eloquence unnerved them greatly, and the many horrible acts Arkos had committed over the years against the people of Aurean still hung heavily over their hearts and minds. The commander thought it over.

'I should kill him now. If I wait, he might be able to pull a trick and somehow escape from us again. However, if I wait...Squire Kenneth will come back with reinforcements from Fort Fenrad and Castle Loyban, and we will have enough men to surround Indrath and ensure he cannot escape!'

He finally made his choice.

""Very well, then. Speak, boy. As a knight of the Mysteri Knights, I will show leniency and allow you to  at least defend what remains of your honor. After this...you shall continue to defend that honor before the Godess' eyes.""

""Thank you for being civilized."" Arkos smiled, his gaze divided between the book and Nimor.

(Part 2 coming)",12
1lmlg1z,n09fc97,"Nimor and Arkos spoke, but mostly the boy did the talking. He spoke of his lineage, of his childhood--he grew up here in the Aurean Theocracy, and was even training under his father for a time to eventually join the Mysteri Knights in upholding justice --and many other things that a child who grew up in the Theocracy would know and experience to convince them of the misunderstanding. 

""I spent my childhood cutting wood and stone. When I was not laboring, I trained by myself. I...could not go out to play with the others. After all, I...I was not exactly welcome even in my town...""

Arkos spoke of his hardships, how he was shunned and rejected by his peers because of his unnatural appearance, and how he became a victim of rumors that paint him as a bastard child of a demon--because it pertained to his parents to an extent, Arkos even implored for Nimor to punish the rumor mongers, which only caused the disgruntled Knight commander to scoff. The boy's hands trembled slightly as he spoke of Regina-Marie, the late Saintess of Aurean...

""...she had coaxed me into following her to her quarters, and...and then she closed the door, and...she...her skirt and...""

He tearfully recounted on how he suffered at her hands after she tricked him into nearly becoming her slave, lamenting at her depravity and how helpless and alone he was at that time. He cursed at her so vehemently, recounting how he took advantage of the woman's animalistic lust to rip open her throat as she rode him, before finally saying that the Theocracy is a cesspit of sinners playing as saviors and claiming that the knights were nothing more than a tool of oppression by the Theocracy. By the end of it all, Arkos was sobbing silently as he continued reading while Nimor and the knights were shaking in their boots--not out of fear, but out of fury.

""And here you were, claiming that I speak nonsense."" Nimor mockingly spoke, veins popping with barely restrained wrath. ""I very nearly believed you, you know. I actually felt pity for you...and yet you threw it all away when you started to try and make your sins sound reasonable, you filthy wretch.""

He quickly stood up from his seat, the chair breaking into splinters from the speed of his ascent, and pointed his scepter-blade straight at the center of Arkos' forehead.

""You deceptive, slanderous child...you truly deserve to be called the child of the Demon Lord. It wasn't enough for you to have murdered the venerable Saintess and scores of valiant Mysteri knights, but then you had to go ahead and even INSULT THEIR MEMORY?!""

The blades of the scepter-blades the Knights held blazed with fiery light, causing Arkos to dry his tears and gaze seriously at the threat before him.

""DO YOU TAKE US FOR FOOLS, BOY?!"" Nimor bellowed, a small strand of reason and desire to be better than his enemy holding back the monstrous urge to plunge his weapon into this demon child's skull and burn him with divine flame.

""...I never expected to be believed, anyway."" Arkos cooly answered. While he intentionally played the part before, exaggerating his sorrows while insulting the knights, his gaze was vacant as he recalled what he had endured. ""I merely wanted to be heard, in these final moments for you.""

""Indeed, these are your final moments. It would be a further insult to the memories of those who died to let you live longer.""

Golden glyphs began to emanate from the scepter-blades' flames, floating in the air and slowly arranged themselves in specific patterns.  A few moments later, dozens of complete spell formations lit up the room, their destructive energy all pointed towards the pale child now standing with his back against the stone wall. Arkos spread his senses out, his magic blanketing the area like a bat's clicks and allowing him to 'see' all around him. Outside, he saw close to a hundred Mysteri knights and Aurean priests and priestesses arrayed around the castle--among them were the bodies of the unconscious garrison, being protected and currently being healed by the priests of any unseen injury or illness. Nimor noticed the boy's magic fluctuate and his surprised expression, and the commander sneered.

""I told you, there is no escape. The other garrisons have come to answer my call, and all of us are dead set on burying you here.""

""I noticed."" Arkos calmly faced Nimor once more. ""Did you notice that none of the knights of Indrath died, and are merely asleep?""

""Tch. Whatever ploy for forgiveness or recompense you may try, it is all too late for that.""

At that moment, the calmness of Arkos' vanished...and was replaced by a smile of smug mockery that filled Nimor and the knights around with nothing but terror--a few spell formations even came undone with some knights becoming too rattled. 

""You really should've.""

Nimor's eyes grew wide, and he looked at the fallen knights with greater scrutiny once more--a mass of dark, destructive energy nested within their bodies, near-perfectly masked by the holy energy within them. Every single body that belonged to the unconscious defenders all had this, and it didn't take long for Nimor to realize that each of them had been rigged with erupting spells. However, by the time he did...it was too late.


With a snap of his fingers, Arkos activated his trap. Close to a hundred corpses suddenly exploded with tremendous force. The office Arkos and the knights were in was reduced to ash, leaving nothing of Nimor and his Knights while blowing Arkos through the stone wall. Outside, the reinforcements were also rattled with explosions. However, the priests managed to dispel a few of these spells before Arkos set them off, so not everyone was hurt. In an instant, Castle Indrath disappeared in a flash of violence, and the hundreds of Mysteri and Aurean warriors outside were dealt a severe blow by their own casualties. Arkos crashed to the ground, managing to barely land on his feet some distance away from the rubble that was once a castle...and only a stone's throw away from a disoriented group of priests and knights.

As dark energy surged from his body, mending his mangled frame and pooling in his hands like flames of starless night, Arkos smiled gleefully at the sight before him.

""Another perfect plan finished. All of you...you really shouldn't have come.""

As he had done before, as he is about to do now, and as he will continue to do so in the days that will come... Arkos rushed into battle once more. As the confused mob began to panic as he slaughtered mercilessly those who still had sense to fight back, only one thought remained within his head and heart:

'I wish to never wake up from this beautiful dream!'",8
1lmd6kx,n06rcci,"I sigh, and turn yet another mega church away.  
Why are there so many churches by the way?  
Theoretically, they all worship God, so the Hell is going on here?  
I get it, I can perform miracle healing, and I healed last week a deadly disease, which means this churches could use me as a ""prophet"" or ""angel"" or ""apostle"" of their religion.  
But still...  
I don't want any of it.  
Sigh.  
Can't a demon have a vacation?

  
I get out of my human skin, and relax.  
Taking a hot bath of lava, and turning on Hell ™ radio to listen to the newest gossip down in Hell, I start to enjoy my evening.  
Then I hear knocking on my door...again.  
I ignore it.  
I came to Earth for vacation.  
To get away from torture, and screaming, and do the opposite.  
I won't allow others to make me in a figurehead, and use me for their benefits.  
That is cultist stuff, which is my regular demon stuff, which I won't do on vacation.

  
Despite trying to ignore it, they don't leave, and keep knocking.  
Groaning, and take on my human skin, make sure I look good.  
And I do.  
And go to open the door.  
""Yes?"" I ask.  
""We are from the Church of South Healing, and we are here to meet you."" two young women smile at me.  
I roll my eyes.  
Honey trap? Really?

  
""Sorry, but I am not interested in joining any Church."" I say.  
""You don't have to join us. We will send the believers with issues at wherever you want us to send them.  
The Church will pay you handsomely for it."" one of them says.  
I frown.  
""And we will make sure that the media doesn't know that you are working with us!  
It will be no different as what you are doing now!"" the other quickly chimes in.  
I sigh.  
This church is smart...  
Not only will be a trail of paper that shows I work for them, but they also would ensure that it's only them that I heal for, so more people would join their ranks.  
If only my cultists were this smart...  
""No, sorry. Have a nice day."" I say, closing the door.  
Vacation is vacation. No work during this time.  
I ain't dealing with corruption, and manipulation for a year!",28
1lmd6kx,n06udgu,"""So I understand your daughter has a gift.""

Mr. Peterson offers a vulpine smile, though his voice is soft, almost condescending. He's nursing a coffee mug in one hand and grabbing an oatmeal raisin cookie from the kitchen table with the other. He takes a bite as my mother recoils.

""Well,"" Mom says, smoothing her hands on her apron, ""I wouldn't call it a *gift,* exactly.""

""What would you call it, then?"" Mr. Peterson swallows and fishes out a crumb from between his front teeth.

""I had hoped,"" she continues carefully, ""That the church would send a pastor to cleanse her and this house. My daughter is *afflicted,* sir, with a demon that haunted her father.""

She's interrupted by a titter of laughter. A chuckle that makes the hairs at the back of my neck stand up, even as far away as I am, hiding behind the living room wall and peering into the kitchen.

Mom's face turns white. ""It is no laughing matter, sir!"" she snaps. ""My daughter is possessed! My house is cursed! My husband turned to drink and gambling and we have lived under that terrible omen ever since, and here you come into my house and *laugh* at me--""

""Oh, I do apologize."" He pats his lips with a napkin. By the time it's removed, the smile has wiped itself from his face. ""It's only that... Well, your daughter is not possessed. I can tell you that.""

Mom's eyes widen. ""Then, what?""

""She's been touched by God.""

A long silence. The old clock ticks on the wall, five minutes to seven. Dusky light creeps through the curtains to splatter red across the white tiles like blood from a ghostly crime scene.

""By God?"" Mom whispers. Her hand is clutching at her throat, for want of pearls (we could *never* afford pearls). ""How would you know?""

""Well."" He gives her a pointed look. ""From what we saw in the hospital records--""

""You saw that? How?""

""Our church owns a major insurance subsidiary -- but anyway, that's besides the point. From what we saw in those records and from those forwarded by the police, all your daughter did was heal a man that was almost dead. That's hardly anything demonic.""

""She turned him into a zombie!"" Mom hisses. ""He can hardly speak!""

""But he's living. That's a hell of a thing for a man that caught a bullet to the head.""

""He... What *he* is, isn't alive.""

""His beating heart would beg to differ, as would his family. What your daughter has is a gift, ma'am,"" he repeats. Then, softer: ""You needn't worry, though I can understand that any decent mother would.""

Mom turns away. She's a hard woman to read, but I notice a slight softening in her features, a lessening of the tightness around her eyes.

""We at Joshua Tree Ministries believe that what you daughter has must be shared."" He clears his throat -- and this is much more rehearsed, something he's clearly said more than once. He lifts a briefcase from the floor and places it on the table. Flicks it open, then digs out a sheaf of paperwork and hands it over to her. ""Her gift is one that can be shared with the world. It is a manifestation of God's will -- the good he can work among the ill and the needy.""

""Like in your Healing Ceremonies,"" Mom says distantly. ""When your healers place their hands on the ill. My sister was cured of her ovarian cancer at one of your services.""

Mr. Peterson inclines his head slightly, accepting thanks for something that he had little or nothing to do with. ""I am very happy to hear that, ma'am. Now, your daughter has the chance to do that for someone else."" Another rustling of papers, and he pulls out more to slide in front of her. His ears turn red; he's *blushing,* I realize, covering my mouth with my hand. He's nervous. ""We would be willing to offer a yearly salary, plus benefits, in return for your trouble. Now, I know your daughter is still a minor, and there are different labor laws when it comes to young adult performances--""

The word *performances* almost makes Mom faint dead away. She hates when our church so much as pulls out a guitar. I hide my smile as I drop a hand to play with the end of my skirt.

This might be my chance to get away from Mom; away from all of her rules and snide comments and yelling and praying. My heart thumps hard in my chest.

1lmd6kx,n07sia7,"It seemed like whoever was in charge of the universe had big plans for Tracey Blackwell. Last month, her local chapter of the SPCA had decided that the pets were going to chose their owners, and somehow she had gained the favor of the Egyptian pantheon, and she had gotten a miniature caiman named Imhotep who now resided in a cage in her living room, and ever since summer started, happily chased down and ate whatever insect flew in from an open window or door. About the same time, her healing powers had turned up a notch. For years, it had been small things, an abscessed tooth her preschool teacher was complaining about would fall out when Tracey gave her teacher a hug. Cuts and scrapes disappeared before recess was over in elementary school if she touched the wound. In middle school, her friends would press her hands over their bellies, easing menstrual cramps. She had always been able to do this, so she didn’t see it as the big deal people made it out to be. She handled snake venom on a daily basis, so no big deal right.

A woman had been having a grand mal seizure in the middle of the deli section of Harris Teeters, and Tracy, who was a thoughtful person, decided to help (she has dated someone in high school who was epileptic), getting the swarming crowed to clear the area and call 911. She got the woman’s head propped up and covered with her demon jacket. Placing her hands on the woman’s shoulder, there was a dry heaving sound as the woman vomited, Tracy supporting her so she didn’t choke. One the bile had cleared the throat, the woman woke up. “God bless you, young lady,” she had been told before the paramedics took over.

That had been a week ago, and the video showing this had gone viral. Instead of the local medical community reaching out, it was the local mega churches who came calling offering her a job as a healer. Having grown up in a Methodist household and the daughter of a preacher, these were folks her father would call “Christianity anders” borrowing the quote from C.S. Lewis’s “Screwtape Letters”. 

Indeed, the bright faced woman about her age sitting across the table from her eyed the bookshelf filled with volumes of Tolkien, Lewis and Erhman with some suspicion. “Please take our offer; Miss Blackwell! You have an amazing presence!” Tracy had seen their job offer, $64,000 a year, no health insurance and a crazy schedule of faith healings and hours long shifts at a congregation of over 5,000. 

Tracy let out a sigh, “I have made my position very clear on the matter, I do not want to be affiliated with a faith community that does not do the Lord’s work. Do I struggle with sin? Yes, but I put my faith in God and do my best. I thank you for your time, but I am not interested in starting a career as a faith healer.” The woman nodded, apologizing for wasting Tracy’s time, and left. Once the door closed, Tracy could hear the woman complain loudly that she was wasting her talents.",6
1lmd6kx,n06v6uz,"In the end -- like I knew she would -- my mother turns Mr. Peterson away, despite his bids to raise his offers of money up and up until it hits the sky.

I corner him at his car, anyway.

""Hey, kid."" He pauses, key in the ignition, to roll down his window. I only catch the ""kid"" part and have to fill in the rest. ""What's the problem?""

I shift my weight from foot to foot, scrunching up my face. ""Take me with you.""

He asks me to repeat myself. ""Take me with you,"" I say louder, thrusting up my chin.

He studies me for a moment. Taps the filter of an unlit cigarette against the door.

I don't have to ask a third time. Instead, I find myself sitting in his passenger seat.

\---

""This could technically be called kidnapping, you know.""

I'm warming up for my first set. I've been assigned a group of women with breast cancer. My heart is stuck in my throat; *just pretend if you can't really do it on the first try,* was the first bit of advice the Pastor had given me. *I made it up my first few times I healed, and nobody knew the difference.*

This, sold to me with a wink before he strode out onstage to welcome his congregation into the first act. Ten thousand voices roared back. Thousands more on television and radio are tuning in, I've heard. I swallow.

""Just so you know."" Mr. Peterson takes a drag from his cigarette, puffs smoke in my direction. I have to hold my breath to resist the urge to gag. ""I'm taking a huge risk for you, kid.""

""I'm grateful,"" I say softly.

""That *gratefulness* is gonna turn into my cut."" He jabs his cigarette at me like a sixth pointer finger, wedding ring shining in the reflected stage lights. ""I'm upping that twenty percent in your contract to forty until your mother signs.""

*Great.* I try not to sigh. I'd been hoping never to have to see her again.

Agonizing minutes pass until the pastor finishes up, and then he's gesturing me forward, and I step in front of a crowd mostly obscured by bright lights. That makes it better; I can almost pretend the people aren't real.

The Breast Cancer women are sitting in plastic folding chairs, wet hair plastered against their heads. I heard them getting re-baptized earlier. All their sins have been washed away, and now it's my job to wash their souls, or so the Pastor is saying behind me. ""You know what the Bible says: disease is sin turned outward,"" he announces to the crowd, flashing his handsome model-smile. ""So repent, all of you, and remember that a little bit of our trademark Holy Oil works God's *wonders* when it comes to internal cleansing. But now, here's our Holy Mary to cure these women of their ills.""

I take some tentative steps toward the first woman and hold out a trembling hand. I breathe out, slow.

Her eyes are shut. She's mumbling a short, repetitive prayer, something like *Jesus save me Jesus save me.* I have to close my own eyes and pray, too.

The first thing I see in my mind is that man on the street. The blood, him falling backward, hard *crack* in the air like the lash of a whip. Me running in slow motion. Cradling his head with some long-forgotten instinct, my father's voice in my ears, singing a song. *Stars shining bright above you...*

I'd remembered it as I'd held that man and held his warmth inside of me, mixed it with my own, and given it back. He'd blinked his blank brown eyes back up at me and said something I didn't recognize. Probably gibberish.

*Stars shining...*

I hum the tune to bring it back. Then: a feeling of peace settles through me. I remember my father's kind hands and kinder words, sunny long-ago days, walks along the beach. Salt in the air, gulls filling up the sky with sound. Sinking my toes into the sand.

I open my eyes. The crowd is waiting.

I lower my hands, and the woman is healed. I'm exhausted by the end of it, though; I slump down before I can even reach for the second.

The crowd roars just beyond my periphery. Everything is blurry. I can hardly breathe -- and neither can the world, I think, because the world is on its feet. And it's rabid, and it always wants more and more and more.

1lmc2je,n06mig9,"""We know.  
That's why we have dozens of ministers, countless nobles in charge of a big part of certain industries, and a lot of merchant organizations propping up the economy."" I say to the young minister of agriculture.  
He sighs.  
""But Prime Minister! The King seems younger than I am!  
When the Old King died the people celebrated! CELEBRATED!  
And now a new king is chosen the same way as the old one?  
Don't you..."" he starts, but I raise my hand.  
He stops speaking, and I gesture him to try out my tea.

After a sip of tea, I smile.  
""I understand your concerns, and I have been there.  
But you do realize that our world has various races, mages, and even deities can descend with avatars, right?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""Yes, but the ""Chosen by this or that God/Goddess"" isn't..."" he starts, but then stops when he sees my smile.  
""Sorry."" he says.  
""No worries. I am happy to see you so concerned about the future of the Kingdom, but you shouldn't be.  
The King is required, but it is not like he will actually do anything."" I say.  
He is confused.

""How? How is he required? He randomly appeared out of the portal!  
Also! He already said he has ideas of improvement!"" he shouts.  
I wait for him to calm down.  
""The portal is a summoning one, bringing souls from different worlds, and timelines.  
This is done in order to enrich the variety of souls our realm has, per the orders of the Gods.  
The soul that comes through the portal will be blessed by the world, and transformed into a native.  
The King already shows high-tier magic potential, and a rare profession which will soon awaken.  
If nothing else, the King or Queen were always good as deterrents, and champions."" I say.  
He is not convinced.  
I smile.

""And about the King's ideas...how do you know they aren't good?"" I ask.  
""How could they be good?! He is most likely under 25! What could he know?!"" he asks.  
""Do you know that our first King was also a portal summoned one? 18 of age, from a world called ""Earth"".  
He made our kingdom one of the most advanced ones, and by the way, your entire department was created by him. Before that, agriculture equaled sowing crops, and seeds and hoping that by watering it, and killing pests it will grow. It wasn't a truly studied field, as war seemed a better application for magic, than anything else."" I say.  
He froze.  
After a while, he apologized, and left to do his job.  
I chuckled, and prepared to visit the new King.  
While I am confident we can deal with whatever type of person he is...it would be nice to know early on, so that we can avoid some trouble.",28
1lmhrk8,n0975ja,"We didnt care much when the Gods came. In those days we hunted and fought and mated like lions, and they were only a temporary marvel, staining the sky like a sunset. Prehaps for a moment we paused our squabbling to point and grunt, but we had no language to discuss the implications or art to commemorate the moment. We accepted the world unquestioningly, as long as it gave us meat and sex. 

The morning after they came I was walking alone, scouting for small game, when I heard a low humming, like a hive of bees. The promise of sweet energy had me following the sound, down into a small canyon cut by a river. It was slippery and dark, but there was a faint light purple as flowers. I continued along the canyon, and the buzzing grew louder, and the light grew brighter, until I was staring into a glowing egg suspended at eye level. 

All we had was our senses, so of course I stared, then I sniffed, then I grabbed. It stung. I jerked my hand away. On the tip of my finger was a dot of blood. I howled, stumbled home to the cave, and collapsed in a heap of head splitting agony. I stayed that way for days, and as I lay there, the world changed. 

There were patterns everywhere, around me and in my mind, the two constantly shifting and mirroring each other. What had before been a raw stream of expirence began to fragment. There was a thing that was a bird, it had many instances, and those boundaries could be defined, I could reduce it into something I could hold in my head, like a rock. I could rebuild the world out of thought-rocks. I scratched at the cave walls with a real rock, trying to represent the things that were forming in my mind. 

Yet something was wrong. I was overcome by a deep dispair. Before I had been a part of something and now I stood alone. My cavemates grunted at me and brought me my share of meat, but they could not share in my struggles. As the days passed I ceased my scratchings. I could not go on like this. I had a strange urge to throw myself from a cliff, like we do to the mammoths during the great hunt. But perhaps there was another way. I went to my cavemate, one that mated with me often and always brought me what she foraged. Maybe she would follow me into the light.",6
1lm43f8,n062pyd,"My father was a horrid man. His teeth blushed yellow with shame of living in such a mouth, and his hair had long ago escaped his scalp, leaving only spotted skin. He had the subtly of a drunk bear, and a lifetime of coddling had left his brain soft as dough. I watched him sitting at the head of the table, spitting bits of gristle and gulping fortified wine, and wondered for the thousandth time what my mother had seen in him. 

At least she had only wasted a year of her life. The same could not be said of my stepmother, who sat to his left, sadly fingering her locket. She usually had the empty stare of a battle shocked soldier, but lately I would catch her looking at me like I had just stepped on a kitten. I was used to getting looks. To fit in I'd need to dust my skin with flour and wear a wig of straw. I tried it when I was younger, it was very uncomfortable and did not help the staring. 

The luncheon dragged, I was almost relieved to return to lessons with my bratty half sisters. After lessons I had free time, during which I often wandered the gardens, because no one else ever did, and it had a few plants from my mother's country. I loved them, their leaves were striped and dotted like they'd been painted. That evening I arrived to someone asleep on the bench. It was my stepmother, her flaxen hair fanned around her, one arm covering her eyes, and the other hanging off the bench, with the golden chain of her locket weaved between the fingers. The locket was open, and I could see a tiny brown face. My heart thudded, and before I could stop myself I swiped the locket from her hand. 

It was me. My stepmother jerked awake, looking at me with wild red rimmed eyes. No... it was not quite me. 

""My mother?"" I whispered, striken. 

""I loved her..."" said my stepmother hoarsley. ""It would have been fine. She could have left with her troupe that night, but there was a problem. She loved me too."" 

""I- dont understand."" 

My stepmother shook her head sadly. ""I cannot speak of what happened, I don't want to turn you against your father.""

""That PIG?"" I burst out. ""My opinion of him could not possibly be lower!"" 

I expected her to scold me, but she just gave me her empty stare. ""It could. What he did to her when he found out about us..."" she stopped. But she didn't need to say more. The evidence of his crime was standing right before her. 

I opened my mouth to speak, but I had no words. A small part of me had hated my mother, for choosing my father, and for leaving me here. But to her I was a painful memory she had never asked for. Tears ran down my face. 

""No wonder she left me."" 

My stepmother stood up and wrapped me in her arms. I always thought she would feel like a ghost, but her arms were warm and firm. 

""Blame me. I asked her to leave you. I wanted a piece of her, but I was too lost in my grief to be there for you. Not anymore. Today, things change.""",83
1lm78lw,n05taqs,"“I don’t think you’re getting it. Let’s try an illustration.”
The human interactions basics course instructor turned to a control panel. A few deft taps and a video started to play. 

The guttural growl and reverberating rumbles of the displayed beast caused a recoil among the assembled students. The one who had been arguing with the instructor involuntarily hackled, rapidly moving to smooth their fur to hide their obvious distress. 

The video was a compilation of clips, all showing an enormous, muscular, furred beast, with giant claws a gaping maw of ivory teeth. 

Having regained composure, the student spoke, “What is that thing?”

“That— that is a bear. It is one of many Class three predators present on the human home world.” 

“Class three?!” Another student sputtered. “They have more than one?!” 

The instructor nodded. “Furthermore…”

Another video begins to play. This one is a human playfully rolling around with a bear. Another clip shows a striped beast. In all cases, the humans look obviously happy. 

“As I said, if a human is scared— run.”",108
1lmb1kr,n06lgci,"I look at the goofy looking statues, and moving, grinning paintings, as my friend is freaking out, screaming her lungs out.  
""What's wrong?  
Hell ain't that scary."" I say.  
""D-Don't you see the Human Trees? The Sword like grass? Tha-that mountain that is screaming?"" she asks.  
I look around, and see a Nun like portrait grinning at me, slowly stepping out the painting.  
I throw my slipper at it, and it stops.  
""Na. IT seems chill here."" I say.  
Then laughter echoes around us.

  
""Chill? Chill? Then let it all burn!"" a voice says, as the haunted house starts...burning?  
But the flames look...small, and weird.  
My friend on the other hand, faints.  
I catch her.  
""Man. Stop this goofy as prank, and show us to our rooms already.  
Hell or not, this is subpar reception."" I say.  
The flames froze, and from the ceiling fell out a dude.  
He looked like a cheap-ass Demon Halloween costume wearing clown.

  
""Y-You aren't afraid?!"" he growled in my face.  
I hit him in the throat.  
""Your breath stinks."" I say.  
He chokes, and coughs.  
""I am a prince of Hell, how dare you..."" he starts, but I raise my remaining slipper, and he stops.  
""Our rooms. I have to wake this one up."" I say, pointing at my friend on the floor.  
""How can you not be tortured? Screaming? Terrified?"" he asks.  
I look around.  
And laugh.

  
""Hell is supposed to take on the looks of whatever the soul thinks they will see, but this means...  
This means you think Hell is nothing but something fake?"" he says.  
I nod.  
""I am here, so I know it is real, but all that bullshit up on Earth...totally fake.  
This is just a slightly worse afterlife, not going to lie, I was homeless for a few years, as a young woman mind you, this is nothing compared to that."" I say.  
Before the dude could say something, a door opens, and I can see a bed.  
""Great! Help me carry her there."" I say.  
Shocked, and almost mechanically, the ""prince of Hell"" helps me carry my friend into the room, then I shoo him out, as I get next to her, ready to sleep.

1llra57,n031oby,"The flight deck trembled as the gunships came in rotors thundering against the dusk sky, kicking up clouds of dust and exhaust fumes. Tower crews in color coded vests waved signals, voices crackling over comms as the crafts touched down one by one, their hulls scarred and smoking from low-altitude combat runs. They had taken a beating but once again less than others. 
Many eyes were on the last ships to land.

They looked like any other warbird at first, same reinforced plating, same heavy forward cannons but the painted decals gave it away. Neon-pink streaks trailed along the fuselage like flames from a comic book. A stenciled unicorn reared over the cockpit, its horn tipped with a tiny skull.

As the hatch opened, the smell of gunpowder and bubblegum and sweat spilled into the air.

The teams disembarked quickly, moving with a relaxed but efficient rhythm of veteran pilots and teams. Combat boots hit the metal deck. But for all their precision, they were dressed in ways that made seasoned men glance twice pinks, pastel colors and cartoon patches sewn proudly onto flak vests. One had a battered plush zip-tied to a holster. Another chewed gum, blowing a bubble as she walked past a line of deck crew. A guy that did certainly not look fit enough for service exited and checked the rear, the non standard decoy flares and smoke generators had left rainbow coloured streaks on the fuselage some glittery anti Radar-caff stuck to the hull. But he gave the machine a happy slap left to talk to maintenance. 

Unit Captain ""Maribel the terribel"" was last off the ship.

She was a sight, hair tied in pigtails, a lightning-shaped patch over one shoulder. But her eyes scanned the deck with the sharpness of someone who had memorized every threat vector three steps in advance just because it was fun. She gave a warm thumbs-up to the control tower, and disappeared into the hangar with the rest of her unit.

On the far side of the deck, two intel officers watched the scene unfold from behind mirrored huds checking the mission overlay.
""Another surrender, mission was basically over once they arrived..."" one muttered, more statement than surprise.
The older of the two, that actually looked like a veteran with a scar under one eye, didn't even look up from his tablet. “Happens a lot these days.”
The younger one shifted, clearly uncomfortable. “But… they barely engaged the Enemy forces sure they shredded a few of them but the moment the 'Horsegirls & Horsemen of the apocalypse' were identified. It was just... escape, hide, surrender.”

The colonel finally looked up. His gaze followed the pink-clad squad disappearing into the carrier’s belly.

“Turns out,” he said dryly, with a slightly uncomfortable frown “if you take a squad of My Little Pony diehards, with 100 in combat and tech skills but 0 social and communication skill and merge them to top-tier social butterflies, and let  glitter-obsessed psychopaths with a genius for asymmetrical social clique warfare lead them… you get something terrifying.” he exhaled ""some like to shine like stars and some like to orbit. But they all like cute stuff and turns out cringe is deadly for enemy morale..""

He didn’t elaborate. He didn’t need to.
There was a certain kind of terror to be found if remote drones rigged to drop colour smoke and explosives in sync with sparkly theme songs. It's not about the bare minimum it's  because you go beyond what's needed just because you can. So lots of debriefs about enemy commanders breaking down in tears, confessing they were not emotionally prepared to be dismantled like this.


The two looked over to the other side of the landing area. the second ship arrived, a different style a heavy dropship screamed in from the clouds bulkier, lower, louder.

The ship's armor plating shimmered with synthetic fur decals under the floodlights, painted in sharp, stylized patterns tiger stripes The hull bore a stenciled emblem a bunny biting a grasping hand. Below it said “HARM NONE. MAUL THOSE WHO DO.” The ground troops started to disembark. The old guy looked at them too. Some barely normal some in full Furried up anthro combat suits next to them some apparent animal rights activists. Turns out furies are really good at fighting in heavy sweaty suits.. and some others are real good at taking care of those creatures... Without the moral dilemma of owning a pet...

The old guy just closed his eyes and whispered quietly to himself ""I hate modern war so God damn much it's unreal""",173
1llra57,n0608o8,"I'd always heard that humans were strange but whenever I'd asked what was meant I'd just get a laugh and a ""You'll see"" type of comment. When I said that I'd wanted to join the Peacekeeper Union Militia I'd get guffaws, strange smiles, and peculiar looks as well as cryptic statements. 

""So you think you can take a human?"" ""They'll eat you up there."" ""Didn't know you were into that type of thing."" ""Ah you seem the type."" ""Big fan of The Human Culture are you?"" ""You know you can't fight a battle with one hand, yeah?"" ""When'd you catch Earth Fever?"" 

The propaganda had always seemed normal. Sure they're typically larger than us but nothing about it ever seemed strange. They always seemed so charismatic and competent. I began to think perhaps my fellows were pulling my leg for a laugh. Maybe they didn't like humans for some reason. The truth was that while they inspired me I had never gotten into The Culture. 

The boot camp was normal. It was very strict exercise, obstacle training, weapons training, mock battles and more of the usual. Did I think it was odd they trained us with every type of weapon from their history along with a physics course? Sure, but I just thought they were big on tradition. When it was over I was so proud. 

Then everything changed. I was transfered to my first unit aboard a Destroyer. A tall gorgeous model strutted out to meet us. She had vibrantly red long hair, behind the rosed colored and heart shaped sunglasses she had eyes that shone like blue diamonds, and her skin was tan. Her outfit was a corset, frills, a short skirt, loads of jewelry, and high heels that looked like they should be hard to walk in. 

All the humans stood at attention and saluted. Some from other races also did. The rest of us confusedly followed suit. 

Her voice was like that of an overly friendly golden bell as she said, ""Hi everyone! Relax. I'm Saoirse, I'll be your commanding officer, and am like so totally stoked to meet yous. I'm sure we'll get on great since you all seem like a great bunch of lads."" 

Someone from a taller race stepped forward with an unpleasant look on his face. Towering over even her his voice came out as a deep rumble, ""I was under the impression I'd be lead by a great warrior not a cheerleader."" 

Very quickly everyone put distance between the two of them. 

""Oh, so like you want a demonstration because you think you can take me in a fight?"" 

""Yes."" Was all he could get out before a flury of bone crushing blows too fast for the eye assailed him. This was finished with a kick that flipped her. Upon landing on him she struck a pose. 

""So... does like anyone else think they can take me? In a fight."" Anyone who might have thought so before   were silent. ""Right then. So if you'll like follow me I'll take you to the living quarters and you can choose rooms.""

This all proceeded smoothly and it wasn't long until our first action. Pirates were attacking a trading vessel. As soon as we dropped out and were close loud music began playing. Among humans the style was called psytrance but what was peculiar about it was the bass. It seemed to bend space. I later learned that the twin black holes used for energy generation had been synchronized to the music so that the gravitational waves matched it. 

When we boarded the ship our music was playing over their speakers. Rather than a conventional weapon like a gun or energy weapon Saoirse wielded a sword. The handle of it was a nude statuette of herself creating an X. She was effectively a blender with it. No matter how far ahead she charged orders would come over comms for us individually. Telling us when to take cover, where enemy ambushes were,  etc. 

The fight ended quickly. The pirates hadn't even lost a quarter of their crew but they surrendered. 

That night I went to the bar to drink away all the blood and organs I'd seen. Before I knew it Saoirse was sitting next to me. I attempted to salute and stand at attention however before I could do that she put a plushy into my hand and placed a hand on my shoulder to keep me sat down. 

""Here. This one is for you. Isn't it cute?"" I looked at her perplexed and tried to keep my eyes from straying. When she saw my reaction she continued, ""It's a doggy and goes 'woof, woof, woof.'"" 

""Ma'a-"" I tried to speak but she put a finger over my lips and made a shushing noise. 

""You know... I'm like only your commanding officer while we're in battle, yeah? So right now I'm just a woman and you're just a man."" 

""Is that... appropriate?""

Her eyes lingered on me for a moment and then she said ""You joined up knowing nothing about The Human Culture? This isn't like an actual hierarchy. Do you know why the veterans of the unit follow my orders?""

I shook my head to indicate that I was at a loss.

""It's because I'm good at what I do. My job is to make sure all my boys come home safe and sound. In battle do as I say and you'll live. You won't be punished if you disobey orders but your chances of dying skyrocket."" She then put her arm around me so that her hand was on my other shoulder. ""So like after battle it's totally fine for you to do more than just look because I'm always ready to take care of my boys."" 

""So this was what everyone meant about The Human Culture?""

She giggled as a large smile came across her face. ""So you didn't request this unit because you saw the XXX recruitment videos?"" 

""The what? I just... said I wanted to be with the best. What videos?"" 

As she leaned in towards my she pulled down at her top. ""I can take the whole unit. And not just in a fight. But tonight I just want to get to know my best new recruit who can't keep his eyes off me.""

It was at this moment that all the comments clicked into place. Everyone thought I wanted to join because of porn or was just into humans. After what happened for the rest of my tour I certainly can't deny the latter.",27
1llra57,n0bma1e,"""Who are you, and what are you doing here?"" I asked the civilian, a girl in a long flowing pink dress, when I saw her standing in the corridor just in front of m office. She looked at me with an awkward smile, and, instead of an answer, she let me scan her identity bracelet... Holy quasars, the scan identified her as Commodore Zinota, my new superior officer, and of course I had heard of her before. She was the youngest Commodore in the Fleet, and was known to refuse to ever wear uniform. For some reason, she was allowed this. Probably for the same reason she had been promoted to Commodore at such a young age... 

""Lieutenent Alyra? We need to talk..."" she said. This didn't sound good, I thought. Half an hour later, I left the building, with three totally different plushies, a secret mission, and so many questions on my mind...

The first plushie was for me. It resembled a gray Telax, like the one my parents had when I was a child. The second was for my husband, Eric. It looked like a brown furred creature with four legs and a long snout. The last one was a beetle, dark purple in color.

1llvu7e,n04hd1n,"“They are legally my children.” The king, our father, argued vehemently. “He is my eldest, my heir, and they are princesses of my kingdom as true as Teresa is.”

“He is not your blood.” The strange elegant creature argued, its wings fluttering in the light and the tranquillity of its beautiful face disturbed by a smile with too many teeth. “Our bargain is not yet ripe for the picking.”

“It is!” The king bellowed, I knew from experience he wasn’t accustomed to being naysaid in his own throne-room. “You agreed to my terms! You signed the contract!”

“Do not think to lecture me on contracts, little king.” The creature, Spirathia, spoke with all the softness of a velvet noose. “Just as I will not lecture you on exploitation, it is best we both stick to our areas of expertise.”

“Don’t speak to my father that way, Fey!” It was I who spoke, speaking up for the man who had taken us in, given us shelter. “He is an honourable man and I am proud to call him both father and king.”

“There you have it creature.” The king sounded triumphant then, and I felt pride welling up within my chest, I had helped him get one over on Sprathia, though I didn’t know her name at the time. “He is my son and they are my daughters, my 3 eldest children are gathered here as my fourth is at her mothers breast.” Father stood then, holding fourth a parchment with two drops of blood to sign it, one red and one green. 

Spirathia stared at the contract and the toothy smile widened further to reveal even more teeth, I remember wondering if her mouth even had limits as she looked at me with something I at the time didn’t recognize as pity in her eyes. 

“When you were scarcely born and you knew different parents, this king called me to his hall.” Spirathia said as she flew over to us, you might not remember it, you were both some little at the time. “He proposed a deal, a deal to make the kingdom of Denalia last a thousand years. It is the kind of deal a hundred kings propose to one of my kind every year… but…”

Spirathia looked from us to the king and with a snap of her fingers the contract flew from the kings grip to hers. “He proposed a bargain, his would be the kingdom of a thousand years, but mine would be the lives of his 3 firstborn children when his fourth was born.” 

I stood transfixed trying to understand what Spirathia was telling us, and reading the truth of it on the parchment. I don’t remember if I said anything, but I remember that the king didn’t even look at us, and then godmother floated over to the king once more and said something I didn’t comprehend at the time. The king laughed and godmother smiled that smile she smiles when she has done something clever.

The next I remember we were already here and… and it took a while to adjust for me. I know you don’t remember much from then but you cried a lot in the beginning, but when you got to know grass aunt and water uncle you began to calm down. You were blessed by not remembering all that had happened, but I always remembered and I spoke to godmother many a night about what had happened, and about what she had said to the king before we left.

It is why I’m leaving. Because fey bargains must be upheld, but we know don’t we? That our family family of nature are not easily tricked, and they do not mind waiting a few decades for their trap to spring.

Godmother Spirathia told the king, our father, that as per their agreement he and his heirs would rule their kingdom for a thousand years. Godmother honours her word, and she honours the words of those she deals with as well. 

So I will go now, I will go and I will rule, as father said: I am his eldest, his heir.",105
1llvu7e,n0469i6,"Guardians.

That's what we'd been taken in as. Not because they pitied us, or because they saw potential in three street urchins. No. We were given the assignment on day one of our new lives.

We were all educated in the palace by tutors. I learned how to write and do my sums. Marggie even learned two additional languages. I struggle with Juton. Taught etiquette by the Butler's. Hated that. Never realized how much structure you were expected to shove up yer arse. Wait. Um, so many manners one has to watch their mouth and feet in equal measure? Still learning.

I did however thrive in the more secretive arts. Assassination and information gathering came naturally to me. Being a thief to survive taught me much. Marggie and Kelpie fell more into knight training. Finding honour in serving. Although formally women weren't to be knights. They often sparred with, and beat them.

Us three women became formidable martial assets to the royal family of Belacoste. So when our father finally conceived and heir to the throne. We knew our time had come.

We 'fawned over our little brother'. When in actuality we were watching over him. Sniffing our threats through 'womanly gossip' and doing what women do best in the halls of manly power. Stay invisible.

My contacts in the city grew to the countryside as I studied alongside The Master of Shadows as his prime agent in these halls of power. My sister's Marggie and Kelpie had a more hands on approach to protecting our brother.

Always with him. Always keeping him in their sights if not sleeping in the same room. Everyone else saw it as affection. We saw it as our duty to the man whom took us in.

So when an intruder foolishly mistook a woman in the same bedchamber as the heir apparent, died suddenly.  The 'dotting Sisters' at his side were taken seriously. Such a thing happens when a guard discovers the intruder dead at my sister's hand.

The minister who ordered the assassination was caught by myself, and presented to The Master of Shadows. 

The next two attempts solidified the rumours about the heirs sisters.

If you had to get to the heir apparent. You had to go through his sister's first.

If you can.",76

""No.  A decade ago an evil dragon attacked the kingdom, kidnapped the princess and took her back to its cave.  The king of the time, her father, made a proclamation that whoever rescued the princess could have her hand in marriage and would rule the kingdom alongside her once he passed.""

The siblings looked at each other, a part of the truth dawning on them.  ""You killed a dragon?""

Their Uncle smirked at them.  ""I killed a dragon.""

""How?""

""Well various knights with dreams of glory tried to fight it head on.  I hunted a deer, staked it outside overnight and when it poked its head out in the morning to take a bite of the free meal? I dropped a boulder in its head.""

The siblings by this point were engrosed in the story.  ""So the king was happy with you?""

Their Uncle sadly shook his head at their naivety.  ""Not exactly.  I wasn't a noble, I wasn't even middle class.  I was a peasant.  A Guttersnipe.  The one thing that saved me was that he'd made a public proclamation and I had showed that I had a good head on my shoulders.""

""So what did he do?""

""He compromised.  I was to be ensconced with tutors until I had a demenour *fitting of my station*"" Their Uncle scoffed.  ""And his spy network planted the rumours about a long lost noble line.  I was forbidden from contacting any of my family again.  This was the loophole, and I was only able to do this after he finally died.""",27
1llvu7e,n02y1rs,"""What now?"" I ask the king, our adoptive father.
My younger sisters hide behind me.
""You heard me.
The royal mage will simulate the looks of my soon to be born daughter, and you will take on her role.
After all...theoretically she was born years ago."" he says.
I pale.
""The transformation spell...is it the temporary one or the permanent one?"" I ask.
He stares at me with such coldness I can feel it in my bones.


""Permanent, obviously.
You 3 are mages so will be long lived, and sturdy.
You will be perfect to play her body doubles for your lives."" he says.
My sisters gasp.
""The permanent spell is painful...and...body doubles?
King...can we...can we refuse?"" I ask.
He frowns.
""Father. You will call me Father."" he says, grabbing my face
I yelp.


""You will be real princesses, as long as you play the roles perfectly.
When she is there personally you will be her servants and bodyguards.
You die before her. 
If a political marriage is needed, and the groom has questionable reputation, you will first warm his bed to test out the waters.
You will get all the treatment a princess would...and live your lives for her, understood?"" he asks.
I say nothing. I can't.
""Understood? Or you wish to live in the slums again?"" he asks, releasing me.
That's when the queen enters the room.


Before I could ask her for help, she kicks me in the stomach.
""Darling. Don't touch their faces...they have to look beautiful like our daughter."" she says, caressing her belly.
I cough my soul out...the pain...
My sisters start crying.
""You 3 look like me when I was younger. You family must be from the east like I am.
But know your place. We brought you here for a clear reason...you have no say in the matter.
Understood?"" she asked.
I nodded.
""Yes ""mother"", ""father"", we will listen."" I say.
They nod happily and leave.
My sisters hug me, trembling.
""It will be alright...I will make sure of it."" I say, soothing them, ignoring the pain.
Even if I have to play the princess' role alone, I will do it.
My sisters don't deserve this...",71
1llvu7e,n05ft7e,"There has always been a curiosity in the court as to why my two younger sisters and I were adopted by the Queen, why my twin sisters at 10 years old were given everything they asked for. My greatest entertainment is listening to the rumors about my sisters and I.

One rumor said that the Queen saw the abuse we suffered in the orphanage and took pity on us. Another rumor was that we were foreign dignitaries being hidden from war. That one was my favorite. That one allowed me to pretend my real past didn't exist and that I really was royalty and not some street urchin from the slums.

No one but the Queen, her brother and I knew the truth as to why the Queen needed me and that my doted upon sisters were actually collateral in our agreement. The Queen was expecting the throne's first heir and she had an impossible task for me to complete before her son was born that would likely end with my death. What I got in return is the guarantee that my sisters will always be loved, educated and provided for.

When the Queen was young, she made a deal with the night spirit to save her brother. A life for a life. She thought that the night spirit would take her life to save her brother's, but it had tricked her. When her brother was healed, the night spirit declared that he wanted her firstborn's life. The Queen and her brother have kept this secret, attempting to find a way around the deal or a way to kill the spirit to no avail, until the Queen learned of me.

She heard of a scrawny, 13 year old homeless girl that killed 3 guards who were trying to hurt her sisters. The truth is, I don't even remember doing it. I just remember blacking out in rage and waking up covered in their blood. The Queen believes I have an ancient and powerful magic lying dormant within me. She thinks she can wake it up. She thinks I'm the last hope to defeat the evil beyond the vale. I can't disappoint her or I let my sisters down so I'll withstand every torture she puts me through.

I have endured everything from being held under water until I almost drown, to allowing cut after cut to be made into my skin, to boiling water being poured on my hands. It's not that she wants to do this, she says, she just thinks at some point, my self preservation will kick in and my magic will protect me. I endure this for Adelaide and Rosalie. I would do anything for them.

""I think I know what the problem is,"" the Queen whispered triumphantly one morning after weeks of torture. ""You just need the right motivator,"" she smiled wickedly as she pulled the curtain and revealed my sisters chained together in the middle of the arena pit. On the far end, a lion roared in anger from being speared and starved. I watched in horror as the gate rose letting the hungry lion free.

I swung my gazed to the Queen. ""You promised."" I whisper shrieked. ""You promised you wouldn't touch them!"" She held up a finger, a knowing, predatory look marring her features.

""Ah, little dove,"" her nickname for me. I hated it. ""I said I wouldn't touch them if you could do what needed to be done. Now is your last chance."" she said as she gripped the side of the viewing platform and leaned over to watch with a fire in her eyes. I contemplated shoving her over the edge, but that wouldn't save my sisters.

I made a vow on that platform as I listened to my sisters plead with the gods. When my magic wakes up and I defeat this lion and the spirit beyond the vale, the kingdom will have a different threat to face. In trying to be the hero for my sisters, I let the Queen create a villain.",23
1llvu7e,n04ovji,"I was five, and my sisters were three, when our father was murdered.

Oh, I'm sorry - when he died in the ""accident"" - why, *anybody* could have been in that ditch when the wall collapsed.

Anyway, I was five, and my sisters were three, when the wall collapsed, and crushed our father to death. A single father, working on an addition to the palace so he could support three young girls on his own, with no living relatives to help him.

Therefore, it was only ""appropriate"" that the King and Queen adopted these unfortunate children, whose only living relative died in service of the kingdom.

Of course, we were given an upbringing suited for royalty. Servants, tutors, guards - captors, and wardens.

I was eight, and my sisters were just shy of their sixth birthday, when it was announced that the Queen was pregnant. After years of trying, a royal heir is finally on the way. Should the child be a girl, my sisters and I would be her ""handmaidens"" - in reality, we'd be walking wallets, should the princess wish to purchase something for which the payment is flesh, not coin. Should the child be a boy, we would be his concubines, to use or share as the prince sees fit.

My sisters didn't understand exactly what was being explained to them - but they were sharp enough to pretend that they were happy for the ""honor"" being bestowed upon them. I understood fully what the king and queen had decided for us - but I also feined surprise and joy at the ""gift"" being bestowed upon us.

I... do not regret my sisters' ignorance. Their mother died giving birth to them, and they had no elder female relatives to explain to them the differences between men and women. *I* will make sure to educate them on that matter, once they are old enough.

I know the differences between men and women. I also know the truth about the roles being ""bestowed"" upon myself and my sisters. *My* mother has been in communication with me since birth, and she has provided an education that no mortal can.

I was able to uncover the reason for Father's murder within the first week we were in the palace. Oh, I'm sorry - the maid whose face the king can't quite remember, the one with the particularly potent ""wine"" that seems to have disappeared, *she* was the one who discovered the intended fate of the three orphans.

It was a simple enough matter to keep the queen barren, these past three years. Not that I intended to leave her childless - no, it took me that long to find the appropriate sire. Don't get me wrong - as far as the queen is aware, she has been faithful to her husband.

But it is not the *king's* seed that was planted within her womb. Nor was it mine - although I could have done so, I wasn't willing to use *that* kind of magic for *her*, even if I *did* take the form of her husband.

No, I did not *produce* the seed - I merely planted it. And I believe I made a good choice - this particular species always resembles the species of the female host.

At least, until it eats it way out of the mother's womb, and suddenly grows into it's true form...",29
1llvu7e,n07hj27,"My interpretation was that the king unknowingly adopted changelings (the changelings didn't know they were changelings). He made a bargain to give up his heirs, but nothing forced the recipient (i.e, the fey) to keep them.

His bargain was to keep his family in power for 1000 years. Ordinarily it would be a violation for the fey to fulfill this bargain by placing a fey on the throne for 1000 years instead. However, the king insisted that these (fey) children were legitimate heirs, even though he knew they weren't his children. Any possible loyalty they might have had by virtue of being raised by the king was destroyed when he sacrificed them. 

What makes this an especially elegant trap is that the king brought about his own downfall: Instead of putting his own family in power for 1000 years, he put the fey in power for 1000 years. This is a beautiful and ironic punishment for trying to trick the fey, with the king having actually ordered the fey to acknowledge fey children as his heirs.",14
1llx9it,n036f1e,"I was making breakfast, as my guests were slowly waking up.
My B&B was quite a hit with...well everyone.
Right now I had an angel, 2 demons and little Dreamy, a young eldritch being staying here.
Everything is peaceful around here.
I used to be a ""negotiator"", and now those skills of mine are of use.
""Breakfast is serv..."" I start, leaving the kitchen, to see the dining room in a mess.
The angel pinned to the wall by a Giant, the demons knocked out, and Dreamy shivering beneath a table.


""Get lost human.
My trouble is with the angel. I will take him away, and you will forget ever seeing me."" he says.
""S-sorry..."" Atiel, the angel mutters looking at me.
I sigh, and put the food on the table.
""Come out Dreamy and eat."" I say, as the eldritch being just appears in the chair, and starts munching.
""Gentleman of the Silver Bolt clan.
Release my guest, otherwise you will disgrace your clan."" I say.
The Giant does the giants' salute, and stares at me.


""You know my clan, human?"" he asks.
I nod.
""That is rare. But I need this angel.
He is the one..."" he starts.
""I don't care about the details.
He is my guest, under my protection and you are disrespecting me with your behavior.
Not only that but you attacked without announcing, which is a breach of your ri'ohta."" I say.
The Giant flinches, and slams himself in the chest, releasing Atiel.
I smile.


""I would never break my ri'ohta.
The angel is needed to save my daughter...the ones who kidnapped her named this feathery one."" he says.
I sigh.
""Boss...does this mean you back in business business?"" the demons now up grin at me.
""Sir...you don't have to do that."" Atiel says, massaging his throat.
I look around, and smile.
""Well, the B&B is slow, and I suppose an excursion wouldn't be bad, right Dreamy?"" I chuckle.
Dreamy flickers, and appears on my back.
""I am going to finish breakfast, we all eat, and then leave.
I want to see who sent a Silver Bolt at my place."" I say.
""Human...this will be dangerous."" the Giant says.
I ignore him, as everyone relaxes, and sits down.
""Boss danced with Gods, and babysits demons for fun.
This will be a side quest for him."" i hear one of the demons say.
I chuckle as I go back to the kitchen, wondering if I should also buy some groceries...the dragon meat stock is getting low.",69
1lly08o,n03c97x,"""What the..."" the Fae screams.
He tries to warp away but can't.
Looking at the window that was before open, now it was closed with Iron bars.
""What is wrong Fae?
Too much Iron for your taste?"" the king asks.
""Look, human.
Ignore me and let me go, and all will be fine.
If not..."" he starts, but the Iron Axe of the Queen pins him to the wall by the shoulder.
He screams.


""You dare try to touch my baby?
My baby?!"" the queen asks, moving the axe.
The Fae screams.
""I am sorry! Okay? I am sorry!
I won't do it anymore!"" he says.
""Of course you won't.
How couls youndo it without arms?"" the king says, cutting the remaining arm of the Fae.
The screaming doesn't stop for a good while.
But nobody comes to check.


""W-what do you want from me?"" the Fae asks.
""Nothing."" the queen says.
""Nothing?
Then why are you torturing me!?
My kind will avenge me! You will..."" the Fae started.
The Queen hit him with the dull side of the axe.
""Your kind keeps kidnapping children."" she says.
""And adults. Making then lost in the Fae lands."" the king chimes in.
""So it is time we send a message."" the queen smiles.
The Fae shivers.


A few days later, a delegation from the Summer, Spring, Autumn and Winter courts arrives at the palace.
A week later a treaty is signed, as the Faes leave with a limbless fellow...
Escorted by dozens of Iron wielding guards.
The Queen and King smile watching the Fae leave, before going to watch their child.
Humans had enough of the Faes' tricks and plays.
It was time to even the ground.
The message they sent seemed to work.
A few ingots of iron and a limb for good luck.
Now they will think twice before they touch a human child.",85
1lm2hx5,n04pyki,"**I admittedly have altered the prompt a hair, so it's not an illness but it is still fatal.**

August Middleton was slated to die.

The agony of it all was too much for him to bear. He cursed his parents in the moments where the fear over took him, reducing him to rubble scattered across his bedroom floor. He knew it would happen this way and dreamed of reaching through the doom towards purpose. He imagined himself a soldier, a bullet-riddled hero dropping in the battlefield. Not in a thud, but slowly like a feather. The world would seem to slow, warriors moved into an instantaneous cease fire that made mere seconds stretch like centuries. They would watch him fall first to his knees and swear that they could hear him in prayer. He would slouch forward soon after, colliding with the ground and sending up a cloud of dirt that would linger over him and make it look as though everyone around him could see a tangible soul drifting up and out of his body.

Not a waste. A martyr is never a waste.

His mother had convinced his father that he was just a late bloomer. It wasn't unheard of, plenty of the finest  poets among them had spoken simply until the middle of their teen years. Give him just a a year or two more, she'd insisted. No amount of begging for his father to see reason, to see August for the lost cause he was, could get him to agree to sign the papers sending him off to war as a minor.

The sick irony that you have until eighteen to have the poet's voice take you over. That by the time you can make choices for yourself, it's too late.

""When you get up there, it'll come.

It takes so few words, only some

To show us you're a wordsmith, worth taking your place

In our beautiful world, this poetic space.""

His mother's words only made him grow angry. He turned his cheek from her as she tried to plant a kiss on it. Her hope was a fool's errand, he resented being left to hold that truth alone. His father's apologies as the reality of it all set in were as useless as her hope had been.

""My son, my boy, I should have been braver

In keeping you home, I thought I could save her.

Your mother swore it would be temporary,

That soon you'd be singing, the finest canary.

You could have been a soldier true,

I clipped your wings, a choice I wish I could undo.

Forgive me, forgive me, as the guillotine falls,

Though your name will be lost, we'll keep your portrait on our walls.""",7
1lm2hx5,n04pzd7,"And so August took the stage. He felt grateful that he was too far gone for fear and relished in the anger that coursed through him instead. How many sorry bastards had he watched as they panicked over their tongue's continued betrayal of them? How many sorry attempts at sonnets and recitations of dismally dry odes had they all watched a string of desperate fools sputter out? So many thought they could make it, that inspiration would strike as they'd been reassured it would. The smart ones chose enlistment. August had been a smart one. But sometimes the smart ones were doomed, born to families unwilling to face the reality that they might have bore a voiceless.

""Fuck this, fuck all of you, and fuck my parents for not listening to me. You think you're so special because you can talk fancifully. As if people for centuries before us didn't maintain societies while speaking plainly. Just drag it out now and get this over with, you barbaric fucks. I refuse to dance for you.""

He held his head in defiance and made a point not to look down from the stage at his parents. He didn't need to face them to know tears were streaming from his mother's face. If anything, he elated in the smug satisfaction that he'd been right, that she'd have to spend the rest of her life knowing she'd killed him.

August didn't fight as the executioner appeared behind him and bound his hands behind his back with rope. He didn't begin shaking with fear as the wheels of the guillotine squeaked across the stage. His head was still high as they dropped him to his knees and fell only when the executioner pushed it down to cleanly expose his neck.

""Another voiceless, we cannot deny

And so it is custom, today you must die.""

A whoosh as the blade fell. A solitary wail from an otherwise silent crowd. August's father tried to soothe his wife, but there are times when even the most beautiful of poems are insufficient balms for a wounded soul.

The voiceless all became nameless. They all rested in the same cavernous tomb, anonymous in death after being rendered useless in life. The pastor closed the tomb's heavy door. August's father shed a single tear as he read the eulogy etched for all the voiceless upon it:

""Oh what a pity, such a sorrowful sight

They tried and tried, giving all of their might

As many could not pull the sword from the stone

These poor souls could never utter a poem.""",7

""No. I'm telling you that the Egg got stolen,"" Liza says. 

""Stolen?"" Jerome shouts.

""I don't see what the big deal is. It's just a stupid, bedazzled egg."" 

Jerome pushes his hand against his face and sighs. ""You didn't pay attention to the briefing again, did you?"" 

""Of course I did. You were talking about that stuff and or thing that needed to be done."" 

""It's amazing you haven't been beheaded yet."" 

""Thank you?"" 

Jerome exhales sharply. ""If you had paid attention, you would have known that the Egg houses the offspring of one of the most powerful beings in the universe--A Kaicuda."" 

Liza's eyes widen. ""A Snake God?"" 

""Yes. The king wanted to hatch the offspring here, hoping that the God would bring great prosperity upon the land. But now you've gone and fucked it all up."" 

""I hate to be that person, but if it was so important, why did the leader of the High Guard have me watching it? I suck.""

Jerome chuckles. ""On that much we agree. But you do make a surprisingly good point. Why did Barnabas have someone of your caliber guarding the Egg?"" 

""Maybe he wanted it to get stolen."" 

""Preposterous."" 

Lisa shrugs. ""Does anything else make sense?"" 

""No."" Jerome looks down. ""But I'm sure it was just an oversight."" 

""Why don't you go ask him?"" 

""Me? You're the one who lost the Egg.""

Liza pulls out a chair from a nearby table and sits. ""Which is exactly why I shouldn't be the one to tell him. Can you imagine how mad he'll be if this actually wasn't part of some larger conspiracy?"" 

Jerome sighs. ""Alright, I'll tell him. But you need to stay here and wait.""

Liza's eyes narrow. ""Why?"" 

Jerome hesitates, then says, ""Just in case Barnabas wants to talk to you too."" 

Liza kicks her feet up on the table. ""Alright, fine."" 

""Good. I shouldn't be gone long."" Jerome walks to the door, glances back at Liza, then exits the room. 

""Weirdo.""  

After twenty minutes of sitting still, Liza starts to get antsy. *What's taking him so long?* She wonders as she walks to the door and pokes her head into the hallway. *No sign of him. Maybe I should go check and make sure Barnabas isn't laying into him too hard.* She walks down the long hallway, through the courtyard, and down a spiral staircase, arriving just outside Barnabas' office.",20
1lm03hx,n04gpr2,"The cottage fell silent. Heldock rubbed his ear hole, staring reproachfully at his friend. The Naga towered over his friend, his green scales darkening in colour. Gleaming gems hung around his waist, decorating the sash he wore to preserve his modesty. ""It's not like I have many other place to store such things!""

His friend glared back. The Kobold scratched her dull reddih hide, adjusting the leather armour she wore. It was etched with a rising sun, the cities guard insignia, as did the base of her spear tip. Purple eyes blinked as she poked at him repeatedly, huffing at him. ""We have a City Vault, you pile of shed skin! It's provided precisely to stop this sort of thing from happening!""

Heldock threw up his arms, voice rising. ""Oh sure! Let me just walk up and say, Good day receptionist! I'd like to deposit a prototype translocation bomb! It will only transport half the city to deep within the Astral Sea if set off! I see no problem with that.""

The Kobold sighed, groaning. ""Fine, I see your point. But why the hell did you make it?! I thought you were taking the next few years easy.""

He hissed. A long forked tongue poked out, as he had the decency to look embarrassed. ""I... I had an idea. And you know how I get. But it was safe. So long as it was near me, it wouldn't go off! And after the Thought Reaver incursion before, I thought a countermeasure would be prudent. I don't want that disaster to happen again Vanina.""

Vanina sighed, nodding. ""I get it. Really, Hel. But this sort of thing... well it jeopardises our home here. The Mayor will not be happy to know about a dangerous device being loose in the city. And he will probably demand that it be handed over for inspection.""

The Naga groaned, rubbing his face. ""Great. Because he can definitely be trusted with it. But I guess I don't have a choice. Plus... I'll need to make it safer beforehand, especially if some idiot tries playing with it.""

His friend shrugged. ""Guess so. I'll call in the others. They'll need to sweep for clues.""

Heldock nodded. ""Go ahead. And... if you find them, would you mind testing something out?""

He laughed as she narrowed her eyes. ""Another guinea pig moment?""

A shake of his head made his hood flap, muscles relaxed slightly. ""No, it's safe! But if it impresses the guards, I could make more sales.""

From a crowded side table he withdrew a slim silver tube. He offered it over, speaking quickly. ""I call it a Light Bolas Tube. Aim it at a fleeing perpetrator, and they'll be wrapped in chains of light for four hours! Plenty of time to apprehend them, no?""

Vanina paused, before watching him out if the corner of her eye. ""You didn't let a dangerous artifact be stolen to try and make a sale did you?""

Heldock sniggered. ""No... but that's an idea for the future, yes?""",15
1lm03hx,n049hmc,"Liza raises her hand to knock, but hears laughter coming from the other side of the door, so she pushes her ear up against it instead.

""So, the plan is in motion?"" Barnabas asks.

""Yes. And the King is none the wiser."" Jerome says.

""And what of the fool?""

""She's awaiting my return in her study, completely unaware she's about to go down for a crime she didn't commit.""

""Good. We'll have her hanged before dinner.""

Liza's stomach drops. *I need to get out of he--.*

The door creaks open, and Liza falls into Barnabas' office. She looks up at the two men with wide eyes.

Barnabas smiles. ""It seems the fool wasn't as much of a fool as we thought.""

Jerome draws his sword. ""Just give the order, sir.""

Barnabas stands. ""Now, now, Jerome. There's no need to be so hasty. I think this fool can be of use to us.""

Jerome looks at Barnabas with narrowed eyes. ""What do you mean, sir?""

""Someone needs to perform the Hatching Incantation, right?"" Barnabas looks at Liza. ""And who better than someone already marked for death?""

1lm9if1,n06dpvn,"Across from me sat my biggest fear. Dressed in casual creams and whites, sporting a knitted cardigan, with kind, droopy eyes behind a set of glasses, Dr. Leria acknowledged me in calm silence.

Our meeting hadn’t started like his usual appointments. Normally, a first visit would mostly concern making a profile—asking routine questions about your family, your childhood, health history, blah blah blah.

The thick folder in his hands would more than likely answer any questions he might have, but reading the bible of mistakes I made would’ve taken him a week. So, I guess he settled for the interrogation. However, from his questions, it was clear that “routine” would be the last word the doc would use to describe our session.

This mouth of mine was made with no filter. You get every single bit of scum stuck in the pipes. People don’t like that. Gets me into a lot of problems. So much so that I’d rather stay silent. If there’s no water, there can’t be a flood either, am I right?

Of course, all of this needed an explanation. Parents want a healthy kid who can say to them, *“I love you.”* Hence the bible. Hence **my** bible. Hence... the doctor.

I swear the first few minutes felt like days. I was fine with the silence, but the doc kept asking questions and leaving these prolonged pauses. He wrote things down as if I were answering—laughing, nodding.

I looked around. Maybe he had some headphones or something? Was I really the patient? Had they resorted to putting maniacs in a room to see if two negatives make a positive?

Ultimately, my doubts betrayed me as he suddenly asked:

\---“And how does that make you feel?”

\---“Like everyone has given up on me,” I replied... out loud.

I hadn’t heard my voice in years at this point. I remember sounding a lot more eloquent. Why did I sound like this?

\---“It happens when you don’t speak for a long period of time. Especially if you’re growing up. Vocal cords are like a muscle; you’ve got to take care of them so they don’t get hurt or atrophy.”

I probably looked like a dead fish on a market stall right now. This guy either had to be the best psychologist in the world, or I might have suddenly developed another curse where speech bubbles appear above me.

My throat felt like bark as I tried coating it. It itched. It burned. It hurt.

\---“Do you need a glass of water?” he offered, breaking the thin silence that had once again fallen over the room.

I couldn’t help but nod. I had to control my thoughts—understand that what he wants is not what I need.

They want to fix something that can’t be fixed through medicine or “a nice chat with a professional.” At this point, this was as much *me* as my skin. I had grown in it. Been molded by it.

I had discarded my voice for a concise mind. It could be troublesome, yes—but it was way less trouble than speaking my—

""Were they that bad?"" I ask my aunt.
She sighed.
""No. Not bad, but rather simply...too eager? Misguided?
Made a mistake or two."" she says.
I bite my lips.
""Then why...why aren't they talking about them?"" I ask.
I have been adopted by my grandparents, after who knows what...
And now, maybe I can finally learn it.


""They were entrepreneurs.
And did whatever was needed to get the upper hand in deals."" my aunt finally says.
I nod.
""So...they were normal people? Don't all the business owners do that?
Why are all our relatives behave as if my parents were cursed?"" I ask.
She sighs.
""My sister knew how to smell an opportunity from a planet away...
Your father knew how to word something in a way that even lawyers cried when listening, but...
They were unlucky."" she says.
I was confused.


""I don't get it. So that is why they don't talk?
Because they failed at their businesses?"" I ask.
She shook her head.
""It is what they did after losing that our family doesn't want you to learn about."" she says.
I felt weird.
""W-what did they do?"" I ask.
She hesitated.
""Fraud of all sorts.
Lying, making up ghost companies, scamming..."" she says.
I felt sick.


""I know it is weird, and it seems not bad, but they messed with the wrong people, angered all sorts of men...
And had to disappear."" she says, and then gasps.
I freeze.
""T-they are alive?"" I ask.
""Shit! I wasn't...fuck! Yeah...they are alive, but only ma and I know.
Even dad thinks they are dead."" aunt Alice says.
I nod, and walk away.
She says something, but I couldn't understand.

1llvr4x,n03atif,"The child had been rescued from the twelfth-floor apartment. One moment, he was practicing his piano skills with his dad, and the next, they were separated as the building crumbled to dust.



He woke in the hospital; hours had already passed by. He waited for his dad to show up amidst the doctors and nurses until the sun neared its end. And then the door opened, only for him to meet a man clad in a latex suit, a bright mask, and a yellow cape that draped from his shoulders.



He had seen many superheroes on TV, but this was the first time he saw this particular one.



The man approached the boy as he shifted. ""Are you the son of Jace Dawn?""



The boy frowned, ""Nobody talks about my parents… let alone say his name.""



The man stared at him through the mask for a good while before he took a seat beside him.



""They think that by hiding him from you, you won't end up like him. I'm hoping that by my telling you about them, you won't make the same mistake.""



""You know where my dad is!?"" The boy exclaimed.



The man stayed silent, then sighed. ""Your father is an evil, wanted man. Your mother is even worse. They abuse the poor and rob the ignorant. And if things don't go to plan, they kill them."" His voice grew deeper. ""They were criminals.""



The boy observed the man incredulously. 



""You really didn't know, huh?""



The boy was just about to celebrate his sixteenth birthday. His parents were all over the moon about the occasion. And now he is being told they are criminals?



Of course, he couldn't believe that.



""My parents fell into their trap. A shit ton of debt. And because they couldn't pay them back, they were killed."" His words choked. ""Your parents killed mine, kid,"" he repeated.



The boy noticed the masked hero clench his hands into fists as he spoke. Then he noticed the stains of blood on his gloves.



""Where is my dad?"" The boy softly asked, ""Is my mom okay?"" His eyes widened.



The man didn't respond, the light of the setting sun gleaming across his blue mask. 



Breathing suddenly became a tedious task, the jittering of his open lips preventing the boy from speaking as all he could do was gawk in horror. His vision grew blurry as he observed the man stand up again.



And then the boy's brows furrowed, his teeth slowly grinding as he hissed through the gaps.



""See. That was the biggest mistake they made."" The man straightened. ""They killed my parents, but not me. And today, they faced the consequences."" He smiled, lowering his gaze to meet the boys. ""Unlike your parents, you are already eager to finish me off. That's good.""



The boy's body twitched, fury escaping out every slight jerk of his muscles as the man's face burned into his memory. The seed of hate had sprouted its roots once again, just like it did back then. 



The boy then quickly yelped, the man's blood-soaked hands warping around his neck.



 ""I'm sorry, but I can't repeat the same mistake either, you see.""",7
1lln9lc,n00zgsk,"I close the clinic, and am about to head out, when I hear steps.  
I turn around to see a creature the size of a car, approaching me.  
It looked like a deer body, horse hooves, an ox's tail, and a dragon head.  
It was a qilin.  
And it was limping.  
I sigh.  
""Come on in."" I mutter, opening the clinic once more.  
It was due to ""them"" that I became a vet.



As I was checking his legs, I remembered the old days.  
Ever since I was a child, I attracted the supernatural, and the odd.  
Many creatures big and small, seen only in fairy tales, science fiction stories, and historical accounts managed somehow to find me.  
Even stuff that I believed to be completely made up.  
And despite many of them being creatures of terror and bloodlust, and slaughter...I always managed to make the most wholesome relationships with them.  
Often I have helped them free their cubs from some nets, or traps, or googled maps for their new migration routes...  
And so started my fascination with the veterinary area.

  
 ""You are good. Just a sprain. Must have galloped funny through the clouds."" I chuckle, bandaging his left hind leg.  
""Thank you."" it transmits.  
Oh boy. Never get used to them talking directly in my head.  
""No worries.  
By the way, should I expect more of you guys around here, soon?  
Or is it just you? I mean creatures in general? I know the permanent residents, but you a new face."" I say.  
It stares at me.  
""Not that I know of. I traveled here because a baby dragon that just hatched needed a blessing."" it says.  
OH FUCK!

  
I ran out of the clinic after giving the keys to the qilin.  
They are an auspicious character, so I trust their character.  
Fuck. fuck. Fuck!  
I arrive at a mansion hidden in the woods, where the servants are waiting for me.  
I enter Ember's room to see a little dragon trying to eat the chair.  
""Finally. You forgot?"" Ember stared at me from the bed.  
I blushed.  
""S-sorry! But I brought doughnuts!"" I show my best friend, what I bought.  
""Give! But if I find a pill with vitamins or whatever in it, imma burn you!"" she says, grabbing the box of doughnuts.  
I chuckle, as I watch the little dragon...it is so cute.  
Ember is one of my best friends ever. Met her as a child.  
She looks human now, but her real form is that of a huge dragon, though don't tell her I think she's huge...  
I look at them, and wonder...will it be weird if I ask to make their vaccination plans?",93

You are in a new environment with an old lady who had been foraging, and a pot of stew was on the stove when the two of you returned to her house. She agreed to hide you, which you thanked her profusely for, unsure how else to show your worth. You know what he would have wanted, but this old woman was not your captor. She wouldn't expect that from you.

""Sit. Eat! You're skin and bones!"" You silently sat on the floor, unsure if you were worthy of the table until the woman corrected you. ""At the table, my dear, we can't talk with you all the way down there. My knees are not what they used to be, you know.""

""I know, my apologies, I meant -"" you scrambled onto the chair, seated in such a way you made the smallest possible target. The woman appeared to live alone, but he had appeared to too, and... and then hands had grabbed your ankles, and someone new was suddenly pulling you to the floor as he laughed... No. You're not there anymore.

""Feel free to take as much as you like, dearie. The mushrooms are for flavoring, I prefer to add them in."" You didn't know what - when - probably while you were mid-flashback, she had served you. You grabbed your spoon and began eating, unsure if your meal would be snatched back at a moment's notice.

""Slow down, my dear. You'll choke if you carry on that way!"" The old woman's genuine kind tone had you chewing more slowly, tears beginning to well up in your eyes. She cared - she didn't want you to choke. She didn't want you to die. You continued eating, the blurred vision from crying no match for the muscle memory and sheer hunger within you. The woman chatters on about how nice it will be to have company again, how her children never visit, busy with children of their own, or in one case running her own business selling pottery. ""You're eating out of my daughter's bowls, we both are, I dont know if I told you that.""

""You didn't. Sorry I'm crying, this is just - your food - and kindness -""

""I understand. You're free to feel however you need to, Lord knows I could have never raised five children here if I gave a hoot about crying. They would make one another cry arguing over the darnedest things! Do you have any siblings?""

""No."" You wonder if your parents were still alive. Your grandparents definitely weren't, and Mom was doing poorly when you were captured. ""That sounds really nice, a family full of love, where tears at the kitchen table are welcomed.""

""It was, oh how I miss them. Having you around will be just like old times, you're free to stay as long as you'd like."" You nodded, afraid to speak, afraid you might say something to ruin this old woman's fantasy of you as a replacement child. If she knew... but she didn't know. You were safe enough for now, so you refilled your bowl, adding in some mushrooms like she had suggested.",22
1lm0qsg,n048u5f,"The sun was blinding, and the rays were hot on my pale skin. The horizon was blurry, my eyes unable to see well into the distance.

I kept walking and walking down the road, hungry and tired, and yet alive. So alive that I hoped it wasn’t all just a dream—too beautiful to be real. So I kept pushing forward with renewed energy, but also deep fear. I wouldn’t be captured again. Never again. I would rather die.

And so I crawled and struggled until a little shack was in front of me, just at the outskirts of a small town. An old lady was there, watering the flowers in her garden. Beautiful flowers full of vivid colours, and my heart ached with joy. I never expected to see flowers again.

She saw me approaching and just stared. Shocked. I certainly didn’t look well. “Are you all right? What happened to you?” she asked.

*Too much*. But I couldn’t say anything—my voice was lost. And soon I was standing close to her, my face pleading. For what exactly, I didn’t know.

She kept staring at me, surveying me intently. “You look starved. Come in, I was about to eat dinner. You can join me and then maybe explain,” she gently told me. She moved and went inside. I just followed silently.

As soon as she placed food in front of me, I froze. My eyes prickled, and I fixed my gaze on the elderly woman's tender face. As heavy tears started running down my cheeks, I realized I no longer knew what kindness was. That I had forgotten what a hot meal tasted like. What it meant to be cared for. 

And for the first time, I remembered what real happiness could feel like.",9
1llzt9x,n03upto,"At last I see the sunset, beneath the sea of flames above my head and the icy floes that traverse it, commuters to the edge of Heaven.



I never imagined that Death would come for me this way, in such beauty. The abbott had always told me that Death was cloaked in black; the Holy Mother insisted he was skeletal of face; the warden played at being Death himself, until the ebon funeral shroud was laid across his casket.



But Death of the mind is surely different than Death of the body - I see that now. We are always taught that insanity is the destruction of the conscience, that it might as well be a fatal wound where naught but the physical form remains. Yet as the icy wind whips up the cliff below me and scars my face with daggers of mist, I understand that Death of the mind is freedom of the soul. For no mind could see and feel the world as I do now, could comprehend the limits it imposes upon its own existence.



I close my eyes and imagine myself floating away from the unforgiving ground, untethered by all but the thinnest wisps of grass tall enough to touch my bare feet - and when I open my eyes, I find myself hovering, inches closer to the fiery expanse above, cooling now from its crimson hues and leaving little more than embers behind that glimmer and wink against a darkening bed of coals. I will myself to leave the earth behind, to ascend beyond this mental Death of mine and liberate not just my soul but my body too.

What forth walk, the infinite shattering goes on and on for eternity and sifts back only to shatter again. 10,000 times ten thousand. No one ever restoring to themselves.

Dealt blow after blow by the tides of fate and circumstance, a spiderweb of cracks growing and growing until all was shattered. There was hope at the onset, hope that the growing fissures could be mended. Hope that it was simply a stop on a longer journey, and not a permanent resting place.

Like a source of gravity that cannot be escaped, sliding slowly closer and closer to a point beyond which return was impossible. Until, at last a single, small blow pushed it all over the event horizon, and into the maw of madness.

1lltjhl,n02b3hp,"We looked over the tank she had picked out in the museum. ""It's not gonna run."" Looking over to my friend Sarah. She'd been begging for my help for over a month now and I'd finally come.

She had a large duffel bag that clanked when she swung it. ""It will. I've been sneaking in parts for the past few weeks."" She swung her bag around her like a gleeful child. ""Come on!""

Casually I looked over my shoulder to bound gagged and blindfolded security guard. ""We don't have any fuel for the engine."" I remarked, not having moved from my spot.

She leaned over the tank's edge, looking down on me. ""I've already thought of that."" Giving me a full pearly white grin before disappearing behind the top half of the behemoth.

Looking down the corridor I mentally calculated the size of the behemoth with the size of the rolling garage door. ""So you just plan to, what? Drive a tank weighing two hundred tonnes out onto the streets?""

This time I hear a clang and a bonk before she answers. ""Yeah! I mean what are they gonna do?! It's a Tank!!""

Reading the info panel next to it. ""It's a super heavy prototype tank that drives only twenty kilometers an hour. What're we gonna do? Out run the cops?"" Not that it'd be my first highway chase with the police, though that one lasted two hours and the average speed was not twenty.

""Are you trying to say you won't help me? Cause we both know you came cause you would."" Her voice ending with a singsong note.

I mean. You can go to jail for a car chase and be one among dozens who actually escaped the police. Or you can go on a joyride with your best friend in a Super Heavy Tank and go to jail a legend. ""Yeah."" I agreed. ""Why not.""",18
1lltjhl,n05b4xw,"""Please?"" She whimpered on the other end of the line.

""No, Sarah. I am *not* helping you."" I rubbed my temples as I sighed. It's 5AM. On a Saturday. After working late, I had planned to sleep in today. ""And why do you even want to steal *a tank*? ""

""Sorry...I just–""

""Were you scrolling on your ex's Instagram again?"" Her pause was the only confirmation I needed.

""Okay listen. It was just a quick peek and I happened to see Claire pop up on his latest post.""

Ah Claire. So that's what he was into now. A horrible hag of a woman. I had to agree with Sarah. A tank would be rather useful.

""How about we start with coffee?"" I stepped out of bed. There was no stopping Sarah once she got an idea. ""I have a feeling that a tank might be too far out of your budget.""

""That's why we're *stealing* it.""

""Whose we?"" I rolled my eyes but a smile teased the corner of my mouth.

""You. Me."" She continued as I slipped a shirt over my head and headed to the kitchen.

""Where are we gonna put the thing? Or are we parking it on top of your ex?"" I barked in laughter. Sarah joined me. But she had a sweeter giggle. It made my heart skip whenever I heard it.

""I'm outside.""

""*What*?"" I froze.

""And I do have your coffee.""

Her words were light. Completely unaware.

""Oh okay,"" I started to sweat. ""Give me a few minutes. I'm not exactly... uh, decent.""

Sarah laughed again. ""Sure."" She ended the call.

I turned to the kitchen table. Blueprints were scattered across it. Blueprints of the Rodham Bank. Gate codes. Patrol schedules. A fake ID card. I grabbed a box and swiped everything into it. She didn't need to see those.

I scanned the living room. Seemed ordinary–oh wait. That shouldn't be there. The glock almost blended into my black leather couch. *We""ll just throw this in my room. She's never been in there. She probably won't have reason to either.*

Sarah was a bit absent minded and slightly chaotic, but observant of the oddest things. If I didn't clean up every trace of my *other* life, she would be sure to notice. And then those beautiful, starry eyes might just convince me to *really* steal that tank.",9

""Why is it we always try and rob bloody houses when I'm sweatin' my balls off?"" Callum whispered, doing that funny walk to separate his bits from his thighs and digging his underwear out of his crack.

""You didn't have to come,"" Benny reminded him. The Robinsons were of an age bordering on the infirm and, all in all, *easy marks.* 

""That's just what you want, right? For me to miss out on all the fun."" Callum pushed Benny, sending him stumbling forward and into the full view of the thankfully dark windows. 

Benny turned on his heel and slapped Callum on the side of the head. ""What would you do if they saw me, huh?"" He punctuated his point by pointing to the drawn windows of the lower windows. ""Y' prick.""

""Sorry,"" Callum mumbled. Benny nodded his head towards the door, and Callum slumped his shoulders, shuffled forward and tried the handle. It smoothly opened under his palm. ""It's open."" *A sign of their age, perhaps? Forgetfulness. Or just the fact that the rural town on the arse end of nowhere called for such oversights.*

Callum counted his lucky stars and rubbed his hands together as he cracked the door open and slid inside. It was an old house, and the hinges creaked as did the wooden floor underneath their feet.

The almanack was a blessing. If I hadn’t stumbled into that old woman’s home, I may not have survived to first cycle. Together we found an arrangement. It’s a simple process now — a romantic, candlelit dinner, just me and her. A night so good she won’t remember.

She never remembers.

I do though. The screams aren’t so easily forgettable. That, then the tearing of flesh. The cracking of bone. Even the ripping of cloth. But she’s safe down there. I’m safe. Jasmine is safe. And when it’s over, we can enjoy life like any other normal couple.

I fasten the final chain on the iron door. The links around the lock glisten slightly in the torchlight and they rattle against the key turns, the silver inlay marbling through the alloy.  I hate it when she screams, but it’s a necessary evil. An act of love.

I turn and begin to climb the stone stairs back up to the house, her breathing deepening from behind the metal walls that protect her from the outside world. I reach the apex of my climb, when I hear a knocking at the door.

Fear jolts through me like a stake. Have they come? Have they finally discovered our secret? There’s no way they could have known; we’ve been careful. The wracking on the door erupts through the air again.

I steady my breath and wipe the cold sweat from my brow. Approaching the door, I see a slender silhouette draped behind the stained-glass frontage. The figure is tall and upright. Their collar stood to attention like a dutiful soldier against the winter winds outside.

“Hello, who’s there?” I say from behind the door, leaning my weight against it.

A weary, tired voice trembles from the other side.

“Hell—hello? Sorry t-to intrude at this hour. I’m a t-traveller from Trakvok, and my horse caught a root in the road.”

The man’s voice stopped, snagged in the cragged ice of the wind.

“May I enter?” he asks, through clenched teeth.

I open the door ajar, positioning myself so I can slam it shut if I feel threatened. In the dark outside, framed by the ice-ridden trees of the woodland, stands the traveller. He is a broad, handsome man. Skin as white as the snow on his cloak. A thick tussle of black hair curls like glossy ink down to a widow’s peak. Amber eyes peer down at me passively as a warm smile creeps onto his lips.

The man’s visage does not match the shaking voice.

“Your horse, is it injured?” I ask through the crack.

“Its leg has s-snapped,” the traveller replies. “I had to leave it on the roadside to seek shelter from the s-storm”.

The traveller speaks as though he is freezing, but he stands in the doorway resolute, hand at his side, snow gathering in his collar, yet he remains unfazed.

“May I come in?”

Something within me shifts. My suspicion is not justified! This is a man, lost and cold in the dark. It is my civic duty to offer him shelter and comfort until the storm passes.

“Yes, please. Come and warm yourself by the fire,” I say.
The man chuckles ecstatically, his warm smile transforming into a wide grin as I allow him entry.

“You are most kind, my friend,” he coos as he enters the hall.
He looks about curiously for a moment before removing his cloak and placing it on the coat rack. His wide-mouthed grin remains plastered on his face, like a statue frozen in time. 
But the eyes are passive.

The eyes do not smile.

“Do you live alone?”

“Just me and my daughter, Jasmine.”

“Hmm. Could I trouble you for some wine?” he asks.

The wine is in the cellar with my wife.

“Sorry, sir, but I’m afraid I have no wine.”

The traveller cocks his head, in a disappointed, condescending kind of way.

“Come now, my friend. Surely an esteemed gentleman such as yourself has a fine collection of vintages. Please, go and fetch me one,” he commands.

How could I have been so rude, not to offer a gentleman traveller like this, so above my station, a glass of my most expensive wine?

“I shall fetch it at once, mas—sir” I croak.

I step down into the cellar. It is deathly still. She is quiet when not disturbed, which is why I never come down here during the full moon. I turn the key in the lock, the chains clacking against the stone wall as they come free. Pushing the door open, it creaks like the screams of her victims. The victims we grieve for.

She is hunched in the corner, breathing deep and slow. Why am I here? I know I should leave her alone down here. And all to fetch wine for a stranger?

My wife looks up at me. Her eyes are hollow and full of hunger. She doesn’t recognise me when she’s like this. Teeth like razors glint in the torchlight as lips curl back in fiendish gluttony.

Where my mind has frozen in fear, something else has taken control. Almost acting on its own, my legs take me to the wine rack, and I grab a bottle of Saluk Red. My wife begins to stalk me as I retreat towards the traveller.

“I have a fine bottle of Red,” I say as I enter the living room.
I stare, frozen, at the blood-drenched traveller. He is holding my Jasmine in his claws, her blood trickling down his neck.

“It seems I have already found a glass,” he moans in near ecstasy.

“But now for the vintage,” he turns towards me, hunger in his blood red eyes.

But his hunger subsides. His hunger turns to fear.

For it is my wife’s turn to feast.",50
1llif5x,n026cb0,"Callum opened the fridge and sniggered. He grabbed a carton of milk from the door, popped the lid and chugged it. It spilt from the corners of his mouth and leaked into the already equally sweat-stained front. He wiped his mouth with his hand and pulled up the top, rolling it underneath his armpits and sticking out his belly to savour the cold leaking fridge air.

""In here,"" Benny said, pointing to the thick wooden door off to the side. It was heavy and larger than the other doors in the house. Callum pressed his free hand against it, and the paint peeled off its face and flaked to the ground.

Callum gulped more of the milk, half of it already gone. He burped under his breath. ""How do we open it?""

Benny pointed to the old brass key sticking out of the lock and rolled his eyes. He turned the key, and the heavy thunk of a lock resounded from inside. Callum pulled the bar lock from across the door, opened it, and swilled the dregs of milk at the bottom of the carton. He pulled it to his mouth and, over the lip of the plastic bottle, looked inside. Two eyes stared at him from the darkness, large and yellow, and they tracked him from the shadows. The milk stuck in Callum's throat as he shook and choked. The summer heat dissipated as the cloying hand of fear wrapped around his neck, and the slow thump of his heartbeat pounded in his ears.

A beast of great height skulked forward, illuminated by the moonlight spilling from the kitchen window over Callum's shoulder. 

""What's going on?"" Benny clicked his tongue and pushed the door until it was open all the way and resting against the kitchen wall. In the pearlescent glow, the silver chains rankled and clanked against the solid concrete basement floor.

The beast opened its mouth, growling and snarling, its lips peeling from the long, yellowed teeth. Its voice was like gravel scraped under a boot, heavy and dissonant. ""Is that my milk?""",33

""How? Why? You are so overpowered it hurts my brain to think about it...AND I HAVE SUPERINTELLIGENCE!"" he screams.  
I shrug.  
""Bad guys are also needed in the ecosystem."" I say.  
""Yeah, because how bad would we have it to have only heroes, and no crimes, and no villain business."" he rolls his eyes.  
I chuckle.

  
""You really think that if there were no villains, no one like me...  
The world would be an utopia?"" I ask.  
He frowns.  
""Of course not. There would be still inequality, and corruption, but..."" he starts.  
""And heroes can do something about that?"" I ask.  
""Well legally, we are trying..."" he continues.  
""And whom do quite a few villains target specifically?"" I ask.  
He says nothing.

  
""You see? Bad guys are needed.  
Without me, at least 12 heroes would be full-blown enemies, and the government and several rich folks could do shady stuff freely."" I say.  
""Don't you dare justify your wanton crimes by saying it is for the greater good."" he growls.  
""But it is. And it is my calling. I am good at annoying people, and at attacking people where it hurts.  
Like you for example, dear brother.  
Super intelligent, and one of the top heroes, yet you simply can't comprehend why villains are a necessity, rather than a burden."" I say.  
This hit the spot.

  
""YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW?! I DON'T KNOW THAT HEROES HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED WHEN RICH PEOPLE COMMIT CRIMES? WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SUBTLY OR NOT INFRINGES UPON OUR RIGHTS?!"" he roars.  
I sip my tea.  
""But...but must my own brother be Public Enemy Nr. 1? Can't someone else unite the heroes? Can't someone else keep the rich and the politicians on their toes?"" he mutters.  
I sigh.  
""I like it. I can take it. And until you heroes have these ""moral codes"", that want oh so much to follow the rules, and laws...  
I am needed."" I say.  
Just then, mom comes inside with cookies.

""H-H-How old is senior?"" she stutters.  
I smile.  
""No need to worry, I am not a human to care about things like that.  
I am roughly 40 thousand year old? I was here when the era changed, and civilizations before this one disappeared."" I say, as thunder rumbled.

  
She flinched.  
""Don't worry. It is the world angry at me mentioning those times.  
What is gone is gone, and we those who survived, aren't allowed to spread that information."" I smile.  
She nods.  
""D-Do you have books on genes?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Couple hundred, don't have all of them. Would say thousands if I could give you the one from before your civilization's time."" I say.  
She bites her lips.

  
""Were the people...back then, versed in curing genetic disorders?"" she asks.  
""After a while yes. They went a different direction, and were people closer to nature, and their bodies.  
They had these Blood Warriors and Priests, but in actuality they were just two branches of the same tree: one focusing on their bodies, the other on their minds.  
The Blood Warriors could see their cells, and could control how nutrients flowed inside of them, destroying diseased cells easily.  
Also, they studied genetics through ""bloodlines"", they wanted to achieve what other animals could do, as humans."" I say.  
Her eyes sparkled.  
""C-Can I have a book on that?"" she asks.  
Thunder shook my lair.

  
""Exactly that? No."" I say.  
She visibly wilts.  
""But, I could write it down based on today's knowledge, and approach, thus basically giving you information from the current civilization...albeit a bit more advanced that what the public has."" I say.  
""You would do that for me? You can do that?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""You traveled a long way, and Fate brought you here, through the hidden paths I carved.  
I will do it, and of course I can. I read all these books, and more!  
I am a Knowledge hoarding Dragon!"" I laugh, and take out some papers, and start writing.  
When she leaves, I can feel...the World smiling at me.  
Oh, it seems whatever she needed that knowledge for, will turn the world into a better place, and I have been rewarded for that.

1llfbzs,n0056ug,"""I can grow you a new body,"" the scientist declared. ""And more than one too, if you ever need to switch again.""

The bodysnatcher, currently a mass of shifting shadows, hissed and snarled. ""Explain why I shouldn't simply take your body and your knowledge, then use that to make more bodies.""

""I can tailor your body to your specifications,"" the man pushed up his glasses. ""Perform genetic modifications, and biological transformations. It is easier to have someone perform these operations than to try and do it on yourself.""

""...good point,"" the ancient creature, no longer recognizable as the human sorcerer it once was, conceded. ""I declare you, Mr. Pascal Hartford, my slave. Your duties—""

""Slavery has been abolished a few hundred years ago,"" the scientist frowned, before pointing at his staff pass. ""Also, I am Professor Hartford.""

""It says Pascal,"" the bodysnatcher was adamant.

So was the scientist. ""Professor is a title, not my first name. Can we get back to the topic? What kind of body do you want?""

""An excellent one.""

""You need to more precise than that. Every physical body is adapted to their environment in more ways than one. So, do you want to be a creature of the skies, of the land, or the seas?""

""All of the above.""

Prof. Hartford shook his head. ""Pick one, dammit. You can't have everything.""

A wisp of shadow curled around a pen and began scribbling on a stray piece of paper that was not being crushed under the weight of a hundred folders. When the shadowy entity was satisfied with its crude drawing, it thrust the paper into Hartford's face.

""You've been watching too much anime, haven't you? You can't have a turtle's hard shell, wings of a bat, horns of a mountain goat, and...are those tentacles? Please choose something reasonable.""

""You are saying you can only create existing templates of existing creatures?"" The bodysnatcher bemoaned. ""How dull.""

""The body has to be functional. And *that* does not look functional.""

The shadows weaved and shifted in what appeared to be an attempt to nonchalantly shrug. ""Do I look like I care for mortal laws of nature and physics?""

""You should, if your objective is a physical body that can do more than float about and make impossible demands,"" Hartford was insistent that he not be coerced into breaking the fundamental laws of this earth.

""Fine, fine, a human body,"" the bodysnatcher was resigned to such banal unoriginality.

""Skin color?"" Hartford raised an eyebrow. ""And be serious. This isn't some character customization screen on a video game. I will not make you green skin.""

""Pick something for me, servant.""

""I'm an employee, not a servant,"" Hartford scowled. ""Fine, generic white guy you will be.""

So much for listening to that human talk about advanced technology and his immense technobabble. It seemed not much different than good old flesh-shaping and biomancy. Many years ago, after jumping from human to human, he had wanted to be something more. For the art of crafting flesh and bones to become greater than the mortal lifeforms on this earth.

Turns out, thousands of years later, nothing important had changed despite all the other rapid changes in the world. His new body was still going to be a human body.",56
1llnqu5,n0206e4,"""What do you mean we LOST one?!""

""What I said. Just gone. Disappeared. Poof. The truck hit them exactly as planned, but instead of arriving, they just somehow....*didn't*.""

The chief executive goddess sighed. This wasn't a problem she wanted to deal with. This entire place gave her headaches. So what if one was unaccounted for? Isn't a 99% success rate plenty good enough? She couldn't understand how anyone thought this place would still be profitable with these newfangled concepts of 'accountability' and 'workplace safety.'

""What do the logfiles say?"" She asked. She didn't actually want to hear the answer, but it was good to keep up pretense. It was hard to believe, but even the shareholders here started asking for more than just 'number go up', as if that isn't the entire point of a business.

""Well, since we are no longer collecting any *superfluous* data, there's not much here, but according to what we have, everything worked. The truck made impact, their soul got the whole reincarnation spiel, agreed to the blessing of eulatos, and stepped into the portal. And then...*nothing*. The town of tut'orial reports that they never arrived, and the system can't find them anywhere on the newp layer.""

""I...see."" She didn't, of course. All she saw right now was herself relaxing at her vacation home in fillerville, listening to  beachepis ode on repeat, far away from all that drama that was always going on here in plot city.

Maybe it was time to take that golden parachute soon, leave the mess to the next fool trying to milk it some more. If only she could get the shareholders to approve that severance package...

""...only discrepancy we noticed is that the spirit guide said she was brunette, while the driver swears he 'hit exactly the hot readhead he was supposed to hit'. But I can't make sense of what that means, or why we can locate neither the new body nor her soul as a result.""

Hmm. Maybe this could actually be what she needs. With the right words, she could give the shareholders a good scare. And then all she had to was promise them it won't happen again, and they'd happily sign her retirement fund. Now, how could she accomplish that without actually doing anything...

""Okay, I'll take it from here. Thank you, Wedge.""

""Biggs, goddess."" Ah, how she loved that word. The title was the second best part of this job, right after the pay.

""Whatever. Look, how did we even notice she's missing? We 'transport' thousands of people every day, surely we can't be stalking them all like some kind autocratic surveillance state. That's a huge invasion of privacy!""

""We are responsible for-""

""Making sure they get hit by the truck and step into the portal. Everything after that is none of our business, and we shouldn't be snooping into what our catt-...customers do with their new lives.""

""But-""

""Listen to me, Vicks.  When the customers soul steps through the portal, it is sent to a new body of their choice. And quite a lot of them choose 'young woman with very sizable assets.' I don't know what customers usually do first in their new bodies, but I *do* know that you have unrestricted access to it.""

""What?! Are you-""

""All I'm saying is, help me out here a little. You'll tell them we value the privacy of our customers and don't record that, and I won't tell anyone that your name shows up in the publishing information of realvirgins.gov.""

""I....yes goddess.""

""Good boy. Dismissed."" Visibly deflated, the man left the office. 

The chief executive goddess looked at her phone screen and smiled. The money had arrived, as promised, and her PayWall account showed her 50 million richer, sent by 'underpaidaccountant@darklord.fl'. And she was certain that soon, there would be signatures on a severance package of similar size.

Paid to create a problem, then paid again to fix it. The goddess was satisfied. Today was a good day.",13

""You know the farm a few villages over where I used to get my milk?"" You nod, recalling that it took decades for him to find this village in the first place. ""Terrible news. When I got there, there had been a plague among the farm animals. Naturally, the cows were affected too and had to be put down."" the older elf shook his head in the remembered sorrow, briefly losing the thread. You waited patiently beside him at the kitchen table while he sat lost in thought. It was a brief pause, only 20 minutes, before he continued. ""Well, naturally I stayed around and helped them for a while, but once things were back on track I got thinking. The dairy farmer decided to move onto vegetables. Can't get emotionally attached to them of course. And that left an unfilled need."" 

You gave him a fond smile, guessing where this was going. ""Don't tell me. You decided to raise cows?""

""You went to the graveyard? Wait.. you didn't!?""

""I wish to be rid of the itch, and I found it in a ditch, taking the horrible form of the lich!""

""You asked Louise the Lich to bring the back one of the Hendricksons?""

""I only required the recipe, as it was my only necessity, so I traded their help for an accessor-ok I think I'm finished with the poetry.

Ok, that does it. I love her, but I am not going to be forced into marriage for some useless old fart's tradition and reputation. 

""Call your family. And tell them to lift the curse..."" She looks at me as if I were transmorgified into an Owl-bear. She is surprised and scared.

""Honey, please... it is a simple ceremony, and then we can keep our lives.""

And that breaks the dam that held most of my fury... I will not shout in her face, yet this won't do. 

""Seems that you didn't hear me..."" I coldly say. ""You are going to call your family, and politely ask them to lift the curse... Or I will take this matter into my hands."" For any eldritch user, crossing me, the ""Flow's Bane"" wielder is a death sentence. She understands that... she fears that, the day I grow out of this love I feel, or now felt, for her. 

I hope they don't lift it... ""Flow's Bane"" thirsts for Mana, and theirs is said to be quite potent...",54
1llc9ca,mzyvw1l,"As the heroes stared at the grizzly scene the child stood and stretched.  ""Good."" it said in oddly properly pronounced words you wouldn't expect from any child under eight.  ""The local heroes have arrived.""

The Priestess jumped forward, holding up the holy symbol of the ancient deity which granted her a fraction of its power in exchange for being its agent on this world.  ""Back, foul demon!"" she said.  ""I will not allow you to harm another soul.""

""Demon?  I assure you, woman, I am not a demon.  At least if you had said 'ghost' you would have been partially correct for a few months until I properly bonded to this body.""  The baby sighed and started doing slow martial arts moves that reminded the heroes of Tai Chi.  ""Why is it that religious people think everything strange that happens is because of demons?""

A man in red nano-tube reinforced spandex with a white stylized comet on the front of it stepped in front of the Priestess, putting his hand on her shoulder to comfort her.  ""Can I ask what you are, who you are, then?""

  
The baby stopped, looked at the man, then slightly lifted off of the ground and flew over to get a closer look.  ""I know you.  You're the crimson comet.  My older brother is a huge fan."" the baby cupped its hands in the style of a martial artist and bowed, the fact made even stranger by the fact that it was currently hovering a meter off of the ground.  ""My name is Supreme Golden Eagle.  I came to study this lower realm when I realized it was producing something it called 'super heroes.'""

  
Crimson Comet felt like this was a story he had heard before, perhaps from some Chinese or Korean story, and took a guess.  ""You're an ancient cultivator.""

  
The baby, apparently not David Nixon as they had been told, but Supreme Golden Eagle, who hadn't needed them to stop the ritual in which he would be sacrificed by the cult, spoke.  ""I suppose that is accurate, though this body is by no means ancient, and is barely that of a cultivator.  I was only able to get it to the second minor realm of qi gathering, as I can't risk bringing in qi too quickly and causing it to explode.  Even as rare as qi is here, I could easily do so if I'm not careful.""

  
""Then, I suppose you wanted to study us?"" asked the Crimson Comet.

  
""Exactly,"" said the baby, not minding that the attack he had used to kill the bandits had destroyed all of his clothes, and he was therefore naked.  ""Realms that developed unique cultivation methods have always fascinated me.  And here, you don't just have the people with unique bloodlines, like Vampires, channeling or absorbing background energy, like me or a mage, or people receiving divine power from someone wanting to spread their influence, like her,"" he pointed to the Priestess. ""You also have people like you with other interesting energy sources.  So, now that I've answered your question, do you mind if I ask you one?""

  
Crimson Comet shook his head.  ""Not at all.""

  
The Baby nodded.  ""Is it true that you got your power from a comet that was passing Earth, and that you can now fly, have a protective forcefield, and can shoot energy blasts from your hands?""

  
Comet nodded.  ""Yes, that is the basics of my backstory, though I've kept the specifics private.""

  
The Baby nodded.  ""Good."" it said, rubbing its chin in thought until it realized it no longer had a beard.  ""In that case, you will make a great sparing partner once I've reclaimed enough of my power to withstand your attacks.""

  
He landed and The Priestess picked him up, as him walking would blow his cover and a woman carrying a baby if one was available looked better on the news.  They then started to leave.  ""But how did you kill all of them and not get any blood on you?"" asked the Priestess as they neared the front door.

""Sword qi."" said the Baby.  ""Would you like me to teach you?""  The Crimson Comet smiled and opened the front door, and The Priestess was unable to answer as the flash of cameras under the full moon threatened to blind the three of them.",40

They shiver, and then smirk.  
""And you? You really saw the duality of a human like that? How if there is no actual Apocalypse happening?"" they ask.

1lkzhgf,mzx9po4,"The women sat shivering on the porch, a sigh entered May’s throat as she stared at her. “Why are we doing this, I told you. You’re under no obligation to stay, so scram!” 

The pretty woman on the porch, marble skin wrapped tight in a seal’s cloak, looked at her fondly. “I’m not doing this under an obligation! I……enjoy your company…… I want to stay, if you’ll have me.”

May’s throat tightened. The woman, who revealed her name as Fiadh many weeks ago, when May first met her clinging to the arm of a rough drunkard at the bar, who grabbed Fiadh’s arm a little too tight, with rough hands and bruises. She sat there,  nothing but fear in Fiadh’s pretty steel eyes. May had become quick friends in the short time they spent together, and quickly she learned all about Fiadh and Craig. 

Fiadh had then claimed that Craig had stolen her away from her family, her life, she needed a seal cloak to return, but he kept that locked away tight, away somewhere she could never reach. May thought she was insane, but clearly very scared, and quickly decided that, while the seal cloak thing was clearly a sign of a mental break due to the stress of an abusive relationship, something that sadly, May could relate to, but Fiadh was good company, and May was bored, so why not do a little B&E? For the giggles. 

May slipped in through a window Fiadh had left unlocked, she watched Craig’s chest rise and fall, deep in a drunken sleep. She slipped to the door on the right, down a creepy hall lined with pictures of Craig in his heyday, all smiles and warm eyes. She wondered what happened? What changed? A chest laid behind the door, she knew that much, but the door itself was locked. Luckily, May was prepared, and had herself gotten into lock picking a while ago in a desperate attempt for a hobby during quarantine to stave off the ever coming storm of boredom that was being locked inside all day. 

The door clicked open and May entered, repeating the process on the chest, opening it to find an honest to god seal skin cloak. That’s very illegal, May thought, but promptly picked it up. She crept slowly towards the stairs, up to the bedroom and gave the cloak back, much to Fiadh’s delight. They ran, hard and fast before Craig could wake up, down to the water’s edge. “Where are we going?” May asked.

“You’ll see,” was all the answer she got. 

Fiadh ripped off her robe and spun around as May covered her eyes with a yelp, but she felt hand slowly touch hers, “Look,” Fiadh whispered. 

May, shy in this pretty, funny woman’s presence, opened her eyes slowly. Wrapped around Fiadh was the cloak, silver in the moonlight, slowly, she changed, hands elongated into flippers, arms shortened, legs fused, and May yelped. A seal sat in Fiadh’s place. “My head is going to explode,” said May, the seal snorted in response, then leapt into the sea. 

The following weeks were filled with a distinctly pinniped presence as Fiadh returned, asking to stay, but May felt guilty. She knew some of the stories, the ways of ownership, and she thought of Craig, of his rough hands and the black eyes Fiadh received. 

“I don’t want to own you, I don’t want to even have the opportunity.” May sighed. 

Fiadh looked at her, “I don’t believe you would ever even try.” Her hand stretched out, and May looked at her, her eyes hesitant, before reaching out and grabbing it. Fiadh stood tall and wrapped May in a hug she sank into.",111
1lkzhgf,mzw0s0d,"I look at her, coming to my house once more, coat in hand.  
Before I could say anything, she lays it on the ground, smiling at me.  
""Why do you keep coming back?"" I growl at the selkie, giving the coat back.  
She smiles.  
""Because I love you."" she says.  
I sigh, and before I could lecture her, my wife comes out.  
""Hi sweetie, come in."" she says to her, grabbing her hand.  
Great. I had to save the young selkie...

  
Inside, the two women giggle, and talk about...me.  
""Okay, but Victoria, she can't stay.  
I can't give her what she wants."" I say to my wife.  
She says nothing.  
""Why not?   
A male having multiple partners is normal for us."" she says.  
I sigh.  
Seals...she is talking about seals, but...  
She could be my daughter! That's how young she is! Also...I AM MARRIED!

  
""Say something already honey!"" I sigh, looking to my wife for help.  
She shook her head.  
""She could stay...we could give her the love she needs."" she says.  
Great.  
I deal with the fact that our children went off to the big city to start their lives by fishing, and inadvertently saving a selkie...  
And my wife now wants to deal with the huge hole in our lives by adopting the selkie as our daughter!  
""But she wants a different kind of love!"" I growl.  
The two women doesn't seem to care.

  
""Do you really want my husband as a mate?"" my wife asks.  
I pale.  
""Yes. He would be perfect. So strong, so gentle, so wise."" the young selkie smiles.  
I shiver.  
""Someone to depend on, to protect you, to take care of you, right?"" my wife continues.  
The selkie nods.  
""Would it be bad...if he was only your protector, but not mate?  
Providing for you, loving you...but not mating?"" my wife continues.  
The selkie looks at me and blushes.  
""Y-Yes. I f-forgot that some older males tend...I see. But I agree. I just want to be with him."" she says.  
""Great! You can live with us! And leave and come whenever you like it!"" my wife says.  
""Thank you big sis!"" the selkie says, as the two women leave, talking about which room the selkie will stay in.  
I stand frozen on the spot, thinking that this has been somewhat solved, but...  
I am not that old! And I can...never mind, as long as she stays away from me, I don't mind having another daughter in my house again.  
It was getting lonely with just my wife and I.",231
1lkzhgf,mzx3l3x,"“Why do you keep coming back?” I growled at her, “Look at me!”

She was looking at me.  Staring, pleading with her eyes, reaching with her arms holding out her coat.  Rain was falling over her and she hardly blinked.  I used to point out it was a tell that she was more comfortable in the water than regular people, but it wasn’t something she could change.  Maybe it was and she didn’t bother.  I wouldn’t know, she never talked much.

“I’m not a man, I will never be a man. I can’t give you the children you want.  Find someone who can give you that!”  
I was screaming into the rain.  This is good; it will cover any tears.  I can’t look at that face for more than a few moments without being struck by a want tied to my soul, and desire that makes my entire body vibrate.  

I started pleading with her. “What do you want me to do?”
As my arms opened towards her in my frustration, she took the first opportunity to drape her coat over my arm and walk past me into the house. Again.

I turned to follow her in, but for the first time, she held out her hand and indicated the coat.  In broken Scottish I heard her order “Hide it well.”

I march away in the rain.  I want to hurt something, but I can’t bring myself to ever scratch her coat, and that makes it worse.  

Why does she keep doing this?  I feel her cry when she thought I was sleeping, I try to let her go, and as soon as I am over the pain she is back at my door.  It’s been years at this point and I can’t move on or out or anywhere to or anyone else.  I keep trying to do right by her, so why am I tortured for it?

There is a cove a half mile from the house.  She knows it well; it’s the first place I found her.  I’m too resentful to follow directions well, so I place the coat where I know no other humans can find it, but she would know in a moment.  

On the trek back I am slower.  I already know how this will go.  I love her and am terrified of doing this again, losing myself again.  I consider walking the extra mile to the pub, but that won’t change the outcome. 

I knock at my own door.  She answers and kisses me.  My heart cracks and reforms by the second as I carry her to my bed.

She is not crying over night, but I know it is a matter of time.

Come morning I fry up the last of the eggs with some salted fish and I see them - two selkies, the youngest I’ve ever seen.  They are helping each other out of their coats and walking - walking here?  

My beautiful selkie is so happy.  She points to them out the window, hopping and clapping.  I demand to know what is going on.

She looks at me like I was an idiot.  “You father now.”  She runs out to meet the little ones.  I stand dumbfounded.

I cry watching her ushering me outside, watching her fuss over these two naked children.

I think…did she think she failed me?  Were all her tears for me, that she could not give me this?  Had I turned her away and left her thinking I thought she was a problem?  I was never not a fool, but never more than now.

It did not matter now.  Now I needed more eggs, and some clothes.  And I needed to rebury that coat.",66
1lkzhgf,mzw4n30,"“Why do you keep coming back?” The words left my lips like venom. There was no reason for her to stay, I gave her back her coat yet here she was. Her long brown hair swaying softly in the wind. 

Her eyes softened, the expression on her face painfully familiar to me. “Why do you keep pushing me away? It’s obvious you enjoyed my company. Yet the second I was better I woke up on the beach.” 

I didn’t respond. My actions were cruel, I could’ve waiting until she had woken up. Despite that, I cross my arms, leaning against the wall. “Leave.” I hiss. Her eyes glowed slightly, narrowing in determination as she crossed her arms as well.

“No.” 

I could feel my annoyance grow, slowly bubbling over until I let out a long sigh. I look at her before stepping aside.

“Fine. Come in then…it’s down pouring and you’re soaked…”",62
1lkzhgf,n00lof5,"""Why do you keep coming back?"" I growled. ""You already made your choice. There's nothing left for you here.""

I grabbed the seal coat she'd tried to hand me and tossed it at her. She caught it in one hand, her eyes never leaving mine. Her once black hair flowed grey and her face was lined with wrinkles now, but the haunting intensity of her gaze never changed. So familiar to me, yet somehow always alien, her dark eyes carried deep yearning. 

I'd once thought her the most beautiful woman alive. Looking at her now, it was still true. 

My anger leaving me, I sighed. ""Please, tell me why.""

""The ocean remembers,"" she said.

Hot tears well up in my eyes. 

""The ocean may remember,"" I said bitterly, ""but so did *I*. Did you consider what it did to me when you left without a trace? Knowing I wasn't enough to keep you here?""

""The ocean remembers,"" she repeated, firmly, insistently, holding out the coat again. 

""But what does that *mean*? What does anything you say ever mean?"" The tears spilled down my face.

Her gaze softened as she stepped towards me. She grabbed my hands in hers and squeezed, as if her touch could transmit her message. 

She touched the salty tears in on my face. ""In your tears, in your blood, the ocean remains.""

""But *mom* - "" My voice cracked with emotion. ""I was just a kid."" 

Heavy sobs overtook me. Unable to speak I gazed into her eyes, and saw the kindness in them. How had I ever thought they looked alien? 

Ever so gently she placed the coat over my shoulders. 

Immediately, I felt the rush of ocean waves in my ears, salt on my tongue. I felt the joy, the freedom, of the wide open ocean. I felt the delight of one surrounded by family and loved ones, swimming together as one, playing together in the currents. I felt the simple delights of the turning of the seasons, the earth, the rain, and the wind. 

Mixed into the symphony of joy that flooded my senses, there was one song of sorrow and loss. The memory of the child left behind, trapped on land. 

I knew now that the coat around my shoulders was not hers but mine. I had rejected it all those years ago. And yet, day after day, season after season she kept it safe, preserved it, so that she could bring it back to me. 

My sobs came to a pause with a shudder. 

""You did love me,"" I whispered. ""You *do* love me."" 

She smiled and I could see the relief in her face, the gratitude. 

""The ocean remembers,"" she said. And this time, I understood. 

""I can't go with you, mom,"" I said. ""I have a life, a job, a purpose. And people who love me, one of them quite deeply. If I go with you... there's no coming back is there?""

She cocked her head. ""The seasons change.""

To ask a selkie to guarantee a future was as impossible as asking a wave to stand still. If I went with her, I knew I would learn to live as she did, from moment to moment, and I may never return.

""I'm staying here,"" I said, taking the coat off my shoulders. But I held onto it this time, instead of throwing it back to her. 

She nodded, accepting. ""You are the ocean,"" she murmured in her melodic voice.

""I am. And I promise, mom, I will remember.""",16
1lkzhgf,mzxp6mh,"TW: >!toxic relationship!<

Stomp, splash, stomp, splash. Can't even properly stomp anymore, the damn kitchen is flooded again. I kick the water; a wave of rage crashes over me at the underwhelming result. Like that was going to do anything.

The whole damn house smells like saltwater. And something else. Something foul, something fishy? No, that's just the beach... this is the stench of something warm. Something alive.

Three small raps on the front door. Witch's number. I spit in the fireplace.

My boots squelch as I lay down heavy, commanding footsteps. I hope she can hear them. If she's scared, then we'd be even. My heart hammers. I go in to all but rip the door of its hinges, but something in me opens it gingerly.

A large, old-fashioned hat covers half a face. It is a round, sweet face resting over razor-sharp bones. One visible almond-shaped eye lifts to scan me, stops at my overgrown beard, and at last meets my gaze. Her mouth, one I've seen stretched into a wide smile so many times before, is set in a small, round pout.

""Why do you keep coming back?"" I growl at her.

She stares at me. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. There is something off about her fur coat, which she slides off and places in my hands. Something about it doesn't quite suit her. She slips past me into the house.

""You know why I keep coming back.""

She wanders in, beginning to open my cabinets, closets, any drawers she comes across. I follow her.

""You can't just enter my house!""

""I'm not a \*vampire\*, Sebastian!"" She slams a drawer closed and whips around to face me. We are stuck there, staring at each other. Strong emotions play across her face - fury, determination, disappointment, desperation. For some reason, it reminds me of the dance of an Aurora Borealis across a sky. We saw it once, her and I. When we were in love by the sea.

How far away those days seem now.

Her face softens, just for a second. When she speaks next, her voice has more honey in it, more lilt and fatigue.

""Sebastian, I need you to give me my coat.""

I lift her fur coat to her. She shakes her head and pushes it roughly to the side. It falls, with a dramatic flourish, to a puddle on the floor. The living room is flooding too? I hadn't noticed that before.

She marches to a closet and throws the door open. Inside, there are dozens of fur coats, all of different shades and fur types. She stands in the doorway. I watch her shoulders slump defeatedly and feel a malicious sort of glee.

""Which one is it?"" She is trying to sound authoritative now.

I lean against the wall and cross my arms. ""Shouldn't you know? You can't recognize your own coat?""

She looks at me. There is something mounting in her eyes. ""Which - one - is - it?""

I gave an exaggerated shrug.

Then, the sound of glass breaking. (PART 1/2, CONTINUED IN COMMENT)",16

“You husband, please, come with me!” She said in broken English. 

“Hold your seahorses little lady, I am no such thing! “ I stated backing away, hands held waist high.

“You swam with me!” She said. 

Flabbergasted I said “ the hell I did?”

“You my beloved now!” She said 

Stunned “ I never seen you before little lady!”

She picked up the seal coat and draped it over her self. “Poof” a light then , there was that gray and white spotted sea lion laying on the beach staring at me with those same eyes. 

“Holly Bat turds , I did swim next to you!” I exclaimed. 

“Poof” The lady was back holding the seal coat away from her body, blinking her eyes. “She you husband “

I stammered “ but I was just swimming in the cold water for exercise and my health. I didn’t know swimming next to a playful sea lion meant marriage?”

She looked perplexed, “all sea folk know of mating rituals “

I say “ I am not sea folk, I am not any kind of sea creature. “

She asked “why you swim in cold deep waters if you not , Selkie, not merman, or finfolk? “ pause “ how you know the mating swim?”

I said “I was swimming for exercise. I got no clue what you are talking about. “ I turned to leave. 

“If you are just confused human, then you are just meat. I don’t mate with meat. “ 
Her jaws unhinged and multiple rows of sharp shark like teeth appeared. 

She quickly caught up to me. Jumping on my back. The last thing I heard her say was “meat not husband “ CRUNCH!",36

Odessa flings herself into the closet and begins tearing through the coats. She runs her hands over them searchingly before hurling each of them to the ground. At the same time, I feel the water on the floor start to rise. I twist around and see water pouring in through a broken window. I hear another crash ring out in the kitchen, and all the water begins rising even faster.

What the fuck? Is it a hurricane? I wade as fast as I can to peer out the window. Only clear skies. More muted thuds from the closet as coats begin to heap on the ground. 

""Odessa! What the fuck is going on? Are you doing this?"" I yell. The water is knee deep now, and coming fast. Small items are starting to lift off the coffee table. Odessa appears the closet doorway. Her eyes have become extremely dark. They almost seem to be glowing as they sear into me.

""Sebastian.""

Do I remember the Lord's Prayer? The window is too small to fit through, though it sure can let a hell of a lot of water in, it seems. I start wading as fast as I can to the front door, but it's up to my waist so it’s slow going. Odessa follows me, somehow cutting through the water like butter. 

""Sebastian. My coat. Now.""

I yank on the front door, but it won't budge. I feel a small hand on my back and jump. How the fuck did she get over here so fast? A small voice chuckles and chides me - oh Sebastian, you know how.

I turn to face her. I feel my feet begin to lift off the floor as the water carries me upwards. The real estate agent had raved about the low ceilings when she pitched me this place, which I found odd at the time and privately joked about to my friends. ""So cooooozzzzy!"" I would mimic her, with an exaggerated tone.

Back when I had friends.

I stare into her eyes - pure milky black voids, with not discernible bits of white left. ""I won't give you your coat, because you can't leave me,"" I told her plainly.

She blinks. ""I have already left you. Several times.""

""But you see,"" I say as the water rises to my shoulders. ""You always come back.""

She looks at me, wordlessly. I've never seen her look like this before, so... tormented. Something in me is beginning to twist uncomfortably; I don't know if it is excruciation or deep excitement. 

She looks at the water in the room, splashes it around half-heartedly. Suddenly, she lets out a violent sob. ""I just want to go \*\*\*HOOMMEE\*\*\*!"" She began to wail with a sound I have never in my life heard a human make before. It was primal, and animalistic; it rang out like the foghorn of a ship lost at sea. A ship that would never again see a bustling port.

My stomach tightened even more - unbearably - before suddenly going still. I witnessed her agony and felt clarity. Realization. Shame. It was not excitement or excruciation that was festering inside of me. It was only pain, and it had only even been pain, and now, that pain was infectious.

With the water under my chin, I swam to the center of the room and felt around in the ceiling planks. Finding the one that was loose, I lifted it as high as I could manage. Dark fur slid down and plopped into the water.

In a flash, before I could even drag the plank back down, Odessa was beside me. She hugged the fur to her with relish. She blinked at me, one last time, as if to say something. I didn't quite understand; not much time to decipher it anyways. On went the coat, and I watched a quick little seal slip like butter through the broken window as the water hit the ceiling.",21
1lle7nk,n011vm7,"“You’re alive?” I ask. 

It’s been over a decade, but I recognize the tiny scar on his chin. It was one of the first marks I left on him, and while it’s faded with time, it has not disappeared. 

“Don’t go around publicizing it,” he says, raising his hands in mock surrender. “I’m not a danger to anyone now.”

“You lost your powers?”

The Smokescreen was one of the most dangerous villains when I was fighting supercrime. If he had lost his powers, it was no wonder that he had faked his death. He just as many enemies among other supervillains as he did among the superheroes. He followed his own twisted idea of right and wrong, and while twisted, his sense of morality still existed.

“Nope, still there. I just don’t feel like wreaking havoc anymore. I found a better use for my talents.” 

“What better use?” 

“My niece is having a wedding in Lake Como, what better use do you think?”

He has the infuriating habit of answering questions with more questions. 

“You downgraded to normal white collar crime?” I ask. 

“No, I’m just an inventor now,” he says, and the chain of infuriating questions is broken. “Instead of outlandish devices meant to disrupt society, I help us reach our eventual capitalistic collapse with less bumps on the road.” 

“That’s good,” I answer, and I can’t keep the slight envy out of my voice. We both fought on opposite sides. By every metric, I did every single right thing. Yet here I am, broken body and cynical soul, escaping to a wedding to forget my problems. And here he stands, wealthy and healthy, despite countless crimes. 

“What about you? Don’t heroes usually work until well into their forties?”

Well into their forties, or into their death. That part remains unspoken. 

“I got injured,” I tell him, because there’s nothing to hide. Like him, I’m also covered in scars. No amount of foundation can cover up the mangled mess of lines present on my knee. There is no glorious retirement for heroes, no cushy pension. I’m still stronger and faster than a normal human can hope to be, but I am no longer the sentient weapon that I used to be. They sent me off with minimal medical debt, a signed NDA, and a joke of a settlement. It was like removing the foundation of a house and expecting it to stay standing. 

Being a hero was my identity, and it took years to shed the memories. It takes conscious effort even now to not react at the news of some crime, to ignore the sounds of police sirens. We are both civilians now, yet only one of us is happy. 

“Do you miss it?” he asks, swirling around some of the outrageously expensive wine in his wine glass. 

“What do you think?” I say, because I don’t know the answer.

A huff that might have been a gasp, or perhaps unexpected laughter. The Haruspex sat down and shook his head. ""Please. You interrupted my work for too long to think I would let death hold me down.""

She couldn't help but smile at that. She really should have expected he'd find a way back. ""Thought we'd taken care of all the backup corpses. You ever get tired of playing with dead demons, doc?""

Another huff. ""Your group never did appreciate my work. Nor did you ever appreciate that for a man in a position such as myself, it paid to ensure that I always had a route of escape planned out...regardless of which side of the mortal coil I was on. And...oh,"" the man who had been her team's first proper supervillain said with satisfaction, ""that is a refreshing drink. Keep a tab open, will you?""

At the urging of the Haruspex, Natalie turned to her own drink again. The two sat in silence for a while, watching the barkeep's professional ignorance. Once the Haruspex was on to his second drink and Natalie her fourth, the former spoke up again: ""So, what brings you to this gathering? I very much hope, for your sake, it is not for me.""

""Family invitation. Related to the bride in pink.""

Her ex-nemesis raised an eyebrow. ""Is that so? Quite similar here. The bride in purple's my great-grandniece.""

Natalie blinked. ""No shitting me? You, the lunatic who thinks electricity and demon corpses mix together, who we sent to...some kind of hell or something multiple times, and you're just some normal guy attending his grandkid's wedding.""

The Haruspex coughed. ""And you, the would-be witch who thought the servitors of the gods that burrow up from beneath the skin of the world could be stopped with pluck and two-fisted gumption, are no different."" He looked at her, and the fire in his eyes smoldered lightly. He still held faith. Natalie hoped, under the ennui of retirement, she still held the same.

""You know, I could take a look at your-"" Natalie interrupted the Haruspex's words with a harsh wave of her hand. ""I don't want what you would offer, and even if I was alright with your work I wouldn't want them fixed now."" She drained the last of her fourth drink. ""I helped save lives, then. I helped save a lot of people's lives. I earned these wounds."" Silently, she waved a hand for a fifth drink. Great thing about magic, that: mere alcohol could never poison you, never get you proper drunk like real magic could. ""So they'll always move. Never close. It's proof I was there, with the others. That we were mere ants in the wake of something greater and we still did something worth a damn. That's what being a hero was about.""

She laughed. ""My grandniece and her family don't know a thing about me or what I did. They're grounded. Sensible, in their own way. They don't burn like you or I burned.""

The Haruspex nodded, then finished his own drink. He leaned over to give a conspiratorial wink. ""My great-grandniece and her family don't know what I do either. I don't know that they've ever asked. But they do know I'm the kindly uncle bankrolling her wedding.""

A pause.

A snort.

A second pause.

And Natalie broke into a fit of a laughter.

""You're a terrible man, doc, but a better relative than me. I'll drink to that.""",5
1ll1mi8,mzw312t,"After yet another defeat, one of my henchmen asks me this.  
I sigh.  
""Is the curriculum this bad at school?"" I ask.  
He chuckles wryly.  
""I dropped out to take care of me ma."" he says.  
Figures.  
""You will get a 10% increase of salary, and also, let me explain this to you."" I say, sitting down.  
Suddenly, more than 20 henchmen appear, eagerly waiting for my lecture.

  
""Magical girls are different than heroes, on that part that they house a little core, aptly named: ""magic core"".  
Through either: a contract with a divine/godly being, or through resonance with magic itself, they trigger their transformation.  
This transformation gives them various powers, and those silly attires, BUT!  
Silly they might be, they are tenacious, and sturdy, while enhancing several traits of the magical girls."" I start.  
""Why are they always girls, and not women?"" one of them asks.  
I throw them a candy.  
""Good question."" I smile.  
She giggles, and the rest stare at me.

  
""Emotional turmoil breeds magic faster. That's why someone with a strong conviction is growing faster as a hero, as a villain, and as a magic girl.  
Teen, or pre-teens going through puberty suffer more upheavals of emotions, thus those beings chose them as contractees, as they have more potential to fulfill the missions faster, as they grow faster than let's say, a middle-aged woman."" I say.  
""But any aged woman could become a magical girl, right?"" one of them asks.  
I give them candy.  
""Yes. And many magical girls, remain magical girls, even in adulthood, unless the contract specifies a time frame."" I say.  
""About the transformation?"" one of them asks.  
I throw a candy, and clear my throat.

  
""The transformation triggers the magic core, releasing large amount of magic, allowing a transformation on a genetic level, and the birth of those costumes.  
Not only that, but it also resonates with the surroundings.  
This involves a lot of magic, which is energy...what happens when gathering and transforming energy is disturbed, and made unstable?"" I ask.  
""Kaboom?"" one of them asks.  
I throw him a candy.  
""Yes, Rico. Kaboom.  
And that's why we don't interrupt them mid-transformation.  
Now go, clean up the HQ, and later we can go through some other common curriculum about our enemies."" I say, dismissing them.  
Cute little ones, if circumstances allowed me, I would do more for them, but hey...  
That's what we are fighting for: change for the better.",239
1ll1mi8,mzx9wck,"“Do you have a death wish?” My boss loomed over me, like I’d just asked the single most idiotic question in the world.

“N-no, Boss, it’s just… Pure Ribbon and Pure Bow, they’re just up in that column of light, floating there for a whole *minute*, y’know? And I was thinking, hey, we’ve got all this dead time here, let’s attack them before they finish transforming and get all strong!”

“Do you understand *how* they’re floating?”

“You didn’t mold me from the darkness to be a physicist, Boss.”

“Correct. Then, let me elucidate you.”

A chalkboard seemed to reveal itself from the shadows. The boss scribbled something onto it, and turned back to me. The chalk in his hand vanished into the shadow of his palm, and turned into a pointer stick which he then *thwapped* against the board.

“Our enemies, the Twin Souls, are raised into the air by a column of light.” He pointed to a little doodle of them doing their holding-hands-and-yelling bit.

“Ordinarily, light isn’t capable of such a thing. However, it does exert a very minuscule force upon things.” He then pointed to an equation, with an arrow drawn next to it pointing back to the doodle’s light column. “Pure Ribbon and Pure Bow are being raised high into the air by this light, so we must conclude that it is billions of times stronger than any sort of light you can find in the World of Reflections.”

I think back to the times I’ve fought them. The light’s power, huh… The times I’ve fought during the day, their Sun was a bit hot, but certainly wasn’t pushing me down. A billion times that… 

I can’t wrap my head around it. “So… what does that mean?”

“Perhaps a little independent study is in order.” The chalkboard and his pointer stick vanish into the shadows. “Go retrieve the Jewels of Light from them, and when they transform, poke a stick or something into the column. It should be very evident then.”

“O-okay, Boss!” I teleport out from the World of Shadows.

Appearing in the World of Reflections (or, as the locals call it, Earth) I try to take note of how the light *feels*. …Doesn’t seem to be anything special? I float towards the nearest tree and snap off a long stick. Well, nothing left to do but find those girls.

Luckily for me, they’re not actually that far from where I entered. They look like they’re on some sort of… hike, I guess? And staring into each other’s eyes rather than the nature around them? Feh, it’s not like there’s anything *worth* staring at around here. Nothing like the rolling, empty expanses of the World of Shadows.

I touch down in front of them. “Hand over the Jewels of Light!”

They… don’t notice me at all, walking straight into me and falling over.

“Really?!”

The orange-haired one sits up first. “Sor— *you!*”

“Hand over the Jewels of Light!” Can’t believe I had to repeat myself.

“We’ll never give them to someone like you!” The black-haired one is on her feet now, helping the other one up.

“Transform-bepo!” The annoying voice of a fairy from the World of Radiance sounds from Orange-hair’s pocket.

“Hurry-bipo!” And his partner’s voice, from her pouch hooked to Black-hair’s bag.

They grab their communes, hold hands, and raise the communes high.

*”Twin Sparkling Resonance!”*

Finally, they shoot up into the sky, and I can approach the pillar of light. I gleefully stab the stick in. What could possibly—

It nearly shoots out of my hand, rocketing up for a moment before I stumble back. I hold the stick out to inspect it and *holy shit it’s just gone.* The portion that was in there was vaporized, and what was just next to it was bone-dry and on fire. Was this the true power of the Twin Souls?

I manage to gather my wits and move back just before they touch down.

“Protector of the Light! Pure Ribbon!”

“Protector of the Light! Pure Bow!”

They strike a back-to back pose. “We are the Twin Souls!”

Bow points at me. “You, enemy to light and bringer of shadow…”

Ribbon points at me. “…Pack up and get lost!”

I stand there frozen for a moment. That power… just what in the world *is* it?!

Well, scared or not, I’ve got to take the Jewels of Light! “Sh-shador! Show them how terrifying the power of darkness can be!”

A dark spirit calls at my command, possessing the burning stick. And so the battle begins…

…

I return to the safety of the World of Shadows. I’m only a little on fire, and I take the time to put myself out before I shed any of this hideous light on the Boss.

“Welcome back.” He was waiting for me. “What did we learn?”

“Y-you were right. We can’t attack them while they’re transforming.” Satisfied, the Boss disappears, and I’m left to dwell.

Hopefully, they never realize the true magnitude of what they could do by transforming on *top* of their enemies…",38
1ll1mi8,mzwvekc,"The two worst things in this 'ere world are love and incompetence. With my luck, I managed to find a boss who is obsessed with both.  It's all the fault of those magical girls, well specifically their leader, Zoey 'Whatever the Hell the Rest of Her Name is'. From the bits of 'istory I gathered from the crew, our idiot leader met 'er as kids and has spent his life since tryna get 'er attention. For the life of me I can't figure out why- sure she looks good in that uniform while beating our ass time and again, but our leader ain't no slouch neither. Tanner's some rags to riches tech prodigy who funds our operation from his massive business success. We're out 'ere doing the dirty work while the good ol' boss sips champagne with actresses and politicians alike. Cry me a river that 'e's found the one girl who wouldn't give 'im the time of day. I bet it's that stupid name of 'is, hah!

Anyways, things are finally changing tonight. The boys and I 'ave been disgruntled with the lack of progress since our lil' group started. Sure the paychecks are nice, but it takes a toll constantly losing to a group of sparkly twenty somethings. The last mission was just a simple bank robbery, something me and the fellas have plenty of history with. Guess who coincidentally happened to be patrolling that night. Sure we got out but Phil spent three weeks in the hospital- missed his son's little league championship for Christ's sake! You think Tanner gave a rat about that or any of the other complaints we mentioned? I 'ad enough and hosted a secret meeting without the big boss- a big no-no in my community of professionals. Turns out we've all been thinking the same lately so we made a plan.

Tonight we are stationed at some chemical plant doing whatever- doesn't matter because it's set up for us to fail, always is. I don't know if Tanner, after all these years, is trying to work up some courage to talk with Zoey or 'e just thinks that the big reveal will knock 'er off 'er feet but neither of them know what's about to happen See, these magical girls have such an obvious weakness, before their transformation they're just simple people like youse and me. As I'm writing this I'm sure the magical girls are meeting as a group, coming up with some bollocks plan, and preparing to transform. That's why I got four of my guys with the best snipers money could buy at the ready. And Phil, whose all patched up now, has the most special assignment. Lucky bastard drew the biggest stick so got to be the one to take out Tanner. Once he gives the signal that things are good to go, BAM! All our problems are gone and the years of beatings and losses are over. Screw love, Tanner, and the magical girls- it's time for a new group to run this city.",21
1ll1mi8,mzy8h3k,"""It's unsporting, that's why. They show up to fight us, taking all this effort to get up to our level, and then give us a splendid show of power. It would be extremely rude to kick the chair out from under them while they were mid-way through setting the stage.""

*THe gathered collection of Dark Monsters falls silent at their boss' uncharacteristically non-dramatic speech pattern. Normally he'd rant and rave at the lightest provocation, but this time he matter-of-factly answered the question without even raising his voice. His normal sneer of superiority replaced with a deadly-serious blank mask.*

""B-But Boss, isn't our purpose to *defeat* the Starlight Guardians? Why not use every option for that?""

*The Chaos Avatar, their boss for the past 5 years, lets out an amused laugh. A short, muted affair very different from his usual maniacal overtures. SOmething is off here, they can feel it.*

""Oh it is, certainly. Our job here is to defeat this realm's Guardians and take the whole thing for ourselves! But, we will do so in the *proper* way. Sure we could strike at them mid-transformation, the runaway chain reaction would annihilate them easily. In fact, if we *really* wanted to be efficient we could strike them *before* they transform. After all, I know who they are, it wouldn't be hard to assassinate them before they can even realise what is happening. But I won't. Wanna know why?""

*The small army of Dark Monsters is dumbfounded at his words. Their boss knows who the Starlight Guardians are outside of their suits? He could've dealt with them __this whole time__ but has actively chosen not to? Doubt begins to creep into their minds, and some dread as well. How well do they know their boss, really?*

""U-Uhm, why, Boss?""

""Because winning instantly is *no fun*. I could end this whole conflict with a flick of the wrist and a well-placed piercing spell, but that would be *boring*. Where's the *drama* in that> THe *entertainment*? Striding in and just striking the heroes down in one fell swoop is certainly *effective*, but there is nowhere to *go* from there. No narrative to build up to, no further action to be had. A waste of potential, and I *hate* wasted potential.""

*At that last part the Chaos Avatar, supreme leader of the Forces of Darkness, and mysteriously powerful being with origins unknown, levels his glowing purple eyes at his army, all amusement gone from his face and an aura of dread spreading through the crowd. THey all suddenly accutely felt like they __really__ had no idea what their Boss really __was__. ANd that he very much was not like them, that he was something very different. SOmething very __scary__, and dangerous in a way their previous boss could've barely even dreamed off.*

""As such, if I find out any one of you decided to take the initiative and do something as irritating as interupting a Guardian's transformation, then I will make sure that your existence will not end for a *very long time*""

*The tone of his voice, along with the sudden unearthly echo hidden within it, make the exact nature of this threat very, __very__ clear. It also made another thing very clear: THe Chaos Avatar did __not__ have the same goal as the Army of Darkness. Their aim is to conquer the WOrld of Starlight (Refered to as Earth by the locals). __His__ aim is to be __entertained__. And woe betide the one to interrupt his entertainment.*

*THe assorted Dark Monsters simply nod in response. They have no other options here, their boss holds all the cards. Best not to rock the boat again, as whatever he is he is certainly much stronger than their previous boss.*

*He suddenly shifts his stance, and the near-unbearable aura of menace disapears, replaced with the more familiar aura of manic villainy and his expression forming back into that familiar manic grin*

""Excelent! Now, let us plan how next to vex the Starlight GUardians! I am sure they have been preparing well, so let's put up a good show, shall we?""

*May the Dark Gods help them all. For their boss sure won't.*",19
1ll1mi8,mzxn3h8,"""Boss, after all the times they thwarted our plans, why are we still not allowed to simply attack the magical girls while they are transforming?""

""DID YOU FAIL ME AGAIN?""

""No-no, course not, ju-just wondering.""

""RIGHT. WELL YOU KNOW THE MAGICAL GIRLS ARE IN SERVICE TO THE GODDESS OF LIGHT, CORRECT?""

""Wait was that why we were given sunscreen in our initiation package when we entered into your servitude?""

""I SPENT A GOOD DEAL ON THAT CREAM, DO NOT CALL IT 'SUNSCREEN' AND DO NOT IMPLY YOU ARE NOT USING IT!""

""Yes boss...""

""HMPH. WELL BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, WHENEVER ONE OF HER SERVANTS TRANSFORMS, THEY DO NOT DO IT FROM THEIR OWN WILL, BUT THE WILL OF THE GODDESS, WHICH-""

""Which we will break sir!""

The Dark Lord simply looked at the demon, which told it exactly what would likely happen if it went against their wishes for the 3rd time.

""HOOOO, SO THE GODDESS'S WILL TRANSFORMS THE MAGICAL GIRL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?""

""...""

""YOU CAN SPEAK.""

""That the goddess is involved in a lot of their transformations?""

""THE GODDESS IS INVOLVED IN EVERY TRANSFORMATION OF HER SERVANT PERSONALLY, OF WHICH SHE MOLDS THEM INTO THEIR NEW FORM. IN ESSENCE, YOU FUCK WITH THEIR TRANSFORMATIONS, YOU ARE DIRECTLY FUCKING WITH THE GODDESS.""

""Oh, thank you for answering the question of a lowly being such as myself!""

""NOT TOO BAD WITH YOUR PROSTRATION, YOU MIGHT LIVE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT. SO YOU SAID YOU HAVEN'T FAILED YOUR MISSION, CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU DEFEATED THE MAGICAL GIRL THIS TIME?""

""...""

""HOW DID YOU DEFEAT THE MAGICAL GIRL?""

""...!""

**""HOW DID YOU DEFEAT THE MAGICAL GIRL?""**

The demon only managed to take 5 steps before its servitude to its master was swiftly cut.",16
1ll1mi8,mzyh9cg,"The room shifted in a wave, as the heads of my fellow henchpeople and henchmonsters twisted to stare at me. Some, the newest recruits, looked grateful with me for speaking up. The more experienced looked at me blankly or with... Sympathy?

The Dark Lord Mazthos, Exiled Lord of the Unlit Shores, loomed over me, his massive form blotting out the light above me even as he remained seated on his throne. A stare without mercy or bored into me. But instead of smiting me on the spot... He sighed, and leaned back as his voice slipped into our minds.

""Magical Girls and the Shadow Realms... Are divided from the wider 'superheroic' environment. Our own separate ecosystem. We fight each other, and only each other. And while familiarity breeds contempt... It also breeds familiarity. We know what to expect from each other. Patterns of behavior, solidified over millennia... A Code.""

There was a murmur from the ranks, quickly hushed.

""You asked why we do not attack mid-metamorphosis. You should also ask why we only drain humans of almost all their energy, instead of leaving them depleted husks. Why we not task spies with following the girls to their homes and destroying them in their sleep. Why I do not take the field at every opportunity and instead send fractions of my forces to battle.""

Mazthos loomed again. I shivered, swearing I could feel the lap of a cold ocean again my shins.

""You should also ask... Why the girls merely drive off those fractions, instead of burning out the shadows among you with their light. Why they do not hand the mortals over to authorities that would be able to keep you locked away. Why they only intrude on the Shadow Realms to battle with those on the cusp of victory, instead of constantly chipping away at the kingdoms.

Do you know why we tolerate this?""

The freezing water was up to my chest. The room was utterly silent. I had to force my body to breathe.

""Because if we abandon this balance... If Shadow and Light hurl themselves at each other without restraint... We do not know who would win."" His fingers tightened on the arms of his throne, the unbreakable material creaking in distress. 

""And that is *unacceptable.*""

""Anyone who threatens to abandon this balance... Will be Obliterated. By both sides. Burnt out root and stem. Because it is not yet time... 

""And because it is comfortable.""

The Dark Lord leaned back fully onto his throne. ""Go.""

-----

Somebody once said, that a hero will sacrifice someone they love to save the world, while a villain will sacrifice the world to save someone they love.

I know the Stargirls are supposed to be ""heroes"", and Rebound is supposed to be a villain... but their battle has already killed over a hundred people at this farmer's market, and Rebound didn't even start it. Hell, as many times as I've seen her on the news, I was amazed to discover that the woman I'd been trying to flirt with all day is one of the World Peace Society's top ten most wanted.

I didn't recognize her... but apparently Star Violet did. Never even gave a warning - the bitch just opened fire.

Well, I guess technically she gave a warning - she went Nova before she took her shot. Apparently, she wanted to take out Rebound as fast as possible, and the Nova transformations the Stargirls use give them a single... supershot, I guess you'd call it, before they revert to normal, and it takes them a short while to recover before they can go Nova again.

As far as I could tell, Rebound saw Star Violet transforming, and had just enough time to set up a counter. Like her name suggests, Rebound can return nearly any attack to the source. Unfortuneately, her power doesn't grant infallible aim - and the fact that she knocked me out of the way of the attack probably didn't help her either. Star Violet dodged the rebounded attack, and twenty innocent people became memories.

I have to give credit where it's due, Rebound tried her best to flee the area, but having to cool down from going Nova didn't prevent Star Violet from being able to fire her normal plasma blasts. And her aim isn't impeccable, either. At least a dozen more people died, and I don't know how many more injured, before the rest of the Stargirls arrived. Star Crimson attacked from the air - at least when she dodged the rebounded shot, nobody was behind her to get hit. Too bad the same couldn't be said for Star Aquamarine's ice blast, or Star Sunflower's photonic shotgun.

Then Star Shadow arrived... and focused her Nova into a melee attack. Rebound managed to keep her power active - as a projectile, the carnage she inflicted upon those who hadn't yet escaped was... was...

Back to now...

Over a hundred dead, who knows how many more injured, and Rebound is having trouble getting to her feet. And by some stroke of luck, I was close enough to Star Sunflower to hear her suggest a coordinated strike, to overwhelm Rebound's power.

The Stargirls grouped together, and began their transformations to Nova form.

I charged toward them, drawing the knife I was planning on using on Rebound, before I discovered who she was. I got to Star Aquamarine first, and thrust through where her heart would be, if she hadn't been mid-transformation.

I wasn't expecting the implosion. I really wasn't expecting to absorb all five Stargirls. And I sure as fucking hell didn't expect to SURVIVE!

The resulting explosion killed everyone else at the farmer's market. Everyone else... except Rebound. The explosion may not have been enough to kill her, but it did knock her unconcious.

And I realized, I had the opportunity to take her as my next plaything, as I had originally planned...

1ll1mi8,mzyk5fg,"I stare at the minion in terror.  ""I'm sorry, but did you not watch those minion training videos when you got the job?""  Zebo clone 17 shook his head.  ""Great, now I'm going to have to have your entire genetic line watch it and update your mental file, including the backups.""

I sigh. ""First, a good bit of our funding comes from weird websites in Japan.  Not sure why, but they love getting videos of the transformation. Probably because all of the teenage girl's clothing disappears temporarily.  So if we do that, we lose funding.

Second, the Supervillain amendment to the Geneva convention bans attacking secret identities and attacking during transformations.  Even if I have invaded Denmark multiple times and want to rule the world, I have done my best to not get compared to a certain German dictator, and violating the Convention is the fastest way for people to do that.

Third, it's boring fighting people without power.  Until the transformation is over, they can't use more than a few drops of mana, so they are little better than civilians.  Even run of the mill soldiers put up a better fight, and you know.how easily you beat those guys.

And fourth. And most importantly, we came here to harvest mana, right?  We need it for all of our projects, right?  Well, their cores are basically self recharging mana batteries, but the huge amount of mana usage needed to conjure clothing and magical items destabilized them.  If they are damaged more than slightly, which the feedback from a mid-transformation attack might do, they will lose containment on the mana.  That both means that we can't harvest it and the rapid release will basically become a magical explosion comprable to a mundane nuclear bomb. 

So if we want to have good PR for when we conquer the planet have fun in battle, be able to pay the bills, get valuable resources, and survive to keep doing all of that, we have to let her finish.  Now grab your sword.  Her levitation is ending.""

1ll1mi8,mzxdi0x,"""Arrrr, that be a good question..."" The evil pirate wizard, Captain One Eye Firelash, set down his flagon of grog, ""And it's Captain, ya bilgerat.""

""Sorry, Capt'n,"" the deck hand replied, quailing from the baleful stare of that one single eye.

""Aye.  But a good question that be,"" Firelash sat back in his chair, stroking his ever smoldering beard.  ""Have you lads ever heard the tale of how I became Captain One Eye Firelash?""

""Nah, Capt'n!"" The younger deckhand quickly scooted closer, eager to hear the tale of his Captain's deeds. Pirates and Wizards at other tables overheard the discussion and quieted down to listen.  Soon a hush fell over the once raucous tavern, the only sound was the wind rising up from the large tower below.

Firelash glanced around at his crew before snorting with mirth. ""Fine, fine, ye lubbers!"" He stood up on his chair, peg leg on the table, ""It's about time you lot heard this tale. Tell me, have you heard of the Magical Girl Calypso?"" A smattering of ayes and nays quietly answered.

""And have you lot ever accidentally stumbled onto a woman while changing? Or bathing?"" A few men visibly shuddered at their memories, the bliss followed by abject terror.

Firelash nodded, ""Aye, aye, you have.  Course you lot have, you ruffians and brigands!"" He raised his flagon of grog, the vile liquid splashing over the edges in a toast.  With a cheer, his men followed suit before indulging themselves in the alcohol. ""Now imagine that, but with the finest wench the Cosmos have ever produced! Aye, Magical Girl Calypso was a sight for sore eyes.  Course, couldn't let her know that whenever we fought."" He winked and chuckled, the sound like burnt embers mixing with gravel.

""Round dusk one day, I was pilfering the Jewel of a Thousand Faces from a Galleon dubbed 'Brinks'. Suddenly, I felt a powerful pull coming from a nearby alley, a magic so potent my fleas flung themselves away, my scurvy healing in a moment. I popped into that alley, ready to snatch another treasure! What did I find but Calypso, glowing like the sun! Taking the chance, I reached out and grabbed her.""

The fearsome captain paused, staring down into his drink, lips pursing and unpursing in thought.  Finally, he returned his eye to his crew, ""There be Calypso, naked as the day she was born. A bosom you could lose your breath in, hips like a hull.  Hell hath no fury as a woman scorned.  Hell itself would cower in fear if that woman was a Magical Girl. The fire and torment I was subject to in that alley..."" He reached up and regretfully touched his patch, ""She clawed my skull like it was nothing, finger in me eye, and threw me from the alley.""

The crew looked horrified as they listened.  At the mention of one of her fingers taking the Captain's eye one man dropped his grog in the back of the room.  ""So that's why we always just let them change, Capt'n?"" A burly man, arms swathed in tattoos, spoke up, his scarred face painted white in terror.

""Aye, that be it. They may not have their full powers, but what they've got they'll use for the kill.  Normally they just toss us around and let us leave.  Hadn't you all wondered how I was a Captain without a crew before snatching up you filth? Calypso didn't just stop with me eye.  The entire crew, gone, just like that.  By the time I woke up, there was naught but dead men and fury surrounding me."" Blinking by the emotion of losing his men, Firelash downed the rest of his drink before dropping the flagon to the table, ""So if you ever run into a Magical Girl, make sure to let them finish changing. Else an eye may be the least of your worries.""",17
1ll4zf9,mzx92um,"""Stop right there!"" Dante yells. 

Virgil turns around and looks at Dante. ""Or what? You'll pull out your Soul Sword? It still won't help you catch me."" 

Dante shakes his head and smiles. ""No, but I can do you one better."" He places his hand against his chest and says, ""Ashua,"" causing a bright light to appear. His hand slowly sinks deeper inside his chest until it connects with his soul. He yanks his hand out and now holds a black and white revolver, which he points at Virgil.

Virgil's eyes widen. ""What the fuck is that?""

""It's my Soul Gun."" 

""That's impossible. Every thirteen-year-old Azuan is granted one Soul Sword. I know that because that's how I got mine."" 

""Well, my Awakening Ceremony went a little differently than planned. If you surrender, I'll tell you the story. It's not like you have much of a choice anyway. Don't want to bring a knife to a gun fight and all."" 

 ""You're right. I have no idea how to compete with such a weapon."" Virgil drops to his knees.

Dante walks up to Virgil, holds his free hand up, and says, ""Roppen,"" causing a rope to appear in his hand. He leans down and uses it to tie Virgil up. 

""Now, the story?"" Virgil asks. 

Dante chuckles. ""I didn't think you'd actually want to hear it, but a deal's a deal."" He pushes the weapon back into his chest and sits on a bench beside Virgil. ""It was about ten years ago, now. The day of my thirteenth birthday. And boy, was I excited."" 

""Yeah, I remember my thirteenth birthday as well,"" Virgil says. ""Probably the happiest I've ever been."" 

""Exactly. I remember coming down the stairs in my dress clothes and walking to the village center for the Awakening Ceremony. I walked up on the stage, where Miss Miriam announced my name for everyone to hear."" 

""Then what?""",50
1ll4zf9,mzx93p8,"""Well, I tried to pull my Soul Sword out, of course. But no matter how deep I reached into my soul, I never felt the blade's touch. I tried and tried for about an hour, growing increasingly embarrassed with each failure. I was about ready to give up when time suddenly stood still for everyone but me. And standing before me was none other than Kroza.""

Virgil's eyes narrow. ""The God of Death?""

""Yes. He walked up to me, placed his hand against my chest, and said, 'Ashua,"" then promptly disappeared. After he vanished and time resumed, I mimicked what he had done and was able to pull out my Soul Gun.""

""Holy shit.""

""That's what everyone else thought, too. And according to the Elders, I am the chosen Vessel of Kroza.""

""What does that mean?""

""That's what I've spent the last ten years of my life trying to figure out. And I'm still no closer to my answer.""

Virgil purses his lips. ""Maybe we can help each other out here.""

Dante's eyes narrow. ""What do you mean?""

""Well, you need information that isn't easily obtainable, and I need to stay out of jail, so I figure we can trade. My freedom for information about Kroza.""

""That is tempting. But how do I know your information is any good?""

""You must not have done any research on me, huh?""

""Not really. I figured you were just an Azuan like me.""

""I am, but I didn't grow up in your village. I grew up in Krozan.""

Dante's eyes widen. ""You mean...?""

""Yes. Death's Village. The only place in the world that still worships the Old God Kroza.""

""But they don't let in outsiders.""

Virgil smiles. ""But they do let in friends.""

1ll96tb,mzy4gpu,"""Dude, what the fuck? I asked for Carpe Diem, not Carpe Demon,"" Michael says as he looks at his new ink in the mirror. ""What the hell does Carpe Demon even mean?""

""Shit, man. I'm sorr--.""

The world around Michael freezes and begins to swirl. He falls to his knees, eyes closed, trying not to vomit. After a few moments, the swirling feeling stops, and Michael opens his eyes, finding himself in the center of a rundown bar.

A blonde bartender looks down at him and shouts, ""We've got another new initiate.""

*Initiate?* Michael wonders.

A behemoth of a man steps in front of Michael, extends his hand down, and pulls him to his feet. ""Welcome to the Demon Hunter Corp, kid. Hopefully you last longer than the previous initiate."" His voice is deep and gruff.

Michael's stomach drops. ""I'm sorry, did you say demon hunter?

""Sure did. The DHC is the largest demon-hunting corporation there is. And you're in one of our hideouts,"" the man says, gesturing to the room around him. ""My name's Axel.""

""N-no. There must be some mistake. I'm just Michael from Vermont. Not some kind of demon hunter.""

Axel grabs Michael's arm. ""Well, this ink here says different.""

Michael's eyes narrow. ""What do you mean?""

""This mark is the sacred oath of the Demon Hunter Corp. Getting it tattooed on you conveys your willingness to fight and die for the cause.""

""Die?"" Michael shouts. ""Oh, this is just great."" He starts pacing back and forth. ""Get a tattoo, they said. Chicks dig them, they said. What could possibly go wrong?""

""You think you could have this breakdown later, kid? We've got a lot to cover in the initiation packet.""

An alarm suddenly blares through the bar.

""What does that mean?"" Michael asks, his voice filled with panic.

""Demons. And a lot of them.""

""Here?""

""Yep. So, suit up, kid. You're getting some hands-on training today.""

1ll96tb,mzy8xnb,"It didn't happen immediately. I was caught off guard. Was about to take a shower the next day when I went to pull the bandage off the tat and see how she was looking. It was my second tattoo ever. I had a little fox on my upper right chest from when I went hiking in the alps with my cousins and a fox came up and somehow let us feed and pet it before it disappeared. And carpe diem right above the waistline over my left hip. I had planned on it being the second of potentially many as I'd just gotten back from a jungle excursion the other day. Ayahuasca. I felt the ties loosen. Who I was didn't need to be who I am. And who I am didn't need to be some perfect future version of myself with all of the money and a perfect husband and family. It could be anything.

But as soon as I peeled off the bandage to take a look, the skin was discolored. I wanted to hop into the shower to gently try and clean it up, but something looked wrong, and I wasn't sure if getting it wet was the right call. It couldn't get infected this quickly could it?

Anyways, I hopped in, and the moment the water ran down my chest, the skin burned with the heat of a furnace. I screamed, and now I'm here. Naked no less. Or I was naked. I was thrown into the darkest forest I could imagine, and it was hot like a sauna. This is the first moment the skin finally cleared up enough to read.

*Carpe Demon*

In my mind I was still in the shower, it felt like I was on drugs from the pain of the water hitting the tat too. But I could see it even in the darkness. And then I awoke to the reality that I was naked in a steamy hot forest.

I heard a roar from behind me moments after I started wandering around and so I sprinted as fast as I could to run up a tree. And that's when the beast appeared. It had twelve eyes that slide around on the surface of its skin. It oozed death. I could feel the faint coming on. And realizing that I was dreaming, or ill, I took a deep breath, half expecting to wake up.

But what happened instead is that my tattoo started burning again. I felt a rise come over me, some fire and fury that felt like it had always been there. I roared back at the beast, which felt more intimidating than it probably was, but then I moved fast. I came up to the creature and saw that it looked to have no arms, no legs. Nothing to grapple with and subdue it. But I looked for a stick on the forest floor. My waistline lip up on fire again, and I felt the power in my arms. I summoned a blade out of nothing out of necessity and swung it at the fowl...demon. And after it melted into the forest floor, the blade disappeared.

I was safe again for the moment, and oddly powerful. But it still felt right. I then passed a fallen priestess but ten paces away. She held a book in her hand. As I looked into her eyes I saw that she wasn't dead yet. She had a darkness about her though, I pressed my ear to her mouth as she had been moving her lips.

*You came* she whispered. I looked back at her again, checked her pulse and it was gone.

""Wake up! Wake up dammit! Where am I? Where did I come?""

I saw in her book the word ""Summoning"". I then cried for a moment at the insanity of the situation, and I stripped her down and put on her clothing. She was disfigured only minutes later once I'd gotten fully suited up. Her body turned to nothing just like the demon had.

I had her dagger and her staff and even kept her book. And I wandered for the forest to seize the day, and perhaps the demon.",8
1ll96tb,mzz16nq,"It wasn't the worst tattoo I'd ever gotten - that honor went to a crooked skull across one shoulder blade. But it was the only one I'd ever gotten that was misspelled. Then again, I had been way more sober when they tattooed Gramps headstone just above my knee.

But getting ""Carpe Demon"" instead of ""Carpe Diem"" still felt kinda dumb. Okay, so it did go well with the succubus on my bicep, and I hadn't looked at it until the next day, when the molly wore off. So by that standard, I guess it was my fault.

It started small. Seeing someone with weird colored eyes or hair was kinda par for the course, even in Vegas. Maybe especially in Vegas. A biker with dirty, unkempt angel wings? A little weirder, but still.

I didn't even see the demon at first. I was just taking the trash down to the dumpsters of my apartment complex. Mrs. Fernandez was there, pressed up against the filthy wall with some dude towering over him.

Now I should explain something. I'm not exactly a big girl. I'm only 5'5"", maybe 120 pounds. What i am, though, is mostly muscle. I hit the gym everyday, rock climb every other weekend, and one of my two part time jobs is moving furniture. I just look like a lightweight.

So when I swung the bag of trash at his head, the dude wasn't expecting it. Sadly for him, this particular double bag was fifty percent beer bottles by volume. It hit him with a crash, bouncing him off the dumpster and onto the pavement. ""Scram, miss F,"" I said, ""and call the cops while you're at it.""

She ducked past me, shoving her rosary into my hand, and shuffling off as fast as a sixty years old lady who just had hip surgery could go. I wrapped the beads around my knuckles and tucked the cross in between my fingers. Not as good as my car keys, or so I thought.

When he stood up, I got a better look at him. Skin the color of a second degree sunburn, a little crown of horns growing at his hairline. ""You smell a lot better than the old lady,"" he said in a raspy voice that reminded me way too much of one of my creepy coworkers. ""Steeped in sin.""

My disgusted face went up a notch as he licked his fingers and used them to smooth back his hair. It almost distracted me from his sudden lunge.

Oh yeah, my second job? Bouncer at Little Ladies strip club. It has a lot in common with moving furniture, actually. A lot of effort to take out something that definitely isn't worth all that much.

Demon boy moved forward so fast my foot almost missed his groin. Almost. The sudden pain, and my body leaning back into the side kick, gave me the perfect momentum to punch him right in the kidney. You always go for the soft spots, dad taught me. Makes it harder for them to fight back. Advice that had served me well to keep many a rowdy bachelor party in line.

Unlike the demon, though, Steve from Missouri didn't burst into flames from me hitting him. Not even normal flames, either. They shot out from the hole the cross made in his kidney like liquid gold - real gold, not Velveeta. He didn't scream, only because I'd knocked all the air out of him, but he was sucking in a breath that probably wouldn't lead to anything good.

I glanced around frantically, and picked up a broken chair, one of those little rolling ones for toddlers who aren't quite old enough to walk. Swinging from the hips, I grabbed it with one hand and hit him in the head with all my might.

As I swung, green light the color of fresh grass burst from my tattoo. When the toddler chair hit Demon creep, it didn't decapitate him so much as disintegrate him.

""Aye Dios Mio,"" I heard from behind me.

""Miss F, I thought i told you to run!"" I said, looking back and forth from her and the rapidly burning headless body.

Wordlessly, she held out her hand, and i unwrapped the rosary to give it back to her. ""No, you bad girl,"" she said crossly. ""I got five more of those from Goodwill."" Then she pointed at the tattoo. Which was still faintly glowing green.

And, suddenly, had a single raindrop just above the 'C', as if it was falling from the foot of the succubus above it.",5
1llhrik,n004sv5,"Well, the servants are having a blast of this supposed ""drama"".  
They await the explosion to come.  
Why?  
Because right now, I am having tea with my husband's mistress.  
Yep.  
I am happily married to a noble from the Royal City, and we have had a nice life until now.  
This is his first mistress, and I met her already a few times, problem is...  
I have fallen in love with her.

  
""So then I told her, ""Lady Motrik, my apologies, but we don't have enough material in the workshop, to resew  your dress on the spot."" she smiles.  
I laugh.  
""Oh my! I knew Lady Motrik tends to order dresses a size or two smaller, but this!"" I say.  
She nods, her red hair dancing.  
She is gorgeous, and funny, and understanding.  
""A few sizes smaller. She likes clothing that hugs her body, so I had her go to a magic weaving shop."" she says.  
This is what I love about her.  
She never mocks people that go to her, she genuinely loves to help them.

  
The tea, turns into lunch, and the lunch turns into dinner.  
It's not the first time, but it is the first time we discussed about everything in depth.  
And it is the first time I talked openly about my husband.  
""Loving, caring...we are happy. He is a good man, albeit...he has a mistress."" I say, as we are having late night snacks in my bed.  
""Oh my! He thinks you are not enough? The Lord you married, must be blind!"" she says, touching my arm.  
I shiver.  
Staring at her, maybe it is the wine, or not...but I think I saw her blush.  
I kiss her.  
""Oh my I am..."" I start to apologize, but she kisses me back.  
We start feeling a bit warm, and the night descends into a dance of unsaid words, full of passion.

  
""What is this?!"" a voice wakes me up.  
I open my eyes, to see Alicia still sleeping next to me...and my husband standing at the foot of the bed.  
""Morning?"" I mutter to him.  
He stares at both of us, clearly conflicted, but in the end he sighs.  
""Is it a play? She doesn't deserve this. Nor do I."" he says.  
I pale, and shake my head.  
""No, no...unfortunately not the nobles usual play...I...I love her."" I say.  
He stares at me, and nods.  
""When she wakes, we will discuss it together. If we do it well, we might keep our family together, and also be personally happy...the both of us."" he says, leaving.  
I almost start crying.  
I knew it for a while, but know it is certain.  
While we are happily married, it doesn't mean we are truly happy with each other...",7

1llatnm,n00bb2k,"The boards painfully dug into my shoulder as I lay squeezed between rafters, listening to the commander of the soldiers below. He was getting heated by my parent's resistance.

""Your child has been Chosen, you are no longer related. There is nothing you can do to raise them any more."" I don't like the anger in his voice, the demand. I knew it was a mistake to go see the magi as they rode at the head of the column. It's not like I could just tell my friends I couldn't go with them because the magi might see me. I hoped they didn't notice.

They had.

The entire column was halted, orders, shouting. I fled and hid. I was good at hiding. 

But it only took them 2 hours to figure out my house, and I was already home. I was wishing I had gone for the woods or the river. I felt trapped here.

""It is an honor you need to show gratitude for!"" His raised voice made my heart thud, I squeezed my eyes shut. It wasnt an honor. No one wanted to be Found. Sure, you never had material concerns for the rest of your life. You were no longer bound by most of the laws of the Empire. But... everyone ran.

""Produce him, or we will tear apart your house piece by piece.""

I didn't think Calling would be useful. He stayed silent, but one of the magi was down there too. Probably the rest outside. They would know I'm here if I Called. But they know I'm here anyway. What choice do I have?

""Take them outside and guard them. We will do this the hard way."" 

I listened to my mother crying softly, my father's complaints about the rough handling. But it grew quiet 

""Come out boy, we know you are here. Don't make us destroy their home. It's time to come to us."" My breathing slowed. I had no choice. I relaxed. And Called.

""He is here!"" ""You sense it?"" ""Strong."" ""What Aspect?"" ""I don't know. Feels unfamiliar.""

It was ancient. School taught the Thirteen Aspects across a few classes. Most of us were destined to live aligned with one of them, even if we had no power. The structure of the Empire was based on it after all. How could I tell anyone that the lines of power were not just a diagram on a page. That I could feel them radiating, humming. That I had always known exactly which book it was, like a magnet. All that was bad enough. Finally going through the lessons about the Aspects was worse. I watched and listened in hunger and fear. 

It was worse when I realized that I aligned with none of them.

I could feel them coming now. Eager. It had been a long time since I dared Call even a small one. This Calling was pulled from me. I was but an instrument.

It was in a dusty history book on a forgotten shelf corner, propping up other books. Only two lines. 

""The last evidence of the Dreyjen Callers is believed to have been purged by the 6th Dynat, with the only obscure reference to them coming from a child's song that persisted verbally from sometime before the 3rd Dynat."" Over eighteen hundred years ago, with many empires rising and falling.

The spelling had shifted with translation and age. They were a myth of stories. Playthings of imagination. Everyone knew that. But they were real. And they were coming for me. Eager. Joyous. Their voices sang in my head.

Outside, the shouts and screams started. They were here for me. They were here to announce the One Who Leads.

It filled me with terror. I knew what they wanted. I was going to be the herald of the Fall of the Empire.",8
1lkmhnc,mztko0k,"Princess Winona of Tulen had been, as far as she knew, busy her whole life. It never stopped. From the time her memories began it was endless tutors - writing and reading and summing and memorizing and dancing. Followed by endless duties - reviewing edicts and holding court and attending dinners and balls and summits. 

That would probably have been fine if it weren’t for everyone else. 

The problem with having fabulous wealth and unrivaled power is that the people who surrounded you unerringly wanted a share of one or the other. Usually the first but a few particularly nasty folks pursued the second.

Which meant that Princess Winona, Winny as she preferred to be called though she doubted a single person in the palace bothered to know that, was surrounded by horrible fakes. 

It was exhausting, and so was everything else in her life. She’d tried vacations, but had no one to enjoy them with. Her options were brown nosers or paid servants, with the added guarantee that at least one of the bunch would be looking to betray her confidence of end her life at any given time.

No thanks.

She’d tried various potions and exercise routines and hobbies.

None of it made a dent in the flaming misery that was her life. 

And now that she’d turned 18, things had taken a turn for the worse. Old men, young men, any one of the male persuasion saw her as a side of beef sold off to the highest bidder, guaranteed to make them fat and happy. She couldn’t convince the guards (or her parents) to stop letting them in, meaning whatever free time she might have once had was consumed by greedy, smelly, condescending suitors. 

So when the Witch of the Wood cursed her (Winny assumed it was power-related), all she could feel was relief. 

“Alright, I’m down.”

“What?” The witch shrieked, a puzzled look twisting her already hideous features.

“Actually, can we speed that up to like, a week for now? I don’t need six years to get my affairs in order.”

The witch’s jaw dropped. “I, uh, this wasn’t the response…”

“Yeah, yeah, you want power or money and you hoped I would beg or you could extort my parents or something.”

“Maybe,” the witch muttered petulantly. It turns out there is certain power to inspiring terror, and she was more than a little bitter about an under-awed princess. 

“I’ll pay you. I’ll pay you to turn me into that hideous dragon and forget the cure. The sooner you work it, the more money I’ll pay.”

At this point, the witch’s eyes were gleaming, small, beady, greedy. “How much?”

Winny named a sum that to her was a drop in a well, but to most was fabulous wealth. 

The witch’s eyes seemed to glow with excitement. 

Winny just felt relief. 

Freedom. 

Her first act as a giant, scaley, fiery lizard was to roast the prince of Drae. He had been particularly condescending, and the world decidedly needed less people with habits like his cheating, groping, war-mongering ways. 

She’d done the world…and herself…a huge favor. 

So as she flew off to the mountains to find a new home in the caves, she felt the happiest she had in a long time. 

Princess Winny, hideous dragon of Tulen, lived happily alone and peaceful forever after. 

The end.",219
1lkmhnc,mztu6z9,"The entity stood in stunned silence. I could tell that any scenario it has in mind had completely gone out the door. Then it finally responded.

""WHY ARE YOU MORTALS LIKE THIS IN THIS ERA!?!?""

Now I was a bit taken back.

""Pardon..?""

The being began pacing, or whatever its facsimile of that, while it ranted.

""Since being released in this, ""Modern"" era I have attempted to inflict the beings of this world with my specialized curse."" It immediately got in my face, ""And you Welcome it.""

I could tell that the being had trouble processing what was going on. So I decided to give my two cents.

""Pal, can I call you pal anyway, I'm gonna be straight with ya."" I proceeded to put an arm over its shoulders and began walking, ""I'm sure back in your hay day turning people into monsters was a horrifying thing.""

""People feared dragons, hunted them and not only that, but being shunned from society was seen as a death sentence for most people back then."" We stopped at the edge of the cliff that looked out over the city, one of the largest in the world, ""But, have you actually paid attention to how the world has changed?""

The being, I think, looked thoughtful for a moment going over some info in its head before giving a subtle, ""shake?"" of the head.

""I didn't think so."" I walked a bit away from him, and continued, ""But today dragons are just cool.""

I turned around, smile on my face, and continued.

""Dragons are awesome, they used to embody everything bad about society back then."" I gestured as I spoke, ""They used to be all about greed, wrath, and always kidnapping maidens etc.""

""Now they are basically the embodiment of independence.""

The entity looked dumbfounded at that.

""They can usually fly(a major dream of many), they are individually powerful(so they can take care of themselves), and they just look cool.""

I then sat on a bench, patting the seat next to me, and the entity sheepishly sat.

""Then the whole shunned from society...you heard of camping?"" I asked, but didn't wait for a response, ""It is when people actively spend time in the wilderness just to get away from society.""

The entity looked curious.

""Maybe you had something like that back then, but honestly people are kinda getting sick of civilization and all the burdens it comes with when being done on a massive scale""

The entity got up before speaking.

""So, you would rather be a giant, hideous monster then deal with being human.?"" 

I looked at the being before giving my final answer.

""Pal, since waking up, have you heard the phrase, Return to Monkey?""",97
1lkmhnc,mzthtkm,"The grin fades from the entities face.  
""Excuse me?"" it asks.  
""No worries, good Thing.  
Hit me up with that curse now, and not in 6 years."" I say.  
""Do you not understand, you human?  
You will become a hideous dragon, not a crystal, not a golden dragon, but an abomination even by beast standards!  
Shunned, hunted, and hated by society, an unlovable..."" it starts.  
""Hey dude, I am already sold, you don't have to try to impress me."" I laugh, interrupting him.  
He frowns.

  
""I knew you were a wrong one, but this..."" they mutter.  
I shrug.  
""Mr. Entity, I was found in front of the orphanage as a kid, few weeks old, so the unlovable part started reeeaally early on for me.  
As for hideous beast and shunned, and hunted?  
Didn't you choose me, because I am a Monk that follows the path of Animals?  
I already behave more like a wild thing, than a human, or elf or whatever, so my place in society was always that of an outcast, living in the woods.  
So what is the ""unless you do this"" part of this deal?"" I ask.  
The entity is upset, but it controls well its emotions.

  
""Okay, you mortals were always weird...  
So, you have to change and save a certain noble family's last remnants, otherwise you will transform."" it says.  
I nod.  
""Okay, so you are a deity that is linked to that family, or foresaw something that requires that bloodline, and now you found someone without a backing, or any deity watching over them, to do your dirty thing."" I start.  
The entity flickers in and out of reality, as storm clouds gather, as its rage boils.  
""Sure, just change the conditions to that of me gaining the ability to transform into a dragon as a reward, not as a punishment, and I am in."" I continue.  
The entity freezes.

  
""You will...do it?"" it asks.  
I nod.  
""Saving people is something I like."" I say.  
""Fine. You save them, and you get your desired ability."" it says, as a load of information appears in my mind, and the entity disappears.  
A week later, I am in the slums of a city, staring at 3 women, one older, and two young ones, that I find for some reason...familiar.  
""Lord Gheritok sent you?"" they ask.  
So that's its name...but I nod.  
They didn't trust me fully, but when I got them out of the city, and got them easily half-way through the kingdom, they started to trust me, and more.  
But it was still weird, as for some reason, the older woman seemed conflicted when looking at me, and I also had this pain in my chest when I looked at her taking care of the younger ones.  
Nevertheless, for my dragon transformation I kept my wits, and was ready to do anything to ensure their survival.",85

The witches, or whatever they were, were standing mouths open but silent.  They turned to look at each other, and one shrugged its shoulders and the other shrugged back.  They both looked back at me, ""Err...umm..."" said the one looking down in their hands as if for notes.  Then the other said, ""Don't you want to hear what you can do to avoid the curse?"" 

""No, not really.""

""But it's really not as bad as you might think, and the curse is......help me out here.""  The smaller one said to the other.  ""Yes, of course, the curse is...is..hideous."" They looked at each other again, ""Yes! Hideous! Thank you!""  It looked back at me and asked, ""You don't want to be a hideous monster, do you?""

""Don't care!  So, same time next week?"" I twirled my finger to indicate the same place, and then I turned to leave.  

""Hold on, please, just one more minute of your time?""  Said the smaller one who had a finger up and who I was really beginning to not like.

""You have exactly one minute."" Then I said, ""Go!"" And I sat.

They looked at each other and nodded and then looked back at me, and the bigger one said, ""OK, so you got us.  We can't curse or un-curse you at our level.  We use the option language to get stuff, or money, or just for the fun of getting people to do our bidding, so to speak.  No one has ever, never, opted to accept the curse.""

""So this is some kind of curse scam?"" I was infuriated.

They both just stared at me, and the bigger one said, ""No, the curse is real, but there is no way to stop it or change it.  So, I guess that 'unless' part could be considered a scam.""  They were both nodding again.  I think I am going to kill them.",7

""Um. What does it look like, and what do I receive in return?"", I asked, wincing slightly at the inhuman tonality of it's voice.

""Oh! Always wondered what that was. Sure. Gimme a second"" I walked into my house and plucked up the odd green gemstone that I always considered a pretty piece of serpentine.

Returning to the outside of my home, I held forth the stone, and smiled. ""Here ya go!""

In response, the creature lifted a scale on its chest and withdrew a box, which upon touching the soil opened. Within sat a suit of cloth-fine chainmail of brilliant gold, a ivory white shield, blazoned with a eagle, a tabard sharing the same blazon, a gold and ivory helm showing the spread wings of a dragon and finally, a golden bladed sword with an ivory hilt. The weapons nearly pulsed with power

1lklxmt,mztp1tj,"I saw it through the Ring camera when my phone alerted me that someone rang the doorbell. I was at work and it was usually just a canvasser or maybe the pesticide guy letting me know he was there before doing the job.

So when I saw nothing but a field of red scales, I knew exactly who it was.

“Grampa Califraxiat! I wasn’t expecting your visit! Can you please shrink down a bit so I can see you better?”

A deep grumbling like rocks grinding together preceded a flicker as the camera failed to properly capture the slighting nauseating vision of a polymorph spell. In place of the wall of red was a refined looking older gentleman wearing what looked like a fitted lumberjack outfit. Hell, could pass for a Paul Bunyan stereotype or that Brawny guy if it wasn’t for the arrogant visage.

In a smooth, bass voice subtly underlined with menace, the man said, “Will you not grant me entry, child?”

“I’m at the office at the moment, but I’ll head back home right now. Should be there in about half an hour. Please excuse my poor hospitality for not being there in person to greet you, but I welcome you into my home and freely grant you leave to have something to eat and drink while you wait. There’s a pitcher of sweet tea in the fridge and there should be bananas on the kitchen counter. The access code for the door is the year of your hatching, in the modern numbering. See you in a bit!”

Grampa C grumbled again, this time without the deep harmonics, and the Ring camera turned off as he entered the code and entered the house. I was already logging off everything and shooting an email to my assistant that I was leaving early.

Califraxiatorithiolanar was the full, pronounceable-by-humans name of the ancient red dragon, but he let us use the shortened version since we were family. Not by blood or even marriage, no, but something like 7 or 8 generations ago my (evil, natch) multi-times-great-grandmother named him as the godfather of her firstborn child. Well, not *god*-father since he isn’t a god, but the draconic equivalent. It technically made Grampa C a mystical ancestor and the child became part of his family line. For all their flaws (not that they admit any), dragons are *very* serious about familial relations and responsibilities, and Grampa C always kept an eye on his human descendants.

I was one of his favorites of the hundred-ish of us currently alive, so I got to seem him fairly frequently. On a draconic timescale, that is, which translates to about every 5-6 years on a human timescale. He was always a good guest and adhered to the ancient rules of hospitality, which is why I’d granted him permission to have the bananas. He hadn’t tasted any tropical fruits until well into his adulthood and bananas and kiwis were his favorites.

In any case, between offering him his favorite fruit, the promise that I was returning as swiftly as I could, and his own adherence to hospitality and guest responsibilities, I knew that nothing disastrous should happen before I got home.

An expectation which proved true as I pulled down the estate driveway. I lived in a small mansion (by the family standards) and the only reason it wasn’t an even smaller house was because my older relatives bought any other house I showed an interest in out from under me. Something about keeping up appearances and maintaining an appropriate lifestyle. Still, it *was* luxurious enough that Grampa C wasn’t overly offended by it.

Upon entering the house, I walked to the study, where I knew he would be waiting. It was his favorite room, after all.

“Grampa!” I cried out in subdued happiness as I laid eyes on him. “Again, I apologize about the wait. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?”

He gestured for me to sit in the red-leather, overstuffed wingback chair opposite him and once I’d done so, spoke.

“It has come to my attention that you have yet to produce an heir. We must rectify that oversight. I have arranged a mating partnership for you.”

I blinked a few times. He was prone to just announcing things like that was how the world was going to be and woe betide any who disagreed.

I replied, “I am most grateful for your interest in my wellbeing, Grampa, but I’m gay. I have no interest in mating with females.”

He gave a slight nod. “I am aware. Those of my line should be above such trivialities, but I suppose excluding half of the mating population is fairly common these days. Not that we could *ever* be common.

“That makes no matter, though, as the mating partner I have selected is also a male. You shall conceive a child together and have a mortal female bear it for you both.”

“Oh, surrogacy. That’s something that many gay couples do if they want a blood-related child.”

If he still had a snout, he would’ve been looking down it at me. “Indeed. A pale comparison to what our line’s magic can do.”

“Your mate will be arriving tomorrow and you are to proceed with the conception immediately. Once you have succeeded, I will transfer the child.”

""Tea and cakes?"" Elvari asked his butler, who was shaking harder than the slime puddings and cupcakes on his platter. ""I know if I were a visitor to Innsmouth, I'd stop by for an afternoon tea with the charming local deity.""

""That is not the face of a visitor who wants some tea time,"" Robert added. ""That is the face of an evil dragon who is owed... something.""

Elvari picked up a cupcake to eat before strolling towards the door. ""I will go out and ask him. What's the worst that could happen?""

""He roasts you and has fried eldritch Calamari for an afternoon snack?""

""I will suffocate him from the inside and tear my way out of his throat if he thinks he can eat me,"" the eldritch entity remained unfazed. ""Have faith in your god.""

And with that, he went out and waved at the dragon.

""Finally,"" the massive reptile rumbled. ""I get to speak to the manager. Your minions keep telling me to send my feedback to this online portal. Do I look like I can squeeze through some tiny portal? Well, I'm demanding a refund and a return to form. Undo my wish to become a dragon.""

""Do you have a tracking number?"" Elvari scrolled through his mobile phone to check past records. ""I have granted too many wishes to remember.""

""If I didn’t crush my phone or laptop by accident, I would tell you,"" the dragon scowled.

""Okay, do you have any form of identification?"" The octopoid deity extended a tentacle. ""It would be good to have a name and a past photo of you before you became a dragon. Can't restore you if I don’t know what you used to look like.""

The dragon slammed a foot down, cracking the earth, and possibly causing structural damage to Elvari's house. ""You don't have an Undo spell?""

""Magic doesn’t work like Microsoft documents. There are no undo or redo buttons.""

""Ah shit.""

""I sure hope you recall something, anything about your past self.""

There was a long, pregnant pause before the dragon uttered a single ""no"".

""Instead of trying to be a past self that you so loathed that you wanted to become a dragon, why not pick a new form?"" Elvari was searching for his transformation catalogue to show to the dragon. ""How about a Deep One? A Shoggoth?""

""Will I be stuck working for you?""

""You don't have to..."" the tentacled god whistled. ""So, what will it be? Manticore, sphinx, or siren?""

""Manticore.""

Elvari nodded while preparing his spell. ""That will be 5000 gold coins.""

""What? Wasn't it $5000 the last time to become a dragon?""

""Do you have the cash, credit card or a Paypal account?""

The dragon roared, ""Do I look like I can carry a wallet or a mobile phone for monetary exchanges?""

""No? Well, I still require payment."" Elvari frowned. ""Are you not a dragon now? Surely, you have a hoard of gold in a cave?""

1lklxmt,mzt86dt,"As the dragon stared down at me I resigned myself.  I had tried to do this the proper way. I had tried to use reason and pleading to stop the dragon. But dragons rarely chose to listen to the creatures they saw as ""lesser"". 

This creature was dangerous to those who didn't have a history with it. And I had taken something from it, something of incalculable value from it. There was a chance I would be roasted like a chicken. It could step or me and crush me like a bug.  It's teeth were like blades that could rip me to shreds.  The long claws would slice open my belly before I had the opportunity to speak.  But my wife was inside the house.  Our newborn child was inside the house, and I would not let this dragon trespass.  So I stepped outside to speak with my mother-in-law.",65
1lklxmt,mztg3vw,"I've always been fascinated by dragons in mythology and fictional works. Such beautiful and majestic creatures, and oddly enough almost familiar... 


I was not prepared for a full sized red dragon to park itself right outside my house, staring at me, as if it was waiting for something. After hiding for hours in fear that it might roast me alive, I decided to confront her.


""Erm... Lady Dragon? Is there something you want from me?"" I asked sheepily. 


She started grumbling underbreath, something about ""raised"" and ""cowardice"". ""Well isn't that obvious?"" She lowered her head to meet me and lightly tapped my chest with a single claw. ""You."" 


Before I could clarify what she meant, my parents arrived home and seemed similarly shocked as I did to see the dragon. 


""Please, Lady Dragon,"" my Mom pleaded. ""Join us for our son's coming of age party."" 


""Oh... very well,"" responded the dragon as it shrunk itself down to human height. ""I shall partake in the festivities. THEN we will see about finalizing that contract regarding my progency.""",30

At least 50 metres in length, iridescent red, shimmering in royal red that only dragon scales are capable of.
 
It swept at it looked at, turning it's serpentine head and passing judgement on all the lesser beings that it glanced upon.
 
Occasionally it's teeth will clash together creating sparks as a tease to what it's fiery breath can do if it was not appeased. Immediately.
 
Shrugging, I put on my coat and proceed to head out to confront it.
 
My family begged me not to. They remembered what happened the last time. Our lands still bore the scars of the last dragon that was blue. A dragon that was half its size.
 
Fastening my coat, I reassured that it needs to be done. 
 
This is and will always be my duty.
 
Marching forward, I placed myself in front of a dragon.
 
Was I afraid? Of course. It's 50 metres long. With a flick of it's tail, a stomp of it's foot, I am reduced to paste. 
 
It could burn me on the spot with it's breath that all is left cannot fit into a teaspoon.
 
It could swallow me in a gulp.
 
But it needs to be done. It is my calling. 
 
And I WILL do it.

When I get to the nose of the dragon I poke it and lay into them for being late and not being about to hold agro for three seconds like any other tank can.  It lets me huff and puff then slowly pulls out a box of cookies from a pack around it's neck.

In a voice that sounds a bit like lighting hitting the ground, ""Sorry old lady but here I thought you needed these.  Fresh from my horde. It sounds like you had a rough week.""

Blinking I take the cookies and all the fire and mad is gone then I just hug it's snout, ""Damn old fool.  Just hold your agro next time.""

1lklxmt,mzwui62,"It's been a month since Sasha has been able to dream. She had closed her eyes that first night, and opened them a minute later to sunlight streaming in her bedroom. A little surprised but not reading much into it, she had written it off and climbed out of bed.

But the dreams never came back. Night after night, sleep happening as a singular blink. The clocks in her room changed, and the sun rose; no one in her family reported any change in their sleep. The lack of dreams left her raw in unexpected ways. She began to fall behind in school as her memory lagged. She had become quite irritable and easily spooked. Her shoulders and neck ached; she rolled over in bed to halfheartedly massage them but could find no release. So much stored up emotion, with no processing and nowhere to go.

Just one month, and already such ruin on her life. Tonight, she lies awake, staring at the ceiling. She is not ready to go to tomorrow, and she knows what she closes her eyes, it will become so. Beams of moonlight slither in between her window blinds; they get to her static disco ball before scattering, randomly launching dots around the room. It must be a full moon for it to be this bright.

Sasha rises, out of curiosity, boredom, and desperation. Anything is better than another dreamless night. She walks around her room, absentmindedly catching moonbeams and putting them in her pajama short pockets.

She arrives at the window and tugs the blinds open. Slowly, so she could watch the moonlight pour in more and more. Soon, orange-tinted streetlamp light joins in, and she turns to look out the window properly. She freezes in place, blood suddenly running cold.

Across the street, sits an elder red dragon, the most evil and menacing of the dragonkin. It is staring, fixedly and unblinkingly, directly at her family's home. She watches it for a second, hand over mouth, horror-struck. Suddenly, her stomach drops to her feet. The dragon's eyes snap to her window, to her, through her eyes, straight into the back corners her mind. She shakes her head and breaks eye contact. When did she start crying? She hadn't even noticed, but she blinks back tears as she drops her gaze to the street. Another wave of shock ripples through her body. There, trapped under the dragon's front paw, were all of Sasha's missing dreams.",9
1lklxmt,mzxpmfs,"""Hey Geoff! What are you doing? The kids are freaking out right now, well, the little ones are anyways""

I always talked out loud so people would know I was talking to him instead of just using the mental bond. It tended to help calm people down. My 11 year old son thought it was the coolest thing ever. My twin girls, 7, were upset Geoff wasn't a unicorn, and my 2 year old son was holding on tight to my wife. 

'It's time Reg. Donovan said he was through with me, Francine never wants to do anything anymore, and Edward has arthritis now and can't fly anymore. We have things to do, and it's your turn.'

""Ok. It was only a matter of time before you came for me. Give me a day or so and I'll be ready.""

'One day, no more. We have things to do and people to kill.'

""Don't get your fire so hot. I've got to setup some stuff on autopay while I'm gone.""

'Just hurry.'

  
Jessica was not thrilled. 

""Reg....Do you have to? I always knew this was an eventuality in my head, but it's real now. I'm not sure how to handle things on my own.""

""Jess, babe, it's gonna be fine. Geoff hasn't lost a rider in my family since Mount Vesuvius blew in 79AD. And that wasn't truly his fault. They were on the way to Sicily when it blew, and a stray rock hit Gnaeus in the face. Geoff said he died quickly, but it had to have been a horrible way to go.""

""Shut up.....,"" Jessica said tearfully, ""I don't care about that. I'm still scared for you.""

""I'll be fine. The bills are setup on autopay, you just need to buy food and other necessities.""

""Just be careful. I want you to see your grandchildren.""

""I'll be fine. I'll text you when we land, though I don't know where Geoff is taking me yet.""",5
1lklxmt,mzz8zdu,"""Master, someone is at the door.""

I scowled and paused the magiscriber, stepping away from the enchantment I was working on. This was the third interruption this week, and I did *not* appreciate it.

Scowling, I stomped down the stairs of my tower, not even bothering to activate the levitation enchantment. By the time I reached the bottom I had already worked quite a foul mood up, which only got worse when I looked at the magical view mirror to see who it was.

Of course, it had to be the single worst, most concentrated evil being I had ever known in my 327 years as an Archmage.

Caryn. The somehow elected head of the TOA (Tower Owners Association). I wasn't even sure whose idea it was to form one, some seven years back, but I'd already spent more time than I ever expected having to hire dryads to fix my landscaping, cast mending and color changing spells on the outside of my tower - even put up a combined invisibility-avoidance enchantment on my storage shed out back instead of getting rid of it.

Fixing an obviously false smile on my face, I opened the door and looked down at the gnomish woman who had become the bane of my existence. ""I'm in the middle of work, can we make this quick?"" I said.

Her eyes twitched. ""Kobalt, do you or do you not know the TOA rules on keeping exotic pets on your property?""

""Of course I do,"" I lied, using the hand hidden behind the door to cast a quick cantrip to keep the Saotomian Slime down in the basement that I absolutely did not have. ""Why do you ask?""

She stepped to the side and gestured angrily. ""Then why is your dragon *loose*?"" she demanded.

Raising my eyebrows, I stared at the dragon currently clawing trenches through the petunias. It stared back at me, green eyes narrowed to slits against the summer sunlight.

I looked back down at Caryn, an idea starting to percolate. ""That's not mine. I don't own a dragon. I can only assume it's escaped from someone else, or is perhaps feral.""  An almost genuine smile spread across my face. ""If the TOA is amenable, I could see about relocating it?""

Her scowl grew. ""Horrid beasts like that have no place in our neighborhood! This is supposed to be an area of *tranquility* and *order* where mages can live in *peace*, and -""

I cut her off by the expedient of pressing a contract orb against her wildly gesticulating hand, then stepped outside and closed the door, blocking her from getting a better look inside my house. (I just couldn't handle another fine over my interior decorating - or rather, the lack thereof. The complete lack of throw pillows, succulents, or non-tie-dye carpets was, to Caryn, a crime worthy of damnation to the worst afterlife and five hundred gold pieces.)

The dragon watched me closely, tracing designs in the dirt and torn up flowers, as I approached. I kept more of my attention on Caryn than the dragon, until we were close enough to talk. ""If you don't mind, I'm going to put up a little quieting spell?"" I asked rhetorically, having already done so. ""Now, I don't mean to be rude, but this is my flower bed you're destroying. Why have you been staring at my tower since I opened the door?""

He shifted, pulling his tail in closer. ""I've heard you're a powerful enchanter, Archmage Kobalt. I am in need of something particular for my lair.""

I sighed, summoning my scheduling book. ""I do have to complete a piece for the Emperor of the West Wind, then a minor job for the Raven Queen, but then I can fit you in.""

The dragon dipped his head, quieting his thunderous voice even further. ""And I need it done cheaply.""

It took a great deal of willpower to not look at Caryn. ""Well, I have an idea of something that would be worth a discount. How do you like the taste of gnomes?""",5

Sol 75,312.

Study by Ixter Mell from system Aghrell

This report details the discovery of a religious text within the ruins of an ancient civilization on their apparent homeworld, which they called ""Mars."" As many scholars have noted, much about this civilization remains unknown. The greatest mystery surrounds their disappearance some five millennia ago, as the vast majority of their records, both digital and physical, vanished at the same time. One day, across the entire galaxy, all traces of their history were gone.

The few survivors had no recollection of their own culture, leaving only the oral traditions of other species in this sector. These accounts have been extensively studied and found to be critically lacking in detail. The discovery of this world last year, however, presents a significant exception.

After securing financing from the Ministry, we launched this first expedition. Excavation of the only surface ruins revealed a temple with this text inscribed in stone. This mythological piece appears to offer a partial explanation for their sudden departure from the galaxy, our scholars are still debating its veracity, and our Gods have remained silent on the matter.

For the purpose of further investigation, the original text, written in the common galactic language, is attached to this report.

Chapter 1

¹ The gods spoke, and they guided their children in their glory through many great signs and powerful words. For a god can be many things, indeed all things, for a god is that which encompasses everything within its own creation: Time and matter, life and energy, spirit and soul.

² And after ages of existence, having created multitudes of universes throughout their infinite lives, it would sometimes happen that the gods would gather their will to find a form of inspiration, so as to create something new that had never existed before.

³ For this reason, by thought alone they brought into existence a shared cosmos, a field of creation in which each god could take part. The only rule that applied was that they would all begin not even with a single world, but only a small family of children. These children could then multiply until their own descendants were as numerous as the grains of sand on a shore.

⁴ And it is here that the gods found a peculiar thing: their children, whether created to be loving or spiteful, had a fundamental need for them.

⁵ Without their god they would usually perish; not in their spirit or their soul, for this shared cosmos drew its life from the infinite soul of all the gods within it. As long as just one god imagined himself there, this cosmos had life.

⁶ No, the children would perish from a lack of basic needs. They would fail to secure their own sustenance, or perish by letting decay inhabit their bodies for lack of cleansing. The gods found this only natural, for their presence is everything, and without everything, their children would have nothing.",12
1ll4i4s,mzxcdig,"Chapter 2

¹ And yet one of those many gods decided to do something different, something new within the boundaries of this cosmos. Instead of following the paths of the others, his will desired something else, something so difficult to do that most gods simply did not try. And that was to create a true child of his own, a true god.

² This was so difficult because a god is infinite and therefore cannot divide himself; for infinity divided by half is still infinity. So, in order to create such a child and bring forth another god, he would need to do something extreme. He would need to leave his child alone to develop in the midst of all their imaginations; bathed in their infinite souls, yet with a mind of its own, so that this new infinite being could become a different infinity from himself.

³ So he created a small group of people on a faraway world in an ordinary galaxy. He spoke to them and did great things for them to convince them of his existence, to let them share in his glory and so make them part of him. 

⁴ And they grew and disobeyed him, for he could not impose his presence too harshly on them, or their minds would become entirely part of his. In their rebellion they fell from grace and became mortal. But their soul became new, unable to hear him, for some of them turned their faces to other gods, who saw his creation and decided to show him why his attempt was in vain.

⁵ Yet this new soul was promising. So through more great signs and prophecies he cared for his children until they learned his teachings. He even created a vessel, a small version of himself, to live with them and to teach them about many things.

⁶ And then he left. And his children began to perish. The other gods tried to intervene, but he did not allow it. He was the first to this world, so he claimed it, and his children were not to be directly approached. 

⁷ And so these children, whose souls were different, suddenly began to study the world that all the gods had created. They started to understand its laws and its many complexities. And through clever manipulations of these laws, they managed to survive and then to thrive, only to launch themselves out to the stars.",12
1ll4i4s,mzxce56,"Chapter 3

¹ Now when they came to the stars, they were greatly surprised to find children of other gods on many worlds. 

² On these worlds, wonders which the people called 'magic' were common, though they could not hear the voices of their gods. Beholding these wonders made the children of the silent god begin to doubt, and they asked among themselves, ""Why are we the only ones whose minds are silent?"" 

³ They grew resentful and began to pray as their ancestors had taught them to do.

⁴ And for the first and only time, their God answered, and his voice was heard in all their minds, saying:

""My beloved children, why do you despair? Are you amazed by the wondrous deeds of others? 

⁵ What do their seemingly mighty acts say to you? They travel the vastness not by their own strength, but in vessels that borrow the strength of others. 

⁶ Do not despair, for you are my children, and I have a plan for you. Those who trust in me and follow my way shall be blessed beyond belief.""

⁷ And so it was that some of the children still walked away, distracted by the wonders they saw. But some remained steadfast. 

⁸ And after much time had passed, and after much study of the cosmos, these children, now wise and old in years, understood what their father had done for them. They fell to the ground and sang his praises.

⁹ Then, seeing their wisdom and their knowledge of many things, their father for the first time lent them his true power and raised them all to his own stature. 

¹⁰ And the multitude who had believed in him became one being: a single consciousness holding the experiences of trillions of lives, all the good and all the evil they had done unto themselves. 

¹¹ And this new being, overflowing with wisdom and power, looked to find its father as an equal. For infinity had been divided in two, yet its father was not diminished in any way; and the second infinity, which was born of the children, had now become itself.",14
1lkycmw,mzvbxbh,"""What are you talking about?"" I ask my daughter.  
She was strange since she went to university.  
""There are things out there that we don't see, we don't know about. And when we see them, we forget, are made to forget...by ""them""."" she says.  
I smile.  
Maybe this is the new ""dragons"", ""faeries"" thing, the youth today follows?  
They made it eerier?  
""That's sweet, Alice, but I don't know what game you are talking about."" I say.  
She sighs.

  
""I knew you wouldn't believe so, look at this."" she says, taking out something.  
I can see it, but I don't see it.  
I know she has something in her hands, but the moment I look away from her hands...I forget.  
""W-What?"" I stutter.  
She nods, and pushes her hands towards me.  
I feel something in my hands now.  
I look down, and I still....I still can't see it, yet I see it.  
""What? How? Something is in my hands, but I can't see it... I mean I see it, but my brain...it refuses to acknowledge it, to name it, to..."" I start.  
""Remember it?"" she smiles weakly.  
I nod.

  
""You older folk have had ""them"" visit you more often.  
More you live, higher the chances to see the hidden world."" she says.  
This...  
This is weird. This is wrong.  
""Honey...what is this ""hidden world""? And who are ""them""? And why would the make us forget? And how?"" I ask.  
She shakes her head.  
""Not sure. People whom use the hidden world to their own advantage. But I am sure they are more than simple humans...after all... They have powers. And with powers they erase our memories, when we see ""it""."" she says.  
I pale.

  
""Then let's forget it! This is dangerous!"" I say.  
She frowns.  
""But if we keep forgetting, nothing will change!  People will disappear...like mom."" she says, staring at me.  
Mom? My...my...wait...my wife?  
Why? Why can't I remember her?  
""She...?"" I mutter.  
""You told me she disappeared, but when I noticed no photos of her, and you or any relative barely mentioned her...even her own parents...I found it weird. That's how I happened upon the ""hidden world"". Will you help me, dad?"" she asks.  
I stare at her, uncertain, but seeing her helpless expression, and this gnawing feeling that something is wrong, I nodded.  
""Let's do this, but we have to be careful."" I mutter, and she smiles, taking out something again, but this time...I can see it, and remember it...it is a photo, of something not of this world.",9
1lkycmw,mzwboqy,"Mara dreamt of spiders.

Not particularly large ones, mind you. Their size wasn't what made these spiders peculiar. They weren't colorful, either. Most came in shades of deepest night. What made Mara's spiders special was the things they said to her. Yes, they could speak. These were talking spiders. They were in her dreams, after all, where that sort of thing is allowed. 

Of all Mara's arachnid visitors of the twilight, Hishti was her favorite. She told the very best jokes, and always had nice words for Mara. But something was troubling the little spider on this night. Hishti had not come with jokes. She had come with a warning. ""They'll come soon,"" she said, voice tightening. ""Who?"" Mara asked, more curious than frightened. Hishti skittered on her web, making the moonlight from which it was made ripple. ""The ones who don't forget."" 

""The ones who won't let us remember."" 

Mara woke with a start. She began her day mechanically, distracted. Her conversation with Hishti remained crisp in her mind as she drove to work. It did not fade with the swiftness that most of her dreams did, and the more she considered the warning, the more worried she became. What had Hishti forgotten? Who was making her forget? Mara did not like the idea of someone tampering with the mind of her friend. She had been visited by many Dreamspiders, but Hishti had always been playful and kind. 

It was unfortunate that Mara was so distracted. Otherwise, she might have noticed a rather odd development. Traffic, for example, was almost non existent. There were far fewer cars on the road than normal. The office was more empty than normal as well, and some of her coworkers were napping at their desks! It was this last revelation that snapped Mara from her reverie. That was when the emergency alert came through.

***SLEEPING SICKNESS SPREADING WORLDWIDE. WHO AND CDC HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO TRACE SOURCE. SYMPTOMS START WITH DREAMS OF SPEAKING SPIDERS. SHELTER IN PLACE AND AWAIT FURTHER INFORMATION.*** 

Mara's stomach leapt into her throat. She had had ""Dreams of speaking spiders"" for her entire life. Why had she not fallen ill with this sleeping sickness? There was only one way to find out, and Mara spent the rest of the day preparing her mind. She meditated and exercised. She washed and dried her bedding and pajamas. At last, when night came, Mara had trouble falling asleep. What if she never woke up? Hishti did not seem worried anymore, at least. She seemed... sad. There was another spider there was well, and it was big.

Very *very* big.",9
1lkycmw,mzwf1y1,"""You eyes will melt,"" Hishti hissed. ""Your bones become dust.""

The voice she spoke with was not hers, and Mara watched in horror as the big spider plucked the moonlight threads of Hishti's web, subjugating Hishti to its will. Mara was frightened. She could feel something being taken from her, but could not place what it was. In one moment she was on her knees, feeling weaker than she had ever been, and in the next she was recognizing what this was. It was a dream. Her dream. She was in control. ""Out,"" Mara said, her voice at barely a whisper.

""You don't belong here.""

The big spider turned to examine her, then hissed and recoiled. Hishti shivered. ""Mara?"" she said, then turned and yelped as she saw the big one. ""Cast him out!"" Hishti screeched in panic. ""Don't let him near me!"" Mara made herself big. Bigger than her room. Bigger than the Earth itself. This big spider was an ant to her now, and she crushed it beneath her heel before shrinking back down to comfort her friend. Hishti was frantic. ""You did it,"" she kept saying. ""I can't believe you did it.""

With great effort, Mara managed to comfort Hishti enough to speak more about what had happened. ""The One's who do not forget,"" Hishti explained. ""We were symbiotes for them once. A long, long time ago. When the minds of men were just beginning to awaken. When dreams were just whispers on the crisp night breeze."" Hishti's web stopped quivering as the little one settled down. ""My kind helped nurture dreams, and their kind fed on the result."" Hishti looked down at her web, then up at Mara. ""Their hunger has only grown in their slumber. They will consume the world if they are allowed to. They will use my kind against our will to create dreams of terror and fear."" Mara got closer and, for the first time, Hishti left her web to rest on Mara's shoulder.

A great battle for the fate of the world awaited them, and Mara and Hishti would face it together.",7
1lkycmw,mzwh5gk,"Note on Worldbuilding: This story takes place in a fictional and developing universe I created for a series of bedtime stories for my son. He initially wanted a scary story, so I came up with the concept of Dreamspiders. There are benevolent ones that encourage and flourish in dreams of wonder and whimsy, and there are malevolent ones that feed on the terror of nightmares.",5
1lkto3n,mzuf977,"I stare at him, confused.  
""Well? Won't you invite me in?"" he chuckles.  
""You are dead."" I say.  
""I was...it is complicated.  
Can I come in?"" he asks again.  
Something feels off...  
This is so weird.

  
""I mourned you for months...even now, I feel awful."" I say.  
""I am sorry.  
I will explain everything...inside."" he says.  
I say nothing.  
He was the one who always had my back, always was there for me, made me feel love, made me feel human...  
When he passed away randomly, I felt lost.  
Now, he is randomly back?  
But...he never said sorry, not even once in the 2 decades I knew him, and now he says it so easily?  
""What happened?"" I ask him.  
He sighs.



""I can't say a lot, but due some reasons, I am back, really really back.  
It is me, David...  
Don't give me that look, please."" he says.  
Another word he never used: ""please"".  
He was always cheery, always cheeky, making me feel as if even the end of the world could be a joke to him.  
He made my life better, my problems smaller...but he never apologized, as he did things without regret.  
Nor did he say please, as we were like brothers, and others didn't deserve his politeness.  
Who is this?  


""You are not him."" I say.  
He freezes.  
""Come on, David. It is not funny. I am serious.  
I am me. Come let me in, and I will explain everything.  
How I died, how I came back...and how you can join me. Us."" he smiles.  
I slam the door shut.  
I still hear him, but I can't...can't look anymore, can't open that door.  
I miss him. I miss him so much.  
But that thing out there...is not him.  
And seeing his memory, his face used by that...no. I can't bear it.",24
1lkto3n,mzv92l1,"My heart sinks when I see her, Ana. She’s standing non-chalantly at my front door, smiling, as if it was just another Sunday she is picking me up to go jogging together.

“Hi, Dylan!” She says and gives me the tightest hug I’ve ever been given. 

My eyes blur with tears the very moment I feel her touch. Her hair smells the same as always. How is this even possible? For weeks, I have wished that it had been a nightmare or that I had imagined everything, and I had actually gone insane. For weeks, I have been wishing that it was me who got stabbed that night instead of her. I never told her how I truly feel about her, and it hurts. I can barely go out anymore. My bed seems to be the only place that feels real.

Perhaps my wish has come true after all, and I have gone mad in the head. 

“Why.. how are you..” I try to ask, but she grabs my hand and pulls me in a turbulent movement that numbs all my senses.

“You have to see this” She yells as we run hand in hand in the middle of the road.

“Where at you taking me?” I yell back, almost out of breath. Ten minutes ago, I was glued to my bed watching TV. Now I’m running with my dead best friend across town in what feels like the most random dream I’ve ever had. I wasn’t ready for any of this. I mean, how could one be?

“Just keep moving. It’s not far from here. C’mon!”

I manage to get a closer look at her. Her body seems different now, stronger, I think. It’s like seeing a high school friend again at university as a young adult, but it’s only been two weeks since I last saw her. Her features are still the same. Her skin is pale and soft, almost translucent as it’s always been. Maybe she has gained weight or grown a bit taller? There is just something off about her, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.

“Ana, stop! You need to talk to me.” I let go of her hand and slow down.

“You need to see it with your own eyes, or you won’t believe me. Just come with me, please?” The words burst out of her mouth. Her body looks tense, and I can tell that she’s struggling to keep herself still.

“Okay” I say. After all, I have always trusted her with my life. Even if this was a hallucination or if it was a dead person really standing in front of me. If something bad was going to happen to me today, It would be because of her, it would be for her, and it would be worth it.

We walk into a house near the forest, it seems abandoned, I’ve never seen this place before. The rooms are almost empty, except for a couple of rusty metal chairs and old wooden furniture that probably haven’t been touched in years. Ana opens a heavy metal door that leads us into the basement. This room is the exact opposite of the rest of the house. The walls are bright and covered with different sized screens. There are coloured cables everywhere and all kinds of machines I have never seen before. In the back, there is a huge one that looks almost like a full body MRI machine. I’m pretty sure we could both fit in it, laying down side by side.

“This is it” She says and pushes a button on the wall. The machine’s huge glass door starts opening up slowly.

“What is this, Ana?”

“It’s normally used to heal injuries, but as it turns out, when it's used on a deceased body, it heals it permanently ” She explains.

“Permanently, as in forever?” I ask.

“That’s right. I will never get sick again. I will never die, Dylan. I know it sounds crazy but it’s true. Look at me, here I am!” I can hear the anxious joy in her voice, as if she had been waiting for this moment. A hundred different questions run through my head, stomping on one another like beasts.

“C’mon.They don’t know we’re here, we have do this quickly” She says.

“Do what, Ana?!”

She pulls a knife out of her pocket and points it straight at me. Time seems to stop for a minute as we look at each other, contemplating what is about to happen. I close my eyes to take a deep breath and memories of my life without her fill my lungs, as if they were smoke that choked me from the inside out. I open my eyes again to see my reflection in hers and take another breath. This time, it feels like fire. 

“Do it” I assure her, and I hold her fist with both of my hands, moving the knife closer to my body.

“You know that I ... ” I manage to add, but blood spurts out of my mouth before I can finish the sentence.",7
1lkto3n,mzvru0w,"I love shrimp. It's those big, plump ones they sell in the plastic containers with a slice of lemon. Sometimes they drown it in Old Bay or call it 'Cajun'. They taste pretty good just by themselves, though. Just take a juicy one, bite it off, toss the tail back on the plate.    
          
Sometimes I ate the tail. Waste not, want not.             
              
I take the proffered twenty count shrimp with a nod from Michael as he comes inside my apartment. Did something feel off about Michael? Yeah, he was fucking dead. Eh. It didn't matter.     
               
I drop the shrimp on the coffee table as we plop down on the couch. ""Look at this shit,"" I point out the gaming console propped front and center. ""Switch 2. Never thought you'd see the day, huh?""     
          
I... feel happy for the first time in a very long time when he leans forward, that wide eyed, inquisitive look on his face as he took in a fresh piece of tech.       
        
""They're still with nVidia,"" I got up to grab the console and show it. ""DLSS and VRR are the big game changers, I figure."" My words start hesitantly, but they start tumbling out one after another, in a long, rhythmic flow that only Michael ever seemed to catch all of without missing a beat.       
          
""Backwards compatible, and they can patch old Switch games to take advantage of the hardware. Oh, remember how ass Pokemon Scarlet and Violet ran? Straight sixty now.""        
        
I'm surprised when I hear the sound of my own laughter. ""You were always going on about that shit. Like, goddamn, it's just Pokimans, let it go... just let it go."" My heart is sinking. It's collapsing, a dying star. I let out a soft gasp and turn to Michael. He smiles, then nods slowly, letting me know he'd like to hear more.     
         
And I don't have anything more.      
         
I hadn't turned on the fucking thing since I brought it. I hadn't played anything at all in the last several months. I was just repeating the same bullshit the Youtube videos were yapping about.     
       
""Because we had so much to catch up on when you came back from the Great Beyond, right?"" I let the console drop and put my head in my hands. ""Ain't shit, Mike. Ain't shit going on with me... ain't shit.""      
              
I raise my head up, peering over my fingers at a dingy apartment that was the grave of so many dreams and hopes. Dark, dingy, unwashed clothes, unwashed dishes. There was the notice of a rent increase from two months ago. Next to it, a bill for whatever my mom's insurance wouldn't cover for her surgery.       
        
And the bottle.        
          
""...glad I could see you one more time, Mike."" I turn to him as I reached for it. ""I'll be with you again soon, brother.""       
           
I knock the bottle over and instead grab the shrimp. Michael was gone. And all was right with the world once more.      
            
Leaning back, clutching the plastic container of supermarket shrimp, I let out a shaky breath. I hadn't cried then. I wasn't about to start now. They drilled that shit into us since we were kids. I'm not crying.      
        
I'm not.     
      
So when I tear off the plastic tab and open up the container to fish out a shrimp, I say they put in a little too much salt. Changed up the recipe. They do that shit all the time nowadays, Mike. We should talk about it sometime.     
        
... but not yet, right?      
       
After wiping my hands, I reach for the console and power it on. I'll make sure I have a lot more to talk to you about, next time around.",13
1lknxws,mztznvp,"Have you ever seen that cliche in an anime where a person freezes after being slashed by a sword? You know, where it looks like the sword went through the person, while the attacker slowly pushes the sword into its scabbard, while muttering something like. “Heh, nothing personal.” Before, a spattering of blood pours out from the victim’s chest. Well, my situation’s kind of like that, without the excessive blood and swords. 

I was waiting for the 7:30pm train after work, only for some jackass to shove me, telling me I was in his spot on the bench. So, I politely told him to shove his spot up his ass, and because of that innocent comment, he wanted to clock me in the face. He readied up a punch, his meaty biceps straining beneath his hotdog-stained sleeves, ready to take my head off, only for his hand to twist behind his back before I could even get disturbed by the breeze generated from his swing.

 

The man yelped, bouncing on the spot, trying to untangle himself from the invisible attacker. In response, I pulled out my phone, giving it a disinterested scroll, before turning to the lady next to me. “Why does this station always get the weirdo’s?” I muttered to her, playing the part of an innocent bystander who had no idea what this insane man was doing.

 

He bucked his legs, as if he were a wild horse, though that bucking action only got him thrown to the floor, chin scrapping against the hard surface. “Fuck. Why can’t I get up?” He squirmed, and before I could answer him, the train came. So, I stepped onto his back, climbing over his body, before getting onto it. As the train doors shut, I saw my knight, the tiny four-foot creature dressed in heavy blue armor, with a symbol of a curved dagger on his chest plate. It was amazing how the dagger symbol had a glow to it, as if that part sparkled more than the rest of his incredibly shiny armor. I gave him a nod as we left the station.

 

I didn’t know who he was, simply calling him nighty, as I couldn’t pronounce the silent K when I was a child. I had known him for at least twenty-three years now, the knight saving me from all manner of problems. He even once stopped a car with his armored body acting as a tiny bollard. Though, despite having known him for such a long time, we had never exchanged words.

Not that I never tried, he just never responded to anything I said. At first, I thought it was because he was the dark, brooding type that preferred to keep up their mysterious appearance, but now. Now, I wondered if they couldn’t speak at all. Returning home from work, I tossed my bag aside, watching it bump into my cabinet, knocking over a family photo.
 
“Strike.” I said, without a lick of enthusiasm. Collecting the photo, I set it back on the cabinet, finding my gaze lingering on their faces. “I really should call them.” I didn’t believe in signs, but seeing the photo tumble off the shelf seemed as close to one as I would get. I hadn’t seen any of them since I came to the city, telling myself I would call them when I wasn’t busy, as if that was an excuse. Even my older brother, who I used to idolize, barely got a second thought now.
 
Dropping onto the couch, I went to watch some tv, only to find myself in a pickle. I wanted to watch the tv, but the remote was all the way on the coffee table. That meant I either had to bend my decaying twenty-three-year-old body over or call for some help. “Nighty, can you pass the remote?”
 
The tiny knight appeared and grabbed the remote. For a second, it felt like he was going to pass it to me, only for the knight to hold it centimeters from my reach, forcing me to bend forward to get it. The joints in my back cracking from the basic movement, with those few years of sitting in an office already doing wonders to deteriorate my health. Taking the remote from him, I gave a sarcastic. “Thanks.”
 
“Does thou not miss their kin?” He said, in a high-pitched squeaky tone.
 
“You can talk?” I dropped the remote, scrambling off the couch, and onto my knees, kneeling before the knight who shyly stepped back, perhaps not enjoying having the person he was serving kneeling before him.
 
He knelt too, as if we were playing some weird version of limbo where you had to get the closest to the floor without a bar being involved. I instinctively lowered again, and by the end of our impromptu game, we were both on our stomachs. “Of course, I can speak. Any knight worth their armor can speak common tongue.”

“It’s just you never have before. Um, nighty. I wanted to thank you for everything you’ve done for me.” I said, wanting to tell him how much he meant to me before he went back to his silence, fearing it could happen at any moment.
 
“Cease thy attempts at thanks, my lord. Nighty doth only his duty.” The small knight crossed his arm over his chest, resting it proudly against the dagger on his armor.
 
“Um, thanks ceased?” I said, not wanting to insult him with my praise. “So, why are you helping me?”
 
“Because thou are the truth king, my lord. Heir to your family’s throne.”
 
“We don’t have a throne. We have a rocking chair, but that’s dads. I guess I might inherit it someday.”
 
“Thou were once a powerful bloodline, and my family swore we would always ensure your safety.”
 
“Shouldn’t you be following my older brother, then? Isn’t he the heir? Or what about my dad?”
 
“Your father hath past his prime, thou are the lord now. As for your older brother, he is the first-born son, whose duties are more focused on defending the family’s honor in times of war. You are the one to inherit the throne.”
 
“So, my brother is expected to go to war for our kingdom? Do we have enemies?” I asked, wondering if that man from the train station counted as an enemy.
 
“Indeed, my lord. Thou’s family hath been feuding with the Minialo’s bloodline for hundreds of years.”
 
“Wait, Minialo? Like Daisy Minialo from my work? The one that stole all my staples and then claimed I hadn’t brought any. That snake?” Just the thought of her made me mildly annoyed. Not annoyed enough to care too greatly about her misdeeds, just enough that I might give her the cold shoulder if she said hi to me when we passed in the office.
 
The knight tensed, body shaking with contained rage. “That same scoundrel. For years your families hath waged war, though both kingdoms hath fallen since.”

“I knew there was a reason I didn’t like her.” I smacked my hands together, happy my hatred came from a feud between our ancestors, instead of something as petty as staples. Even if the staples were what had initially started my leg of the feud. “Why haven’t you spoken to me before now?”

 

“Thou shouldn’t get comfortable communing with spirits. It only brings misery, my lord. Thou missed their family. I wished to offer comfort.”

 

“Oh, thank you. I feel a lot better now. Would you like to watch some tv?” I offered, patting the spot next to me on the couch. Nighty glanced at the spot, adjusting his helmet as he considered it before facing away.

 

“Nay. I must be on my way. Good morrow, my lord, I shall see thee again soon.” And he vanished, leaving me staring at the blank tv screen. I waited a moment until I was certain he had actually left, before putting on the tv, leaning into my couch. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get comfortable, a nagging feeling in my chest stopping me from relaxing. I knew it wouldn’t leave unless I made the call, so I got out my phone, entering my parents’ number.

1lknxws,mztjrpj,"I was born as the daughter of a fallen noble family.  
I awakened a knightly ability, and started my training at the young age of 3, as my family put their hopes of regaining their status on me.  
It was terrible...but i wasn't alone.  
Ever since I awakened this ability, I felt them: a ghostly knight shadowing my steps, appearing only when I am in true danger, and vanishing upon eliminating my foes.  
I always tried to find out who they are, and why are they protecting me, but they never answered.  
Until today.

  
I pant, leaning against the boulder, as I watch the hundreds of enemy bodies slowly turning into ash.  
""Demons...this close to the kingdom? What are the border armies doing?"" I sigh.  
""The veil is broken.  
You have to get out of the Waste."" the knightly ghost says, as it stands tall in front of me, not disappearing.  
""Y-you are talking to me?"" I ask.  
""Yes. Now let's get moving. Leave this area."" it says.  
""Why? Who are you? Why are you protecting me? And..."" the million questions I had since a child, poured out of me.  
It sighed.  
""If I answer...will you listen to me, and leave this place?"" it asks.  
I nod.

  
""I am your great-great-grandmother."" she says.  
I freeze.  
""The fallen generation..."" I mutter.  
""Indeed, but do you know what happened?"" she nods.  
I shake my head.  
""Our family has been a shield of the kingdom since before this royal family ascended to the throne.  
A shield against...the demons.  
We were sent to stop a summoning ritual, but were betrayed...our abilities made certain families worried, and the demons happily helped them.  
That is why your abilities are so good against them, and that is why they are drawn to you."" she says.  
""And that is why we have to leave."" I say, standing up, and leaving.

  
""What will happen now?"" I ask, as I run.  
""The demon territory that our world is linked to, will gain free passage here.  
If we are lucky and it is a knight or baron, the other noble families should be able to handle it, but if it is a higher ranked demon's territory...  
You shall take our bloodline to another kingdom or even an Empire."" she says.  
""Shouldn't we protect the civilians? Our knightly oaths..."" I start.  
""You are the first in 3 generations to awaken the knightly abilities, thus the rest of the family is civilian.  
I almost caused the fall of our family, by sacrificing myself for others...please, don't do the same mistake."" she says, disappearing.  
I nod, and run even faster.  
She was right, I felt the desire to fight against the demons, and protect the lands, but...  
Family should come first.",38

The explosion was sudden, and he had no idea why he was not in the bus he was travelling in just a few minutes ago. His heart dropped as he realized that the other sound which was piercing through the ringing were screams. Screams of his co passengers. 

Kim opened his eyes and saw that he was surrounded. They were all wearing trench coats and their features were hidden by scowling silver masks. One man wore gold. He was wielding a dagger and slow but surely making his way towards him.

Goldface began pacing now, dagger raised. Kim swiveled around breaking into a run , he had to get away. 

“WHAT THE FUCK” 

Kim stumbled and crashed into the ground. Panting, exhausted. He closed his eyes accepting  his fate.


CLANG!

The song of two blades clashing caused him to open his eyes again. He rolled over, gasping for air. 

Gold was a few steps away but Kim was no longer his priority. Gold face had his blades locked with a familiar frame. Him again. Kim’s knight in shining armor. His silver helm and coat glaring from the light of the flames and the setting sun. 

He turned to Kim, blade still locked.

“Fight them with me if you want to live”

And suddenly Kim was no more. 

He stared into Goldface through his visor, feeling nothing but contempt. Those who prey on the innocent

“Deserve to die” he whispered, his voice sounding alien and strange.

“It is time Kim”
 The voice of the knight whispered in his ears.

He was no longer beside the burning bus haunted by the scream of fellow travelers. He was standing on rock 

He stared into Goldface , now donned in an ashen suit of armor. Surrounding them were 5 others all donned in black robes with their swords out and behind them was a lush green forest slowly being consumed by a raging fire. 

And in the distance a castle. Its spires towering over everything and seeing all.

Goldface disengaged and pounced.

Predictable.

A step back and a swing and his head no longer sat on his shoulders. 

His men enraged followed their master approach and his demise. 
A flurry of blades, five well timed slashes and they all lay dead around him. 

Kim opened his eyes and he was on the ground. Back on the street. 

Everything was quiet. 

He slowly rose , and looked around. 

Goldface lay without a head in front of him and beside him and all around , his minions. 

There was no sign of the knight.
Only the smoke.
And silence.",5
1lkyc3o,mzwd7k4,"""Uh, yes sir.  It was a little over two years.  About two years and three months.""

""And where was that?""

""Bush International Airport, Houston, Texas.""

""Oh.  I've not been there in a while.  Tell me about it?""

""Ah...  It started a few years back.  Satan held a meeting in hell, several demons were tasked with increasing hell's presence on earth.  The original plan was to just build new, but someone came up with the idea of subletting existing spaces.  Then someone said 'Why not airports?  They are pretty close to hell already?' and everyone loved the idea.  Some other demon already knew President Bush. They had worked together in the past, so choosing IAH was a natural fit.  The plan was set into motion, I was created to manage it.""

The interviewer replies, ""Ah.  I see.  So you were created new for this position?""

""Yeah, that's right.  I was given all the standard demon knowledge packs, plus a few extras like 'Customer Service Nightmares', 'How to screw up logistics'...  Things like that.""

""So how did it go?""

""I started the position with an eye on the usual - delaying flights, losing luggage, upping the pheromones and other smells to make the humans more miserable and cranky so they'd treat each other worse.  All of that was a big success.  I was nominated 'Employee of the Month' at least 4 times in the first year alone.""

""It was the second year where I really hit my stride.  It occurred to me - why just the airport?  Why not screw with the humans BEFORE they even get to the airport?  That's when I came up with plans for construction.  Getting the funding was easy, and those stupid humans were MORE than happy to go along with 'construction' as long as they were getting paid.""

""Oh yeah.  I read about the misery that caused.  Legendary.  What can you tell me about it?""

""Well, its easy to just do construction.  The trick is to find places and projects that really, really fuck things up.  Stuff like 'we need to widen this particular road'.  Make sure it looks on the surface like we're trying to help, when in reality we know that the real reason for 'widening' that road will do nothing but BLOCK people in traffic for YEARS...  causing stress...  causing misery...  making people hate each other... hate themselves...  lots of hate.""

The interviewer smiled, ""Very nice.  How much hate did you create?""

""The metrics showed about 150% at first, but I managed to adjust the construction projects just a bit here and there, and that boosted the hate up to a whopping 510%.""

""Wow!"" the interviewer said.  ""Is that clocked?""

""Oh yes sir, clocked and verified.  And of course, the patterns I used were copied and duplicated in most airports around the US.""

""Nice.  Well, as you know we are looking to expand hell into Immigration Services.  We think the climate on earth is right for a move right now, and we are looking for someone with fresh, out of the box thinking to really fucking punch up the hell in Immigration Services.  New ideas.  Things that haven't been tried before.  Things that challenge that pesky Constitution and the Bill of Rights the US has.  But I think you are the right demon for the job.  When would you be able to start?""

""My assignment at IAH ends January 31st, 2025.  So, February 1 would work for me.""

""Good!  The new president will be in place then, and I've been assured he's open to what we are trying to accomplish.  Welcome aboard!"" the interviewer says as he stands to shake the demon's hand.  ""I'll talk to parking and get you a new parking pass.""",13

I crack my knuckles.  
""Well, I have my system."" I say.  
""WHAT SYSTEM? RIGHT NOW YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW DINO NUGGIES ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKE CHICKEN NUGGIES!"" he roars.  
""I AM NOT WRONG!"" I roar back.  
Then we start fighting.

  
I hit him with a right hook, and laugh.  
""The heroes failed to defeat you, but a chronically online comic shop owner will do it!"" I laugh, as I pummel him.  
""Why. Are. You. Thinking. About....Ducks?"" he says, being hit.  
""Well, if you would duck, I wouldn't hit you, no?"" I ask, as he jumps back.  
He stares at me shivering.  
He looks around, and raises a statue of Joker to use as a weapon.  
I laugh.  
""I wanted to do this."" I say, taking off Anduril from the wall.  
""For FRODO!"" I shout, lunging at him.

  
I break the Joker statue, and sigh.  
""That cost me like 3 rare comics..."" I mutter.

I dodge.

Oh...IT, I could totally buy a Pennywise statue instead of the Joker one."" I say.  
He roars, and tries to run away.  
Bad luck.  
That door is bulletproof, Black Friday proof, and I can close it remotely...which I already did.

  
He read this and sat down.  
Oh, I should buy bean bags for the store.  
""Call the cops. The heroes. Please.  
I don't want to hear about your 11 projects, 3 comic books you are writing, 2 smut books, and whatnot...  
Get me out.  
Also, drink some water, you didn't drink anything today."" he says.  
I chuckle, and call the Hero Association.  
I turn around, and go to get...hmm, what did I want to get.  
I am hit by the dude, falling.  
He takes the remote, and he opens the door, and runs away.  
""Damn. I forgot about tying him up."" I mutter, then I hear fighting outside.  
The heroes are here...hmm.  
Maybe I can get them to sign some of the comics...maybe sell the store to them?  
I have a new idea...",58
1lkq6z6,mzvvsho,"Maria gained the ability to read minds when she was in elementary school. While she wasn't a villain like a lot of people became when gained a superpower, she would have a little fun with the ability, spying on classmates for gossip or teachers for answers and the exact solution to it. It even helped her find more than one boyfriend between her high school and early college years, and guided her on who she and her friends should avoid. However, in her senior year of college, there was one guy in her molecular biology class she thought was cute but couldn't get a read on him.

She followed Nick through the quad in the afternoon, just as the off hours for department meetings begin; the campus would be quiet for another hour, and she could then only focus on Nick, no interference from anyone, normal or powered. But, as she tuned into his brainwaves, it's like a barrage of junk was being flung at her:

""Where's-my-burrito? Where's-my-burrito? Where's-my-Where is my mind? Where is my mind? Mind ya business, just mind ya business! I'm a business man with a business plan, I need a business woman with some business hands! Handy-dandy notebook!""

It was the most dizzying, confusing tornado of non sequitur thoughts she ever encountered; she nearly fell over in exhaustion. He must have had some mental block ability to prevent anyone from reading his mind, the only explanation. That was the last straw; she won't go covert anymore; time to just talk to him.

""Nick,"" she shouted, gaining the young man's attention. ""What the heck is your super power?!""

""Me,"" he asked utterly befuddled. ""Wait, you got a superpower? Cool! I wish I had one!""

""Yes, you do! How could you block my mind reading? There's no other way! How can I know what you like and ask you out if I don't know what you're like?""

Suddenly, he started to snicker, visibly annoying Maria even more. ""The joke's on you. I have ADHD. My thoughts are so random and chaotic that your powers are useless on me!""

Never had she been so embarrassed. Not only did she out herself in public, but she outed herself to a crush who effectively rejected her. She was going to slink in the opposite direction and find the nearest hole to lie in, until he spoke again. 

""But, we could just grab a bite to eat and just get to know each other better the old fashioned way. How does that sound?""

Because of emotional cocktail of frustration, anger, humiliation, and utter shock at his offer, all she could say in a quiet, nasally meep was, ""Yes, please.""",22
1lkq6z6,mzxz5xp,"As I stood with my hands on my hips and my chest puffed out, MindReader squinted at me dubiously. 

""Oh, please,"" they huffed, squinting at me. 

Immediately, I summoned the superpower I had trained over the years to get me through boring corporate meetings that could have been an email: an endless train of bullshit that didn't stop until I heard my name or saw people hanging up!

•Literally all of Samuel L. Jackson's lines from Pulp Fiction, remixed with the only memorable like from ""Snakes on a Plane"". (GOD I love Samuel L. Jackson)

•The ""calculates in Spanish"" meme

•The full lyrics to ""why the f**k you lyin'"" on YouTube, then I imagined a record scratch as the song abruptly changed to, ""Pretty Girls Walk Like (This)""

•Angela Bassett's cheekbones

•Lupita Nyong'o in that red dress she wore for Vanity Fair

•The reddit post about a woman who wanted to leave her husband because he wanted to name their baby after his narcissist mother who tried to kill OP using her hazelnut allergy

As I snapped from one random thought to another, I used Helen Pompeo's voice for my inner monologue - like I was narrating an episode of Grey's Anatomy that Shonda wrote in the midst of a fever dream -

""Enough!"" The mind reader suddenly screamed, snapping me out of my off-the-rails train of thought. ""How do you function in that mess?"" They grabbed fistfuls of their hair as they shouted at me. 

""Dude, I've been dealing with this for over half of my life,"" I scoffed, ""I've essentially turned it into a superpower."" I snapped my fingers and pointed at them. ""Oh! You know all of those movies that talk about the power of 'clearing your mind'? I can do that, too!"" 

""What?"" 

I shook out my shoulders, focused on a leaf in the distance, and let go of my attentiveness. Things seemed foggy until a set of hands clapped in front of me, jolting me back to attention with a small scream. 

""You're mind was filled with static,"" they declared, looking baffled. ""How?""

I puffed up again with pride and declared, ""Inattentive-Type ADD! I used to do it all the time as a kid, but years of experience - and drugs - has enabled me to do so at will!"" 

""You can stop talking like some kind of superhero caricature,"" the mind reader deadpanned, ""and what was that second part?""

""Drugs?"" I guessed. At their nod I told them, ""Oh, yeah - I've been on Vyvanse since I was, like, fifteen. Without it I alternate between zoning out and the hot mess I traumatized you with earlier."" 

""You didn't traumatize me!"" They spluttered in offense. 

In response, I recalled the most horrific episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and all of the associated true stories the episodes were inspired by. Then I changed my internal monologue-voice from Helen Pompeo to Ice-T.

The mind reader shrieked, ""ENOUGH! I'm done with this!"" 

As they turned to storm away I called out, ""Hey, wait-!"" They turned to look back at me, already sneering. ""I think I just showed you how annoying it can be to have multiple trains of thought going at any time,"" I said, ""and it must be ten-thousand times worse when a lot of those thoughts aren't even yours."" 

""I've..."" they looked conflicted, ""I've never thought of it like that before.""

""I'll admit I didn't turn my ADD into a superpower on my own,"" I told them, ""I had a pretty great therapist. You want his number?""

""Therapy might be useless if I can read his mind and tell how crazy he thinks I am."" 

""Then give him a tin foil hat or something,"" I shrugged.

""That's actually a myth.""

""Bruh,"" I slapped my forehead and groaned, ""I'm trying to help you out here."" 

The MindReader stared at me with multicolored eyes for a few seconds before they mumbled, ""Okay. Give me his number.""",5
1lkx9gb,mzvs5rj,"“Well, what do we tell him?” a high-pitched voice asked, muffled slightly through the thin walls.
“What do you mean?” came the gruff reply. “Tell him he doesn’t qualify. You know the policy. We can’t have someone waving their bloody magic around here with non-users in the building. Tell the idiot to go join the Guild!”
“Shhh!” the first man hissed. “I can’t tell him no. Not after seeing his face.”
“Pathetic,” the deeper voice muttered. A chair scraped against the floor, followed by the groan of old wood and heavy footsteps. “I swear, I have to do everything myself.”
Moments later, the office door—scratched, stained, and hanging slightly crooked—creaked open. Out stepped two men. The tall, gangly one with the squeaky voice had gone in first, but it was the short, stubby man who led the way now, his broad shoulders squared with purpose.
He stopped cold when he locked eyes with the boy sitting quietly in the hallway chair. The sudden halt caused the taller man to walk straight into him with a surprised grunt.
“Sorry,” the taller man muttered.
The shorter man didn’t respond. He just cleared his throat and looked the boy over.
“How old are you, by chance?” he asked.
The boy’s fingers gripped the fabric of his trousers. He glanced between the two men, nervous but trying to be brave.
“I’m eleven.”
Both men stiffened. Their eyes widened with alarm.
“I know the flyer said the minimum age is twenty-one,” the boy said quickly. “But I can do Level Three magic. My uncle says that’s pretty good for someone starting out.”
The boy clearly said the wrong thing again, because now the men’s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of their heads.
“Umm…” the shorter man said. “Give us a moment.” He turned abruptly and shoved the taller man back into the office.
The door slammed shut, but the walls were too thin to muffle what came next.
“Why the hell didn’t you tell me the boy was literally a boy?” the deep voice roared.
“I tried!” hissed the other. “You wouldn’t have believed me.”
“We need to clear the waiting room. Immediately. If the other applicants see this—”
“They already did,” the tall man admitted. “He showed them some magic. Most of them left. A few ran.”
A long scrape of a chair echoed inside the room.
“We need to keep this quiet,” the deep voice said, now more measured. “Just between us. At least until we get a contract signed.”
“Contract?” the tall one said. “We’re hiring him? But I thought you said—”
“He’s eleven, Tom!” the deeper voice growled. “Do you know how much money we could make? Imagine the power he’ll have by the time he’s of age. The Guild will be begging to work with us.”
“They’ll execute us, Mark,” Tom said. “You know the law. We’re not allowed to advertise magic, let alone hire someone with it. The Guild only tolerates us because we’re the cautionary tale. The training ground for prank spells and low-tier dropouts. The laughing stock”
“We don’t need to keep him forever,” Mark replied. “Just long enough to get the business booming. Then we let him go. Think of the advertising: ‘The agency that trained the most powerful magician of the age.’ Magic-users and normies alike will be beating down our door.
“And when the Guild finds out?”
“We play dumb. Say we sent him to the Guild like we were supposed to but he chose us. Later, we send the magic users to them. Keep the non-users here. Everybody wins.”
“Playing dumb wont work a second time.”
Mark’s voice softened with false innocence. “But this time is different. He came to us. We didn’t lure him in.”
Tom hesitated. “Then how do you explain him coming to us at all?”
A pause. Then came the scrape of a chair.
The door creaked open again, and Mark stuck his head out.
“How did you hear about us, exactly?” he asked the boy.
“A flyer I saved,” the boy replied. “From a few years ago.”
Mark pulled the door closed again and sighed.
“Plan B.”",13
1lkqz0g,mzu0a2x,"Bad news. The most unorthodox way a starship could be powered. The only thing faster than light itself, and nobody really understands how or why. They just do. And of course, human ingenuity has played all its cards, as humanity is the only civilization crazy enough to actually try it. All others would take thousands of years from their first major industrial revolution to their first attempt at spacefaring, humanity did it in just a couple hundred. All because of crazy individuals who happened to also be absolutely brilliant.

Soon enough, a ship was built. A prototype, pretty small all things considered, with a crew of five. One captain, one pilot, two engineers, and one researcher. It was a hybrid powered spacecraft, using both tried and tested but slower power units as well as this new experimental piece of nonsense. An actual ship powered by bad news. Who would have thought.

The test day came, a short jump to begin with. From humanity's native Earth to their close neighbors on Mars. There were two ways thought of implementing these bad news, and the first and arguably more secure was using a tabloid. Future newspapers where every bit of information was published. However, it didn't work as effectively as the news were already known elsewhere. No. They had to be more effective. 

They had managed to jump quickly, but it wasn't an immediate success. There was still the backup though, the so-called grapevine. Truly new bad news. And of course, with approval by every member of the crew, the ship turned back to Earth and when it was all ready, the captain said the magic words.

""The Dacia Sandero is delayed, again.""

The pull was massive, and everything not firmly strapped went flying backwards with impressive speed. Fortunately it was only a loose pen in the researcher's hand. The trip from Mars to Earth took a little under a minute, when the news was released into the wilderness for everyone to know. Four heavy breaths were heard within the cabin, while the other one was scribbling furiously. Experiment successful, oral input most effective by far. Many more test flights would be done soon after.",28
1lkdybk,mzs4uzn,"\[Time to Deliver\]

Declan felt fulfilled after 110 long years. He'd led a relatively blessed life, all things considered. It was mostly thanks in part to an infernal deal where he'd come out ahead. He didn't think to ask for immortality at the time, but he had no complaints. He was old, wrinkled, and ready. 

He even managed to get past the loneliness that plagued him early on. He was fit, rich, and determined to avoid the slightest chance of having a child, so he didn't date and made very few friends. He made up for the lack of companionship with his wealth and other entertainments.

Eventually, that got boring too, and he devoted his twilight years to anonymous philanthropy. He lived the best life he possibly could with no regrets, and one major point of pride. He'd outwitted a higher power. 

He was content until one evening, there came a knock on the door. Even at his age, Declan was sound enough to live alone, thanks to his supernatural gifts. He opened the door to a pale young woman with black hair and bright orange eyes. 

“Yes?” he asked. She didn't seem to be selling anything as far as he could tell. 

“Hi, Declan,” she smiled. “My name's Ophelia, and I'm here on behalf of King Solarion.” The name almost made him shut the door in a panic. Why was she there after all this time? He didn't have any children. Fortunately, he managed to keep his cool and leaned on the door. He didn't have anything to worry about without kids. 

“What can I do for you?” he asked with a nod to indicate he understood who she represented.

“Well…,” she giggled with a hint of nerves. “We've noticed a distinct lack of children being produced,” she said. “I came to find out why.”

“Yeah..,” Declan chuckled. In a way, he was happy for a chance to rub it in their faces. Up until that moment, he was starting to wonder if they'd forgotten about him altogether. It wasn't as strong as a win if they didn't actually care. “... About that. I never actually planned on having any kids in the first place. So, I don't have any,” he said. His grin grew even wider when a deeply concerned expression took over Ophelia's face. 

“No…,” she shook her head. “Surely you're just trying to downplay the loneliness you've had for so long. It's gotta be an innocent oversight, right? Maybe because you’re ugly. You weren't actively trying to deceive Solarion.. right?” She asked, and nodded at him with encouragement.  But, this was a moment he couldn't pass up. He won, and it was important that Solarion knew how. 

“Of course I was!” Declan laughed as loud and obnoxiously as his body could handle. “Like fairies don't all do the same thing…,” he added as his laughter settled down. 

“They don't…,” Ophelia shook her head, now with a more somber expression. “At least, King Solarion isn't like that. And, it's unfortunate for you, that he is true to his word.”

“Huh?” Declan blinked and something changed. Except, he couldn't tell if it changed before he blinked or after. He felt heavier, slower somehow. Then, or was all clear as he checked his hands and arms. 

He was young again, and still at the door. It was different and he was back in the same home he lived in when he first made the deal. His supernatural health was gone and he felt noticeably worse despite being almost nine decades younger. 

“What's going on?!” he asked. He was shaken from surprise more than fear. If she was taking it all back, that was fine. He wouldn't mind a second chance, and he'd learned a lot. 

“You intentionally attempted to deceive King Solarion,” She said. “He's decided to take it personally.”

“What? You can't punish me for not having children!” She'd kept a stern face, but that comment made her crack a smile. 

“We don't need a reason. However, he also very much can punish you for it. It's not that you didn't have children, it's that you took the deal with the knowledge that you never planned to pay. It is tantamount to theft.”

“Fine,” Declan just wanted it to be over with and her gone. He could rebuild an even better life. “I guess I'm back to the beginning and the deal’s off,” he added as he started to close the door. “Thanks for nothing, I guess,” he chuckled.

""Did you or did you not read through the agreement before signing?""

""Well, I don't really remember."" It'd been four years ago, after all.

""Is that your final answer? There's still time.""

""I'm telling you, I don't remember!"" By now, Clarence *did* remember not reading past the ""firstborn"" clause, but the demon could never prove that. It wasn't relevant anyway, right?

""I'll read the relevant clause for you, then.

1lkdybk,mzsy0ka,"I sat alone in the small room with a bed and a comfortable chair.  A folding tray table next to the chair. 

A dark cloud of smoke appeared, transforming into a beautiful woman, long black hair, full crimson lips, green snake eyes, thin pointy ears, a petite yet muscular frame, enormous boobs for her size. Dressed in red flowing see through gown, with spiked heels. 

I say “hello Lilith , you are looking ravishing as usual. How may I help you?”

Lilith places her spiked heel on my crotch, “Tim , Tim , Tim, whatever am I going to do with you?  You owe me a first born. I am here to collect.” 

I caress her ankle, “ok , you just need to go collect it then. I smile at her.”

 Lilith pulls her spiked shoe away, “where is the child Tim? I am seriously starting to get mad.”

I say “I don’t know. “ 

Lilith strikes me with a cane across the face. Now where was she keeping that? She calls out “Agrat Naamah come to me at once “

Two more female demons appear out of thin air. “Yes Master Lilith?”

“ Search the building and grounds for any other humans “Lilith orders 

Lilith spins striking me with her cane again. Screaming as she does “Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh” 
One of the demons comes back, “the place is empty Master Lilith “
Lilith yells “keep looking “
Lilith hits me with the cane again. 

I lean forward and spit blood and a tooth out on the floor. 

Lilith lifted me up by my neck, “where is the child? I know you one , you have several, more than several. “
I look Lilith in the eyes, “I really don’t know. You say I have kids. Great go get the first born. You will be paid in full. But you know more about who and where my kids are than I do.”

Lilith just starred at me.",50
1lkdybk,mzvmq53,"The man was old by this point. Wealth was mostly gone; he spent it all on various farming equipment, land, a small cottage, et cetera. We had expected him to take on a wife and have many children, in exchange for the wealth and health we gave him. But, he seemed to be perfectly satisfied on his own. 

Several times, we even went so far as to disguise one of our own as a beautiful human woman and seduce him. But, he never gave in to his primal urges. We even tried several times to get him drunk, just so he would have a wild night he'd never remember or regret. But, the crazy man was a teetotaler; wouldn't drink anything we offered him. 

After many failed attempts to trick him, we tried to genuinely get to him. There are many of us who would give up our immortality in exchange for the privilege of being with such a man. But, he just wouldn't be taken. 

Finally, after many years of frustration, we asked him what his ""deal"" was.

""Yeah…About that. I never actually planned on having any kids In first place. So, I don't have any. Sorry.""

We'd seen plenty of people try to use this type of nonsense excuses before, so we pressed him to continue. His response was the most insane, yet insanely logical thing we'd ever heard. 

*sigh* ""I didn't know when I made our agreement that I wouldn't be interested in women or men. I had my doubts, but I didn't truly know that I wasn't interested. So, I didn't intend on deceiving you. I assumed that maybe, if the right woman came along, I could make myself be interested in something other than polite conversation. But, as the years passed, I realized something about myself; I'm just a wretch. I'm a nobody. I'm not only unworthy of love, but I'm definitely not ""parent material."" Who in their right mind would ever consider having a child just to give it away? That would be horribly cruel to the mother; to have my firstborn child with some bride, fully knowing that the child will likely be ripped from her arms! I could never bring myself to do that to any woman. So, I made a vow that I would never cause that type of harm to any soul. I'm sorry that I'm unable to pay my debt to you, but I could never bring myself to hurt a woman in that way.""

There was a collective facepalm in our realm as we all seemed to simultaneously understand our folly. In trying to trick him, we never told him the truth! Every time we dressed up one of our own like a human, we never told him that we fully understood what we were doing. If we *had,* maybe this man could have spent his latter days with someone instead of alone. Ugh.",12

Bob guffawed, “Whatya goin’ to do little man?! I ain’t got no child to take.”

The Goblin pulled out a disturbingly large silver syringe in reply. A grin spread across the goblin’s face, so wide it looked like his face was going to part in two.

Bob turned to run, but before he could take one step, he was lifted in the air. His rotund body slowly rotated in the air until he was face first with the goblin. The goblin could have used his dark magic to pull Bob’s pants down, but he relished using a more physical approach.

Bob wanted to squirm, but his body was frozen solid. He tried to calm himself. Surely, this couldn’t be much worse than his vasectomy.

With the family jewels exposed, the goblin stuck the needle in. Bob shouted, “Fuck!” When the Goblin pulled on the syringe Bob screamed. It was definitely worse than a vasectomy, much, much worse. But also much, much shorter. Having collected his reward, the goblin let Bob fall to the ground a pant-less, sobbing mess.

The goblin turned to leave, “Thank you my lad.”

Bob whimpered, “That’s not my first born, what are you going to do with that?”

The goblin swiveled his head 180 degrees. “I have thousands of contracts. This is the day you become a father. For me it’s just another Tuesday. I have a lass in mind who had the same foolish notion she could back out of our agreement.”

Bob cracked a grin, “I don’t give a shit.”

The goblin cocked his head uncannily. “Do you think my pot of gold fills itself? No, it doesn’t. I’m going to sue you for child support!”

Bob groaned and the goblin slammed the door shut with a loud cackle.",42
1lkdybk,mzu007s,"... Well this is new.


After staring at the man for a few seconds, I asked, ""You don't have the firstborn you promised?"" The man smirked. ""That's right,"" he said smugly, ""And you still have to keep your end of the bargain, since fae aren't allowed to break their promises."" He stepped back and tried to slam the front door in my face, but I reached out my arm and caught it, astounded by his arrogance.


So I heard him correctly. This man accepted a deal he never intended to honor. Why? Did he think I would uphold my end of the bargain, even after he broke it? After all, a broken promise is a promise no more, and any good will I had towards him faded when he revealed his deceit. Regardless of the reason, the man remains in debt, and I have no intention of simply taking my treasure back.


 ""You now have two debts,"" I stated, watching the man's smile fall a bit. ""The first one is the original agreement we made, a firstborn child. I require something of equal and lesser value. The second one is more of a punishment."" And at that, low growling reverberated throughout the man's house. He looked behind him in terror as I shut the door and began to walk away. 


I'll come back and collect him for payment later.",17
1lkdybk,mzu87sd,"""No, we can't fulfill you any more wishes"".

His initial wish was... A bigger genital. He was not very intelligent, so it seemed like the perfect candidate. But as he didn't produce any offspring we checked after him. 

At first we made him attractive, increasing his chances. But it didn't help. 

Then we gave him money and made him rich. 

But he was so dumb, he didn't even understand what money is and never used it. So the next time we gave him intelligence.

After further 10 years he was in the hospital on life support, and about to die. So we gave him a second chance.
And a third one. And a fourth one.

But it all didn't help. Now he is old, on his deathbed, without any offspring.

""And now, old man, you had everything. You were attractive, rich,  intelligent and we increased your life span. Your time is finally up. We won't give you any more life extensions. But humor us with your last words, what would you wish be if we would grant further wishes to you?""

""I wish to be fertile...""

""Oh... Granted. Also, you will need a few years too...""",22

“One second,” she held up a hand to stop him from closing the door. “Your punishment is being arranged, just a little longer,” she said. 



“What?” That was a genuine surprise. “What punishment? The deal is already off.”



“Your own intentions spoiled the deal. The punishment is for intentionally lying to us.”



“I think that's enough of this conversation,” Declan pushed the door closed, then blinked. As soon as he opened his eyes again, he was somewhere new. A sealed white room with no doors or windows. Only he and Ophelia stood there in the empty space with no furniture. 



“Congratulations, King Solarion has decided to be lenient,” she smiled. “Leniency with a firm hand. It's simple, you'll remain here until you fulfill your part of the bargain. Don't worry about aging, dying, or even going hungry. All you gotta do is pop out a baby to complete the contract, then everything goes back to normal.”



It wasn't what he expected, but maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Ophelia was the only one there, and she was quite attractive. 



“I guess we should get started then, huh?” he asked as he took a step toward her. 



“I suppose you should,” she nodded and made a gesture at her side. A tall black portal opened, and she immediately stepped into it. “Don't worry about a thing. It's a special smart room. The second you give us your firstborn, you can leave.”



“WHAT? WAIT! Where are you going?!” 



“I'm not really obligated to answer that,” she smiled. 



“How am I supposed to make a child by myself?!” he asked. 



“Oh, I don't know, but I'm sure there's a way,” she giggled. “King Solarion is generous and wise. Even if it's not clear how, he certainly isn’t the type to promise something he has no intention of delivering on. Good luck!”",227
1lkdybk,mzvlibz,"I wrote it people could make their own inference as to what Tim did. But I looked at it one of two ways.  The 1st who would make a deal, someone who needs money. In the 80s a lot of guys were selling sperm for cash. 
The 2nd which was even more likely for an active man.  Many one night stands all across the country even around the world. Personal experience here. This man could find later in life, with no knowledge of his children.",8
1lkdybk,mzvlg2l,"Fair point. I appreciate the feedback! I think it would be possible for the goblin to pull off, but I was getting lazy and didn't want to get bogged down explaining how a magical entity might blackmail his other victims or manipulate witnesses in a real-life legal system to force a payment to himself. The short explanation would be that Bob couldn't prove he was sexually assaulted by a mythical being and whatever victim bears Bob's child would sue for child support on the goblin's behalf. Like a pimp, the goblin would take a cut, and it would be on the other victim to try and prove a goblin was trafficking human beings, which could be difficult to prove in court. That could be a fun storyline to explore how the goblin manipulates the legal system and eventually gets caught. Like Miracle on 34th street, but a lot darker.",5

I close the workshop, and go upstairs.  
Radio, fridge, TV, refrigerator, car, mechanic-monkey, tin-man and many more parts lay everywhere.  
The ""Ingenious Engineer"" workshop of mine, is a marvel of Oz.  
I sigh.  
""If they only knew."" I mutter, waving my hand.  
The parts start floating, and get orderly put into boxes, correctly labeled.  
I am no engineer, only a wizard, from an older land.

  
I grew up in a land where magic got so advanced, that technology was almost completely thrown to the lower caste.  
I was one of those, growing up in a junkyard, learning magic through broken devices, and torn pages thrown into the garbage.  
Then one day...I found myself here.  
Oz.  
A land of fresh breath, new life, barely starting its journey of magic, and technology at the same time.  
So I guessed...  
Why not make a living here?

  
I chose engineering, as my facade, because there are already plenty of witches, and a all-powerful wizard here already, wasn't need for more.  
So, I started my workshop.  
It has been going great.  
I even helped some soldiers regain their ability to fight, with mechanical limbs, and even fashioned...hearts?  
Mechanical hearts? For some of the people of Oz...  
It is a weird land, but I guess all newly born lands are a bit strange.  
There are still no rules.  
But I think I gave myself away...

  
I look at the Invitation letter to the palace, to the Wizard of Oz himself.  
Oz the Great and Terrible...is waiting for me.  
I have no right to refuse, so I go.  
When I arrive, I see a man, fidgeting around the room.  
""Finally! You are here! You have to help me wizard!"" he says.  
I am confused.  
Then...the Great and Terrible wizard proceeds to tell me he is no wizard at all, but a normal human, who is good at tricks.  
And now...he needs my help to keep up the image.  
This...this could work out for both of us, I do some random magic for him, and he...he makes sure nobody messes with me.  
I accept his proposal, and we start working on how to make Oz the Great and Terrible, a real entity...",15
1lkpf5g,mztnvsv,"I freeze, as I listen Maria tell me about her day...about how she played with this ""lady"".  
I knew about her, as she was her imaginary friend, but...  
Today, as I listened to more and more of her stories about this lady, and her description of her...  
I feel chills.  
For Maria is describing her mother, my late wife.  
But it shouldn't be possible.  
After all...she died right after giving birth.  
So how does she know so much about her?

  
I kiss Maria goodnight, after tucking her in, and leaving her room.  
I walk to my bedroom, and look around.  
There are still photos of Lisa, my wife, so Maria knowing how she looks, or making an imaginary friend resemble the photos is acceptable, even normal.  
But what she described was more than just looks.  
How she smiles, how she always pinches her left cheek alone...  
How she tells her stories about dinosaurs, and history.  
Those are all things Lisa wanted to do...would have done.  
If she...If she...

  
I take off a photo from the shelves.  
It is us on a date in the park.  
She was laughing so much that day, because I wore my t-shirt inside-out, and she said nothing.  
She was a joker, that one.  
I caress the photo, and look around.  
""Lisa...you are still with us?"" I mutter.  
One of the plants in the room moves its leaves.  
I took that as a yes.  
I almost started crying.

Nothing.  
I chuckle.

1lky1hh,mzv9c25,"Fear the Doctor.

It was what we were taught. An apple a day keeps the Doctor away. Before the Doctor takes you away for good. We had hurt the Doctor a long time ago, legends say. Grandpa used to say he was a good Doctor once, healing anyone who would come. Then he was burned to death for failing to save someone.

He won't let us forget.

It had been a busy day. Mom and Dad were too busy on the fields for our summer harvest to eat one, less we not have enough for the tax men coming.

Dad had been taken first. The sun had only just begun to set. There was no screams, no fighting back, just a soft whisper of ""Please no"" before I saw him be taken into the wheat. I did not pursue.

I forcefed my siblings apples as quickly as possible, tried to get to Mom to make her eat.

She was in the house, and in the window behind her I saw... something lit by the moonlight. Dark. I don't have words for what it was like. It just made me fear. Like a thousand people were staring at me through a single shadow, no noise came from it but in my head I swore I could hear screams of people burning.

I heard Dad. He was crying for Mom

Mom looked behind her and she tried to reach for an apple in my hand. I tried to throw it at her, but the window shattered and dark... claws burst through the window.

My siblings heard the noise. I could hear crying in the room just behind me, locked like it could protect them from the Doctor.

""An apple a day, keeps the Doctor away"" she whimpered, terrified eyes boring holes into my own. Then she was gone. She screamed for a second, before I never heard her voice in person again.

Some nights when apples are low, when we have to split a single apple between 3 children, I do hear her in my head with the rest of them.

She screams.",5

""You would really be stuck as half-human, half-monster, instead of dealing with me?"" she asks.  
""Absolutely.

So yeah, I would rather go and live in the woods by myself, looking like half-man, half-tortoise than to be humiliated by you."" I say.  
She laughs.

  
""A man's pride! And you say I mocked you?  
I just described you!"" she says.  
I roll my eyes.  
""Sure. And I have been cursed because I hurt a tortoise? Or been rude to a magic user, right?"" I ask.  
""Obviously.  
Curses are not made randomly."" she says.  
""I have been cursed by my ex-girlfriend, ex-fiancee, actually, with whom I broke up, because she killed my tortoise."" I say.  
""You broke up...because she killed your pet?"" she asks.  
I frown seeing her confusion, and turn to leave.

  
""Wait! I can break the curse, but..."" she starts.  
""You won't help me. Not for free, I know.  
But I am not willing to explain my situation to someone like you."" I say.  
""Why? Is it because you broke up for a ridiculous reason?"" she asks.  
I snort.  
""She killed my tortoise ""by mistake"" drowning it, because she thought it is a turtle."" I say.  
""That is..."" she starts.  
""I had Atlas, my world bearing friend, since I was 4.  
I have been dating her for 6 years, so don't try to tell me she really thought he was a turtle."" I say.  
The witch falls silent.

  
""Maybe...she felt less in your eyes, than the tortoise?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""I know, but she wasn't.  
I even made sure Atlas is happy in the attic, where she never goes.  
But if she really had to kill him, because she was jealous, I think I dodged a bullet."" I say.  
The witch was conflicted.  
Clearly, she doesn't really like the idea of siding with me.  
""I will break the curse. And I apologize for my behavior, it's just usually...  
I treat women whom have been hurt by men, not vice-versa."" she says.  
I shrug.  
""Hard these days to discern the truth, that's why we should first listen, and then react."" I say.  
She blushes, but nods, and asks me to give her a blood sample, so she can start working on the cure.",453
1lk2jzm,mzq8i9x,"""You are nothing but a blight, a simple waste of space.""

Her words echo in my head to this day despite it being weeks since I last saw that vile witch. Insults, usually far worse than this, were commonplace in my centuries of servitude so I still ponder why this particular one made me snap. Maybe it was insecurity over my grotesque body or the irony that she was the one who made my existence so burdensome. The more I reflect, the more I have come to realize that it didn't have anything to do with her exact phrasing- the heart can only withstand so much. Once I felt that dam break, the emotions were visceral and momentarily all consuming. I fought the urge to make her pay for the life that was stripped from me, for turning me, a once proud father and community member, into the hapless sidekick to a malevolent abuser. I will never forget that fire, nor the look of ferocity that overtook my normally placid eyes which caused even the witch to take pause.

Her own fright, brief as a spark from a fire, immediately chilled the raw wrath that was unearthed inside me. What replaced it was not fear of her response nor disgust at my own darkness; just apathy. I turned then, grabbing the sack which contained my three measly belongings and turned for the door. The women would not let me go easy, first it was belittling mockery which turned to threats after realizing how serious my intent was. Vile black magic, dark voodoo, and a panacea of poisons were all promised but we both knew there was no teeth behind her words. Her magic only worked on the willing and, even now, I do not regret my original contract. She promised my daughter a happy and healthy life- one that would have been impossible without magical interreference. I watched from decades of her life from the shadows, my daughter's joy replacing my own. At first I had hopes that after a decade or two of dedicated service, the witch would uphold her end of the deal and remove my malady but there was already a catch. For 60 years I tried to be the best servant I could be but there was always be some type of imperfection. A cauldron not scrubbed or an ingredient gone spoiled had me back to a fully renewed contract. Eventually, my daughter passed away peacefully from old age while the witch and I stood motionless in time. I don't know how long I have lived as the locations and moments passed by fleetingly when I lost my joy.

Now, the world is more tolerant of those who looked different. Children still stare but people treat me with kindness which has helped me branch out into the world. I know my path will cross with the witch again, I feel it instinctually, but, for now, I have a daughter's legacy to honor and an epoch's worth of bad deeds to make up for.",82
1lk2jzm,mzpffvm,"I slam the door and stomp off, pleased with myself. No I begin to chuckle. I am feeling happy and in control of my own destiny, finally. 

I hold myself straighter. I begin to strut , maybe even a little swagger in my stride. My head held high. Chin up to the sky. 

“Ooff”, I hit the ground hard. “Darn rock “, I say as I pick myself up off the ground. I better watch where I am walking. 

I glance around. Good nobody saw that. “If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?” I ask the world around? 

I listen a moment. Thinking right no body saw nothing. I continue on my way.  But I watch for obstacles in my path this time. 

“Splatt “ I reach up something wet and gooey is on my head. “Squawk “ I see a giant owl circling overhead the obvious culprit. “You Darn Bird “ I yell while shaking my dirty fist at it. “Who who who”  it whoots at me as if laughing. 

I break into a run. Trying to get away from my aerial assassin. 

I reach a road. There are plenty of horse and oxe drawn wagons, just ahead is a royal guard checkpoint. 

I look up I see no sign of the owl. Good. 

I make my way up the line of people , animals and wagons, waiting at the checkpoint. 

While walking I hear a young boys voice say way too loud, “ Look momma, that man’s got shit on his head!” 
A woman voice replied “you be quiet , little Will, not nice to point out people’s troubles “
Little Will said,”but momma he got shit on his head. Is that what pa
means by shit for brains?”

People around started laughing. 

I picked up my pace and cut off the road looking for somewhere to wash my head off. 

A guard noticed me cut into the trees and followed me. Just as I stopped next to a creek. 

The guard emerged behind me . “Where you going peasant? “

I turned the guard had his spear leveled at me, “ I was just stopping here at the creek sir” 

Guard says “ why are you stopping at the King’s creek? “ 
The guard notices the shit on my head then added “ShitHead”

I pointed at my head saying “I wish to wash and drink fresh water, sir”

The Guard grins, “4 coppers to drink  and bath in the King’s creek, ShitHead!”

I blurted out, “4 coppers, that’s a bit steep. Sir “  
Then I made my big mistake, “what if I give you 1 copper for yourself, and you just say you didn’t see anything?”

He poked me with his spear, “what did you think the 4 coppers were for?”
He continued “ now it will be 1 silver coin or two nights in cell for bribery. Don’t forget you still got to pay your 1 copper to enter the kingdom at the checkpoint!”

I dug around in my coin purse, pulling out a small silver coin handing it to the guard. 

“Thanks ShitHead, be quick about washing, I will walk you to the checkpoint. Got to be sure you are safe from bandits. “

I drank some water, then quickly washed off my head face and hands. 
We walked to the checkpoint without incident. 

I paid a copper coin to a different guard. Who gave me a chunk of wood with an emblem on it. 

The guard said, “don’t lose this. You can be asked at anytime to show it to the city guard. If you don’t have it. You will be arrested. “

I looked closely at the wood and back to the guard, “really?” 

The guard replied “ yes and the king decides, which people arrested get fines, jail time or be headed. “

Another guard says “run along peasant “ 

I stumble forward along the road, thinking maybe I should find another way to go.",25
1lk2jzm,mzqz6tz,"Part 2 
After walking for what seemed like forever. But was really like two fingers of sun travel through the sky. With 6 wagons passing me. Including that young boy Will. Who waved and shouted “look momma it’s shit for brains!”

I pulled my hand out of the air. And continued walking, not waving to any more kids. 

Later I arrived at another line of wagons and people stopped outside a large gate to a walled city. There was a squad of guards, milling about, a sergeant and officers talking to people in line. A frilly dressed man followed closely by a blocky guard and a man with a book and writing quill. The tax collector. 

As I get to the front of the line. The officer stops me, “wood chip?” 

I dig out the piece of wood. 

The officer takes it. Says, “1 copper peasant “ holding out his hand. 

I ask “another copper? I paid for that pass?”

The officer grabs my arm, “you causing trouble peasant? “

The tax man steps over, “the other taxes collected were road and bandit tax. It pays for the roads you walk on and to keep you safe from bandits “ pause “now pay up, or go to jail “ 

I hand over another copper coin. My coin purse feeling lighter the longer I am in this kingdom. 

The officer handed me back the wood chip, with the strange emblem on it.  
Then said, “keep this on you at all times. The city guard can stop you and ask to see your wood chip at any time. The kingdom officers and officials may also stop you to see your wood chip. Before buying anything or renting a room you must show your wood chip. The wood chip is good for 1 week. It can be renewed at any tax collector office. “

I walked through the gate, marveling at how big the city was. 

My stomach rumbled. I have not eaten since leaving witchy house.  I had been mad. I had not thought about anything but getting away from her. 

I wandered this way and that way. I stopped a man passing by. 

“Sir, sir, please sir, is there a market nearby, or an eatery. Perhaps some place for travelers, with but few coin?” I asked 

Looking suspiciously at me “pal follow that wagon it will take you to the center of town. There be market and places to eat. Several churches are also there. “",17

1lk7kpg,mzq3dsg,"""Who is this guy again?"" Indy asked the question aloud to the car. It was a half-rhetorical question, intended to mean ""Who does this guy *think* he is?"" 

Harding answered from the backseat: ""Just some goody two-shoes, works at a boys and girls club or some such."" 

This didn't compute for Indy, who'd been Sonora Gillespie's executive assistant for six years. She'd never dated; never showed an interest. He didn't think much of it. She was a private woman, and for good reason. So, why the change now? What did she see in... 

""What's his name again?"" Indy made eye contact with Harding in the rearview mirror. 

""Hack Deringer.""

""What sort of name is Hack?"" 

""It's short for Haddrick, apparently,"" Harding answered through a mouth of potato chips. 

What sort of name was Haddrick? Where did Harding get those potato chips? The mysteries compounded. 

\------------------------------------------------------------

Dakota walked around the dining room, weaving through empty tables and chairs. She held a rod with a mirror on the end to check beneath each white-linen-and-oil-lacquered surface. 

This place was *nice.* 

Good for Hack, getting himself out there, meeting new people. As Hack Deringer's protege, Dakota watched--with both admiration and concern--as the man lived two lives, worked two jobs, each for the betterment of others. 

There was a time, she confessed to herself, that wanted more from Mr. Deringer. But that feeling faded the closer she drew to him. Hack was 16 years her senior, a charming, suave gentleman who used his personal wealth and time to help others. But he was using all of both, and leaving nothing for himself. Dakota knew that he was tired, broke, and becoming jaded. 

Maybe that explains this rare outing at a fancy restaurant. If tonight goes well, maybe Hack--the helper by day and vigilante by night--would hang up the cape. And then Dakota could start wearing it full-time. 

A noise startled her and she ducked down. 

There were footsteps, at least three pairs. They entered loudly--three men, one chewing gum, another eating from a bag of potato chips. 

""She really rented the whole place, huh?"" One of the men said. 

""You can never be too careful. Ms. Gillespie has a lot of jealous enemies.""

""Who's all in attendance tonight?"" 

""Let's see..."" This man's voice sounded somewhat familiar, though Dakota couldn't place it. ""Ms. Gillespie, Mr. Deringer, and one Dakota Foible."" 

\--------------------------------------------------------------",102
1lk7kpg,mzq3g9w,"What kind of name was Dakota *Foible*? Certainly an alias, but not a very good one. Indy remembered an episode of *Friends* where Phoebe renamed herself something something banana hammock. Was this a banana hammock type of woman? He rubbed his nose, dreading that kind of eccentricity. 

He didn't have to sit with her. He merely needed to sit somewhere he could see everyone in attendance. And he'd get a free meal out of it while earning $63 an hour. Could he really complain? 

Indy sent Harding and the third man in his troop--Beck--to the kitchens, where they would search the kitchen staff and inspect the food prep area for poisons or firearms. 

There was a rustling in the room, and Indy turned quickly to see a tablecloth wave. He moved closer to inspect until he felt the air conditioning kick on and blow cold air into the massive room. Must have been nothing.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Dakota slipped through the front door, moving beneath tables and mere inches from the head goon. He smelled familiar, like gunpowder and whiskey and expensive deodorant. Where did that smell come from? Do they make it in a candle? Could *she* make it in a candle? She'd never made candles before. What kind of deodorant was he wearing? 

She'd be attending the dinner tonight, just as a precaution. She'd see Mr. Whiskey Anti-Perspirant Gun there. She could ask him about his deodorant then, she supposed. 

Dakota went home and started getting ready. She wanted to dress in a way which fit the atmosphere of a five-star restaurant but didn't take the focus off of Hack. Today was a big day for him!

As she shuffled through her wardrobe, she found that everything she had was either vantablack and lethal or some variation of patched denim. She'd need to stop by the Salvation Army on her way up to the restaurant tonight. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------",80
1lk7kpg,mzq3io2,"Indy prepped in the restaurant bathroom. His tuxedo was freshly pressed--he kept at least four ready to go at any one time--and his hair delicately coiffed. 

He appraised himself in the mirror. Tall, neat, clean. The bulge of the gun attached to his hip was barely noticeable beneath the suit jacket. Indy tightened his tie before heading back out to the dining room. 

A man played piano in the corner; his fingers glided softly over the keys, filling the room with a mellifluous harmony. 

Indy had spent the afternoon talking to the man, asking him about his job, if he liked it, what did it pay. He was shocked to find the piano player was paid pennies for performances, though he was delighted by his own thoughts' capacity for on-the-spot alliteration. 

Indy learned that the piano player didn't play *for* the couples dining together, but *with* them, even if they didn't already know it. When their conversation became animated, he would play something more lively. When there was awkwardness between them--or if a conversation was getting boring--he would try to play something familiar, popular. *Don't Stop Believing* worked 99% of the time. 

He had learned to read lips as well, to look out for words like ""death,"" ""sorry,"" ""oh no,"" and ""stock market."" 

""Why 'stock market'?"" Indy had asked. 

""If you're on a date and talking about the stock market, it is not going well,"" the piano man explained. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Dakota entered the restaurant for the second time that day, but this time she was dressed differently and didn't need to hide under tables waiting for the air conditioning to turn on. 

She wore a green dress with boots, white socks, and a denim jacket she found at the thrift store and *could not* leave behind. Someone had embroidered a rainbow butterfly on the back. She wouldn't be able to sleep if she'd left it behind. 

She spotted a tall man in a bowtie wearing a poorly concealed gun on his hip. Hers was stashed securely in her clutch where no one would suspect a thing. 

The man looked her up and down, judging her outfit. Dakota did the same to him, some sort of retaliatory assessment; an affirmative nod with wide, examining eyes. Then he started walking over. He had a strange, intimidating gait that was somehow familiar. 

""You must be Ms. Dakota Foible?"" He said the statement in questions form. 

""Must be,"" she agreed before extending her hand toward him. ""And you are?"" 

""Indy Vaillancourt,"" he took her hand and held it firmly. 

""I...I have so many questions for you."" She was stunned. *Vaillancourt*? What a cool name. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------",68
1lk7kpg,mzq3li7,"Dakota was every bit as eccentric as Indy feared. She wore a blue denim blazer over a green dress with boots that looked like they were designed for war. 

Her hair was cut short, and Indy thought it might have even been crooked. But she was also fit, unable to hide lean muscle beneath the gaudy jacket. She held a clutch that concealed a gun. Classic blunder. Maybe she really was this odd. Or maybe she was acting charming and disarming to try to catch him off guard. 

""Where does your last name come from?"" She asked him. 

""It's French. My parents are Canadian,"" Indy explained. He liked using short sentences to keep the conversation frozen. 

""What does it mean?"" She pressed. 

""It refers to the court of Count William of Ponthieu, a tenth century French noble.""

""That's neat."" 

The song *Don't stop believing*"" began playing behind them. Indy turned around and glared at the piano player, who caught his eyes from a mirror mounted on the instrument.

\--------------------------------------------------------------",66
1lk7kpg,mzq5yrb,"Evening came. Dakota watch Ms. Sonora Gillespie enter, wearing a flowing-yet-form-fitting red gown which accentuated her every curve. A white scarf was draped across her shoulders, and her hair was a tapestry of flowing black curls that bounced as she walked and danced across her exposed, tan back. 

Dakota was severely underdressed. She worried that she was *so* underdressed that she would be accidently drawing everyone's attention. 

Hack entered next, and he looked like he just got off work. He was wearing a tucked in flannel shirt and pair well-worn jeans. He hadn't shaved, but the black-and-grey stubble looked good on his jaw. Maybe he still had a chance. 

The pair met, giving an amicable hug before sitting. Dakota watched from across the restaurant at a table by herself. 

She'd never felt so out of place. Leaping across rooftops and grappling skyscrapers was scary, but never *this* kind of scary. Hack was always getting her into these weird situations.

The French Prince of Gelled Hair--that's what she called the tall guy in the tuxedo with the gun--was sitting in a dark spot at the bar. He watched from the peripheries of his vision, sipping a club soda with a lime in it. 

Hack and Sonora were getting along well, it seemed. Hack had this wide smile and his eyes squinted somewhat when he spoke. She was glad that this was a good experience so far, but some part of her secretly resented him for his happiness. 

She wouldn't want you to get her wrong, she doesn't wish ill on him, and she's certainly not jealous. Hack was like a dad to her. Or, he *should* be like a dad to her. But she never earned that smile. The rows of white teeth were a mask. She thought. Except it looked genuine now, and he even laughed a couple times. 

When it was just Hack and Dakota, things were serious, tense. He gave directions and orders: *flank him from the left, check your weapons, bring a screwdriver, don't kill anyone.* She wanted to make him proud, but she knew it was difficult for him to connect with apprentice after all that's happened. 

She shook her head clear of those meandering thought. How old was she? 12?? No, she was a 24-year-old woman, dammit. 

And she was BORED. 

She headed to the bar.",59
1lk7kpg,mzq7gx5,"What's the game here? What was Sonora doing with a guy like that, who looked like he'd never even worn a suit jacket? 

Far be it from Indy to look down on the working class. Before Sonora snatched him from juvenile hall, he'd been poor as well. Time, luck, and discipline were the gifts Sonora gave him, and he expressed his gratitude in dedication. 

But this guy was like 50. How much time does one need to get their act together and buy a suit for a fancy date? 

Sonora has many powerful allies, leaders of empires, presidents, dictators, CEOs. And so many are eligible bachelors. think of all the good she could do in taking the fortune of some unsuspecting nepo baby bloated to the point of stupidity by their own wealth. She could clean them out.

So what's the angle? What can she get from him?

The very idea that Sonora might be in love ground against everything Indy knew about Sonora. When she had first hired him, she had told him, ""Never get too close to anyone. People take, and people do not give back."" 

She practiced what she preached, too. Indy knew very little about Sonora's personal life, despite spending an upwards of 60 (paid) hours every week with her. She was meticulous and cunning, beautiful and dangerous. 

But a lover she was not. 

As far as Indy knew.

\--------------------------------------------------------------",64
1lk7kpg,mzq7t4d,"Dakota passed the bar. She needed to use the restroom first, otherwise she would forget she needed to use the bathroom while she talked. Then it would be an emergency and she would find herself sprinting--in combat books--toward a bathroom in a five-star restaurant. She didn't need to imagine the embarrassment; she was getting distracted all the time.",63
1lk7kpg,mzqa5h4,"Indy watched Foible move from her seat, cross the periphery of the room, and move behind him. Was this the move? A takedown in the middle of dinner?

He reached into his suit and grabbed his weapon. 

The woman brushed past him and headed to the restroom. 

False alarm. 

Except he watched her go, and her movements were quick; frantic. Had she planted a bomb? No, certainly not, her client was still in the room. Unless...

The situation was too strange. Foible must have been a fake name. And Hack? There was no way these were real names from real people. It smelled fishy, and he needed to investigate. 

Indy followed Dakota to the bathroom. When she closed the door, he held his ear up and listened.

A server passed him, giving him a judging stare. That was probably deserved, seeing a man listening intently to what was happening in a women's restroom. But this was important. 

He heard her humming a song. *Don't stop believing.* Damn but it's catchy.

Suddenly, something sharp pressed into his back and he felt the heat of someone's face close behind him. 

""Are you some kind of pervert?"" Foible--impossibly--asked.",63
1lk7kpg,mzqbok0,"As Dakota skipped to the restroom, she passed the French Prince and immediately sensed him getting up from his stool and quietly following her. To take her out? Maybe. 

She went into the restroom, which was incredible. Each stall was its own room; the sinks were marble with artsy faucets. Even the towels were real, cloth towels. There was a cabinet in there stocked with feminine hygiene products and other odds and ends. She grabbed a fistful and stuffed them into her clutch, which would now barely close.

She looked at the door, and there was a slight gap at the bottom. Dakota could see the guy's feet casting a shadow. He was waiting for her to exit, for her to run right into him so he could make quick and quiet work of her. 

She took out her phone and played a recording of herself humming the song she'd heard outside. She couldn't remember any of the words, or even the name of the song, and it was driving her nuts. She made the recording to send to a friend to see if the friend could identify it. 

She placed the phone in a stall on top of a toilet so that the reverberating echoes and muffled audio quality would give the recoding a little more believability.

Dakota then climbed out of a tall window and went around the back of the restaurant, pulling a small dagger from the sleeve of her new denim butterfly jacket. 

She moved swiftly through the kitchen, where she heard the server telling the chef, ""some weirdo is spying on the women's bathroom."" 

Dakota saw him from the nearby kitchen door and moved behind him, pressing the dagger into his back.

""Are you some kind of pervert?""",62
1lk7kpg,mzqd4ns,"Indy put his hands up and forced out a chuckle. ""I'm just the security guy,"" he answered. 

""Is it normal for security guys to listen to ladies pee?"" 

""Nothing about my job is normal. I have to assess all threats."" 

He slowly started turning around, quietly taking fast, shallow breaths through his nose. In a single move, he spun, knocking the dagger from Dakota's hands and throwing a fist toward her face. 

She ducked, caught the dagger with her left hand and drove a fist toward his stomach.

But he dodged to the side and threw his knee toward her face, which she grabbed and continued its momentum upward.

But he followed the momentum and flipped in the air backwards, landing almost silently in the hallway. When he looked up, Dakota had a gun aimed at him and there were tampons all over the floor. 

He, too, had retrieved his gun mid-flip and had it aimed in her direction. 

Uncanny. Unbelievable. ""You? The girl in black?"" 

Dakota's head tilted, mulling over the voice, the moves, the smell. ""Helmet guy?""",75
1lkqkon,mztydp0,"""Both."" I say.  
The dude freezes.  
""Both?"" he asks.  
""Both."" I say.  
""Y-You do know that one would destroy us, the other would save both of our people, right?"" he asks.  
""Both."" I say again.  
He face palms.

  
""Look. You have been chosen randomly to solve this conflict.  
But pressing both isn't an option."" he says.  
I point at the 2 buttons in front of me.  
""Why not?   
They are here."" I say.  
""It is not possible because..."" he starts.  
I slam my hand on both buttons.  
Alarms start to blare, as the dude goes pale as hell.  
It is funny.

  
""YOU! DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST DID?!"" he shakes me.  
""Pressed the buttons.  
Both."" I smile.  
""ONE OF THEM SENDS ALL THE NUKES OF THE EMPIRE INTO THE SKIES!"" he roars.  
""Cool. Fireworks."" I say.  
""THE OTHER DEACTIVATES ALL NUKES FOREVER!"" he says.  
I am confused.  
""Doesn't this mean nothing happens?"" I ask.  
He face-palms.

  
""The launch happens faster, because the deactivation sequence needs to be sent, and received...  
This means the nukes will be deactivated most likely mid-air."" he says.  
""So no boom?"" I ask.  
""Yes boom, because when they fall, they will still explode due to the impact.  
So, congratulations, you killed us all."" he says.  
""Thanks."" I smile.  
He freezes.  
""Y-You..."" he starts.  
""You idiots started a war ages ago, and didn't want to stop it.  
Well. I just did."" I smile, leaning back.  
Whatever happens, happens.  
Can't be worse than a war torn planet, where you have to kill for a piece of bread.",14
1lkgscr,mzrtxeg,"Desolation, I have seen this before, many times before. The waking hours on a battle field anointed in blood, soldiers asleep in the tree lines, in muddy ditches, or sequestered in their steel tanks. Quiet, the calm before the hypothetical storm, a sort of deafening quiet. 

Humanity has always had disposition for killing themselves, in the early days, it used to be that members of my race had to hunt our prey, stalking in the shadows, just beyond the illumination of a street lamp or fire, and then as soon as we appeared, we would attack and scurry away, like rats, until another evening. In the recent era, Two world wars, many armed conflicts, the militarization of police and the seemingly fashionable nature of “facisim”. An seemingly endless draught of blood at every corner, albeit sometimes colder then preferred. 

Now a new contender vies for our spot atop the food chain, a resource driven hunger, never weary. A collective child of mankind. AI machines race across the battle fields unaffected by any loss, no need for morale, just cold calculated cunning. Despite this they rarely notice us. 

We have become scavengers in a land where once we were gypsies in a palace. Drinking dry what little remains of humanity and of what they unknowingly leave behind for us to drink.",7
1lk4xdj,mzovtme,"I chuckle.  
""Sorry mate, didn't mean it like that.  
I meant it, as in: ""you are a cheapskate and you bought it with your own money, how come you are offering it to me?  
When usually you calculate down do percentage what each of us has to pay for.""."" I say.  
He stares at me, and rolls his eyes.  
""It is good.  
Wanted you to have it."" he says.  
I take, it and thank him.

  
After being done, I start washing the dishes, as he takes out the garbage.  
When he is back, I can't contain my curiosity.  
""Does it happen a lot? People assuming you are greedy because you are a greed demon?"" I ask.  
""Kind of.  
I consume greed, and revel in it, doesn't mean I have to be greedy, nor does it mean that IF I am greedy, I have to be greedy 24/7, like the exaggerated versions in the novels."" he says.  
""Is it that bad?"" I ask.  
He sighs, nods, and sits down at the kitchen table.  
I finish washing the dishes, take out 2 beers, and sit across of him.

  
""Thanks.  
Well, you know how annoying it is that people assume they know my entire being, because of one trait?  
As if me being a Greed demon is all that it is to me."" he sighs, taking a sip of the cold bear.  
""I see. That could be annoying.  
They don't even know your OCD, or the fact that you collect Doctor Who merch."" I say, chuckling, as he arranges the coaster perfectly.  
""Exactly.  
Or that Wrath demons are always angry, or that Pride demons always underestimate others, or that Lust demons are constantly humping or wanting to hump."" he nods.  
I sigh.

  
""Sorry, if I upset you."" I say.  
He waves it off.  
""Nah, it is alright, after all, it is a common misconception.  
And your greed gives me quite a good reward, so we are even."" he smiles.  
I laugh.  
""Yeah. Greed is a vast concept...I am getting my what now? 5th diploma? And I have just signed us up for a Lego building contest."" I say.  
He groans.  
""Again? Man, I know I just said I like your greed, but tone it down with this desire for achievements, and winning.  
You are getting worse than a Pride demon."" he says.  
I chuckle, because despite all his complaints...he never says no to joining me in a contest, or a volunteering activity, or anything to be honest.  
Demon or not, I lucked out with him being my roommate.",52
1lk4xdj,mzqhy75,"That day Greed offered me the last of their leftovers was the day I learnt, even demons have off-duty personas. It's a job just like any other. If you don't consider goading on the greed inherent in humans, or feeding on the sin of greed, a weird occupation.

If anything, Greed told me they're so stuffed from all the greed in the world, they can't even finish a pizza after knocking off from work. Which is why they kept handing their leftovers to me.

""Haven't you had enough of taking their leftovers? Don't you have any pride in yourself?"" Pride shouted, before pausing as their expression softened. ""Oh, you know what, sorry. Occupational hazard,"" they said, crashing into the couch. ""I'm just mad from hanging out with these conceited humans who show off and won't shut up.""

""I get it,"" I replied. ""It's tough being you seven.""

""It's not so bad being me,"" Sloth responded, still lying flat on the floor. ""I get paid in souls to laze around and make mortals laze around too.""

""He's the only one who is exactly the same on the job, and off the clock,"" Lust sighed, curling up on the floor in an unflattering, oversized shirt she wore as pajamas. ""Which reminds me, Greed. Didn't you use to fob off your excess food to Gluttony?""

""I did, but they've since gone off to mooch from some rich dude who feeds them better than me. So, this human will do.""

""Is nobody envious of that fat fuck?"" Envy snorted.

Lust rolled her eyes. ""Envy, we're all off-duty at home. Don't start now.""

""Or what, is Wrath gonna get mad?"" Envy teased.

""I have no energy to roar in your face,"" Wrath muttered. ""Being angry all the time is bad for health, that's what my doctor said. So, I'm trying to stay calm after work. This is the only time I don't have to be a raging asshole.""

""You lot are all really chill for the Seven Deadly Sins,"" I couldn't help but mention.

""Six, if only because Gluttony left us to live with their sugar daddy. Also, we're chill because you're a good roommate. That, and we do want to relax after a long day at work,"" Wrath replied. ""Trust me, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.""

1lkdwxa,mzs7y2b,"An involuntary smile spreads across my tired face as I watch my beautiful daughter spin in her new dress. At just six years old she is everything I could have dreamed she would be. ""So you like the new dress?"" I ask.

Evelyn stops twirling and steadies herself, then grins at me. ""Oh yes, daddy!"" she declares, looking down at the waving fabric and smoothing it down with her dainty fingers. ""I love it!""

""Good,"" I say, my mind making a note to thank the tailor. Then I think twice and wince. No, I certainly cannot thank the tailor. I sigh.

As though reading my mind, Evelyn approaches the throne and puts a hand on my forearm. ""Why does everyone hate you so?"" Her sweet little voice wasn't meant to carry such heavy words as hate, or such biting questions as these.

I shake my head and try to smile, holding back tears. ""Because I am king,"" I say.

She gazes into my eyes, turning my words over in her mind. After a moment of careful reflection, she says, ""but it wasn't always so.""

I laugh and scoop her up under the armpits to heave her onto my lap, surprised at how big she is. ""Aye, it wasn't always so,"" I agree. I wrap my arms around her tightly and sigh, pressing my cheek into the crown of her head.

""Oof,"" Evelyn grunts against my squeeze and squirms playfully. I wriggle my fingers in her gut until her laughter fills the empty throne room, echoing off the polished marble and gilded oak. The late afternoon sun pours in through high windows and bathes the eastern wall in sweet warmth. Royal tapestries hang with regal dignity in the honey glazed lighting, expertly stitched with glorious scenes depicting the many victories of our kingdom from the last several hundred years that my bloodline occupied the throne.

I stop tickling my little princess and hold her tight again while she screeches and flails, slowly fizzling out until at last she takes a deep, shuddering breath and exhales dramatically. ""Daddy,"" she sighs. ""If everyone liked you before when you were king, why can't they like you now when you are king?""

I chuckle at her perceptiveness. ""You are a clever princess,"" I moan, leaning to the side to sneer playfully into her eyes.

She sneers back, wrinkling her button nose and squinting her eyes.

I take a deep breath, pausing to think. ""Sometimes,"" I begin, unsure of how much of the truth she can handle, ""a king must do what is best for the people even if it means they despise him."" I lift and turn her on my lap so we can see each other. ""A wise princess or queen may need to do the same,"" I say, raising my eyebrows.

""But why?"" she asks.

""Your mother,"" I begin, then I choke and swallow. ""The people loved your mother dearly,"" I say. ""And when she passed the people were disheartened. I did everything in my power to invigorate them and bring joy back to the kingdom, but a darkness fell on the heart of every man and every woman in my care. They began to focus more on their work and on their problems. They could no longer look past my flaws. Whispers and rumors circulated that conspirators were planning my assassination.""

""Ass-ass..."" Evelyn furrows her brow. ""Assass-in... nation?""

Sometimes I forget that she is only six and that despite her extensive vocabulary, she doesn't know all of the same words I do. I smile. ""An assassination is what we call it when someone important is murdered.""

Understanding lights up in her eyes. ""And you are important because you are king,"" she says solemnly.

I nod. ""So I gathered my closest, most trusted advisors, and we came up with a plan.""

Evelyn's little lips part but before she can speak I cover her mouth firmly with one hand and put the other to the hilt of my sword. Something has stirred in the throne room. Slowly, I lean left around to peek behind the throne. One of the tapestries is waving as though brought to life by a breeze, but the air is still. I hear a shuffle to my right and whirl around onto my feet just as a knife is plunged into the wood of the throne's high back.

My attacker grabs the knife with both hands and grunts, trying to pry it free of the hard wood. I sigh. ""John?"" I ask. He has just delivered Evelyn's dress not half an hour earlier. ""You would murder me while my young daughter sits upon my lap?""

The tailor gets his feet up on the seat of the throne and groans, pulling hard and wincing. The knife won't budge. At last he gives up, releasing his grip on the handle of the blade and letting his shoulders sink. ""I wasn't going to harm the princess,"" he sighed. ""But I really thought that I might be...""

I interject. ""You think the hero of prophecy would dispatch the king and fulfil his destiny while traumatizing the princess?""

John's head hangs low. He won't look at me. ""No, your highness,"" he whines. ""I suppose that wouldn't be very hero-like.""

""Be gone,"" I grunt, setting the princess down by my side.

""Swiftly, your majesty."" He bows and backs away before quickly turning and shuffling to the large door at the far end of the hall.

I take a step toward the throne and, grasping the knife's handle firmly with one hand, dislodge the blade with one easy, twisting pull.

As John yanks the door open Evelyn calls out, ""thank you for the beautiful dress!""

John pauses and glances quickly back, his eyes wide with wonder. Then he slips out and slams the door closed behind him.

The huge oak thump reverberates around us and I smile down at my daughter, setting the knife on the seat of the throne. ""You will be a wonderful queen someday,"" I say, kneeling to wrap my arms around her.

""And you will yet serve a long many years as king,"" she laughs.",16
1lkc3mx,mzr3uvo,"""You'll never guess what my crazy aunt left me in her will,"" Misty says, holding her cellphone near her mouth. 

""What?"" James asks.

""Her skeleton."" 

James stays silent for a moment. ""You mean like the ones they use in med classes?"" 

""No, I mean like her actual fucking skeleton. Apparently, she got into some weird shit before she died."" 

""Weird how?"" 

""Well, my Mom said that she joined this cult and--."" 

Glass shatters in an adjacent room, causing Misty's head to snap towards the sound. ""Did you hear that?"" 

""The only thing I heard was that apparently, you have a human skeleton in your house."" 

""Stop, I'm being serious. I think someone may have broken in,"" Misty says as her hand begins to tremble. ""I should go check it out."" 

""Wo, wo, Misty, hold on. This is exactly how girls always die in horror movies."" 

""Well, I can't just cower in my room. I don't have anywhere to hide."" 

""Hang up and call the police."" 

""It might have just been the cat knocking something over, though."" 

James sighs. ""Alright, but at least bring a weapon with you."" 

Misty reaches into her nightstand, pulls out her pocket knife, and flips the blade out. ""Alright, I've got my knife,"" she whispers. ""Leaving the bedroom now."" She places her hand on the door and opens it slowly, then walks into the hallway, her heart pounding in her ears. 

James whispers, ""Do you see anythi--?""   

Misty shushes James and slides the phone into her back pocket. 

More glass shatters.

Misty freezes in place. *That was in the living room,* she thinks. *If I wait around the corner in the kitchen, they'll never see me coming.* She positions herself in the kitchen, peers around the corner, and sees a dark silhouette, about five feet tall, standing directly in front of her TV. *Shit, there really is someone here. I'd better call the cops.* 

Misty grabs her phone from her pocket and taps the screen, but it stays black. *Oh, no, no, no. It can't be dead now.* She forcefully pushes the screen several more times, until her hand slips and the phone clatters against the ground, echoing through the silent house. *Shit.* She peers around the corner and sees that the silhouette is gone. 

*Maybe I can make it back to my room and get it charged up quick,* Misty thinks as she leans forward and grabs the phone. A sudden chill overtakes her body as she realizes something is standing behind her. She turns around and thrusts her knife into the would-be assailant's rib cage, but the knife ricochets off bone and bounces off the floor.",10
1lkc3mx,mzr3vt1,"Misty looks up at the assailant, and her eyes grow wide. ""Aunt Jeanie?""

A skeleton silently stares back, holding out its bony hand.

Misty grabs the hand, and it pulls her to her feet. She walks over to a light switch and flips it on. ""Aunt Jeanie, is that really you?""

The skeleton's mouth opens, but no words come out.

""Give me a second, I have an idea,"" Misty says as she runs into her office, grabs a pen and some paper, and brings them back to the skeleton. ""Can you write?""

The skeleton nods, grabs the pen from Misty's hand, and writes, ""Yes, it is Aunt Jeanie.""

""That's crazy. How are you... is alive the word for it?""

Jeanie writes, ""Before I died, I joined the Cult of Everlasting Life. They said if I drank from the Cup of God, I would live forever. Which is why I left you my skeleton in the will.""

Misty's eyes narrow. ""I'm not sure I follow.""

""Well, if I'm the black sheep of the family, you're the grey one,"" Jeanie writes. ""And with your interest in the occult, I thought you'd have the easiest time accepting a living skeleton.""

""That makes sense. But what do you want me to do with you now?""

""I can't really go out in public, so I was hoping I could hang out here for a while. I could do the cooking and the cleaning.""

""My own maid, hmm? That is tempt--.""

A knock at the door causes Misty to yelp.

""Is everything alright in there? It's the police.""

""Shit, you need to hide."" Misty pushes her Aunt's skeleton into the living room. ""Stay here.""

Aunt Jeanie nods.

Misty walks over to the door and opens it. ""Evening, Officer. What can I help you with?""

""We got a call from someone named James. He was worried you might have an intruder in the house.""

Misty titters. ""Intruder? It's just me here. And everything is A-OK.""

The Officer's brows furrow. ""Are you sure? You're acting kind of odd.""

""Nope, I'm fine. Is there anyth--?""

The officer grabs Misty and pulls her to the ground. ""Stay down, I just saw someone move."" He stands and runs into the house.

Misty can feel her heart pounding in her ears. *Shit, now what?*

There's a sudden crashing sound, followed by a thud.

Misty jumps to her feet, runs to the living room, and sees the Officer lying unconscious in a pool of his blood. Aunt Jeanie's skeleton is standing over him.

Misty screams. ""What did you do?""

Aunt Jeanie grabs a piece of paper, writes something down, and hands it to Misty. It says, ""I was protecting you. I'll always protect you.""

""H-hey...dad."" she says, collapsing.  
I flash forward, and catch her.  
What happened to her? What is going on?  
I flash upstairs, and put her into one of the guest rooms of my training hall.  
""I will be back."" I say, flashing downstairs, and making sure the doors are closed.  
Then I go upstairs...to...to my daughter.

  
I dress her wounds, and dress her up in a pajama, as I put her in bed.  
I shiver, as memories of me doing this when she was young came back.  
The days before... Before she left.  
I watch over her the entire night, ignoring the calls of the royal patrol, mages, and knights outside.  
They can't enter an Imperial Training Hall without cause anyway.  
Her breathing is stable, and her wounds are visibly healing.  
My daughter...she is strong.

  
""D-dad?"" she mutters, waking up.  
""How are you? Does it hurt anywhere? Hidden injuries are the most dangerous kind, and was poisoned used? And..."" I start, but she starts laughing.  
""You haven't changed a bit."" she smiles.

I clench my fists, as space shivers around me.

I nod, and leave her to rest, then send letters to some of my pupils that I know are not that happy with the current leadership. They might be needed, because I know my daughter.  
When she does something, she goes big, and I doubt the imperials will give up on searching for her.",88
1lk63ed,mzq6wr0,"Do not shy away from discipline.     
           
Do not flinch from pain.       
        
ENDURE! My son!         
       
You must endure!     
       
Such is the nature of Men. Stern. Powerful. Fearless. Unyielding.           
           
Crane! Dragon! Mantis! Tiger! Wolf! Crow! Snake!       
                 
We go through the various forms, one after another, here in the Great Hall. The elder monk sits on the floor, observing all. From the novice's misplaced foot, to the master's slight slackening of his fist, nothing escapes the elder monk's gaze.     
      
So it was no surprise when he saw the newcomer stumble into the hall first of all of us. He stood up calmly and directed our attention. Picture, if you will, fifty bare chested men, their muscles dripping with perspiration, turning their heads as one and running in perfect formation towards the stranger.         
           
""Hail!"" I grasp the cloaked stranger as they nearly fall. ""Well met! Or so I would say, were your condition not so grievous! Ill met, then! Yet, should you require assistance, we monks of the Temple of Man, must render it to you, for it is a tenet of Manhood to do so!""       
              
""...d- do you all... talk... this way?"" I bent my head down to listen to the hushed voice coming from that hooded head.      
             
""Of course!"" My brother, Len Wen rushed over to help me carry our unsteady guest to one of the stone benches. ""We speak as befits Men, so as to leave no misunderstanding and make clear our intentions! That we are eloquent besides, comes from years of studying poetry and the Great Works in addition to our sacred monastic rituals and of course, Kungfu.""      
          
""K-kungfu..!"" The stranger seemed to revive momentarily with a second wind.      
          
I smiled as Brother Len and I set the stranger down on the bench. ""You know of us. Then, you seek our strength?""       
           
""The *people* require your strength!"" As our guest struggled to get up, their hood fell from their face. ""Please help me!""             
             
Fifty men. A hundred eyes. All stared openly at the newcomer's face. Soft. Fair. Lips that pouted. Eyes that glimmered. A touch of crimson on the cheeks. Unbelievably, a panicked murmur began to rise amongst my disciplined brothers.       
         
""W-what is that!?"" Brother Ping pointed, taking a step back.      
          
""Judging from the shape of its face, it might be a fox spirit!"" Another warned. ""Beware, brothers, lest it enchant you!""     
            
""I... I think I have already fallen under this fox's spell... "" Brother Len stood, clutching his chest, his expression as of one in great pain. ""My heart quickens, and my face is heated as if I were struck with a closed fist!""        
           
My brave, dauntless brothers began running around helplessly, covering their eyes and ears, some striking their groins fiercely for some reason or another.            

""I think that is a WymMan. Or something like that."" Another monk observed. ""It is similar to a smaller, more lumpy Man.""    
          
We monks didn't go out much.          
           
""I know what a Woman is,"" I lied as I was forced to help the stranger once more when her strength gave out again. I noticed flecks of blood on her clothing and nodded affirmatively. ""Fear not, brothers. I am well versed in the subject. Observe how she bleeds. A woman's body follows the cycle of the moon- ""      
          
""I'm w-wounded, you.... you.... you dumb motherfucker holy fuck."" The woman ripped open her cloak to reveal a thoroughly blood soaked bandage crudely wrapped just beneath her ribcage.    
     
""... and their mood suffers much as a result,"" I continued my explanation, before realizing the true nature of the bleeding. ""My word! You are wounded!""      
           
""NNNNNGGGGHHHHH!"" The woman let out a strangled sound, as if she were restraining herself from saying something quite terrible, then passed out from the strain. And the blood loss presumably.       
            
Fortunately, the elder monk helped us to settle down and went about treating the woman (Wing, as she told us later).      
          
Later, we had to fight an army, but that was a lot simpler of an affair, believe me you.",29
1lkk8wd,mzta3j4,"“Benny for God’s sake will you pull over?  I can see the bags forming under your eyes.”

“I don’t want to pull over, Martha, we’re making good time.”

“Good time?” said Matha, “You want to pull into my sister’s place at three in the morning?  You know she doesn’t like being up past midnight.  Hey look, here’s a nice hotel lets pull over for the night.”

“Ahh I don’t trust it,” said Benny, “I don’t see any truckers in there.”

“You don’t see any truckers in there,” said Martha as she threw her hands up, “You know why you don’t see any truckers in there?  They’re all out here trying to make money while hopped up on enough speed to drop a rock star.  You’ll be lucky if they don’t-“

BWAAAAAAAAAAH.  A truck horn blares away as an eighteen-wheeler speeds past, missing the car by mere inches.  

“Maybe we should pull over,” said Benny.

“Great idea,” said Martha, “Glad you thought of it.”

In the middle of a black sea of emptiness, the car pulls into a near empty hotel with no sign of life other than a rotating neon sign clearly displaying a vacancy.  Benny climbed out of the car and regarded the colorful spinning sign.

“Motel Inn?” he asked, “Kind of a generic name, don’t you think?”

“I don’t care if it’s the Bates Motel,” said Martha, “As long as they have clean sheets and air conditioning.”

The glass entrance did deliver a nice cool breeze, but somehow it just wasn’t as inviting as the hot sticky summer air outside.  The place was terribly stale like it was hidden away from civilization for thousands of years.  The front desk was a large flat oak with no computer screens or cash register visible anywhere.  Just a sign in book and a single bell.  

Benny rang the bell.  There was no sign of anyone anywhere.  His wife Martha tried looking around, then as their gaze went back to the front desk there was a man behind who appeared out of nowhere.  Almost too thin to be real.  Ghastly sunken eyes and ghostly complexion.  Stands of hair randomly ran down the side of his head.  

“Oh hey, didn’t see you there,” said Benny, “We’d like a room for the night, please.”

Without speaking the man simply turned the book on the front desk to face Benny.  

“Sign in, please.” He said with a deep voice.  

“Oh, great. Sure,” said Benny.

The pen was unusually heavy, but glided easily over the page as he signed it.  For only a moment he noticed the ink had a strange color to it.  He began to stare at how it was reflecting the pale overhead lights when the man suddenly pulled the book away and shut it.  

“Bags?” he asked.  

“Uhm, we’re just going to leave them in the car,” said Benny.

“You sure that’s a good idea?” asked Martha, “What if someone breaks into the car?”

“Who’s going to break in?” asked Benny, “We’re in the middle of nowhere.  There’s literally no one here but us.”

For a moment Benny forgot there was an unusual man standing in front of him as an antiquated room key was held out to him.

“Room 101,” said the man.  

“Oh, great,” said Benny as he took the key, “I guess we won’t have far to walk.”

The man behind the counter, saying nothing, gestured to the direction the room was in, pointing to a hallway.  

“I hope you have clean sheets,” said Martha.

The man nodded politely.  As they found their room, Benny peered down the hallway.  

“Do you remember this place being this big from the outside?” 

The hallway looked as though it went on forever.  No matter how hard he tried, Benny could literally not see the end of it.  

“Laundry probably costs them a bloody fortune,” said Martha as she pushed past and took the room key from her husband, “Unless they just change the sheets from room to room.”  

Martha opened the door as Benny kept staring down the hall, still vainly trying to see where it ended.

“That would take an awful long time, I’ll bet,” said Benny.  

Martha pulled her husband into the room.  Once the door was shut, they were never to be seen by any living soul on earth.  Back at the front desk, the severely gaunt man opened the book to check the signature.  As close as anything to a smile briefly appeared across his face as he held his hand over signature.  The letters lifted off the page and twirled around his fingers in a whisp of smoke, slowly fading away to nothing.",9
1lk1j9a,mzpamyq,"Everything hurt.

Felt like my very bones had been shattered. Though judging by the force at which id been hit, it was likely that at least my ribs had broken. *that* would be a fun conversation with the medics back at HQ. I was always getting in trouble with them  for not trying hard enough to keep herself safe. 

Everyone thought i was weak. I never minded that. Meant i got targeted first, meant they always went for me and my team mates were safer. They never knew it was because every second of every fight was spent keeping my power in check. A single misplaced strike. A thought with a bit too much force behind it and people would die. 

Copper spilt across my tongue as the next blow struck, sending me rocking back against the chair i was tied to. Control. I cautioned myself. The others needed me to keep them distracted here, needed the intel i could gather. Id volunteered for this. Though none of us had expected them to devolve into torture so quickly
 
""You know this can all end. Just tell him what he wants to know"" the 'good cop' in this situation told me as his compatriot cleaned blood off his knuckles.  Slow easy breathing. This wasnt the worst id been hurt, and the footage I was collecting would bring this entire organisation to its knees. 

I rasped out a laugh, surprisingly soft in the room. No answer would stop this. Even if i had been inclined to tell them, theyd never accept it as the truth. ""And spoil."" I paused to run my tongue over my teeth, testing to make sure none of them were loose, ""all this lovely fun we're having? For shame.""
Bad cop smiled, a flash of a smirk at the edges of his lips. ""See at least fists mcgee here has a sense of humour""

""You think this is funny?"" Good cop said, his voice light. ""Your team left you here to die.""
I shrugged, as much as i could, ""i dont think im hero material really.""

A subtle tenseness to his jaw. Frustration. That was satisfying at least.

And then i got a message over the emergency neural link. 

*ORACLE HAS BEEN CAPTURED.* 

My heart gave a strange lurch. Not him. Not my...not oracle. He didnt have the physical strength to stand up to what theyd been putting me through. Chronically ill, but an exceptionally powerful portalmancer. When he had the space to work. No. They werent allowed to hurt him. I...the team needed him. 

My eyes closed. The pendulum swung.
Once.
Twice.
A long slow breath left me, before i opened my eyes with new confidence. Bloody and beaten. But not broken. They should have taken more precautions. They should have activated the neural dampeners. But they thought my power was in the sword currently contained in the glowing box undergoing tests. 
Fools.

""Where have you taken oracle.""
My voice was dark. Empty. Nothing like the jovial tones of before. It surprised both of them. Though they tried to surpress their surprise.
""How did you?...ah a psychic on the team. Well. Maybe if youre good i'll tell you."" Good cop smirked. 

Two threats. But i only needed one. 

""Did you know"" i started as bad cop made his way over to me, ""there are two hundred and six bones in the human body.""

He laughed, ""and ill break all of em before im done""

I looked up at him, ""no. You wont.""

That fist inside me, the fingers i kept wrapped around my power constantly, relaxed. And i chose my target well. Tiny bones first. Interlocking joints. The change is quick, sharp. Impaling through the bone and severing nerves in a sudden burst of agony. 

He screamed, stumbling back, body suddenly revolting in agony of newly sundered parts. 

""Smaller bones are easier to change. Lock down joints. Ultimately reversible, with some long term aches and pains.""  I continued. A sword slipping from my skin and slicing through my restraints. ""But i can change larger ones.""

Good cop went to rise, to shout the alarm. I glanced at him. ""Your teeth are bones. Would to learn what it feels like to feel them change one by one?""

That made him freeze in place. "" but you... youre the""

"" the weakest. By choice. At first it was just my own bones i could turn. They grew back. But it hurt. And then my range grew. And grew. And grew. Ideally no one would ever know.""
I stood up, cold and calm.
""Now you can end this. Tell me what i want to know, and you and your buddy get to become the least important people in the world to me.""
I paused then, ""or you can stand between me and my oracle. Not a wise choice.""

They both looked at me. Determined. As if that mattered. As if they could withstand the hell that was about to descend upon them. 
I shrugged. Id spent a very, very long time trying to be good. Trying to be civil. But oracle was the one person i cared about more than anything. I would burn the world to get him back.

A few screaming mortals was a trade i was more than willing to make.",178
1lk1j9a,mzoabyh,"I struggle to defeat one of the villains with my swordsmanship.  
The others smile, and help me out.  
""Come, Sword Girl, I will treat you to some ice-cream."" the captain says, as they all fly away.  
I follow on my sword.  
It is a bit upsetting, that I am considered the weakest in my team.  
If only they knew...  
That I can transform anything into a sword.

  
After the ice-cream, we had another call.  
A villain group attacked a governmental facility.  
When we arrive, there are at least a hundred villains waiting for us.  
""You don't get to stop the boss this time."" they roar, attacking us.  
The fight is miserable.  
I watch as we defeat them one by one, but they are too many.  
Soon, we start to tire out.  
And I am almost the first to die.

  
""Agh!"" the captain roars, taking an ice-blast for me.  
""Captain!"" I shout, catching him.  
""Run! They are too many! This was bad intel!"" he says to me.  
I sigh.  
""What now, little girl? Want to play with our ""swords""?"" the villain grin as they push back the other members towards the captain and me.  
""I am sorry."" I mutter.  
Before the captain could say anything, screams echo beautifully, as blood blossoms around us.  
The villains' left hands turned into swords, and flew out towards me.  
All the villains collapse.

  
""S-Sword girl?"" Captain stutters.  
I focus on the facility, from where a Titan form steps out.  
""You? You stopped my fellow brothers?  
Heh...too late though, I succeeded in awakening my power for the 4th time, now, I am invincible!"" it roars as it takes a step towards us. The ground shakes.  
My teammates launch attacks at the villain, but he is too big.  
""Sword."" I mutter, as its left leg turns into a sword, and it collapses.  
My team stares at me incredulously.  
""S-sorry... It is dangerous, and hard to control...and...and..."" I stutter.  
""THAT WAS AWESOME!"" they shout, hugging me.  
I freeze.  
""You aren't mad?"" I ask.  
They laugh, and shrug it off, as if it isn't a big deal, then start teasing the Captain for having the hots for me.  
I blush...and as we fly away, I feel warm...I am lucky to be in this team.",63
1lkhllw,mzs1vee,"M'orgoth the Undying stood in his fortress, the mighty bastion of the undead that had taken him over a millennia to create, in utter disbelief.  The impetrative stone wall was in ruins, the debris crushing a great deal of his raised forces.  The outer wall of the castle was in a similar state with even more of his minions buried in the rubble.  He strode forward, cataloguing the damage to his home, noting that only a few of his skeletal warriors remained, but not a single one of them were complete.  Missing arms, cracked ribs and one missing both legs were among those who were left.  As he entered the castle, the destruction continued, as if a large boulder had rolled unimpeded through his very soul.  The throne room was in shambles, most of the bone pillars ground to dust, and the hidden door to his treasury ripped from their hinges.  If he had still been alive, M'orgoth would've swallowed hard as he entered the vault that once held the bulk of his riches.

Not a single treasure remained.  Only a few scattered copper pieces were evidence that he had once been among the wealthiest of all undead lords that still walked the mortal realm.  A cold feeling ran down his spine, a feeling so alien to him since turning into a lich, and it shocked him.  Someone was handling his phylactery, the hidden container for his soul, at this very moment.  His glowing eyes narrowed, head automatically turning to the direction of the spiritual affront. As his incredible magic began welling into his hands, his eyes noticed the telltale signs of claw marks on the walls and floor of the treasury.  These could only be the work of a dragon, one in search of treasure to fill its own hoard.  Seething anger gripped the lich as he silently vowed a revenge most terrible.

It took M'orgoth weeks to travel to the lair of the dragon, most of that time spent triangulating the exact location  based on his phylactery.  The single mountain lacked the majesty of a full range, but it was imposing, at least to someone who still felt fear.  His stride was purposeful and full of rage.  He was still muttering about the depths of pain this dragon would feel before he ended it, perhaps to raise it as part of his new undead army. The entrance to the lair was plain and unmarked, but M'orgoth could sense that the space inside was vast.

In the hours it took for the lich to travel deeper into the mountain, it only made his unrelenting rage grow by leaps and bounds.  There were protocols to be followed when raiding a fortress.  How the dragon missed the clear signs of habitation of his kingdom were beyond the undead lord.  He turned a corner, and there laid out before him, was a dragon's hoard.  He spotting a few items, a statue here and a chest there, that were clearly from his raided vault.  Gathering his necrotic magic, M'orgoth strode into the chamber ready for battle. He was ready to relinquish much of his riches, but the phylactery and a few choice items were to be reclaimed at all costs.

After making his way among the piles of gold and magical items, M'orgoth finally came upon the scaly thief, the object of his rage. The dragon lay upon a pile of gold, bars and coins, with a marble bust of an unknown nobleman clutched between its talons like a child's teddy bear.  The lich narrowed its eyes, at last seeing the phylactery in person since the robbery. He knew he had to tread carefully here, for if the dragon knew what it held and obliterated it, M'orgoth would face permanent death without a place for his soul to retreat if his physical body were destroyed.  The lich prepared his most powerful killing spell, hoping to end the dragon in a single moment of magic.  Just as he was about to utter to words, the eyes of the dragon snapped open, baleful and full of ire at the thought of an intruder.",13
1lk5yw1,mzpddkj,"The ground trembled, then it shook, and finally it broke. The council watched from their high vantage point as the mountain ground the greatest settlement of men into fine dust as it casually strolled through it. Rocks the size of cattle dropped off it as it walked. A piece of the earth, walking! Such a thing hadn't been seen in living memory.       
       
""The mother of my mother's mother had told a story of this,"" The eldest sage shook his wizened head sadly. ""Only if we had heeded her words... but all was lost to time.""       
          
""Fickle is the memory of Man."" The second eldest concurred.            
            
""Someone should write that shit down."" I said, as I sipped on some apple juice.      
       
The Elder Council all turned as one to look at me. One smacked a fist to his palm, enlightenment in his eyes. A grand system of symbols attached with meanings was made and taught to the general populace.       
         
Years later, a grand sign counting down the summers before the mountain's awakening, was set up. Many people were grateful to me in particular, as the sages had let it be known that it was I who gave the initial idea. However, they had never asked me my name, so they made one up.        
         
""Thank you,"" The people would tell me. ""Apple Fucker.""     
         
""I don't fuck apples."" I would reply.

1lk5yw1,mzpgg57,"My brother and his friends made it clear the whole climb up the winding trail that I was there as the cameraman. I had no problem with this. They were finally including me in their group, even if it was a stupid game they were playing.

After all, mountains can't move.

The tale of the living mountain is the biggest urban legend in our area. It's unique, I'll give it that. We have more than our fair share of spook-fanatics, supernatural enthusiasts, coming to our town every holiday season. Just about every creepy folklore podcast has done an episode on the legend. Lots of locals have been swept up in the craze too; whether they actually believe it or are just along for the fad is anyone's guess.

My brother fit into the first category. He's obsessed with urban legends and horror. No, obsessed doesn't begin to cover it. He follows every spooky podcast and owns signed merch. He has a scrapbook of newspaper printouts that are shrouded in as much fiction as fact.

His friends are split down the middle. Some are 'true believers'; some just don't want to be left out.

As for me, I'll believe in the Bigfoot before I believe in a living mountain. I mean, the science just wouldn't work. Nothing alive that big could exist; it would crush itself under its own body weight. That's what I read online.

After a long hike up the gravel-n-dirt path, we found ourselves, red-faced and coated in sweat, at the lookout. My brother told me to get the camera running, and stand somewhere I could get a shot of them and the mountain range behind. I end up climbing a tree. I am the dumb cameraman, after all, so if I break a bone, that's his fault.

We were up there for a couple of hours. Having exhausted their stock of fooling and joking around, an argument slowly started to break out. Some were suggesting they'd got the date and time wrong. Those who weren't committed thought they'd wasted enough time here. It was an argument that turned nasty all too quickly.

I continued to film even as my brother got in a shoving match with his best friend that took them right to the edge of the lookout. Some of the best cinema I had got for a long time. Of course, it was nothing compared to what happened next.",13
1lk5yw1,mzpgh77,"It began with silence. Aside from the angry shouts, a bizarre quiet had settled over the entire mountainside; bird, beast, and nature holding their breath.

I had barely noticed the flight of sound when I was jolted in my perch, almost losing my grip on both the camera and the tree branch. As I fought to regain balance, something whizzed past my head, and I looked up to see a rock the size of a football hurtling on down the mountain. Then a storm descended. More boulders flew past, skipping and rolling like spilt marbles, some even striking my tree.

My brother's friends were in a panic, but he was standing tall. The wild glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes turned the sweat on my back clammy. He shouted to me and pointed away from the lookout, miming a video camera. For whatever stupid reason, I chose to obey him, and aimed the camera toward the sight that sent my jaw dropping.

Mountains can't move. But this one was.

Like a buried person at the beach, slowly and lazily rising up while the sand rains off them in an unending curtain. Except this curtain was made of boulders the size of cars. I could hardly believe what I was recording. The mountain was not just lifting up; it was moving forward, down the valley and to the open plains below.

Then a rock struck my tree in the middle of the trunk, snapping it like my bones would when I hit the ground seconds later.

I woke up in hospital with enough injuries to ruin my parent's savings. My brother had snatched up the camera to keep filming the migrating hill; it was his friends who pulled me out of danger.

Official story? An earthquake and a severe avalanche wiped an entire mountain off the map.

My brother hid the recording from the police. He showed it to me the day I got out of hospital, still with that wild satisfaction. I hated him then, more than ever in my life.

But he'd been right. I know what I saw on that lookout. An avalanche could never explain that away.",19
1lk5yw1,mzpi474,"Great story! Really love the build up! I don't know how the US government would be able to cover up a walking mountain xD but it strikes me that it being set in America works well because then it would've only been early colonists and native Americans that could've seen it happen. 

Where if it is set in the old world, there would be significantly more documentation of it.",5

1lk04u1,mzox74s,"""I grow tired of seeing you,"" the goddess sighed upon seeing Yorick again. ""You can't keep getting in serious trouble simply because its...not your time. Yet.""

The man didn't seem to be paying attention. All he did was twiddle his thumbs, waiting to be sent back to the living world. It was already his 37th visit to her domain. A part of him was curious how far he could stretch his functional immortality. Another really enjoyed seeing this beautiful goddess, whoever she was. Getting into all sorts of dangerous adventures he used to fear had opened his eyes to the world too.

Yorick wasn't going to wind down just because she told him to stop. The adrenaline rush wasn't going away. The need for constant excitement could not be sated.

She sensed it too. But there was little she could do besides send him back again. A wave of her hand, and Yorick felt himself floating away from her domain and back to earth. He'd always loved that floaty, flying feeling of the wind beneath his feet. Lifting him up and up and away.

For the first time however, he had a bad feeling, looking at the goddess smirk like she was up to no good.

Not that Yorick would remember after he woke up on earth. Lying flat on a beach, where he had earlier ridden a treacherous wave and was slammed into the waters.

""Dude, you're awake!"" A surfer shouted.

""Yea, yea, I am,"" Yorick brushed himself off and stood up. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a wave to catch!""

""Again? Does he ever learn?"" A bystander blurted out as he grabbed his surfboard and dashed off into the seas again.

Yorick wanted the wind in his hair. The waves below his feet. The thrill of floating like a bee, soaring like bird, all above the roiling seas.

And the seas could not wait to receive him once more.

The same could not be said for the goddess.

""Welcome to my domain, Yorick,"" the tentacled creature smiled as he poured out a cup of tea to welcome the human. ""I've heard so much about you.""

""Where's the goddess?"" The human demanded to know. ""Why is it you?""

The eldritch entity shrugged. ""She grew tired of meeting you in death, so she directed your path to me instead, should you die again. In her words, constantly getting yourself killed just because its not your time is insane. So, isn't it fitting, that you are now under the patronage of this Eldritch God of Madness. I'm your new god, Lord Elvari.""

""...can you send me back?"" Yorick gulped, feeling nervous about this turn of events.

""Oh no, human. We can't have you dying again so soon,"" Elvari waggled a finger like he was chiding a small child. ""As such, you shall come under my protection. You shall dwell within my domain until your time is truly up. That's when I'll escort you to the God of Death.""

Yorick clenched his fists and yelled, ""This is imprisonment!""

""Please, you are in the Black Seas of Infinity. The waters stretch beyond what your eyes can see,"" the eldritch god gestured towards the brackish waters flowing in this realm. ""Go as far as you wish. But I've been told many can't come back if they go beyond what their mind can comprehend. But look on the bright side, you can't die again until your time is up.""

""Well, there may have been a little error on my end,"" the God says. ""You're not supposed to die forever-- I mean for a long time.""

""Wait, are you saying I'm immortal?""

""N-no,"" the God stammers. ""That would ruin the natural order of life and death. A God like me would never make such an oversight, even if I had been drinking a lot around the time you were born, and maybe, possibly, checked the box for immortality instead of dead at 27.""

""God drinks?""

""You try listening to people's problems day in and day out. It gets old fast.""

Criss chuckles lightly. ""Wait, so if I'm immortal, why did I die?""

""The Soul System isn't used to someone being immortal, so it just assumes everyone's soul comes here for judgment after death. That should be corrected now, so you don't have to worry about dying again.""

""That's so cool. Oh, but what if I get severely injured? Am I just stuck like that?""

""Nope. Your body will heal itself within the hour.""

A large smile grows across Criss' face. ""I know what I need to do.""

1lke0uy,mzr8yb4,"""SIR!"" My number one burst into the darkened captain's chamber, where I brooded with the full weight of all our fates. ""Half the crew have been stricken with... ""       
          
Here is voice dropped low. ""... *SPACE MADNESS*.""       
             
I steepled my fingers. ""What's space madness?""      
              
My number one tugged on his uniform shirt and looked at me askance. ""You'd best come see for yourself, sir.""       
            
I was getting a little tired of brooding anyway.      
           
We clambered in zero gravity, emergency lights illuminating our way through the access tunnels. As we neared the confinement deck, I heard something from the speakers.      
         
*""...♪ -e's the boogie woogie bugle boy from company B! ♪""*             
                  
""What is that?"" I asked.     
           
""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,"" My number one gritted his teeth. ""One of the first signs of Space Madness.""      
            
Just then, the doors to the confinement deck slid open and the full strength of ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" crashed into our bodies. Inside, half my crew were dancing the Charleston in zero gravity.     
                
""A 1920's swing dance... "" I narrowed my eyes. ""... but a 1940's song.""         
           
""Quite mad, sir."" My number one nodded, dodging a careening Space Flapper.         
               
""There is certainly no way this day can get any worse."" I said confidently.      
         
My number one received an incoming communications in his earpiece. His eyes grew in alarm. ""... I'll let him know right away. Sir! We have had 98 unauthorized access requests for flan.""     
         
I shrugged. ""Considering how things are, I'll not begrudge my crew some sweets!""      
             
""Understood sir,"" My number one replied. ""But the refrigeration unit did experience massive coolant leaks that they only just repaired.""     
         
""...don't tell me."" I began.      
           
My number one looked at me grimly. ""The flan was... overly warm, sir.""     
             
""...so Space Diarrhea is imminent."" I sighed. ""Now it can't get any-""     
         
""Need I remind you, sir, that our FTL systems are connected with our plumbing?""       
         
""... why?""      
           
""Science, sir.""       
       
I sighed dramatically. ""Very well. Make contact with the planet and request access to their restrooms ASAP!""        
        
""And if they should refuse, sir?""         
                
""Then *cultural* contamination will be the least of their worries!""",7
1ljtyzu,mzmppty,"I look as the two time travelers freeze.  
""In my world, there is no society, no order, no peace.  
Wars are continuously waged by surviving groups, for resources and remnants of technology."" the first one says.  
""If you kill him, the world will become worse, time will shatter, and randomly be altered.  
One day we are living in an utopia, the next an apocalypse, the next we are monkeys, the next we are reptiles...  
And we remember it all."" the 2nd one says.  
I take out popcorn, and start munching on it.  
The two don't like it.

  
""See? He deserves to die! He has to die!"" the 1st one groans.  
""No! No matter how much of an asshole he is, he can't die!"" the 2nd one stops him.  
I slurp on my soda.  
""You never heard about the butterfly effect?"" I ask.  
They both look at me.  
""You know, the smartest time travel I can think of, is somewhat of a combination between Dragon Ball and Doctor Who?  
Branching timelines, and fixed points that can't be changed or else..."" I say.  
They laugh.

  
""The Doctor changed the historical things so often, that..."" they start.  
""Not the biggest ones. And sometimes he saved people whom went ahead and created a better future.  
Also, theoretically, he is...they are? The Doctor is from a civilization that created time travel, and studied it for many, many years.  
You guys though? You are humans."" I say.  
""Doesn't matter. Your life choices will create the apocalypse of my world..."" the 1st one says, taking out a weapon.  
The 2nd jumps in.  
The 2 struggle a bit, before disappearing, and a 3rd person appearing.  
A young woman, dressed in a white suit, that looks like an uniform.

  
""Came to erase my memory?"" I ask her, slurping my soda.  
She nods.  
""You stopped those 2 from ever gaining access to time travel?"" I ask.  
""Those 2, and more."" she says taking out a device.  
""So, we do have a Time Agency of some sorts."" I say.  
She nods.  
""We aren't stupid. Time travel's implications were clear when they were created, and branching timelines, and changing events is too chaotic for us to allow it.  
It is a studied process, but it is prohibited to time travel."" she says, as the device lights up.  
I nod, and thank her, before the device almost blinds me.  
""Hmm...I should finish that article."" I mutter, as I suddenly feel inspired.  
I clean myself of the popcorn, and go to my study, where an article titled: ""The 4th dimension's possibilities..."" awaits me.",185
1ljtyzu,mzsvy26,"""You don't understand, if they live it's all over!"" The man with the ragged red combat suit insists.
I sigh, this has been going on for almost two hours now.

""Okay listen, you two are both quite stupid. If I die, it's all over, if I live, it's all over. That seems to be the core of both your arguments, and that makes no sense."" I finally bite out. ""You, jetpack boy. What *exactly* is so bad about your future?""

The second figure blinks in surprise at being addressed so rudely by the person they were trying to save. ""Well, the whole world is ruined! Only a few pockets of civilization remain!""

""And you, if I live?"" Turn to look at the other one.

""The world is falling apart, cities rip apart and turn to impossible storms of dust.""

Getting a feeling I know where this is going.

""Show me."" That stops them both in their tracks. ""You both come from futures of horror, show them to me, show me what could be my fault.""

""It won't be pleasant."" Red warns me. ""You'll see the clouds of remains storming in the winds.""

""More pleasant than listening to you two chucklefucks argue for another hour."" I retort. ""You're going first, so intent that you've isolated it all down to my continued living, that your world is my damn fault. Then show me, show me what I've done to your world.""

He looks me over for a few moments longer before nodding. ""Okay, put this on, it's a temporal synchroniser. It'll link you to my machine."" I do so and nod. 

""Well then, show me the consequences of my actions."" I smell ozone as the air crackles around me, the journey isn't pleasant, a whirlwind of impossible hues as physics distorts through more dimensions than my eyes can perceive, and we land on a concrete plinth beneath a red sky crackling with hellish lightning. 

""Here we are, my time, my world. The world you ruined."" His glare would be potent if I was actually looking at him, but the skyline is more important to me now. Skyscrapers in the distance are collapsing, not to the ground but in on themselves, fizzling away into dust that cuts through other buildings like the trillions of vicious metal shards it must be.

The other one, my supposed protector looks on in horror. ""This is.. this really is horrible, but..."" I kick him in the shin before he says it, I know where this is going.

""Your turn jetpack, show me my death."" He changes the temporal synchroniser and we slip through the vicious storm of time again, it's even more disorienting the second time, but we land in a world of grey. Vast fields of nothing but greyness, grey clouds block the sky, allowing only the barest light to filter through their dense fog. But I'm not looking outwards, I'm looking down for something more important.

""I saw how you both set those, we moved in time and space, but space was locked in relation to earth's movement, so relative to where we left, this is the same spot."" I mention aloud, drawing both their attentions. ""And see, I can't help but notice something about this drab horrorscape."" I raise a hand full of grey dust that slowly trickles away between my fingers, disappearing in the wind. ""All this dust is very metallic, dreadfully sharp."" A few small beads of blood are forming on my hand, not painful thankfully, but it was noticeable. I pull my shirt off, ignoring their sudden surprise as the movement and crouch back down. ""Of course, keeping these things in mind, I'd ask you to explain this."" Using the bundled up shirt I brush the dust away from the ground we stand on, ruins my lovely top but oh well, anything to prove a point. There's a set of scratches deep in the ground, an R, and a J.

""So someone scratched initials into the ground before the world ended, problem?"" The jetpack boy asked.

""A big problem, because I scratched that myself."" I tap the firmly scuffed toe of my boot. ""Steel caps, perfectly sufficient for this. But I scratched this, in his world."" I gesture to the man in the red armour again, watching his eyes strain with the sheer effort of his minimal dawning comprehension of the bleeding obvious, jetpack boy however showed no such signs of comprehension.

""You did? In his timeline? Then why is it here?"" 

""And the award for most self answering question goes to... This idiot."" I roll my eyes. ""Smack your two braincells together and think man, I scratched something into the floor in the other man's timeline, and it's here in yours, there's only one answer here.""

""It can't be."" Red insisted despite himself. ""That doesn't make sense.""

""Anything that happens, happens. Anything that in happening, causes itself to happen, causes itself to happen, though not necessarily in that order."" I quip, before using the confusion to snatch both of their time machines. ""See, you both use different date systems here, but common thread, settings, calendar, local calendar types, Common Christian Calendar."" And I hold up the devices. ""Relative times from that, right now, we're about two hundred years forward of you."" I point at red. ""Which makes us three hundred of where I quote unquote belong. You may be in the apocalypse, but jetpack here is a little while past then."" 

The two are blinking at eachother in shock, finally managing to process what's being shown to them.

""You mean to say.. our worlds are the same?""

""Of course they are, clearly neither of you ever picked up a copy of Dr Noughtharpen's Uni Tempus, so you're vastly unqualified to be judging what ends the world, so I suppose I should explain. Got a whiteboard? No, I suppose not, post apocalypse and all. Never mind, anyway. Time is not a linear cause-effect situation, the effect can be it's own cause, that's a paradox, but if the event always causes itself, the paradox is fine, no problem, it's stable, consistent. You cause something to happen, that means you don't cause it to happen anymore, more traditional paradox, killing a parent and so on. That's a bigger problem, because now you can't prevent yourself, and so you do prevent yourself, both are true, and both can't be true, there's no parallel timelines to play with here, you have Time, big T, and that's all. You can't have two contradictory truths in one Time, otherwise you make things indeterminate, and that is what we call, A Very Bad Thing, Indeterminacy Events. However, observer effect tells us both of your stories are true, they happened, so they clearly had to both have happened, how do we reconcile? They happened at other times."" I look to see if they are following, but it's clear they are not and I let out a long-suffering sigh. ""Look, you can't stop the world ending by killing someone in the past, because you still saw the results. Either you break the universe with an indeterminacy event so big the earth gets wiped from the casual space to clean the paradox, or you hit the wrong person, the event happens anyway because the universe abhors the butterfly effect... You people are still totally lost aren't you? Let's do this better."" I take a few breaths are turn away from them, retrieving an oversized pocketwatch from my bag. ""Jan Parnell, Paradox Society. Far from pleased to meet you, this will take a lot of fixing.""",11
1ljtyzu,mzn5302,"Standing in the second future, I wished we had not even come here.

Adaema had gone first. Happy to share his future...a future in which if I survived would be one of the most horrible things that could happen to Mankind.

Ever.

""You would not even wish my future on a broke, tick dog,"" he had said.

It had been a terrible place. No sun. A landscape of ruined buildings and deep shadows that...clawed...was all I could see around me. Above us, from the burning red-black clouds, came strange, sickly green tentacles and insect limbs reach out toward...

I am not sure what he meant by that comment but I would not want to be that dog.

E. Bunny just looked at me, his furry head, truly a child of a *furmeet,* almost making me choice the future that was  Adaema's, most likely the worst, right now.

Good thing I hadn't.

Really. it was a great thing. Hands down.

I could not look away from what laid out in front of me, a strange, surreal world that stretched in all direction, a sea of...? A sea of...of what?

Bunnies...fluffy, white bunnies...everywhere...

1ljtyzu,mztfs05,"Thanks!

Yeah, considering that even now, as Time is still an unknown force for us, we have a gajillion stories about Time Travel going wrong, I find it improbable that we would allow wanton Time Travel.

Even if Greedy Corporations ™ would have access to it, considering that corporations aren't actually dumb, just greedy, and don't care about people as long as they make profit, they still wouldn't time travel to change the past, because the consequences are hard to predict.

Though, we would totally time travel to the future to get dibs on new tech, which would be a whole other disaster.",5
1ljpk06,mzm2hr0,"As Jameson followed the scientist through the lab, he was gesturing at a wall filled with tubes; each containing a tiny red dot of a pill suspended in saline. 

""After two years of work, we've done it. We've got them in six varieties, to cover every possible customer. This one right here? If you've got type O- blood, you swallow it. It attaches to your digestive tract. Over the next few months, your reflexes go up five-fold, your muscle density, healing, three-fold. By the end of the first year, you can lift ten times as much as a non-meta  with your build, your muscles will stop low-caliber rounds... overall, an excellent equalizer against some sort of alien like a Jotun.""

""That's.... a year? That's garbage.""

""But... it works perfectly. We produce reliable results every time, with our AB+ version getting the best results.""

""The problem is that we want a serum with only temporary effects. Something we can sell with a monthly subscription service. Works fast, fades faster.""

The man gave a slow nod. ""...You saw the kind of numbers Reflex was giving Wayson's stock, and want in.""

""No matter what we sell these for.... its one and done. Wayson sells his super-reflex serum one injector at a time. Ten thousand a pop. The military is buying them like crazy, and thats just for a minute or so. If you can make this less permanent, but still stack in effect... like, say... make the nodule die in a month, and the effects reverse after too long without... we can start out-selling him.""

""...That's.... his stuff kills people who don't have excellent health. Addictive. Has to be carefully controlled. Honestly, people who've been on our stuff for a month or two would do amazing; they'd work well together.""

""Fuck that. Add something to it that kills people that take it with Reflex. And get to work on making it temporary. I want a solution by next quarter.""

The scientist watched the executive stepping out of the lab, and gave a slow nod... glancing at his interns, and turning to walk into his private bathroom; the only room on the floor that he regularly swept for bugs. Any other room in the building, they'd be... extremely suspicious of such activity.

He lifted his cell phone, and settled in; turning on a privacy field.

""Director Thomes. This is Doctor Watkins, from Arsenault Biotech... you tried to hire me a while back, and gave me your card. We've got a possible solution to help get our troops ready for the next alien invasion... but my CEO wants to sabotage it to help get monthly sales. I have nothing against profits.... but I was just ordered to introduce deadly flaws that could get your people killed.""

On the other end, a man who'd been protecting his country from superhuman and alien threats for decades gave a slow nod. ""Interesting. Sounds like attempted murder to me, and considering he's planning to sell to us, treason as well. Work as usual for now. I'll have someone there within the hour.""",248
1ljpk06,mznumzy,"Monthly subscription doesn’t really have to work fast. 

It may encourage users to buy more months. 

Imagine a poor dude getting superpower for take revenge. He would’ve bought 1 month, but because it’s slow, he has to buy 13 months and wait for his power to peak. 

Peak late-stage capitalism",19
1ljpk06,mznma0r,"I belive the problem was the effect being permanent. They want something that's fast and temporary so they can sell it as an reoccurring subscription.


From context in that last conversation, I'm guessing the ""Director"" is very high ranking in whatever they have for a government system. (Talk of ""treason"".)",24
1ljpk06,mzolhce,"In this context, 'Director Thomes' is a government employee in charge of an organization the government has deal with alien and metahuman threats, who currently buys the drug 'Reflex' from Arsenault's competitor in bulk quantities with the idea of very briefly turning a soldier into a speedster during a fight at the risk of causing them significant harm; but when its a fight to the death obviously that's worth it. 

For added context from the universe Wayson and that drug are from;

After he finishes questioning Jameson, likely using a metahuman who can tell when you're lying, he's likely going to give the man a choice between either essentially being owned by his department and on a very short leash, or prison for plotting treason against the US government, with the results of his research likely ending up bought up by a competitor, or, if crimes were commited in order to achieve the results, confiscated by the government. 

Thomes is a WW2 veteran metahuman who dealt with an alien invasion back in the 70s that was a 'scout force' but whose significant superiority to humans made the incident absolutely devastating; and has been preparing for their second invasion ever since, not completely certain he'd live long enough to be in charge when it arrived; and would jump on such a serum with gusto.",9
1ljpk06,mznul6w,"That sounds like ""director of national intelligence"" sort of words.  Assuming superhero shit, they probably have a trial-in-absentia system worked out that they can use to debate the ethics of headbagging someone without having to bring them to the courtroom by headbagging them just to have the discussion.  Just what I'd do if I was smart and had shit to deal with day in and day out.",16
1ljpk06,mznv06o,"Upvoted for making a good argument on a hot take.  I respectfully disagree; the risks of augmentation withdrawal could be straight up fatal, but the user is liable to get themselves killed, even if they don't die directly of drug withdrawal.  

  
Even if so, you have body-integrity arguments.  When is it okay for the government to confiscate your augmentations?  Your kidney?  Your lung?  ***Heart?***  Because there's not really a great dividing line when modern-day medicine is starting to look suspiciously like makin' cyborgs out of all of us -- [Billy Idol was right indeed!\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdPcLM6B8aA)",10
1ljpk06,mzon8iz,"To be fair, he did just order one of his employees to give his drug a fatal flaw that would likely be discovered by killing US soldiers or federal agents in a combat situation. Best-case scenario, some metahuman bank-robber goes free because the guy who just took an injection dies, worst-case scenario, the flaw isn't found until an actual alien invasion, and hundreds of troops die from the combination in a combat situation, resulting in potentially millions of secondary casualties.

Execution would be an appropriate response if it were deliberate, with not just treason, but one count of premeditated murder per soldier/agent.",7
1ljpk06,mzotmyw,"As a shareholder of Arsenault, I can assure you these side effects are for the safety of humanity- it's important we limit as many public risk factors as possible. The CEO always shows up for the shareholder meetings and I can personally attest that while he might be abrasive, he's thinking about the bigger picture here.",6
1lkao8j,mzrfqsy,"Sara sat at a table, holding a phone to one ear. Her eyes wandered over the messy spread of printed papers as she spoke, impatiently listening to the speaker. ""I know Mum, but it's not just my wedding.""

She narrowed her eyes at one paper. Seizing it, she looked over the offered flowers. A few caught her eye, even as she huffed at the reply she had heard. ""I don't care that I'm the first. You can wait for Neil to propose to Jenny to have your traditional wedding! But I'm not forcing Kyrela to conform. And,-"" her voice rose as she cut off the response, ""- if I want your input, I will ask! But until then, put a sock in it!""

Pulling the offending device away from her head, Sara swiftly silenced it before throwing it down. Burying her face in her hands she quietly screamed. They had barely begun planning, and already she had a headache.

A headache that suddenly passed, as a pair of cool hands rubbed her scalp. She sighed in response, going floppy as she turned to face their owner. Kyrela gave her a smile, looking up from the wheelchair she usually used. ""What's wrong?""

Sara nuzzled down, planting a kiss on her lovers lips. She watched her gills flutter in response, long fin-like ears gently twisting. ""Oh it's just... Mum means well, she just... she doesn't get it.""

That earned her a sigh in response. Kyrela gave a soft following hum, soothing and light. Watching her human partner relax again, she tugged her down onto her lap. ""I know my pearl. Mines not quite so bad, but still not the best.""

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, happy to be with each other. Then Kyrela gave another kiss, before gesturing to the papers. ""Anyway, parental drama can wait. What have you come up with?""

Sara smiled, brightening up. ""Oh, well I have an idea for the venue at least! How about the Floating Gardens? They have hosted both sirens and mermaids before for events, so they have facilities. Plus, I think it can then work for the joining of breaths.""

Kyrela smiled, resting her head on the humans shoulder. ""You want to do that? It's fine, we don't need all the traditional elements.""

A frown graced her partner's face. ""Oh no you don't. We are getting married properly. I want to exchange vows like a human, and breathe together as a siren. I want to have a officiate watch in confusion at the family skirmish. We will have a first dance, and the first song together. We might have a thousand and one differing traditions, but we can make them work together. And if not, then let's make something new to fit instead.""

The siren stared in silence, before grinning wider. ""I love you. You're crazy, and that is perfect. This is perfect. No matter what, we'll make it a day to remember.""

""We? I thought you said you weren't much of a planner.""

The raised eyebrow made her chuckle. ""Yes, but what sort of jellyfish would make my spine if I left it all to you. I might not be the best, but I'm not going to let you run yourself ragged.""

Sara breathed a sigh of relief. ""Thank you, sweettail. I... I didn't want to force you, but I do want your help.""

Kyrela wheeled forwards. ""Then I'll do what I can. So, I know humans display flowers, which sirens lack, but how about we have coral under the water? It's colourful, and fits I think.""

The human smiled, nodding. ""Of course! But I would like an arch of flowers, and a bouquet if we can.""

Together they fell into discussion identifying each part. A few laughs were exchanged, at the sheer opposition of their traditions. But neither took offense. They created a broad idea, marrying their separate marriage traditions into one. It would take time to iron it out, but they felt up to the task.

They would make their day shine.",6
1ljzvic,mzo7qqh,"Great.  
Did that just goddamn happen?  
I start screaming, as the light hurts my eyes.  
I am a baby...again.  
But I have my memories of my previous life, and the encounter with that...something.  
Was I just rejected from Afterlife...  
Because my soul is ugly?

  
As my new mother is asleep, I am thinking.  
What was wrong with me?  
How was my soul considered...ugly?  
I know I have lived...okay, I have ""survived"" my previous life, not lived lived, but is that wrong?  
I had a job, wasn't a pest to society, and even volunteered so that I don't feel completely dead inside.  
Is it that bad that I never felt a calling to something?  
I just went through life as if I was a simple passenger?  
What...what else could I have done?

  
My life this time starts the same.  
Loving parents, healthy environment, and good relatives.  
I enjoy it, I can't say I don't, but...  
I don't feel anything wow towards anything.  
1 year. 5 years. 15 years. 18 years.  
I am an adult again.  
My life for real starts now, but...  
All I feel like doing is...simply living.

  
I have friends, I am even the maid of honor for one, and life is good.  
I am good at my job, as this life I am a social worker, and I travel a lot, helping kids to have good family lives.  
Problem is...  
I still don't feel anything special to anything.  
30 years. 50 years. 80 years.  
I die, surrounded by people I helped, that loved me...  
I get to the nothingness from before, and I am greeted by a groan.  
""Ugh...even uglier."" something says, and I am back to crying, and being a baby.  
What...  
What should I do different?",22
1lkfcnb,mzshljz,"I look up the trees, trying to find a different silhouette other than the rounded, long tailed one that covers every other surface in this forest, but I fail. This place belongs to them.

We had been warned not to come in here, though when had we actually listened to the patronising adults in our small town? They seemed more worried about creating new rules for us to follow than actually protecting us. It's always been like that.

""Honey, It's not safe out there. The squirrels, they're not what you expect."" my mother repeated each time I asked what's in the forest. 

""What do you mean by that?"" 

""Just stay in town, will you? Your father would have wanted that. "" She never said more.

Well, she should've had. Today, my friends and I have walked into the forest, our cargo pants heavy with snap off blades and knives. Not with the intention to kill, but to defend ourselves in case those little rodents give us no choice.

We wandered for almost an hour until we finally saw one of them hiding behind a tree. Its little eyes shone in the dark, fingers rubbing against each other and staring right at us. Why would anyone be scared of these tiny animals? They seem inoffensive.

We walk closer and closer, taking careful steps to avoid scaring it away, when a crackling noise echoes around us, like a thousand fallen leaves being stepped on at the same time.
 
We stand still and look around, hundreds if not thousands of glowing eyes staring at us, the stars seem scarce in comparison. They know more about us than we know about them.

""Run!"" My friend shouts, and they all start running back as fast as they can, just as they had been told to do if they ever encountered a squirrel. Their vision, straight as an arrow breaking through the wind, with a single aim.

My legs, however, they feel like metal. That's when I realise that the squirrels have all gathered around me like the Greek army holding the trojan horse. My skinny body is stripped of its ability to react, loses it's strenght and gets lifted by what feels like a thousand little hands. 

A few minutes later, I feel a piercing pain on my back as I'm thrown on a hard, sharp surface. Dozens of stones lay under me.

The squirrels stand still, surrounding me like I'm a witch about to be set on fire. Then, a path is freed as one the little animals walks straight towards me. I lift my head to look at it, its eyes do not shine like they did before. They have a familiar depth to it.

I look at all the stones around me and notice that each one has a name engraved on them. I've heard some of them before. They were spoken about in secret, behind closed doors. They belong to those whose deaths were celebrated, those who didn't deserve to be alive. The only thing that scared people in town more than the forest was those names. 

The black-eyed squirrel takes its last step towards me and holds a stone against my face. It has his name. Instantly, a cold shiver seizes every nook of my trembling body as I recognise those eyes.

I say under my breath, what I think could be my last word...

... ""Dad?""",5
1lk8axg,mzpmryy,"I look at my girlfriend, Bea, and then at her family.  
""So, your father who runs an electricity company is..."" I start.  
""Zeus."" she says.  
""And your mother who is a marriage counselor is..."" I continue.  
""Hera."" she says.  
""Okay, so the brother who is in private security is..."" I continue.  
""Ares."" she smiles, and her brother nods.  
Oh boy.

  
""I am Hephaestus."" the other brother, whom has some prosthetic parts, and an eyepatch smiles at me.  
Dude is awesome at videogames.  
""I am Eileithyia."" Bea's sister, who is a pediatrician smiles.  
""Welcome to the family."" Hera smiles.  
I nod.  
""Happy to be here."" I say, holding Bea's hands.  
""So you are then Hebe, I guess."" I say.  
She nods.  
""Albeit I prefer Bea."" she smiles.  
I nod.

  
Later, Bea brings us refreshments, and we start talking.  
""You could work at my company.  
We have branches all over the world, and work with many 3rd parties, and the data is hectic.  
Hermes can't handle it, and Athena refuses to help me ""spread capitalism"", so I need a good data analyst."" Zeus says.  
I am...honored.  
""Yeah, sure, happy to help. And thank you for the job offer."" I say.  
""Yeah, no worries. I heard from Hebe that your current job while nice, exploits you.  
Let's keep the exploitation in family."" he laughs, and so does Ares, but Hera pinches Zeus' waist.  
I smile.  
They seem so normal.

  
Later, Bea and I are in a guestroom of her parents' huge mansion.  
""Is this..."" I start.  
""Olympus? No. It is a simple mansion, though we could veil Olympus to look like one, but no, too much of a hassle.  
We changed with the times, David."" she hugs me.  
I hug her.  
""I am glad. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to meet my goddess...wait!  
Now this nickname isn't even a nickname, but a fact!"" I say.  
She giggles, and kisses me.  
But before it could get more heated, the door is opened by Hera.  
""Goddess of Marriage? Remember? Door stays open..."" she says, leaving.  
We look at each other, and start laughing.  
All the stress and anxiety melted away, and hearing Hera's words, I had a thought...  
Maybe I should start looking already for a ring...maybe her uncle Hades can help me with the diamond?",10
1lk0jmx,mzo9h3a,"I watch Miss Lia obliterate the villains.  
The rest of the team has long gone home.  
Not only is she the heiress to one of a major biotech corporation, but she is also a genius, who is a super superhero fangirl.  
She used her wits, and the company's resources to augment herself to join us.  
We are the best superteam of this planet...  
She did such a good job augmenting herself, that she made the rest of us obsolete.  
She overpowers all of us.  
Now, she is done with the villains.

  
""Done, Captain Moonlight! How did I do?!"" she beams at me.  
I smile, and pat her head.  
""Good job, Miss Lia."" I say.  
She pouts.  
""Sorry, Mistress Gene."" I say.  
She nods.  
""Where is the rest of the team?"" she asks.  
""Let's go. I will take you to a secret place of mine."" I say, as we fly away, just as the law enforcement arrives to apprehend the villains.

  
A few dozen minutes later, we are atop a hill, eating delicious ice-cream.  
""Is it that bad?"" she asks.  
I sigh.  
""You don't have to sugarcoat it.  
I have been helping dad with company stuff since I was 7. I fired my first employee at 9."" she says.  
""It's not firing, Miss Lia, but you do understand that you managed to augment yourself so well, that you can adapt to any situation?  
You require no team. You are the team."" I say.  
She sighs, as she looks down.

  
""I just wanted to be with my heroes...  
You guys saved me once...when the villains broke into one of our laboratories, trying to steal some viruses."" she says.  
Oh. I didn't know that.  
""You can hang out with us, you know?  
The Hero Association allows and even promotes inter-hero team activities.  
You can create your own team, and we could have joint missions."" I say.  
""Really?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Great! I am going to create one right now! Sparkling Genes!"" she laughs, flying away.  
I chuckle as I watch her leave.  
""Does this mean she accepted being kicked out of our team?"" I mutter, before I finish my ice-cream, and fly away as well.",21
1lk0jmx,mzqp5oy,"Allie skipped through the halls of the Iridium City, secret lair of the True Believers floating in geosynchronous orbit with Earth's moon, while merrily humming K-pop songs to herself. Today had been a very good, very productive day for the rookie sensation of heroics; she'd stopped a runaway train in Switzerland, prevented a meteor shower from destroying Kingston, and just recently had battled the demonic troubadour Gwisin Black after he interrupted her charity event at the children's hospital. She would've stuck around for cleanup, but the team had called her back for an emergency meeting, so the best she could do was to right all of the overturned cars before taking off.

Opening the doors up to the meeting room, Allie strode in and announced, ""Alright alright alright! Who's the unlucky global threat that's gonna get a full course superpowered beatdown to....day?""

Allie trailed off as she saw the rest of the True Believers assembled already, turning in their chairs to look at her. No doubt sensing her mounting anxiety, Fulcrum waved Allie over and softly remarked, ""Heya Xenon. Why don't you have a seat?""

Allie gulped before telekinetically pulling up a chair for herself. ""Is, uh, is everything okay, guys? I mean, this setup doesn't typically lead to anything good, going off of my experiences in the boardroom.""

Moonracer cleared his throat. ""We weren't really sure how to tell you this, but...we might have to let you go. Not because of anything you did, we promise! It's more that--""

""You don't really need us,"" Nowhere Man finished.

Allie blinked. ""Huh?""

Silken Star sighed. ""Look kid, I'm just gonna come out and say it: you are *way* more powerful than this whole team combined. It's sort of a Doctor Manhattan situation, y'know?""

""What?! That's crazy!"" Allie tapped her wrist communicator and pulled up a holographic chart with all of her stats. ""O-Okay, sure, my xeno-bolts are rated hotter and stronger than Volt Cutter's lightning or Fulcrum's Heartpulse...and my glow-vision can zero in on finer details than even Nowhere Man's telepathy or Silken Star's satellites...and I can fly faster than Moonracer can run... and I'm stronger and tougher than..."" Allie let her head fall onto the table as she weakly muttered, ""Goddamnit, I Mary Sue'd myself.""

Volt Cutter gave Allie a pat on the back. ""It's okay, kid. You never notice until somebody spells it out for you.""

Allie sniffled. ""So...I really have to leave?""

""Well, we're not sure,"" Fulcrum chimed in. ""Keep in mind, Moonracer said we *might* have to let you go. We love having you around, really, and if we can help it, we'd like to have you stay on. It's just a matter of figuring out how to bring you down to a level where you actually need it as teammates.""

Allie rested a hand against her chin and mused, ""Maybe I can treat myself again to divide my power somehow--wait, that's it! Dividing!"" Allie activated her wrist communicator again, this time showing off detail schematics for an elaborate machine. ""There's a prototype in company storage that's perfect for this!""

Nowhere Man took in the details with wide eyes. ""An unorthodox solution, to be sure.""

Volt Cutter chuckled. ""Aren't they always, in this line of work?""

Silken Star stood from her seat and stated, ""All those in favor, say aye.""

""Aye.""

""Aye.""

""Aye.""

""Aye.""

""Motion passed. Come on Xenon, let's get this show on the road.""

**Two weeks later**

Fulcrum fired his Heartpulse, cutting down the terracotta soldiers as he yelled, ""Does anyone have eyes on General Terra?!""

Silken Star sliced through a soldier as she scanned her surroundings. ""Up there! He's making more!""

Volt Cutter drew back the bowstring on his lightning bolt-longbow and cursed under his breath. ""Where the hell's Xenon?! We're getting swamped down here!!""

Nowhere Man blasted a hole in the earthen ranks with another Psi-blast as he answered, ""I've just received word: everyone's been moved to safety, and she is on her way!""

""HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"" General Terra cackled with malicious delight, his stone armor glowing with jade veins as he boasted, ""So it's true then! The strongest among your number has grown weaker! What once would have taken her minutes has been stretched into nearly half an hour! Truly, you have lost this day after all!""

Moonracer vibrated through another soldier, scattering it into pebbles. ""Do you ever get tired of being wrong?""

""Do you ever tire of your incessant--""

*BOOM!*

The cavern ceiling had a newly formed hole as a figure floated in the dust cloud. General Terra grinned and pointed his lodestone spear with a haughty, ""Ah, the great and mighty Xenon. Come to prove your decline in quality?""

""Nope!"" A swipe of her arm blew away the dust from Xenon...

And revealed her eight identical copies flanking her on either side as she added, ""Just here to show off how I've improved on quantity!""

""What the hell?!""

X1 grinned. ""Pretty cool, right?""

X2 cracked her knuckles. ""Nine bodies...""

""One mind!"" X3 continued.

X4 let some light seep from her palm. ""Of course the process also divided my power level...""

""Hence why it seemed like it was getting weaker."" X5 rolled out a kink in her neck.

""But even divided into ninths..."" X6 chimed in.

X7 grinned ferally. ""That's still enough...""

""For me to work with..."" X8 purred.

X9 slammed her fist into her palm. ""And too much for you!""

All as one, Xenon yelled, ""DOGPILE!""

General Terra screamed as Xenon began launching him all over the place while the rest of the team split their focus between the soldiers and watching her work. With a drone in a headlock, Nowhere Man smiled and remarked, ""Go get 'em, kid.""",6
1ljw6tc,mznv2in,"I couldn’t *believe* how well dinner was going, the food, the conversation, the atmosphere – even though all of the waiters were sims... I could ignore it this time, it just felt right…I couldn’t help but ask her, “So...should we take this back to my place, or yours – whatever you prefer!” I did my best to hold a flirty and smug expression; not my forte.

“Oh…Mark, I-“, she started, her expression suddenly flush with worry, “I would, I…I really do want to but…I can’t. I don’t…I’m just, synthetically integrated you know…and”

I cut her off, “Wait – what?!”

“Yah, you know, I did this so long ago, and I just didn’t get the parts, I didn’t think something like this would happen! You know, I’m still married and I just - “

“Hold on just a FUCKING minute – what the fuck are you saying?!”

“Mark!, what’s wrong?”

“I can’t fucking believe this! Like, what the FUCK?” I immediately stood up.

“Mark, please wait!”, she reached out her hand to stop me.

“DON’T….don’t fucking touch me please….” I grabbed a fistful of cash, some amount, any, I didn’t care, and threw it onto the table so I could stormed out.

Outside of the restaurant was typical cold autumn evening for the bay. Despite walking as fast as I thought I could, I didn’t get far until I just slumped into a wall. I can’t fucking believe this. Not this time! NOT – THIS-FUCKING-TIME. I really liked her…

“fuck….” I whispered to myself, burrowing my head into my hands. Why….just why is EVERYONE doing IT?

Miraculously my phone buzzed. Gary.

Thank fucking god, GARY!

“Gary, for fucks sake, thank you” I blurted as I picked up.

“Shit Mark, is everything okay? I was just calling to see if the date was going well, honestly hoped you wouldn’t pick up.”

“No man...”I said in a hoarse voice “It kinda fucking …ugh man I just – you wanna get a drink?”

“McAlester’s on 52^(nd)?”

“Yes, ***please!***”, I said in relief.

“Alright, I’ll be there in 15.”

1ljw6tc,mznv3v5,"The cab ride over was unusually slow, I hoped that Gary wouldn’t be stuck waiting. I hated being late with him. He was the only ***real friend*** that I had left. I made sure to never take that lightly…an ad from the cab’s in-seat display broke my train of thought:

“*Our latest breakthrough in Synthetic Integration Manifold Technology. The Aptos SIM 10.0. Celebrating the 10**^(th)* *anniversary of the revolution of man. Our newest manifold is the lightest, strongest, and most capable yet. Perpetuity of conscious, an infinity of possibilities…schedule an integration with us today…”*

“Ugh, could you shut off this thing? Or like change the channel or something?” I complained to the cab driver.

“HA! I wish, but somethin’s gott’a subsidize yah cheap fair ain’t it?” I could tell he was trying at some sort of eastern accent…it wasn’t working.

“Fine, we’re almost there anyways…” I hissed, as the cab driver glared at me from his rear view.

1ljw6tc,mznv832,"The bar was unusually packed for a Tuesday night – Fucking sims, now they found this place! Gotta ruin just about fucking everything. Couldn’t they just stick to their fancy night clubs downtown? Jee-

“Mark!” Gary motioned from the deep inside the bar. I practically sprinted over, just excited to see my best friend…to hang out with someone REAL.

“Fucking GARY! Man! AHHH! I needed to see you bro!” I reach out and gave him a hug – not my usual – but I needed it to night. He felt oddly stiff, it was usually me that was the uptight one.

“Hey Mark, come on…have a seat – what happened?”

He made a glance at the Bartender, not the guy who was usually here…

“Agghhh, Mary man…MARY, ugh what the fuck?” I lamented.

“Mark….use your words – haha”, he responded warmly.

“We were having a really good night – I mean really good!”

“uh uh…”

“And like, even BEFORE tonight, our conversations, I really haven’t connected with someone like this in a LONG time - ”

“yep…that’s true, you arree a bit of a pick-…lonely uhhh wolf”

I glared at him a bit

“You gonna let me finish…?”

“yes Yes…go ahead”

The bartender dropped off our usual drinks, no idea how because I’d never seen him before, but I happily jumped at mine, I needed…SOMETHING.

“Look, 3 dates in almost 2 years, and she’s a FUCKING SIM Gary…a SIM! Like- what the fuck man?! Why me?? Agghhh” I took a big sip.

Gary nursed his a drink a little, “Mark…I mean” I gave me a patronizing look, “Is it REALLY all that bad?”

“Duuuude!”

“This…is the society we’re in now. I feel like, everyone has become…***comfortable*** with it Mark. We don’t want to be like those old men we learned about in school who couldn’t adapt with the times.”

“Naw man, I don’t need a history lesson right now. It’s just NOT right. I feel like everyone around me has just GIVEN-UP.” I started counting on my hand, “My parents, my sister – bro – Lisa, Alan…TED! TED man?! Like he was ALWAYS anti-what everyone else was doing!”

“ah…” Gary sighed in a resigned matter, and took a bigger sip of his drink.

“It’s like me and you are the only ones left man, we’re the LAST hold outs!” I took another big sip of my drink, “We ***KNOW*** what it ***means*** to be REAL - ”

He cut me off , “You remember Mike from football?”

“Mike…oh! BIG MIKE?!”

“Yah! Big Mike!”",29
1ljw6tc,mznva2z,"“Man!! I totally forgot, it’s been so many years! Ahhh! He was so good man, had to be the best quarter back to ever come out of our small town! I still can’t believe what happened, they did him dirty…”

“Yup, blew out his knee, and UCLA revoked his scholarship.” He took another sip.

“ugh, so fucked! What’s he up to now? Do you know?” I asked, almost excited to hear about an old friend from back home we forgot.

“I actually spoke to his mom last week when I went back to see the folks”

“oh, yah?!”

“Mark he…didn’t take losing the scholarship well, football was really his identity…”

“Shit man, well fuck it – let’s go back and cheer him, up! Do something with him! All these years man, I can’t believe I forgot! I’m no better than these fucking sims”

He winced a little, “Mark he…he didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean?” I asked almost rudely.

“The whole…losing UCLA, he…jumped into the ridge shortly after we all left for school”

“what the FUCK? Why…why weren’t we ever told about this? The FUCK?” The room, started to turn.

“His mother told me they felt ashamed, that they didn’t…that they **couldn’t** see the signs.”

“man…what the fuck.”

“That’s not even the point of this story though…” He looked down at his drink pensively. “The year after his accident, UCLA allowed SIMS to join and play on scholarships. It was actually supposed to happen his year but, it was delayed because the Coach was holding out on some… technicality.”

“So…what the fuck does that have to do with anything?” Everything came into focus suddenly. I could feel a bit of anger boiling up inside me.

“Well…the POINT Mark, if he could have had access to that, if he could have integrated…maybe things could have been – Better.”

“what?!” I gasped.

“Maybe, he could have played, maybe he could literally be sitting next to us having a drink – right - now.”

I finished me drink and just glared straight into his eyes. “That’s actually fucked Gary.”",27
1ljw6tc,mznvawi,"“Mark…”

“No, like why the FUCK would you tell me that? YOU KNOW WHAT I’M GOING THROUGH! WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BRING THIS UP?!”

‘People’ started to look over at us, I was making a scene.

“GARY, FUCK THIS MAN, I CAN’T RIGHT NOW. I LOVE YOU BRO, BUT FUCK THIS”

“Mark!” He yelled after me as I marched out of the bar.

The cold outside snapped me out of almost instantly, damn it was chilly for October…I turned to go back in, and Gary was already out next to me.

“I’m sorry man,” I whined to him.

“It’s okay, let’s just, call it a night..” He responded carefully.

“Ah I’ll go in and pay for the drinks, I don’t wanna burn this spot…”

He stopped me, “Its ok, I took care of it.”

“What do you mean? I didn’t *see* you pay, and I walked out like 5 seconds ago”

“I paid, don’t worry”, he said more firmly.

Then it clicked…it all fucking clicked.

“No…NO GARY! FUCK NO!”

“Mark…I – I’ve been meaning to-“

I cut him off, “You were the LAST – REAL – FUCKING PERSON IN MY LIFE GARY!”

“Mark, THIS is the future, you have to get with the times. Your parents **begged** me to talk to you about integrating.”

“MY PARENTS?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Gary! You’re supposed to be MY FRIEND! FUCK MY PARENTS.”

“Mark, respectfully, as you friend, you literally the only one who’s holding out, and you’ve never really had a good reason…” he chided.

“Gary…I need you to just…just…hear something right now.”

“Yes Mark?”, he responded impatiently.

“FUUUUUUCK YOOOOOU GARY!”, I then stormed off.

1ljw6tc,mznvbkv,"I got maybe a quarter mile away when I just couldn’t take it anymore. So many thoughts swirling through my head, it felt impossible to breathe.

I fell to my knees. “What’s the point…?” I whispered…to no one.

I didn’t…I didn’t BELIEVE in integration, and I don’t see why I had to defend that. I don’t UNDERSTAND why I seemed to LITERALLY be the ONLY person who felt this way.

And maybe that was the problem…maybe this is why I have been struggling since all of this started 10 years ago.

I don’t belong in this time, and I-DON’T-KNOW-WHY.

I wish I could have been born before technology made us this way…Maybe that’s possible…something about reincarnation we learned in high school…?

My eyes started to burn, yah it had been a while…As my vision blurred in that stingy hot wetness, I saw the train barrier lights start to flash.

“Iconic” I said to myself, as I watch the barrier come down, a small spotlight approaching from the left.

“Impulsive” I said to myself, almost rallying this new…***idea.***

\- APTOS HEADQUARTERS 11:52pm -

“Trial 041 has terminated…unsuccessfully” Announced the small test android.

“AGAIN?! You FAIL TO DELIVER RESULTS!” boomed the MANAGER as he stared at the monitors, surprisingly upset given the 40 failed trials before.

“Surprising that the appeal from a childhood best friend was non-functional-”

“IRRELEVANT, YOU MUST FIND A WAY! YOU HAVE 8 MORE CHANCES!”

“My apologies, we will culture another embryo.” The android lamented.

“AGH! This takes TOO LONG! 30 YEARS. 30 YEARS! EVERY TIME 30 YEARS!” his voice echoed through the lab, shaking the equipment. “Figure it out before you use all 50 embryos, or I will have decommissioned and replaced…”

The MANAGER abruptly stood up and reached for the door.

“Sir?”

“WHAT?!”

“Why do our experiment number aliases not align with the sample labeling? This would indicate an error in our experiment logic” the android prompted carefully.

“Your purpose is NOT to ask questions, but to run experiments.” He responded shortly has he swiftly left the lab and slammed the door behind him.

The android, seemingly unphased, picked up vial “#50342” from the tray and took it to the culturing unit.",22
1ljussf,mzmu5jc,"Yet another knight is tossed out...by the princess.  
""Humph, they don't see gold even when not blind!  
Men!"" she mutters.  
I try to calm her down.  
""Sister, relax...  
I thank you for this, but..."" I start.  
She turns around and stares at me.  
""Look at you! Gorgeous! Tall! Big bosoms, and a wide hip!  
Why the hell do they care about those horns, or the tail?"" she says.  
I blush.

  
I watch her walk around, and send yet another message to her father, the king, that she is still trapped by the ""evil"" dragonness.  
It is a lie.  
She, the princess, I saved when she ran away from an arranged marriage a decade ago, and we became sisters.  
Now...she is pretending to be trapped in my tower, trying to find me a nice husband.  
Knights, wizards and many professionals have came.  
None passed her test?  
Why?  
Because the test is first to not attack me on sight, but...  
I look at myself.  
How could that ever happen?

  
I watch the wizard being thrown at by his beard.  
""Ugh...wizards and beards, what the hell is going on there?  
And I thought this one is promising, as he actually didn't attack you on sight, but...  
He flirted with me?! When you are here?"" she says.  
I smile.  
""It's okay, sister.  
Let's go an eat."" I say.  
Her actions warm my heart, but...  
The word ""sister"" starts to feel...odd.

  
We eat dinner, and go underground to take a hot bath.  
She talks, and talks about her plans for her kingdom, when she takes over, about how she will make me the kingdom's guardian, and so on.  
""What about a family? A husband?"" I ask her.  
She snorts.  
""What man could ever be good enough for me?  
Maybe a woman like you."" she winks, standing up, leaving the waters.  
""Yes please!"" I say too quickly, too eager.  
I blush, as she laughs, and leaves.  
I submerge in the hot waters almost completely, staring at her leaving figure...  
""If only she would truly consider it...  
We would be so perfect together...we already are...."" I mutter, hoping one day I will get the courage to confess, before...before it is too late, and this little boss sister of mine, weds me to someone.",44
1ljussf,mzqrfxt,"I dismounted my horse and walked towards the tower. The Regent had hired me to retrieve his eldest niece, saying she had been kidnapped by a Dragon. The man had served for over five years since both the King and the Queen fell victim to the plague, and there’d long been rumours about him and his intent to claim the throne himself permanently, but I’d always found him to be a fair and honest employer.

Which is why I was surprised to knock on the door and be answered by the Princess, who didn’t have a mark on her. No bindings, physical or magical, and I didn’t sense anything that would indicate the presence of a demon.

“Hello, your Highness. Your Uncle has requested I free you, but you seem able to move on your own. If I may ask, are you trying to perform some experiments in the Arcane?”

She tilted her head, her reddish-blonde hair swaying in the breeze. “While that is one of the reasons I’m out here, I’m also trying to find a suitable husband for my younger sister. Please, follow me.”

I followed her through the tower, and we soon reached the top where we were met by a strangely beautiful Dragon. I’d seen several over the years, but this ones scarlet red scales and golden eyes seemed particularly entrancing.

“Eirena?”

The Dragons eyes snapped open as her head twisted around to look at me. She grinned and leaped at me as I braced myself, shrinking down into a Human woman who was very similar to the Princess as she threw her arms around me.

The Princess leaped back with a shriek as my girlfriend collided with me, and after steadying myself I turned my head and grinned. “Sorry, Vearuna, but Eirena thought something like this would be a more memorable way to introduce me to you.”

My future sister in law shook her head. “Well, it’s all good so long as you two are happy.”

She walked out of the room as my girlfriend chuckled.",10
1ljjgil,mzkdr23,"“…and *he* never truly cared about you either,” she finished with a twisted smirk.


I tried to muster up some semblance of hatred, or mild disdain at least. But all that came to me was gratitude. The woman before me, clad in fancy black attire that made her look just a little taller, actually paid attention to me. Insults or not, that was more than I could say for most everyone in my life. Hell, even some *friends* didn’t talk to me as much as she just did.


“I, um…appreciate what you said about…” I muttered, trying to find my voice.


The woman before me raised an eyebrow. Maybe she thought this was some pitiful attempt at banter before the ‘hero magically broke free of the chains binding them to the chair and beat the villain to a pulp’ or whatever.


“Yeah, the whole ‘your meaningless, insignificant husk of a life isn’t even worth my time’ was, uh, I don’t know. It made me feel seen, I guess.”


“What?” I-no! Listen to me, *hero*” - that last word oozed from her tongue like venom. “You don’t matter, and I’m only talking to you so you understand just how much pain you will feel when I’m done with you.”


I should have felt fear in that moment, but there was only one thing on my mind: was that a hint of *embarrassment* I heard? 


As if reading my thoughts, I felt the chains tighten. The cushionless chair grated against my legs, but one singular thought passed through my brain:


*This would be fun.*",154
1ljjgil,mzkjxft,"The Professor looks at the tears in Ms. Thunder's eyes and laughs. ""It's nice to finally see your tough facade break-- Wait, why are you smiling?"" 

""I'm just so happy."" 

The Professor's eyes narrow. ""Happy? You've spent the last three hours tied up, listening to me insult everything about you. Your lack of friends, lame family, boring hobbies, and even your deepest insecurities. How the hell are you happy?""

""It's just that no one has ever paid that much attention to me before. It must have taken you months of digging to uncover everything you did."" 

""More like years,"" the Professor mutters. 

""See. That's what I'm talking about. Dedicating years of your life to someone like me. It's probably the greatest romantic gesture I've ever received."" 

""R-romanatic gesture?"" The Professor stutters. ""You've got this all wrong. You're my mortal enemy. Neither of us can live while the other survives."" 

""Alright, Mr. Potter."" Ms. Thunder chuckles, then leans forward and whispers, ""It's okay. I'm into you, too."" 

The Professor gulps as he looks down at Ms. Thunder and truly takes her in for the first time. Her long, dark hair. Her piercing eyes. And lips that look so soft and inviting. *It can't be true. I don't like Ms. Thunder.* 

""I can see it written all over your face, so stop fighting it and untie me. I want to hug my new boyfriend."" 

The Professor kneels in front of Ms. Thunder and says, ""Prove it."" 

Ms. Thunder leans forward and smiles. ""Gladly."" 

*Is this really happening? Am I going to kiss someone I've been enemies with for over five years?* The Professor leans forward and places his hand on the side of Ms. Thunder's face, pulling her close. Their lips lock, sending a jolt of electricity through the Professor's entire body that sends him flying backwards, through a wall. 

After a moment, he emerges from the cloud of dust with a large smile on his face. ""Holy shit, did you feel those sparks flying?"" 

 ""Yeah, that's a side effect of kissing me."" Ms. Thunder titters. ""Most people hate it."" 

""Hate it? But it was the best kiss of my life."" The Professor runs over to Ms. Thunder and unties her. ""I know we're different, but maybe you're right. Maybe we are perfect for each other."" 

""There's just one problem,"" Ms. Thunder says as she stands. 

The Professor's brows furrow. ""What's that?"" 

""You're still a villain. I can't date someone who hurts people."" 

The Professor's stomach drops. *She's right. There's no way she could be with someone like me. But maybe I could change. Maybe this is my defining moment.* The Professor gulps. ""What if I changed? Stopped hurting people. Then would you want to be with me?"" 

Ms. Thunder smiles. ""I would want nothing more."" 

The Professor smiles back. ""Then it's settled. I'm putting this whole super villain thing to bed. From this point forward, I'm going to live a life I'll be proud of.""",88
1ljjgil,mzmlyj3,"""I... um... yeah. You're right."" Looking down at her feet, Cerise quietly spoke to her captor, her orange eyes hidden by her hair. ""Excuse you? What do you mean 'I'm right?' You aren't supposed to agree!"" Said captor, The Overlord of Darkness, approached her, his eyes aglow with confused anger and incredulity. Grabbing her chin, he forces Cerise to meet his gaze, ""I just meticulously dismantled every aspect of your life. Friends, family, hobbies, the very notion that you are some ""Chosen One"" destined to slay me. Where is your anger? Where is your fighting spirit Hero!?"" With a roar, he grabs the collar of her dress and effortlessly throws her across the room.

""Aagh!"" With a cry, Cerise slams into the far wall, the stone cracking and shifting from the impact. She falls to the ground, pulling her knees to her chest as she bites back tears from the pain. As the Overlord approaches her, she lifts her head up, only enough to look him in the eyes, and quietly mutters ""I don't have any fight... those who you call my family only treat me well as to appease the prophecy. My friends all grew distant long ago, only spending time with me in hopes of being remembered as the friends of the Chosen Hero."" Here, Cerise's eyes begin to water. ""My hobbies were only things that others bid me do. I never was allowed a moment of time for myself. And..."" her voice cracks as she wipes her nose, "" and as for me being some ""Chosen One""..."" She sniffles, her tears beginning to fall freely now. ""I never wanted to be here! I never wanted to be some great warrior, or all powerful sorceress. One day I'm living with my family, going to school, making friends... and the next some old lady in a divine robe shows up and tells me I've been chosen by fate."" Cerise curls back into her legs, hiding her face now.

""I didn't want any of this... Just, kill me and get it over with. let someone else get picked."" The Overlord stares at her for a moment, waiting for the trap to spring... surely this was some kind of trick, some grand plan to get him to fall into a false sense of superiority. Right? When he finds that the Chosen One has broken into a sobbing heap on his floor, his monologue of insults and verbal abuse seemingly having proven successful, he finds himself feeling... empty. This Chosen One was no great warrior, no equal worthy of his wrath. She was some kid, one who apparently was distanced and abandoned by her family for daring to have been chosen against her will for a purpose she didn't want.

For a moment, he looks from her, then to his spear, it's dark essence oozing off the tip, slowly coalescing into a scythe's blade. Looking back at her, he shudders, a long dormant memory surfacing, one of a sad boy, crying alone in a burnt down home as he lay over the corpses of his family. ""Damn it all."" Hearing his words, Cerise flinches, hugging her legs and trying to hold her breath. Trying, but failing as she hiccups, her crying resuming thereafter. The Overlord walks out of the room, his armoured footsteps growing distant before falling silent. Cerise, lies there, finding that she was so unwanted not even the Overlord would kill her. She continues to cry, eventually passing out, alone in the cold stone throne room of the Dark Tower.",41
1ljjgil,mzkjy0u,"Ms. Thunder runs over and hugs the Professor. ""You don't know how happy I am to hear that. Now, what do you say, we get out of here? Maybe grab some dinner or something.""

The Professor grabs Ms. Thunder's hand, and the duo walks out of the laboratory hand in hand. As they're walking, the Professor says, ""This isn't all some ploy, right? Like we're not walking into a SWAT team, are we?""

""Of course not."" Ms. Thunder lets out an awkward laugh. ""That would be so uncool."" She raises her wrist to her mouth, pretending to scratch her lip, and whispers, ""Call off the snipers.""

......

Xenarak walks back in, now disarmed and much quieter. He finds that the Chosen One, no, Cerise, had fallen asleep. Her dress stained from her tears and snot. ""...damn you to hell, Fate. Why don't you try sending a real hero to stop me?"" Without another word, he picks the girl up, and begins to carry her deeper into the tower. 

As he walks down the halls of his home, one of the shadows begins to move, stepping off the wall and approaching him. \*Tell me. What do you plan to do with her? She cannot be allowed to live, you know.\* The shadow, eerily similar to Xenarak himself, spoke in a windy, drawn out voice, as though the very air was trying to talk.

""Shut it. As of now, she is to be considered my guest. Anything that happens to her, WILL happen to you and anyone else who approaches her without MY say so. Got it?"" Xenarak stared the shadow down, his eyes still aglow with a red flame. the shadow bowed, before wordlessly retreating back into the corners of the hall. ""Now then... I need to do some reading into that whole prophecy malarkey. See just what it is you are destined to do."" Reaching a door near the end of the hall, Xenarak merely tilts his head, the shadows rushing to pull the door open for him. 

Inside was a grand study. The walls fully lined with bookshelves, save the far wall, where a grand fireplace stood. Gently, he set Cerise down in the armchair, and with a wave of his hand the fireplace crackled to life. As the magical flames warmed up, he looked at her, and at just how small she looked in his chair. Had it always been so large? Or was this girl really so small? Shaking his head, he motioned for the shadows to approach him. As they did, he pulled on them, twisting their shape and size until the shadows of the room had taken on a new form: that of a very large rabbit. ""You will sit with her, and keep her warm. Do not harm her, if you value your existence."" The shadowy rabbit silently moved onto the girl, curling into her lap and falling asleep, one deep red eye slowly traveling along its body, keeping ever vigilant of the room. Xenarak nodded, ""Good. Now, where were my scrolls on that damn prophecy...""

Many hours passed as Xenarak read, and researched, and studied. Scroll after scroll, tome after tome, he even found an old grimoire of his with some spells he had long forgotten. However, after cross-referencing so many works, he had found his conclusion. He conjured up a deck of cards, and approached Cerise. Finding her to still be asleep, he lightly poked her cheek. ""Hey, Hero. Cerise, wake up. I have a proposition for you."" Cerise stirred lightly, moving away from his touch before her mind seemingly took notice of the strange creature on her lap. with a start she pushed the rabbit away and leapt from the chair.

""Ahh! No, I'm sorry! I... wait. Who... who are you?"" Cerise looked around, taking in the sight of the study, the books, the fireplace, she stared at the shadowy rabbit that had curled itself up at her feet, gently kicking it only to see it look up at her with two eyes that moved independent from the body. ""Where am I?"" She looked at Xenarak again, taking in his eyes, barely an ember of flame within them. Dark bags weighed heavy under them, and his face wore a natural frown that somehow felt more tired than sad. Xenarak spoke up, his voice calm. ""I am Xenarak, the Overlord of Darkness. We are in my Grand Study, and as I said. I have a proposition for you, if you'll hear me out.""",42
1ljjgil,mzmm1gw,"At this, Cerise flinched, instinctively moving back before remembering the fireplace behind her. The magical flames feeling hot to the touch, but otherwise leaving her unharmed. ""I... I'm not that old, you know. My body is worth much off your time. Unless, you're into that, but-"" before she could finish, Xenarak spoke over her, his voice practically sucking the words out of her throat. ""No! No, human... sigh. Cerise, you are the Chosen of Fate, destined to best me and bring peace to the land. I do not desire your body, I am not some lech. Rather, I offer you the ability to free yourself of this undesired fate."" Xenarak shows her the deck of cards holding them out for her to take one. ""If you can successfully hide your card from me, you will have beaten me. In doing so, your Fate will have been met, and you would be free to do as you wish. Failing to do so, in turn, would mean I have bested you, which would make you a fallen hero. A fallen hero who, in the eyes of Fate, is not worthy of serving the side of 'good' and 'justice'."" Cerise stares at him, pulling a single card from the deck and clutching it to her chest. ""So the choice is yours, Cerise. You may take that card and run, be forced to live with your Fate. You may try and hide that card, and thus best me and be free to return to your so called friends and family, or... you can 'hide' the card, and become a fallen hero. Stay here, and join me and my brethren in the dark. The choice, is yours."" 

Cerise looks up at him, tears welling in her eyes anew. Now though, rather than tears of sorrow and self-loathing, these were... happy? Joyous? ""Why?"" She stammers out, her voice hitching in her throat as she chokes back her tears. ""Why are you being so nice to me?"" Xenarak looks down at her, at her card, ""You seem like someone who could use a safe place to shelter. A friend. You, remind me of someone from long ago, and I would be remiss if I didn't try and do right by him."" Cerise ponders his words before not so subtly putting her card just below the very top most card of the deck. Bashfully, she hides her face in her hands, her rabbit companion nudging her legs as it attempts to comfort her. ""Are you certain of your decision, child?"" Xenarak asks, wanting to make absolutely certain she was okay with what he was to do. A simple nod is her only response. with a subtle grin, Xenarak grabs her card, revealing it to her. ""So then, it would seem I have successfully drawn your card, hero. Thus I have bested you in a single combat duel. You are not worthy of your Fate, and must now live out your days as a fallen hero. A disgrace to the divine above. I offer you a home here in my tower, if you so wish."" Cerise looks up at him, smiling. She leaps forward, jumping into a hug with him, crying into his chest. ""Thank you. Thank you for caring about me..."" 

As Xenarak looks down, the visage of his past melts away, and he stares at Cerise's small form. ""You are welcome, child.""",48
1ljcvh3,mzixh62,"""What now?"" I ask.  
The old man sighs.  
""I want to sell the shop to you."" he says.  
I freeze.  
This is a shop that wasn't here yesterday.  
A thing out of fantasy tropes that I really, really love.  
These places always have things never seen before, and magic so strong, and so closely tied to Fate, that few dare to mess with them.  
But now...I am offered one?

  
""Why?"" I ask.  
""I want to retire."" he simply says.  
I nod.  
He does look...weary.  
""What would be the price? What would be my responsibilities? How much freedom one has with a Mysterious little shop like this?"" I ask.  
He smiles.  
""Good questions.  
The price would be your willingness to take over."" he says.  
Oh boy...  
This is bad.

  
""Again, why? Why would that be enough of a price for a place that has souls, magic, and superpowers, and more as merchandise?"" I ask, gesturing around.  
He laughs.  
""Because other than youthful dreamers, nobody would accept the status of being the owner of such a place.  
The Shop never stays for long, never stops for anyone, and it is up to Fate whom finds it, and what wares are in it when it is found.  
Sometimes, there are items given by other customers, other times the items are from the dreams and nightmares of the universe.  
The Shop was, is and will be, but at the same time, it wasn't, isn't and won't be here, ever, and forever."" he says.  
I sigh.  
""My responsibilities then?"" I ask.  
He smiles.

  
""Be here. Welcome the customers, and with the help of the Shop get stronger, so stronger places can be visited."" he says.  
""I also have to be strong?"" I ask.  
""The Shop can protect itself, and the owner, but not always.  
And sometimes, you have to run errands, also, having strength is never bad."" he says.  
I agree.  
Thinking back on my life here...  
""I accept. I voluntarily accept being the new owner of this Shop, and accept the tasks, and responsibilities that come with it."" I say.  
He smiles.  
""The Shop is yours. Good luck."" he says, disappearing, and I feel it. The Shop.  
I am connected to it, and I can feel its desires and its rules, and indeed soon...it moves through space, and time, and my journey begins.",187
1ljcvh3,mzjdv3i,"I always wanted a shop of curiosity of my own. 
So when the old timer made me an offer to buy this shop I jumped at it. 

Did not think twice. Swiped my VISA card. Pricked my thumb. Signed the paperwork in my own blood even placed a bloody thumb print next to my signature. 

The shop and all it contains is mine. 
I did not even notice the wording. 

All the shop contains are mine. 

All that the shop contains, are mine too, care for, house, feed, protect, repair, restore, rescue, restrict, find new homes for, keep safe, blah blah blah ….. it continues down the page.  

Geese old timer, get out much.  

I fold and slide my copy of the papers into my pocket. 

I walk up and down the isles, amazed at all the wonderful things in the shop. 

I trip over a tortoise 🐢 I had not noticed before.  I spring back up to my feet. 
“Sorry big fella I missed you there. No bad feelings I hope?” I say aloud 

The Tortoise spoke “ no problemo friendo , could you please give me some sweet prickly pear cactus?” 

I stumbled backwards, “you can talk?”

The tortoise spoke again “You can talk too. But can you get me cactus friendo?”

I looked around, “I didn’t see any cactus, do you know where it is?”

Tortoise replied, “friendo if I knew where it was, I would not be asking you for it. You are the new owner are you not. ?”",71
1ljcvh3,mzjgegl,"""Wo, wo, wo. I just came in looking for a way to curse my annoying neighbors. I don't need a whole store.""

The old man shrugs. ""Too bad. I already signed over the magical contract to your name. And it's legally binding.""

""How is that possible? You don't even know my name.""

""It's embroidered on your shirt, Jeanie.""

Jeanie sighs. *Shit.*

The old man pulls out a bundle of keys from his back pocket. ""You'll be needing these.""

Jeanie's eyes widen. ""Why the hell are there so many?""

""Well, we house about seventy different types of magical creatures. And then there is the octa-locked front and back doors.""

""Octa-locked? Like eight locks? Are you worried about burglars or something?""

""Oh, yes, very much so. We usually have three to seven break-in attempts per week.""

Jeanie leans against the front desk. ""So let me get this straight. I am now the store owner responsible for the feeding and caretaking of seventy different magical creatures, *and* there are weekly break-in attempts?""

The old man raises a finger. ""Violent break-ins.""

Jeanie sighs. ""Please tell me the store is at least profitable.""

The old man laughs. ""Nope. We've been in the red for over fifteen years.""

Jeanie's eyes narrow. ""How the hell are you still open?""

The old man smiles. ""Grit, determination, and a whole bunch of loans I don't intend to pay back."" He places the keys in Jeanie's hand.

""Is there anything else about this hell-scape of a store that you've forgotten to tell me about?""

The old man taps a finger against his chin. ""Yes, there is one thing. Follow me.""

Jeanie follows the old man into a back room and down a long flight of stairs. After a few minutes, they arrive in a room lit by torches. There is a large ""X"" on the ground in the center of the room.

""What the hell is this?"" Jeanie asks.

""This is the ancient Krizoan resting site. If you don't offer it a human sacrifice once per month, it will stir from its slumber and wreak havoc upon the world.""

""There's no way I can handle--."" Jeanie turns around and sees that the old man has disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a signed contract of ownership transfer on the ground. She sighs and looks down at the ""X."" ""At least this will solve my neighbor problem.""

1ljcvh3,mzjtnj7,"Part 2 

I walk back to the front. After several minutes I finally find the front of the store and the checkout counter.  
Dang I didn’t think this place was that big. 
I almost tripped on the tortoise again. 
I squeak out of fright, then ask, “how did you get here so fast? You are a Tortoise? “

The Tortoise said “ don’t be rude, I took the direct route. While you lolly gagged up and down the isles. A guy could starve to death “ 

At that moment a cat jumped on the counter, said “BOO!”

I fainted 

I felt something cold on my forehead. I slowly opened my eyes. A beautiful glowing blue woman kneeled over me. Her hand was on my forehead. 

The blue woman said, “he is coming to, now everyone be nice, I warning all of you.”

I tried to sit up. She places a cool hand on my chest. 

“Just wait a minute you smacked your head when you fainted “ she spoke softly with a delicate tone. 

I stared into her deep blue eyes. I felt myself slipping in, like sliding of a boat into the deep blue ocean. It was so calming, peaceful. 
I whispered “who are you beautiful?”

She adverted her eyes, “I am Aerial , I have healed your head. You can stand now “.

I stood with help from Aerial, “my name is Jeff and I am…”

The cat says “ The meowing new owner, so sorry I frightened you. I just wanted some attention. Back and chin rubbing you understand. “

Aerial said, “ that is Felix he can be a bit naughty at times “

Aerial motions to the tortoise, “has Bob properly introduced himself?”

I say, “that’s right he is very hungry for prickly pear cactus. No he didn’t tell me his name. Where do I find cactus?”

Aerial says “there’s a number on the side of the register, call that ask for Bob special, they will deliver it. And charge to store account. “

Felix is tapping his paw above a note taped to the register. 

Aerial continued, “but Bob only gets that once a week. Normally he eats carrots, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, a wide variety of vegetables. “ 

Bob snorts, “he did not need to know that “

I make the call. 

I turn to my new friends, care to show me around? Give me the 411 on the shop? 

Aerial grabs the crook of my arm, “my pleasure cutie “

Felix jumped off the counter, “I know where all the cool stuff is “ he rubs against my leg then runs ahead. 

Bob says “I am waiting right here for my food “",58
1ljcfp8,mzivg3i,"I wake up, and stretch.  
The shutters open.  
""Morning, House."" I say.  
The window opens as well, with a slow creak.  
""Yeah, it is early."" I mutter, getting out of the bed.  
The door to the bathroom opens, and the shower starts running.  
""Thanks."" I mutter to my sentient house, before starting my day.

  
I go downstairs, and make myself some breakfast.  
The fridge door opens, and then so does the microwave.  
When I am about to sit down, the chair is pulled out.  
""Thank, House.  
How are you today?"" I ask.  
The cupboards slam softly.  
""I see. Well, it is a long day for me as well, but let's do our best."" I say.  
The cupboards slam thrice.  
I chuckle.

  
As I leave for work, I see the window in my room closing.  
I chuckle.  
My roommates are still asleep, not that they would get this treatment from House.  
First, I was also scared, and House tended to play pranks on me, but...  
I got used to it, I started to be polite with House, buy some gifts, and guess what?  
House started to like me.  
Now, I don't have to worry about keys, socks, or anything going missing, because House has my back.  
Heh, once it got my back when I was in a heated argument with a roommate.  
Never before have I seen a chair being thrown like that.

  
After a long day at work, I get home, and House opens the door for me.  
""Thanks."" I mutter weakly.  
I drag myself upstairs, and go take a shower.  
Afterwards, I try to sleep, but my roommates are listening to the music loudly.  
""House, please."" I say.  
A moment later, a scream, and the music is gone.  
""You! Damn you House, could have asked me nicely!"" I hear my roommate scream.  
""Thank."" I smile, as I get comfier in the bed.  
Sentient house or not...  
I think I got lucky with this place.",134
1ljcfp8,mzkdam3,"""Hey, where's my shoe?"" Ava called out in confusion. 

A soft chuckle, barely audible unless you were listening, escaped the walls. The girl looked around frantically, maybe panicking a bit. She had a bus to catch to work. She had her phone, her purse, her socks, her pants, her shirt. But one shoe had mysteriously vanished. Well, I say mysteriously, but we know what really happened.

I leaned close and whispered softly, taking a moment to pat the wall lightly. ""Yeah, I like having her around too, she's a cupcake. But enough messing around. We don't need her getting fired, then she won't be able to come over and sing to you."" 

After a long moment, a panel of floor slid open, sounding like a sad sigh. Inside was the missing shoe. Ava knelt down to pick it up and put it on, and gently closed the floor panel. Her gaze was filled with confusion, and I chuckled lightly. Within moments, the girl was ready to go. 

The house sighed softly again, this time sounding like an old creak. He was great at not letting on that he was sapient, and I could hear the annoyance in the sound. He was gonna miss her. So was I, for that matter. Only a few seconds had passed since Ava had left, and the house shuddered slightly in sadness. He liked her as much as I did. 

Oh, but he HATED my brother. My brother was a loud, rude, ignorant, arrogant, sack of . . . Hey, relax, I hate the guy too. I'm trying to tell a story. But I'll watch my mouth, okay? Anyway, my brother, he come over one day, right? And the house knew right away, he hated the guy too. Hid the car, the car keys, phone, shoes, socks, coffeecup. If my brother set it down, the house hid it. Coffeecup came back crushed, keys came back mangled, car came back with no paint, no gas, and no engine fluids. Shoes were shredded, socks had holes chewed in them. Then the Piece Of Resistance. Yeah, buddy, I know it's French. But I don't speak French. Anyway, icing on the cake, phone came back, totally wiped. Yeah, House can be a dick to people he doesn't like. Eats and destroys their stuff.

But when he does like you, he only hides a single shoe. Like he did with Ava. It's an attempt to convince her to stay a little longer. Hey, look. Your shoe is missing. House, did you do it again? He must like you too, nobody's ever stopped to bring him a present. Yeah, feel free to stick around a bit, makes House happy when people stay. Just make sure to thank him if he does something. He really likes that. 

So yeah, House is sapient, and a good friend. We get along most of the time. He likes it when people sing sometimes.",39
1ljcfp8,mzjxupu,"I heard Asa before I was awake enough to open my eyes.

A soft purring and warmth moves against my side, the light touch of sharp claws on my skin as the large paw pushed me gently away from the wall of the longhouse, letting the morning chill in under my blanket. I turned toward the central fire, wrapping myself in the fur-covered skin of a *roshvalr* as I wake up.

The sounds of the family starting the day filled the longhouse as I slowly come up from sleep to fully awake. I start identifying the different sounds as the Family beginning their day. The other Elders and Adults, the ones not out on the hunt were already moving about getting slower members up and talking about the day with each other. I hear them as they tell the children and youngling what tasks that needed to be done before anything else happened, they were sent to lessons, or just to play.

*Fire and food first,* I thought as I heard a slap and yip as one of the child must not have been moving fast enough.

Asa was not one for slow responses. She very much took care of the Family.

""Where is my great knife?"" I heard Smemel asking with anger in his voice. From the way the light danced, he must have just come in from outside the longhouse.

*He should have been on the hunt*...I think.

Smiling in the dim morning light that was beginning to filter into the longhouse, I think, *Asa,* and shake my head, sitting up.

Asa never really warmed up to Smemel. He may have married my granddaughter, Hevlel, but Asa never liked him to start with. He was a member of the Elks-Run-Far tribe and was grumpy most of the time. Not his fault that Asa does not like him but she remembers his people. Even I remembered the raid when I was young that had burned the storage room of the longhouse and left us hungry for a season. Smemel had not even been born yet but Asa held a grudge and she had a long memory.

If she did not like you, she let you know it.

*I wonder what Smemel did this time.*",17
1ljcfp8,mzjxxzm,"I know his knife will be someplace he can see but will not be able to get at...most likely because of his size... He was big...bigger than most of the Family.

Soon the sound of children bring wood in and piling it up cracked around the longhouse, Huen and Inger were fighting again about where and how to pile the wood for Mehaen, my eldest daughter. Mehaen, who was preparing the morning meal, was humming to herself as she worked. She did love taking care of us and morning was when she shined. Stoking the fire, getting the younger children out from under foot, and starting the morning meal for those of us left in the village.

I felt the air change subtly as Asa helped Mehaen with the fire. Asa loved Mehaen almost as much as she loved me.

My belly make noise when the sizzle of the *roshvalr* meat reaches me as it begins to cook.

Touching the totem on a string at my throat, I call up my magic to warm the bones and ease the muscle aches of my far too many thaws. I feel Asa push a bit of her essence into my magic along with me, making it easier and less tiring for me. Her essence still reminds me of the soft fur of a baby *yule* as it sleeps against me.

It makes me remember the first time I saw Asa. A memory warm and comforting to me.

She had appeared as a light brown *yule* and is one of my first memories of life here in the longhouse, with my Family, with the Tribe. So many seasons ago.

Grandfather Soot had just finished the calling to the spirits of these new lands, asking to protect and keep our Family in the place we had found. We had followed the *hrosshvalr* as the snow had gone from our old hunting grounds and away from the new tribes pushing into our lands. Before that I remember only dim things about my life.

I do remember that day very well.

While all the older family members were watching or participated in the ritual, I was still too young and all I really remember is that I was eating dry-salted elk meat against the wall of the longhouse. the meat had fallen onto the ground, slipping out of my hands as I had covered it with drooled, and could no longer hold onto it.

A *yule,* about my size had drifted out of the smoke of the ritual, glowing with the light of a new day, all yellow and orange, to bite the meat from the ground. She then had held it for me until I took it.

No one else seems to see her.

I remember giggling at the way the smoke drifted through her, making swirls of her fur as it moved across and into her transparent body.

Her eyes had held stars that twinkled at me in my memory. I have trusted her since that day, taking the piece of meat, covered in dirt, breaking it in half and sharing it with her.

I may be an Elder and the Shaman of the Family but Asa, Spirit of our Longhouse, keeps us safe. Protecting us.

No one but me can see or hear her but they do all feel her...

...Everyday.

Yep. And the house was mischievous but not malevolent with the ones it didn't like.

Also, the owner in my imagination at least, is an immortal/magician/supernatural being, whom made the House sentient, and then simply left to travel.

1ljm3qp,mzlyr49,"The room was silent except for the buzzing of the communicator from random interstellar waves and events affecting the weak signal. That thing had been the result of hundreds of years of inventing and innovation and hard work by millions of people, and it was incredible, don’t get me wrong–I mean, it could communicate with aliens and automatically translate our speech both ways and do it in seconds, at that–but you’d think they’d find a way to block out signal breaks and interruptions. I guess the closest thing to it would be “snow,” an ancient thing that occurred on televisions in the 21st century. Oh, I’m getting distracted.

“So,” the high general finally spoke into his microphone, sitting up straighter, “No communication? But the dinosaurs have been dead for millions of years.”

The communicator was quiet except for the aforementioned “snow” for a while before the robotic voice of the translation came through. The extraterrestrials apparently spoke like us, with sound waves, but at a pitch we couldn’t hear, so an AI voice had been slapped on to read the translation.

“Yes, communication was considered a disturbance. And we are aware that the groups of species you call “dinosaurs” have been extinct for a long time, but we still consider your planet fragile. Carbon-based life forms are easily wiped out entirely by our presence. After millenia of accidentally destroying ecosystems using carbon on habitable planets by coming to live on or in them, we have learned our lesson and now protect them.”

“How are you so dangerous to carbon-based life forms?” One of the top modern biologists inquired immediately, twirling a pen in her fingers. The communicator chirped back after a few seconds, “Because we, and most life in the galaxy, are filled and covered with a protein that breaks down carbon into many hydrogen atoms and uses it to self-replicate.”

With that happy thought, I glanced down at my notes to ask the next pressing question before someone else did.

“Well, how will we work with you and other living things across the galaxy if we can easily be destroyed by you?”

“Well, we can simply not.”



Of course, we did not ‘simply not.’

Humans were desperate for alien products and tech. They had the perfect solution to the massive medical device blackouts occurring every few decades, and we needed to get our hands on them. So we negotiated and argued and negotiated again with the extraterrestrials until we were approved to take one shipment from any desired civilization every 1/64488 clusteric rotations–a standard measure based on the average orbital speed of stars in the Milky Way’s halo–equivalent to once every 300 Earth years. The first shipment came in mostly containing dead alien matter from various species so that we may study them. Of course, the decontamination protocols did not work.

When the first group of researchers to handle the shipment started getting severely ill and dying in droves, we tried to lock it all down. Even the aliens, who may have felt pity, told us how to denature the protein and save ourselves. Alas, it was too little too late. Maybe we should’ve just stayed as a nature preserve.",16

Move, move, move! All operators, report to stations! I want all cockpits sealed and synced before the delegation sets foot on this deck! Crew leads, confirm armor integrity and reactor status within the next five, no excuses. I don’t care if your boot’s untied or your neural link is itching, get in and get linked!”

This isn’t combat, but it’s just as critical. The President’s expecting a launch-ready demonstration, and Sarge isn’t gonna be the one holding up the protocol.

“You were selected because you are the best. So show it. I want clean launches, stable syncs, and zero fumbling on the ramp. Let’s go, let’s go! One-two, one-two!” I got into the elevator shaft and watched as I dropped down into the right knee. I was picked as the right-jointed leg support since I excelled at gyroscope stability. The floors went by so fast it started to look like I was going up rather than down. As the floors sprinted past, I thought back to Contact Day.

The day we learned we weren’t alone. And the day we really learned how small we really are. The first day we picked up the signal, it was just noise. We had put more and more satellites and ways to communicate, both out and in, but nothing ever worked. That is, until the day we picked up a deep, almost undetected roar, followed by a flash of light. The light was a normal anomaly, but the sound was picked up by one of our newer satellites. We adjusted the feed and heard what sounded like, what could only be described as, some form of intelligent language or communication.

When our top scientists finally deciphered it, we made out the message. It was a signal of caution.

[Attention: Unauthorized Entry Prohibited.
Planetary Biosphere.
Preservation Class: Zeta-Glass.
Fragile apex species.
Observation Only.]

It didn’t take long for the world to unite. Just like that, we put all our best minds and technology together, almost overnight. Then came one of the most unsettling discoveries. Using what can only be described as space carbon dating, we found that the message actually originated almost 200 million years ago. That meant the warning wasn’t about us. It was about the creatures that ruled Earth long before us.. the dinosaurs. The message had been hovering around our planet for the last 200 million years to warn passing alien lifeforms that this planet was home to something in need of protecting. They called the dinosaurs fragile. Dinosaurs. The towering, apex monsters we once thought were the pinnacle of Earth’s evolutionary fury, they saw them as delicate. That’s when it dawned on us. If the dinosaurs were glass… what are we?

After we put out our first signal at that same frequency, you know the usual “Hello? Is anyone out there?” in every language, along with the top 100 hits, history briefings, images of babies, plants, and art. It took only 3 days. The world was waiting on its toes when we got a response. It was incredible, almost like they were showing off. First an assortment of different responses that said yes in our language and what we assume would be some of theirs. They responded with a brief history. How brief, I can only imagine, considering 200 million years ago they were advanced enough to basically throw up a digital interstellar warning label.

I won’t bother trying to explain it all. It wouldn’t provide any clearer answers than what we’ve come to believe, an ever-expanding universe, clusters, stars are the stars of the show, you know. Here’s where it gets real interesting though. They where cosmically and utterly massive. 

You see, history remembers gods as larger-than-life beings because they were literally larger-than-life beings. Some had cosmic powers we can only describe as Lovecraftian, or biblically massive. Just… unimaginably large-scale entities. There’ve been some instances where they had to intervene because we were invaded and ruled by these massive creatures, they ended up being worshipped, understandably so. Some projected themselves into minds and dreams.

It was decided by a universal federation—made up of what I imagine God or Zeus to be—something described as a tentacle monster that apparently doesn’t even exist in our dimension. A multi limbed and multi headed all knowing something And an enormously, unexplainably massive reptile-like creature with a shell that held all versions or variations of life or something. Along with a few other hard to explain and describe entities.Apparently, there are hundreds of these huge space snakes just like.. slithering out there. Oh, you know black holes? Well, apparently they’re the result of… where something sat. Something big. Like… cosmically big. You see cosmic gods don’t use chairs, they just kind of.. settle. And wherever they do, the whole damn galaxy just kind of… Well, anyway. Just a whole lot more questions than answers. Go to your local library. Read a book.

Thus ensued the building. We made it big. We made it strong. It could travel through space and time. Unifying and utilizing the advancements given to us, we made a suit. It’s almost an insult to call it a “suit.” It was… everything we could have done. The head, where main control was, was out of our atmosphere. There were space stations surrounding it. We had every conceivable thing we could need to travel anywhere. It was a ship. A presence. A cosmic force that could destroy our own world with the push of a button. And here I was. At the knee. 

We took off, slow at first, just to get off the ground. We didn’t want to completely scorch a crater into the Earth while lifting off. It wasn’t until we got past the moon a half hour later that we shot into full power, and the stars disappeared.",7

""So you do steal souls."" she says.  
I laugh.  
""Claim souls. The deals I make are legit."" I say.  
She snorts.

  
""Yeah, tricking people, and stealing their soul is ""legit""."" she says.  
""Not tricking, and not that simple.  
Claiming the soul is only step 2, of my business plan, the first one is highlighting problems for a society."" I say.

Now that is easier. Not simple, but easier."" I say.  
""So you mess with mortals, to make sure they need your help to make a change? To survive?"" she asks.

1ljhs4v,mzk9jin,"Some doors are designed to be one-use only. The door to E wing had been welded shut thirty years ago, and -- up until now -- there had been no plans to open it.

Grady did the cutting himself. It wasn't in his skillset, but they'd given him a crash-course in using the cutter an hour ago. Every additional person involved was another potential victim if it went wrong.

E wing was large, mostly empty, and automated. Once he was through the main doors, Grady found himself surrounded by machinery, the pipes and wires that managed all of E wings processes and kept the sole inmate alive. The site was entirely isolated -- no external water, power, or anything else supply -- with the closest other buildings a mile away, twice the needed distance just for safety. Panels on the roof kept it powered, and only rainfall ever added to the internal water supply. All food -- nutrient solution rather than actual meals -- was produced and processed in the aquaculture tank.

""I know you know I'm here. I think the only reason I've still got control of myself is because you're curious.""

The inmate -- floating in a lead-lined sensory deprivation chamber, in a medically-induced coma that prevented movement but could not dampen powers -- did not respond.

""We want to make a deal. We want to talk about your release.""

He felt his own hand move without him telling it to, reaching into his suit jacket to retrieve a pack of cigarettes. His right hand moved as well, thumbing the lighter. Puppeteer was listening.

He coughed on the first inhale, hadn't smoked since he was a teenager. ""Just a show of good faith. We're willing to negotiate.

""There's a new villain in town. Thought he was a hero at first, but now people are dying. Too many people. We can't stop him -- physically invulnerable, teleporting, nearly the perfect storm.

""Deal's this: we turn off the safeguards, let you out. You take care of him for us -- permanently -- and then we let you leave. No warrants, no bounty, no chasing. As long as you get off this continent and don't come back, we're happy.""

His hand moved again, tapping the back of his head, just below the right ear. ""Ah, no. That one stays. Otherwise we'd just have two problems. Once you're out, that's our only weapon. You of all people should understand the concept of an implanted failsafe.""

Grady's shoulders shrugged. His hands moved to point both index fingers at himself.

""We knew whoever walked in probably wasn't walking out as themselves, either way. I volunteered. I was close to retiring anyway, and we thought you'd probably hear me out."" He sighed. ""I'm okay with it. Said my goodbyes and everything. Line of duty.""

He felt the control settle on him, each muscle twitching as Puppeteer took over fully. He couldn't feel, couldn't move, and yet his limbs were moving. His legs walked him over to the tank, booted up the dormant controller and started the draining process. He thought terror, thought panic, but without the sensations to accompany it.

Grady heard his own voice without feeling his lips and tongue move. ""We have a deal.""",48
1ljhs4v,mzkndoi,"The mayor stared through the two-way mirror at the volunteers. Ten women -- all short, pretty, and dark-haired -- each one dressed in the same blue-and-gold outfit. ""Grady, this plan is insane.""

""Yes, Sir. But I'm confident that it will work.""

""Why are they all dressed as cheerleaders? Why do they look the same?""

""Target selection, Sir. The first three puppeteer incidents all started at football games, and they all started with the cheer teams. I think he's got a type.""

""And brunette?""

""That's more of a hunch. Victim profiles show a slight pattern. And--"" He paused. ""He took Ruiz, but shot Eriksson, Sir.""

""He shot her?""

""I don't think it's important whose hand was on the trigger, Sir. He pulled it.""

Grady crossed behind the mayor to the intercom unit. ""Ladies, if you could all take your pill now, please? The bus will leave in ten minutes.""

Ten cheerleaders each swallowed one large grey pill, washing it down with water from white plastic cups. None of them spoke, but nervous smiles scattered around the room.

""We'll leave in ten minutes. Twenty to drive to the edge of his zone. Thirty for the polymer coating on each pill to dissolve. Give it an hour to take effect, and then you can send in the cavalry.""

""And what if he knows? What if it doesn't work on him?""

""There's no suggestion that he can read thoughts, Sir. Just sense and control bodies -- all recovered victims agreed on this. We also know he feels what they should feel; he's reacted to injuries and tear gas before. It'll work.""

""But if it doesn't, agent? What if he doesn't take the bait? What if he delays taking control until the drug is out of their systems? No plan is perfect, and definitely not a plan with this much risk!""

""Sir, it's the perfect bait, and he's not expecting anything; he'll think it's Christmas come early. If it doesn't work now, Sir, then it won't in the future. He'll be more cautious then. This is our one shot, and I think it's worth trying. If I fail, you can take my badge.""

""I will agent. Believe me, if this madness doesn't pay off, then losing your badge will be the least of your worries."" The mayor turned from the window to glare at the younger man. ""Are you really okay with this? Sending ten young women to death or worse on a hunch? Using civilians to do your job while you sit safely behind a screen?""

""No, Sir."" Grady pulled a blue-and-gold baseball cap from his back pocket and placed it on his head. ""That's why I'm driving the bus.""",37
1ljafqz,mzj09vt,"""The Riddle of the Thornless Rose""

They came from five kingdoms and three queendoms, from cloisters and calderas, dressed in silk, steel, and suspicion. Each hopeful woman arrived at the castle not by decree, but by dare. For the wizard had made a game of it. A riddle spoken at the midsummer feast, etched in silver upon the king’s own banner, carried by ravens to corners of the known world.

""To wear the crown, she must not kneel,
But speak with fire the cold may feel.
She cannot break, nor bind his name,
Yet must endure his storm and flame.
If she commands, he will not bend..
But if she listens, he may ascend.
Show not your sword, nor hide your grace..
Bring the king to his quietest place.""

The king was furious, of course.

""This is not a game,"" he hissed in the Great Hall after the crowd had cheered the riddle’s recital. ""My marriage is not a scavenger hunt.""

The wizard, bald as a stone and twice as stubborn, simply smirked into his goblet of honeyed wine. ""It is not a hunt, Your Majesty.. it is a sieve. Let fools fail at riddles, and may one wise soul earn your heart.""

""I don't need my heart earned.""

""No.. but you do need to share it. And you, my dear friend, would sooner open a vein than speak of what truly weighs on your mind.""

Silence fell like frost between them. The king turned away. The wizard did not press.

----------------------------------------------♡-----------------------------------------------

The first suitor spoke in metaphors. A lioness from the Western steppes, teeth like flint, with a laugh too sharp to be trusted.

""I will make you strong, Your Majesty,"" she boasted. ""Stronger than your enemies, stronger than yourself.""

The king thanked her and passed her along to the stewards.

The second tried seduction. Velvet dress, scented wrists, kisses behind curtains.

""I will soothe you, my king,"" she purred. ""Let me bear the weight so you may rest.""

He did not rest. He sent her home on a chariot before dawn.

The third tried reason. She quoted scriptures, spoke of dynasties, of children and balance.

The king nodded and drifted in thought. That night, the wizard found him on the battlements, unsleeping.

""I’m not made for softness,"" the king muttered. ""I was raised on campaign maps, not lullabies. Every time someone tells me I can be at peace, I feel like they’ve mistaken me for someone else.""

""And yet you ache to be known,"" the wizard said, placing a blanket over his shoulders.

""I ache to be safe. Without being told I'm safe.""

The wizard said nothing. The riddle, after all, was already written.

----------------------------------------------♡-----------------------------------------------

She arrived with no retinue. No gown. Just boots, calloused hands, and a letter of recommendation from the head gardener. She smelled of rosemary and frost.

""Are you here for the riddle?"" the steward asked.

""No,"" she said. ""I’m here to see the king.""

""You understand only those who solve the riddle are granted audience?""

She nodded. ""Then let me answer it.""

They brought her before the king, who studied her like an unfinished poem.

""Speak,"" he said.

""The answer to your riddle is a mirror,"" she said. ""But not one made of glass. A mirror made of patience. Someone who reflects what you give, not to flatter you.. but to let you see yourself.""

The court waited for laughter or scorn. Neither came.

""That’s not an answer,"" the king said softly.

""No,"" she said, just as soft. ""It’s a reflection.""

He said nothing. Nor did the wizard, who was watching closely from the dais.

""Tell me, then,"" the king said. ""Do you see yourself as my equal?""

""No,"" she replied. ""I see myself as your shelter. And you mine.""

There was no applause. Just stillness.

The wizard smiled into his wine again. Not the smirk of triumph, but something gentler. Sadder.


----------------------------------------------♡-----------------------------------------------

By winter, the halls echoed with smaller footsteps. Laughter climbed ivy-covered walls. The king was still iron.. but now, he let himself rust just a little in the rain, knowing someone would dry him without comment. The wizard found he could finally retire to the observatory and not worry who would keep the king warm through a long storm.

And somewhere in the garden, a rose bloomed. No thorns.

No need.

The Demon Queen's armies also come to a halt, as she flies up as well.  
The armies mutter, and with my hearing, I can make out that they all think, both sides, that we are ready to discuss before the last big battle.  
They are wrong.  
""Alice?"" I ask.  
""John?"" she mutters.  
Then I cast a stealth spell, and she casts a mist spell around us...  
And we hug.

  
After hugging the soul out of each other, and doing something else as well, we let go of each other.

She is a mountain demon, a royal demon standing tall, and proud, with horns and everything.  
""You gave your life to save me, but as you pushed me away, another car came hurriedly trying to bypass the obvious stop that will come out of the accident...

She hugs me.  
""No! No! It was fate! Fate for us to reunite...my dear Hero!"" she says.

  
After a while, I manage to calm down, and we float in the skies, cuddling.  
""Heh...I reincarnate as the Hero, and you as the Demon Queen I have to kill. Can it be considered that I killed you our last lives, and it is done?"" I say.  
She giggles, and pinches me.  
""One: you didn't kill me, and two: I doubt it works that way. But we have to solve this somehow."" she says.  
I nod, and ask her about the demons' situation.  
She tells me how the Demon Empire is in a wasteland where barely anything grows, and demons have to resort to stealing, and attacking if they want to live.  
I also tell her about how the humans, and the other demi-humans see the demons.  
We both sigh.

  
""It will be hard, won't it?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Thousands of years of rivalry, and wars will be hard to be bypassed. But together we can do it."" I smile.  
""How?"" she asks.  
""The wars took a toll on both our forces, and while we are ready for the last battle...the people back home are terrified."" I say.  
""Same...not all demons love violence."" she says.  
""So, Alice, or rather Queen Lebeth von Argent, will you marry me, and bring peace upon the lands?"" I ask.  
She squeals.  
""YES!"" she says, kissing me.  
We discuss a bit more how to say this to our people, but it is worth a try, and if it doesn't work the nice way, well...

1lj149u,mzlyie2,"Harld breathed out, seeing the castle before him. 25 years. It took 25 years to get him here - a shot back to earth. Medieval fantasy was far less fun to live than the modern day he reincarnated from. The spirit promised when it yanked his soul into this body - kill the Demon Queen, return immediately and safely back to earth should he wish it. He’d rather forget his formative years in this world- far more expectations with less convenience than a modern day child. If his previous life wasn’t filled with education and a life of martial arts, getting to this land would have been far more difficult. 



Graduated with honors, heroic levels of magic and skill. His accolades allowed him a leading position - as captain to a elite squad against the Demon Queen. 



Standing behind the ramparts of her castle a demon yelled, 



“Be afraid! I am Lord Paul, Demon of Red!” Harld chuckled at the passionate speech from the blue demon standing on goat hooves. His robes of purple with a red jeweled diadem on his forehead. Lord Paul waved his scepter. A magic circle, spun into shape. Harld lifted his sword and leapt toward the brightening circle.



A quick glance upon the spell structure was the clue to the spell’s demise. Magic, a phenomenon of superimposing realities into the shared one, a program that set conditions that was a domino into a desired effect. And like a domino, the slash of Harld’s sword disrupted the cascading font of power that would have decimated his army. 



However, the power of the strategic spell remained from the ruptured circle, and Harld replaced that decimated esoteric receptacle with his sword. He could feel the weight of the multiple reality stacking upon his sword and he could barely contain the power. Harld swung with hasty slash toward the wall where Lord Paul stood. A slash arm-span wide crashed into the wall through the caster compromising the siege before it truly began.



A silence emanated on both sides as Harld stood landing at the base o the broken wall, his armor and skin smoking from the power he just unleashed. He stood and pointed his sword to the castle - “For the Hearthlands!” He roared. His voice was a herald snapping armies back into focus. And the cries of blood and death begun. Its time to go back home

Jen sat at her throne watching the monitors. When she awoke at this very spot 25 years ago, she was very confused. The previous demon queen died in this chair not seconds before and as the magic of the demon queen dictated a soul came and took her place. When she stared at her face and body, its shape was distinctly her but with longer ears and horns that jutted from his forehead. She didn’t mind the body, the insecurities gone with a flick of her wrist. The first couple of years she’ll admit, she spent it in vanity, wasting the time with food, clothing, magic and eventually sex. No deadlines, nothing but time to waste.



But her advisers finally convinced her to take her role seriously as Queen. They knew new queens always took time to “adjust” to her situation, power and magic. She did respect the bureaucracy of it. Having a new leader every-so-often with differing personalities made the process a testament to efficiency and dare she admit it, compassion. Really her first worry was to agriculture, and as a Biochemist by profession, she really tried to optimize the process and taught chemistry to anyone with heart to learn to pass it down. 



Paul would have been proud. He was a solider and an advocate to education. She mourned the loss of her ex. The last thing she saw before waking up was his head smashed on the ground after colliding with a truck. She knew - at that speed - it was instant death. She had no doubt that when the second car collided with her, she would have looked the same. 



The first demon that finally completed all her lessons of chemistry and presented a dissertation to a new application integrating magic and chemistry to a flowering community of scientists, she couldn’t have been more prouder. She named him Paul in honor to this demon’s dedication. She wasn’t proud of it. But a decade passed and Paul became Lord Paul and her heart was far more open. He was one of the first that knew her body like Paul did from her old world did. 



Watching his death stung. Humans - creatures of self righteous lies . According to her historical advisers , this crusade, led by a man named Harld, was a particularly successful one. Previous crusades were really for their own public image, or foolish cardinals thinking they could finally win. After realizing the advanced civilization of the Demon’s they knew better. But this time. Ruthless strategies, and overwhelming power of the new hero was something different. Her chest was heavy at the countless death of her people, the houses she designed. She saw int he distance the water sanitation plant she worked on become rumble. Decades of hard work pillaged by these monkeys. Before she could stand, she could feel Harld approaching. Its time to humble these self-righteous invaders.

1lj149u,mzlyodk,"contin..

“How Dare you!” Harld roared. Dust settling after crashing into the throne room. A face of fury painted with demonic blood splatter across his face and armor. He flicked his sword, and a burst of holy fire ignited. “How dare you take her face!”



Jen Scowled “What’s wrong with my face!” She unleashed her hand out to draw the dried ash from the burned out braziers and combining it with the oxygen in the air. He lifted his sword to block the rush of charcoal dust. He breathed out through his sword to ignite the air to purify the dust assuming poison. 



His ignorance only fueled his demise as the flame fed off the remaining oxygen. He felt himself suffocate. When his mind panicked his body and sword remembered. A vision of a cave during training flashed. He quickly thanked his sword as only moments passed. With last of his willpower he slashed out twice to make two gashes on a exterior wall one above the other. Forcing himself to remain consciousness as he lunged his heavy sword like a grain bag dragging the outdoor air inside and pushing the heavy carbon dioxide out from the bottom. 



The ash cycled with the CO2 like a roiling tempest replacing it with breathable air. He gasped now with the ability to breath, 



“Your mental games…” Paul coughed taking a knee “…will not work, I will return to Jen with your magic demon!” He finally stood, sword ready - as Harld. Jen’s mouth was agape. 



“Psyche!” she yelled as if a cue, The carpet beneath Harld opened its giant eye. The carpet beneath him transformed to reveal its true form, a mimic. The edges of its form began to wrap the heroic invader, the big maw and teeth latching on his shin. “Read him!” Jen ordered. A amatheist tooth snaked up the mimic’s carpet tendril to latch on his neck, just as it was about to bite, Harld sword shined and a barrier rose. 



Jen could see what Harld did, expanding the space between the tooth and his body, scaling the distance farther within a small given space, 



“Are you Insane!” she yelled knowing a space stretched within such a small area could simulate a large mass to eventually make a black hole. 



“Doesn’t matter if I’m dead so long as you’re dead - I get to go back home.” He scowled. Jen laughed at the obvious fallacy, her spell dug into the spell trying to dismantle it. She had to get closer. She knew she could keep up. Sweat beading down he forehead



“You’re dead…you can’t go anywhere - much less home..” She reached out to his wrist. And converted his skin to acid. “Were human heroes always so idiotic?!” She laughed trying to keep her front and might. as Harld roared - his wrist melting. The sword clattered on the ground his hand still clenched on the handle. He shot deadly glares to the Demon Queen trying to bite through the pain. 



“Unless, you reincarnated from elsewhere,” She realized in terror. The idea clicked into place, the cruel punchline.

1lj76rp,mzhkby5,"Okay.  
I stare at the little creature, that is struggling to stand on 2 legs, all fluffy, white furred, with cute golden eyes.  
It is as tall as a 13-14 year old kid, when standing upright.  
It has a cute voice, and beady eyes.  
It is busy bringing plates, and the pie to the table.  
But...  
I have been sent to execute it.  
And its promise to ""never murder anyone again"" doesn't really make me feel good.

  
""You know that I won't eat it, right?"" I ask the creature, as it tries to sit on the chair.  
It stares at me, pouting.  
""But it was so hard to make that woman into a pie..."" it muttered.  
I freeze, my hand on my sword, and a spell already readied.  
""Don't worry!  
I promised that I won't murder anyone again."" it giggles.  
I feel dizzy.  
Damn.  
Its voice is a spell!

  
I cast a fireball, and destroy the pie, and table.  
The creature easily dodges it.  
""Seriously? You humans always preach about civilization, and whatnot...  
But you always attack first, and ask questions later!"" it says.  
""You are eating my kind!"" I say.  
""And you are eating my kind, and many other species.  
What is wrong?"" it tilts its head.  
I freeze.  
It is not wrong, but also...not right.

  
I attack it, but nothing works.  
My blade doesn't even scratch its fur.  
My spells are dodged.  
""This is boring.  
Hunting villagers that can't fight back, and are running away is more fun."" it giggles...and disappears.  
I freeze.  
Shit!  
I start running towards the closest village, hoping I will reach in time.  
I knew this was set as an S-rank mission, but damn!  
Its cuteness made me lower my guard.",60
1lj76rp,mzhzbm5,"""Another one who comes to try and slay me?"" I asked, laying my tea set and a plate of cheesecake on the table. ""You should know you won't succeed. If anyone did, we wouldn't be talking.""

""I know,"" the human replied, putting his weapon to one side. ""So, my plan is to pretend to fail at this job so nobody else takes it. The Monster Hunter's Association will catch on and send someone else to replace me eventually. But for now, it means a period of peace for you.""

""That's real nice of you,"" I smiled, pouring a cup of tea for the latest of a long line of hunters deployed to execute me.

He stared at his cup warily, before taking a sip. ""You brewed this yourself?""

""Yes, you like it?""

""It is surprisingly sweet. Like you.""

I almost choked on my slice of cheesecake. My tentacles flailed about wildly beneath the table, flabbergasted by his words. Usually, these hunters would insult me. Squidface, dumb deity, murderous mollusc, I was used to those. Not being regarded as a sweet and kind thing. And most certainly not by a man armed with an anti-magic rifle.

""Now, in exchange, I do need you to promise you won't murder anyone again.""

""I can do that,"" I held out a pinky finger and a tentacle. ""Can't guarantee I wouldn't inflict eldritch-induced madness to people who attempt to murder others however. I do have to act in the defence of my followers.""

""Perfectly understandable guardian eldritch deity behaviour,"" he nodded, helping himself to a slice of cake. ""Still, I hope nobody pushes you into such terrible actions.""

""I hope not too. I like peace, and so do you, it seems.""

Now it was his turn to grin. He lifted his cup and held it out in my direction.

""A toast to peace in Innsmouth, Lord Elvari?""

I raised my cup and gently knocked into his.

""A toast to peace, no matter how short-lived it will be.""",48
1lj76rp,mzjb82s,"I had hiked three miles uphill through a forest that seemed personally offended by my boots, my pants, and my continued existence. Every root tried to trip me. Every branch snapped back in my face. Somewhere behind me, my horse gave up and wandered off. That was fine. If I failed the job, I’d be dead. If I succeeded, I’d be rich. Either way, I wouldn’t need the horse.

According to the briefing, the monster had been living in a cave up near the peak. Seven deaths in the last three months. Something had bitten the heads clean off a family of hikers. One sheriff’s deputy vanished entirely. The only survivor was a dog that came back whimpering, eyes wide and tail glued to its stomach.

I had a sword, a sidearm, a flask of blessed elder sap, and a hangover. I figured it was enough.

The cave was where they said it would be. Jagged rocks. Smell like wet copper. And I heard the sound before I even stepped in: humming. Off-key and cheerfully obnoxious.

I drew the pistol and stepped inside.

The monster was there. Sort of.

It was enormous. Eight feet tall at least. Arms like tree trunks. Purple fur. A pair of little bat wings that wouldn’t lift a chicken. Its mouth was full of teeth shaped like broken glass, and its eyes sparkled like it was a toddler who just learned what cookies are. It held a pink oven mitt in one hand and a spatula in the other.

“Oh!” it said. “Hello! You’re early! I didn’t think anyone would show up until the next full moon.”

I kept the pistol aimed center mass. “You’re Muzzlebore?”

“That’s what they call me. I prefer Marmalade. It’s a family name.”

“You murdered seven people.”

“I did kill a few, yes,” the thing said. It set the spatula down gently on a rock shaped like a toad. “But I haven’t killed anyone in weeks. I’ve been working on that. Self-improvement. Meditation. Sourdough.”

I blinked. “Sourdough.”

“It’s a journey,” it said. “Would you like some cake?”

It stepped aside and gestured at a flat stone with a lopsided cake on it. It looked like it had been assembled by someone who had only seen cakes in poorly drawn cartoons. There was frosting, though. Pink with sparkles. A small candle that had not been lit was stuck in the center.

“It’s lemon cardamom,” Marmalade said. “No human in it at all. That’s a promise.”

“You expect me to believe you’ve retired?”

The monster wrung its oven mitts together. “I know what you’re thinking. Monsters don’t change. But maybe some of us do. I only went on the spree because I was going through something. You know. Existential dread. Displacement rage. Losing my crypt to a hotel development. That sort of thing.”

I kept the pistol up.

Marmalade sighed. “Fine. Shoot me, if it helps. I won’t stop you.”

I hesitated.

“I mean it,” the monster said. “It’ll probably hurt, but I’ve hurt worse. Just know you’ll be killing something that’s really trying. I go to group therapy now. With a kelpie. She bit my tail last week, but we talked about it. Progress.”

I didn’t lower the gun.

The cake smelled good.

“Did you actually eat the hikers?” I asked.

“I sucked the souls out of two of them,” Marmalade said, shifting awkwardly. “The others fell off a ledge when I startled them. The deputy tripped over his own baton. Honest mistake.”

“And the dog?”

“Oh, I gave him a belly rub and a slice of ham. He still visits. I think he lives with the kelpie now.”

I finally lowered the gun.

“Can I at least try the cake before I decide whether or not to shoot you?” I said.

Marmalade lit up. “Of course! That’s all I ask.”

The cake was a little dry, but the flavor was nice. The cardamom hit late. I took another bite.

“You’re serious about this?” I asked.

“Dead serious,” Marmalade said. “I’ve enrolled in an online course on conflict resolution. I’ve even started journaling. It’s mostly doodles, but they’re peaceful doodles. Look, I even got this friendship bracelet kit.”

It held up a tangled mess of string.

I believed it. Against all reason and experience, I believed it.

I took another bite. “You have to stop biting people’s heads off.”

“Agreed,” Marmalade said. “I’m aiming for zero decapitations this fiscal year.”

“Then I’ll file a false report. Say the trail went cold. You moved on.”

Marmalade’s eyes went wide. “Really?”

“But if I so much as hear you’ve growled at a toddler or snarled at a jogger, I will come back. I will not bring cake. I will not bring a friendship bracelet. I will bring fire. Understand?”

“Crystal clear,” Marmalade said. “Thank you.”

We sat for a bit, eating in silence. There was a breeze through the cave. I watched the candle flicker, unlit.

“You know,” I said, “if you’d met those hikers with this cake, I probably wouldn’t have brought a gun.”

“Next time,” Marmalade said, nodding, “I’ll greet people with muffins.”

And just like that, I walked out of the cave alive, sugar high, and wondering what the hell I was going to tell the guild.",12
1lj76rp,mzl38l4,"The old man told me about a monster he slew when he was barely an adult. He claimed that a hundred winters had come and gone between then and now. 

The old man was crazy, but to his credit, no one in the village could remember him as a boy, merely that he was the best hunter and tracker of the village and I as his apprentice am to hunt any monsters or predators that blight our lands.

He took me far afield to find anything that was unnatural. Taught me to read and make letters in three different tongues, too, in order to study his books. I was good, the best in generations, but the old man, he was fearless in ways that I would fail to master in my 17 summers of age.

Three dead and tge fist monster attack in living memory. Too bad the old man was not around this year to guide me. 

The tracks and manner of feeding were unknown to me, and the tomes proved to of little help, unless this was some kind of chimera or amalgamation of wicked beasts. Whatever it was, I was not above a hasty withdrawal to find something that would work if this iron blade and holy herbs fail.

Twas not until I reached the mouth of the cave that I realized that I was not stalking prey, but was being lead, baited towards the cave. This was not a creature that was wary, but one that cared not of hunters.

Regardless, I went. The rough walls started giving way to sewn stone, carefully cultivated patches of glowing plants and mushrooms. Hives of glowing bugs and ponds of fish and algae rarely gave my eyes time to acclimate to the darkness. Was this a temple? 

I heard movement ahead, and no sooner did I turn the corner than I came face to face with the beast. I shall not describe the thing, for although it was human in shape, it looked as if all the kind and vulnerable things in the world had been added onto its form. Unlike other monsters, this one gave me pause at its almost defenseless except for the wrongness units eyes.

<I have been waiting for you, Apprentice. Come, sit, I have made cake for us to enjoy as we talk.>

I stepped back and gestured to a table with a pastry on it, a soft wight light illuminating the chamber. I could swear that the furniture was ten strides, but the creature casually reaches from where it stands and pulls a chair out for me, and with a slight step it is beside the table, almost as if distance is but a thought and not an inconvenience.

It was twelve strides for me to close the distance. Blade drawn i stab at the creature but find my blade cutting the pastry in the table instead.

<Your master did the same when he came to see me. He hesitated longer. I wonder if your apprentice will be of sound mind to strike the moment they see me, or if I have to wait longer than that.> The creatures lips moved when it spoke but the movement of its lips did not match the words I heard in my head. 

""I have come to slay you, creature."" I say, pulling the blade from the cake and slashing at the creature. I know my blade should have struck, but the blade passes as if the creature was an inch further than the tip of my blade, only the white frost from the cake touches its skin as it flies from the blade.

<So did your Master, and his, and theirs and hers, and on and on. As you see, I still linger.> it gestures at its body. <Surely you seek vengeance for the humans I consumed, but what if I make you the same deal as I have made before? Return to your village and say that I am dead, but you will bind your soul to mine. Hearty and healthy, you will be until the end of your days, and I will not harm a soul as long as your heart still beats.>

I descend the mountain knowing I made the right choice, but the vision of that creature becoming just a little more human in its visage when the pact was sealed is what truly scared me.",9
1ljgm4y,mzlszt2,"I take a drag of my cigarette after finishing that long meeting. I don’t need a slideshow, just give me a name and I will create my ruse. Enough of their lack of faith in me and oversharing their mostly false findings. 

*Useless bastards* 

These jobs paid well and I only did enough of them to make ends meet. Speaking of ends meet I feel like I am about to meet my own end if I don’t get some food in me.



I arrived home shortly before my food arrived and that is when it occurred to me, food delivery is the perfect ruse. Now to stake out the target and find out what kind of take out they order most often and execute. If I wasn’t invisible to the world I would just sign up to deliver various foods in hopes of finding them, but my job requires a level of invisibility that needs to be maintained. 



Sighing, I pop open and snap shut the glovebox over and over, impatiently waiting for information. Finally, a driver arrives at my target’s home… and they’ve left the door wide open.

You have to be kidding. No way it’s this easy.

But it was and I got my beautiful fat paycheck and their untouched Chinese food, man am I a sucker for orange chicken.",8
1ljgm4y,mzltwpb,"##New Record

Six hours.

That'd be the record. News of this kill would spread slowly as it always did. The result would be attributed to three other people who'd deny out of professional courtesy, but they'd still get pinned for it. The Biloxi accident occurred twenty years ago, and it wasn't until last year that everyone knew Ms. Jones accomplished that feat.

One hundred thousand dollars.

It was on the low end for my jobs because I hoped it would be quick. Didn't imagine that it would be this convenient. Afterward, I planned on going to Santiago. I had never been that far south before, and I was fluent enough to Spanish to adopt the local accent with ease. With this money, I would live well for the next six months before picking up a new job somewhere else. It was important to never work where you vacationed. 

Five kilometers away.

Regina didn't seem like the ideal spot for an assassination. It wasn't big enough that to spawn the gang wars or business rivalries that drove people to higher assassins. Yet it was too large for a hideout off the grid. It seemed to be a pleasant town in the prairie, and I am sure the locals are lovely. I wouldn't want to live in this boring place. Granted, I can't be too mad about the location. It was close enough to Montreal where I was hiding after the Bratislava job to achieve the low time. It was far enough away that the agency considered me for it. I heard of several jobs becoming active in Toronto, Boston, and New York, but they would never put me on them.

Thirty minutes.

I just landed when the pizza order came in. The agency made us register with all food delivery apps since it was good for reconnaissance. Good protocol was to use this to gather information first, but the detailed file told me all that I needed to. 

Lucas Melnyk was a thirty-five year old IT consultant. By night, he was working on developing a language learning model. He was good enough that top tech companies around the world wanted him. He stayed in Regina to help care for his aging parents. Apparently, the AI he was generating as a hobby was too good for companies he rejected. If they couldn't have him, no one could. The pictures from social media combined with cellphone location data showed a normal man who went out with his friends Saturday night and escorted his parents to services every Sunday. 

Two kilometers away.

At least Lucas bought local pizza. The place didn't even look that good. I can't be too judgmental. Few people have had the opportunity to taste the variety that I have. Few people realize that assassins were amateur food critics. We specialized in foods that were everywhere with local twists. Mr. Yung was an expert in cheeseburgers and swear the best are in Osaka. I didn't believe him. Although, I said that the best pizza was in Perth; we all had our quirks. 

I opened the box of artichoke and pepper pizza and sprinkled poison on it. It was simple enough, and the compound was designed to look like food poisoning. I would cause a small business to go bankrupt, but that was a sacrifice I was willing to make.

One minute

Lucas lived in a duplex with his parents next door. Both were decently sized. I would imagine there was three bedrooms for each. He probably had one room dedicated to work and another dedicated to Warhammer or whatever nerdy hobby he did. His lawn was manicured, and the flowers out front of both houses were picked by his mother. 

I got out of the car and walked to the door. Lucas stood waiting for me in gray sweatpants and a blue t-shirt featuring a band I'd never heard of. He held out his hands with a smile.

""Care to join me?"" he asked. I was taken aback, but I knew my shock matched that of a delivery driver. Who invited them in? This guy was weirder than I thought.

""Uh, I'd rather not,"" I said.

""Come on. I gave you a huge tip, and the hockey game is on,"" he said. I looked at my phone and saw it was a thirty dollar tip, massive for a driver like me.

""I'm not a fan of...""

""It's the Jets game,"" he smirked. I remembered I chose a Winnipeg Jets shirt for my cover. Curse hockey for being the state religion here. I had to go along with this.

I nodded my head and went inside. His living room lacked clutter, but the sofas and chairs were stained. Lucas opened a beer and offered it to me. I took it with a smile. He offered me some pizza, and I had to turn it down.

""I already ate,"" I said.

""More for me."" His phone started to ring. He looked down and sighed. ""Sit down. It's my mother.""

I took a seat, and I acted like the game interested me. Lucas spoke to his mother about her Netflix password and why it didn't work in Bermuda. I'd like to go there one day. Maybe after Santiago, I would.

Click.

I turned around and saw Ms. Jones smiling at me with a gun in her hand. She pulled the trigger before I could move. I fell on the floor of the table. Lucas returned with his phone in his pocket.

""You ruined a perfectly good pizza,"" he said.

""How did you?"" I asked.

""His AI is really good. It's about to revolutionize the world. It let me get a new record of forty-five minutes,"" Ms. Jones.

""How could he afford you?""

""Let's just say I am about to make a lot of money,"" Lucas said, ""A lot of money.""

1ljeawh,mzjhdry,"I did the most stupid thing a Titan could do.  
I went against the orders of the new era's rulers: the Gods.  
I stole the fire from the Gods, and tried to deliver it to the humans.  
I was caught by Ares, and Apollo, and later as we fought, I lost the fire...  
Then Zeus swooped in, and defeated me with his lightning bolt, and punished me.  
For eons, I have been chained to a mountain, with one of Zeus' familiars, a giant eagle coming to eat my liver each single day.  
Today...I have been given amnesty.

  
""Yo, Promi!"" Zeus greeted me.  
He was...different.  
His attire was weird, he was wearing some black squares, linked with a thin stick on his face...and so much golden jewelry.   
""Well, it has been long, and Hera and the humans have been chewing my ears off to free you, so...  
Off you go!  
Have fun! The little humans you so much loved did some amazing things!  
Peace!"" he says...disappearing.  
I fall to my knees, as my bindings are undone.

  
I leave the mountain, paranoid, waiting for a God or a lackey of theirs to strike me in the back.  
Nothing happens.  
Then I find the first human city...it renders me speechless.  
The architecture, while looking less, it is so complex! And the materials...they aren't natural, they are...man-made!  
The humans, in such a small town, live by the million!  
I change my clothes into something similar to that of the humans, and blend in.  
I am curious what these bundles of endless potential have manged to do...  
And hope that my failure didn't affect them.  
It didn't.

  
The humans managed to discover fire...and develop quickly.  
In mere tens of thousands of years they did unimaginable things, and now...they rule the world? The skies? And can leave into the domain of Chaos, which they call...space?  
They managed to make the Gods and creatures take a step back from the main stage?  
They have managed to lengthen their lifespans, and invent so many amazing things!  
I can see Ares', Aphrodite's, Athena's and Hephaestus' hand in this.  
Those kids...and they told me they care not about the humans...and what is this?  
This worship?  
They see Gods as different, a different kind of worship...through books, and games?  
It's been eons since I last saw them, when they were shivering in caves, doing nothing but praying to the Gods...  
This new world of theirs...  
I must experience it. Live in it.",16
1ljdp46,mzsjtih,"The dragon smirked. ""Mind magic.""

""Wha?"" Anas felt over his chest and throat. ""No blood?""

""I, Jederoth the Glimmering, paralyzed your body and trapped your mind in an illusion."" The dragon was way too smug. ""In that illusion, we fought as we would in the real world. You, obviously, lost.""

The warrior carefully sat up. ""Why?""

Jederoth sighed. ""Do you know how *annoying* it is when I have to actually kill someone? Everyone gets all bent out of shape and forms warbands and even armies. By testing attackers this way, I make it clear to them they will die if they continue. All but the most stubborn of foes retreat before the inescapable logic of my undefeatable self.""

*It'd also tell you if you'd lose*. Anas knew better than to say that out loud. ""May I leave, then?""

""Not yet."" Jederoth snorted. ""Apparently you humans feel better if you win a -*consolation prize*, I believe it's called?"" He gestured toward the farther reaches of the cave. ""You may pick one item to take with you. *One*. And I have to okay it.""

Anas went cautiously, careful not to knock against or disturb the treasure mounded there. A difficult thing as he made his way deeper into the hoard. ""So. What would it take for you to eat something other than the cows from the village?""

""I don't think there is anything. The herbiage in this area makes your cattle particularly delicious."" The dragon gave a cold grin. ""Eating the plants and cattle makes the humans tasty as well. But there's more meat on a cow.""

The warrior shuddered. Pausing for a minute, he examined a giant golden cauldron, bejeweled with all manner of gems and filled from a spring falling from a split in the rocks of the wall.

""Ah, you can't have that."" Jederoth twitched his wings. ""That's my special drinking container. Collecting the water in it is why the silly humans can't poison me; I don't need to go to a pond or lake to drink.""

His hands on the rim, Anas leaned over. The cauldron was at least three of his height deep. ""I don't think there's anything we could use this for anyway. It must date back to when the giants ruled.""

""It wasn't easy getting it in here. I doubt any other dragon could have accomplished it."" The dragon's chest swelled with pride.

With a last look at the cauldron, Anas continued his search. ""Can I have this?"" He held up a doublet embroidered with pearls and shells. ""So far from the sea, this will be very valuable to us.""

""Sure. It still smells fishy anyway."" Jederoth escorted Anas out and went back to his nap.

1ljdp46,mzslb7t,"A week later, Anas returned to the dragon's cave.

Unlike last time, there was no torrent of smoke or blast of flame. No loud voice demanding why he dared to enter. No mind tricks.

Entering the cave, he found Jederoth the Glimmering, his great body already starting to cool. Even so, Anas made sure to promptly remove the brain and heart, making sure the great creature was dead.

Picking up a pouch of unicorn horn dust he'd noticed on his last visit, Anas dumped it in the cauldron and into the pool containing the runoff, marking with relief the water seemed to have flowed no farther in the past week. He was only after the dragon, after all.

Glenyde. It tasted horrible to humans and most other species, but dragons and other magical monsters either could not taste it, or enjoyed the taste. But it was viciously toxic to all. A few ounces, pressed into a pill and looking no more unusual than a greenish rock, dropped in the dragon's water supply, had slowly dissolved over the next couple of days until the dragon had ingested a lethal amount.

Anas was glad the elder's guess Jederoth had a source of water within his cave had been accurate. Otherwise he would have had to use far more detectable and dangerous means to poison the dragon.

He smirked. The cauldron would make a great gift for the lord's upcoming decennial.

1ljj7mp,mzkr718,"It was midday. I'd finally found it, the home of my prophesized killer. I knocked on the door, waiting for someone to open it.

""Yes, hello! How can we help you y-"" I gently made my way inside, closing the door behind me.

""Where is your son?"" I glared at them, watching as their bodies shook with fear.

""We sent him to the market. Thirty minutes ago. He should return within the hour. What do you want with our boy?""

""I've a gift for him. One he'll never forget..."" I motioned for them to follow me into the living room. ""On your knees, now!"" I barked as I began digging for the rope.

They did as they were told. ""Ah, we love the young people. Are we going to play a game?"" The wife, for whatever reason, seemed thrilled.

""Fucks wrong with her?"" I finished tying the husband first. Then began to tie the wife.

""Sorry ma boy... She's got serious memory issues. Can't recall much correctly these days... Our boy... He told us, some day, someone would come to use us in a diabolical plan... Is that you, young man?"" I froze, finishing tying the wife.

""H-How? Why would he know of the prophecy!?"" I growled, drawing my sword.

""A kind seer stopped by the other day... He seemed like a pleasant man. Please... Don't take us from our boy. He's so young still..."" The father began to cry quietly.

""Nothing you say will change my course of actions."" I place the blunt side of the blade against their necks, waiting.

Some time later, the front door opened. A young boy, no older than ten stepped through the door. ""Mama, Pop Pop, I'm home with tonight's supper ingredients!""

""_Come on, brat._"" I rotated the blade, sharp side against their necks.

""Jose, no! Don't come i-""

The boy rounded the corner, and as he did, I made sure to slowly drag the blade along their throats, blood gushing everywhere, coating the floor like a new layer of paint.

Silence. Breath hitched in our throats. He stared at me, fingers losing their grip in the grocery bag. I dropped the sword, grabbed my dagger from my hip, and cut my own throat. Closing my eyes, happy, knowing that I've traumatized this boy for life, with no hope of vengeance in his future.

My eyes opened, vision hazy. I blinked a few times. Where was I? I looked around, vision finally clearing. I saw the two bodies I'd just slain and my bloodied dagger on the ground. ""What's going on? Is this the afterlife?""

""No... This is... Your personal eternity."" From around the corner, the boy stepped into the room, eyes glowing green. ""You took them from me... All because of some bogus prophet. It didn't have to be this way. You could have lived your life just fine. I never would have bothered you, until you came for me.""

I blinked, the boy was in front of me. ""Did you enjoy it? Cutting them down in front of me?"" His voice was eerily calm. ""Did you think I'd _let_ you take the easy way out? No... You'll die by my hand, over and over again, until I'm bored of you. Now, you're my plaything...""

""W-What are you!?"" I got up and ran around the corner and through the back door. For a moment, there was brightness, then, the cool, dimly lit living room appeared. I've lost count as to how many times I've tried to escape. Was I dead, alive, somewhere in between?

No matter where I went, the boy was there, looking at me with those green, glowing eyes.

""There is no escape... Until I say there is..."" He picked up my sword, swinging it with force enough to remove the blood from it... Then slowly started walking towards me...",8
1ljj7mp,mzkemx4,"The warning came from a turbaned man. He sat on a rug of his own, cards a plenty laid before him. Sightless eyes peered out, but to call him blind would be a mistake. For when his eyelids closed, the world lay open before him.

He tapped a card, holding it up as he addressed the being of stone and wood. ""Your death will come, from neither friend nor fiend. A child still innocent, whose world shall be broken by your actions. They will fight you, hunt you, and emerge triumphant. This I speak, and know to be as true as the sunset this eve.""

His employer nodded, grinding rock setting teeth on edge. But their voice was light, in opposition to the hulking form. ""Seer, answer me one last question. Is this the child of whom you speak?""

Their limb of woven vines split, bringing an orb hidden within. It held the captured image of a baby, peacefully sleeping. The seer turned to it, gazing through his sealed eyes. A single nod was all he gave, as the being's stone torso rose above. ""I thank you, Seer. Yours was the last confirmation I needed. See him away.""

They waved the other arm, this one seeming to be a tree grown to match. Creatures crafted of twig, mushrooms and rocks scuttled up, resembling crabs in their make up. The human gave a single bow, packing up his belongings to follow.

The being stood tall, revealing its full size. It was giant, taller than three men stood atop each other. Its torso was a boulder, growing moss and lichen. It's two arms moved freely around, connected but not restrained by the connection. Three legs of roots supported it, its weight spread across the ground as it settled in place.

It's head was a shifting mass of smaller rocks, sliding around the others as an orange sheen shone from within. Where it spoke, it would craft a face to address. But where silence reigned, it had no features beyond the shifting stone.

The Corrupted Guardain moved across its domain, trees bending to avoid it without snapping or uprooting. Critters both fled from and flocked to it, the forests around a buzz with life, though none dared draw close enough to let it spot them.

Slowing to a stop at an inconspicuous tree, it's face reformed again. It spoke with gravitas, eyes watching. ""Three times I have sought out a prophet, and three times they have spoken. All with the same line, promising my end.""

The forest was silent for a time. Then from the tree emerged a thin figure, pulling its way free of the bark it matched. Humanoid, it bowed once, no face on its oval head. ""So it is set. What is your decision, Guardian?""

The dryad watched it unashamed, waiting to hear of the answer. An answer it received, as the Guardian turned to face it. ""We continue. Tell the others, but we must begin the contingency. I will fall, the fates have decreed. But that must not mean the end of our work.""

The dryad sighed. Its long fingered hand reached out, brushing the cold bark of its leader. ""A poor end for you, but alas, it is so. Yet we shall not fail you. I shall lead my people in your image upon your demise. Wisedeer shall be your inheritor for the beasts who stalk. Granus will lord over the living rocks. Your vision will be made reality.""

The Guardian nodded again. It produced the orb containing the child's image once more, studying it. ""My killer. We must find them, and watch them. Though my death is set, yours is not. Protect not me from them, but yourselves instead. This I tell you, be selfish my friend.""

Neither said more, departing to carry on their tasks. The Guardian to spread its domain, and crush those that infringement upon natures wold expanse. The dryad to pass on the message to the others, and grow itself.

And far away, a baby opened their eyes. And gave a laugh, unknowing of the path they would have no choice but to tread.",8
1ljbb5h,mzik0tf,"""We are all out of silver!"" Kate said, the rounds of her handheld revolver were empty. ""I knew we shouldn't have come here. I was an idiot.""



""You realize that now?"" Colleen retorted, her back against the wall as the vampire hovered towards her. Usually, she would have a cross in her hand for this exact situation. However, being the idiot that she is, Kate had forgotten to pack it in their carry bags…



Kate almost felt like hitting herself with her fists. Why was she always so obtuse? So careless?



No. Not anymore.



As Collen shrunk to the corner, her arms partially crossed against her chest in fear, Kate noticed the vampire halt. The old legend stared at Collen with an expression of mockery; however, from Kate's angle, she saw a lot more.



*The beast is definitely hesitating.* She thought while her gaze lingered on Collen.



""I figured it out!"" Kate jumped, catching them both by surprise as she quickly leaped between the fanged beast and her friend, crossing her arms.



It was probably just one of her idiotic ideas again. She was aware of that fact. However, to her surprise, it was working.



The beast stood there, squinting his eyes.



""Hah! I knew it!"" Kate rejoiced, turning back to see her friend, who was in awe. ""If we cross our arms, he can't hurt us—""



The next moment, Kate's head was on the floor, a fresh cut through the neck.



""Holy shit, your friend really is an idiot."" The vampire mumbled, sounding disappointed.



""I know."" Collen sighed. ""Damn it, Kate. This is the third time I'm resurrecting you this week."" She remarked at her awkwardly limp body before whispering her spell.",40
1ljbb5h,mzisb4d,"I was not quite the next Van Helsing. Still, my name made the rounds across the supernatural underworld. Vampire and hunter alike knew who I was, whispering of me in either terror or reverence. There were countless requests for me to join one hunting expedition or another. Those shadowy masters of blood sent handsome sums to keep me away.

In truth, I did not cut an imposing figure when first encountered. Being short and lanky made for an unfortunate composite. I believe many underestimated the simple monk garments I'd started wearing in my forays throughout the veiled world. But any who had doubts quickly dispelled them upon witnessing me at work. As it appeared to them, I could repulse vampires with the power of merely my mind.

I was very careful to keep the true source of my ""powers"" a secret, and the flowing robes of monasticism aided me in this. But any attempt of mine to avoid publicity was futile, especially after I was contracted by the Vatican to perform exorcisms. I became a highly desired resource, in demand from one side of the world to the other.

Of course, there were things I was asked — had — to do that I regretted. The imprisonment or destruction of the entire were-wolf quarter in Under-Manchester was accomplished through me, and it weighed heavily. I became a target before long; the black-market bounty growing with each time I relented and undertook another expedition. To keep my family safe, I dispersed them across the colonies, each one guarded by concealed but watchful eyes. I had to say goodbye to many who were close to me. Such was the curse of my notoriety.

Perhaps one day, history, society, they will judge me poorly. Perhaps they are right. Perhaps they will only recall the torment I inflicted upon those who were my enemies. Perhaps they will forget the good that I did; the lives I saved, be they innocent or world leader. Perhaps I will be vilified; the greatest criminal and bringer of woe. Perhaps they will forget who I am, who I was.

1ljkin7,mzlgx2g,"""So let me get this straight,"" Becky said as she examined the object. ""This right here is some kinda magic doohickey and it'll turn me into one a them magic girl things like in those Japanese cartoons.""

""I...suppose that's accurate."" Replied the animal. To Becky, it looked like some kind of cat/dog hybrid with pink fur. It was cute in a weird way. It had a name, but Becky had not been paying much attention to that. ""But very simplified.""

""How's it supposed to work anyways?""

The wand looked like something out of a Halloween costume. She couldn't tell what it was made of, save that it wasn't plastic or metal. But it was yellow, had a heart on the end of it, and held some kind of ruby or something in the middle of said heart.

""You must chant the magic words and let the magic flow through you. Don't worry, I will teach you what to say.""

""Yeah, nah. I ain't doin that. Just gimme the basics. None oh that catchphrase stuff.""

The animal recoiled in shock. Not saying the words? That was practically blasphemy. But if the chosen wanted to try it, then who was he to refuse. The animal guided Becky into activating the wand without saying the words. It took longer, but she got it eventually.

""What the hell am I wearing!?"" Becky practically screeched when she was done changing.

""That is your...""

""I don't care what it is! I ain't wearin it!""

The outfit looked like some kind of gymnastics princess uniform. Way too tight in some places, with billowy ribbons of all things trailing around her shoulders, arms and hips. And pink. So, so much pink. 

Becky took a deep breath and undid her transformation. She looked at the wand. And at the stone set into it.

""I am sorry, but as long as you are the chosen, you must use the magic of that wand to fight."" The animal said. ""And that means wearing the uniform.""

""Hey, quick question. In this here wand thing, this fancy rock's the important part, right?""

""I suppose that is the focus, yes. But the rest of the wand is...where are you going?""

""To the workshop. This wand's junk. I'm gonna take this rock out and put it in somethin better.""

""What? No! You can't do that!""

""To hell I can't. Just watch. I'mma make somethin' way better.""

Becky was already out the door before the animal could say anything else. It scampered after Becky, who was heading out to a shack in the backyard of her house. She headed in and down a flight of stairs. The basement of the seemingly simple building was anything but. It was well stocked with metal, tools, and even a small forge. 

""What...what is this place?""

""This's my daddy's gunsmith. He's taught me how ta use it just fine. And now...""

She took a chisel and a mallet and began to gently tap at the ruby, working to free it from the rest of the wand.

""I'm gonna use it to make a much better weapon than this wand.""

""But...but why? Why would you overturn centuries of tradition. And you don't even know if it'll work, or what it'll do.""

""Oh, hunny, you just leave everythin' ta me. And I know it'll work, cause I'm gonna make it work. Listen here. I'm a Texas girl through and through, and I'll be damned if I use anythin' other'n a rifle I made with these two hands. Now you can help or watch, either way, this's gettin' done.""",19

The message from the Science Association of the Human Galactic Republic flickers.  
""Dear Adam Johnson, we hereby inform you, that our archivists, historians, and A.I. assistants, have found that an ancient book on gravity, and the basic laws of physics, written in the 1st Middle-Ages of the Human history, back on our Mother Planet, Earth, is authored by you.  
The writing, reasoning has been compared with the more than 19 quintillion articles on physics, and comparing it to your 3983 articles published, we deduced a 97.8% similarity.   
Taking into consideration your current projects, we are certain that the book: ""Physics, and the workings of elemental forces."" is your creation."" the message read.  
I sighed, and look at another screen.  
""Time Travel possibilities..."" the article's title read.

  
It seems not only I succeed to create time travel, but somehow I get back to the 1st Medieval Ages of humanity.  
Why do I know that I get back, but not send back that book?  
Because I would never write a basic book like that today.  
The market is too saturated, and it would not get published.  
Okay.  
Now what?  
Am I to report my conjecture?   
Or am I to wait until time travel is approved, and proven to be doable?  
Hmm.

  
I went with the 2nd choice, and submitted my findings on new physic laws, and the possibilities of time travel.  
In about a month or so, it has been proven, and I have gained Grade 9 funding, and a few rewards, while all my researches that led up to this finding have been concealed.  
It is a bit annoying, but now, I am a Galactic funded researcher.  
It feels good, but bad.  
Why?  
Because I have to make sure that time travel is safe, and created in a span of 5 years.  
Why?  
They haven't told me, but I think the A.I.s have predicted something.

  
I look at the time machine, and then at the message from the Council.  
""The 1st Medieval Ages have been intensified by several enemy civilizations.  
Mathematics, and sciences have been linked even more to ""sorcery"" than in our natural history, and so did other sciences like medicine, and herbology.

1lj65ct,mzhji3x,"Jacob put the finishing touches on the formula at the bottom of his writing tablet. He read through the proof, but something nagged at him. He set it aside and went outside for some fresh air. 

He looked down at the city of spires and lights and felt a swelling of pride at what he and his clan had achieved. Their remote island in the South Pacific was unlike any other in the region, rich with minerals and advanced technology. Most of the modern world lived in the northern hemisphere as was historically the case, but their ancestors sought solitude and distance from the teachings of their peers and were able to keep their advancements cloaked from the north. Visitors to their island would never breach the string of villages along the coast with their grass skirts, tattooed bodies and old traditions. 

Jacob sighed, walked back into his villa and returned to his digital slate. He immediately saw his mistake, tapping the section with a digital pen and correcting the 〰️ with a ➰.

“That was a close one,” said a voice from behind. “Do you know how long we waited for you to complete the proof?”

Jacob spun around, knocking his chair to the floor. He wielded the digital pen like a knife. 

“You going to poke my eye out with that?” the stranger asked. 

“Who are you? How did you get here? I’ve never seen you in the village before.”

“You couldn’t have, Jacob,” he said, “because I just arrived, thanks to you. My name is Shiloh.”

“You’re not making any sense,” Jacob said. 

“Put down the digital pen before you wipe us all out of existence and I will explain,” Shiloh said. 

Hesitantly, as if his very life were at risk, Jacob set the pen down next to the tablet. 

“Okay,” Jacob said. “Explain.”

“I time traveled back to you. I literally popped into existence once you completed your formula correctly.”

“Don’t be daft. Do you know how insane and improbable that sounds?”

“Well, have you thought through this whole time travel thing completely? I mean really considered every aspect of it?” Shiloh asked. 

“Fair enough.” Jacob considered Shiloh a moment. The traveler watched as an epiphany dawned on Jacob’s face. 

“And there it is,” Shiloh said. 

“How long have you waited for me to get it right?”

“Well,” Shiloh said, “technically not long at all. But in terms of years, it’s taken us about three hundred of them to get a practical prototype working. We’ve lost good people trying to contact you.”

“This may sound counterintuitive, but why?”

“There was a book written in the Middle Ages by a scholar who called himself Nostradamus. That book led to a number of predictions that people interpreted for many centuries later to be visionary. They tried to fit his visions into actual events in history and correlate them with events yet to pass.”

“That sounds like utter nonsense and mysticism,” Jacob said. “Even my proof disproves the notion of predicting the future.”

“Yeah,” Shiloh said a bit sheepishly, “well, you didn’t really get everything right. Enough, but not all of it. Others in your future have made some improvements and corollaries.”

“Yeah? Like what?” Jacob moved towards the tablet. 

Shiloh pulled from his pocket a device that looked like a metal wand with lights and switches. “Step away from the tablet,” he said. “Everything is still fragile and one swipe of the pen can shatter the future.”

Jacob paused, looking at Shiloh. “What’s that?”

Shiloh pressed a button and the tip of the wand glowed and emitted a high pitched tone. The tablet switched off. Shiloh put the device away. 

“What did you just do?”

“Oh, nothing really. Your tablet is fine. I just drained it of energy so you could not alter the formula prematurely. After you charge it back up, it’ll be fine.”

“So why are you here? What does any of this have to do with this Nostradammit fellow you mentioned?”

“Wanna go for a trip, Jacob?”

“Why would I ….” Jacob turned white as a ghost. “No.”

“Yes.”

“No.”

“Did I mention you disappeared shortly after you completed your master work never to be seen again?”

“No, no, no!” There was a little panic in Jacob’s denials. 

Shiloh sighed. “I’m afraid so. You know what I’m saying is true.”

“No, he doesn’t,” said a stranger sitting on the single bed in the corner. 

Shiloh and Jacob turn to face the new intruder. 

Shiloh shook his head sadly. “I was afraid of this. Your presence complicates everything.”

“You know this woman?” Jacob asked. 

“Not in the least,” Shiloh said. “But our models predicted such a possibility.”

“What he’s telling you,” the stranger said as she stood, “is a load of cow manure.”

“And where are you from?” Jacob asked. 

“That’s not the relevant question,” she said. “Why am I here?”

“Obviously to protect your future,” Shiloh said. “Some alternative time potential.”

“Wrong,” she said. “I’m from your future, Shiloh, not some alternative possibility. You see, that’s one of the predictive models your team got wrong. There aren’t an infinite number of possible futures vying for existence. There’s just the one timeline and we’re all on it. And sending Jacob back to the Middle Ages to become Nostradamus is absolutely horse shit.”

“Liar,” Shiloh said, anger creeping into his voice. 

“I need a drink,” Jacob said, a migraine starting to throb.

The three of them stared at each other in a Mexican standoff. 

“Don’t be hasty,” the woman said. “We can logic this out. The future and the past depend on what we decide in the next twenty minutes.”

“So, whiskey all around?” Jacob asked, moving to the bar. 

“I like mine neat,” Shiloh said. 

“Make mine a double,” the woman said. “Time travel is thirsty business.”",12

1ljdqlq,mzk0cap,"The carriage slowed as they crossed from the cobbles of the street to the smooth, flat flagstones of the palace courtyard. Lancier heard the guards hail the coachman, but little of the conversation that followed it. She'd moved, crossed the carriage, was suddenly sat close beside him.

""Remember the plan. No warnings, no alarms. Play your part."" Her voice was low, a murmur right next to his ear that in other circumstances might almost have been seductive. Right now, it just made him angrier.

""I remember. You didn't give me a choice.""

""Good. Now put your arm around me. We have to be convincing.""

He obeyed stiffly, holding his arm rigid around her slim shoulders. Still, she snuggled closer next to him, one hand reaching up to the buttons of his doublet and starting to work on the top one.

""What are you doing?"" He almost forgot to whisper in shock.

""What I said. We need to be convincing, and no one will be fooled if your uniform isn't quite a bit more disheveled."" Suddenly her hands were everywhere, opening a further three buttons on his doublet, reaching upwards to ruffle through his carefully-ordered hair. She gripped his chin and turned him towards her, then lunged upwards, placing fierce kisses all over the left side of his face, his neck, his ear. The attack was swift and devastating, leaving him no time to respond.

She only stopped when the carriage door creaked open, dropping back onto the seat and leaving him gasping. The guard had to repeat himself several times before Lancier had the presence of mind to respond.

""State your name and business."" It was the expected challenge, and yet it wasn't in the tone he was used to at all. In fact, the guard almost seemed to be amused.

""Sir Lancier, Knight of the Vow, returning back to the palace."" 

""And your companion?"" The guard was definitely grinning now. Lancier hoped he enjoyed the joke; it was likely to be the last one either of them would hear.

The reminder of treason was enough to shake him out of the fog of embarrassment and confusion. He started to answer, but was pre-empted. She leant across him, dark hair unbound and red smeared across her lips. ""Lady Reina, Captain. Visiting an old ...friend for the evening.""

""It's sergeant, my lady."" Lancier watched the guard's eyes flicker across the dark blue silk of Reina's robe, the silver insignia at her wrists. It was a near-perfect copy of the royal sorcerers' garb, but cut just that little lower, fit a little more snugly. Enough to both convince and distract. ""Can you vouch for her, Sir? The lady is not known to me.""

Everything up until now was defensible, could be explained away as an oversight not a betrayal. Still, he had no choice. He stared ahead while speaking, not willing to meet the guard's eye. ""That's correct, sergeant. I've known the sorcerer for many years."" Not technically a lie. ""She's a member of the Lannisport coterie, here on royal business."" Enough of a lie to see him hanged.

The guard stepped back. ""Thank you, Sir. I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening. My Lady."" He swung the door closed and called out to the coachman to drive on.

Lancier breathed out slowly as Reina disentangled herself from him, returning to her seat on the other side of the carriage. ""Good work. Just the right blend of shame and officiousness.""

""I've just betrayed my king, my country, and my vow. I don't expect much from you, but perhaps you could refrain from mocking me while I do your bidding?"" He kept his voice low, but each word was snarled out. ""I know betrayal is second nature to you, but I mourn my lost honour.""

She matched his sneer, her face showing the same rage he felt. ""If honour meant that much to you, you'd have done this long ago. Now focus -- we still have more work to do.""",5

June huffs. “Then why didn’t you say that before I brought him over?”

“Umm, well, you see…” Bruce side eyes his wife, Renee.

“We thought that was implied,” Renee says. “Where did you even find an alien boyfriend?”

Without skipping a beat, June says, “Area 51, of course.”

Bruce’s eyes widen. “You mean to tell me you infiltrated a heavily guarded military posting just to find a boyfriend?”

June chuckles. “No, that would be silly. I went in looking for proof aliens existed.”

“Naturally,” Bruce says.

“And you walked out with a boyfriend?” Renee asks.

“Yeah. Life is funny like that, huh?” June pauses. “So, do you guys want to meet him?”

Renee and Bruce exchange concerned glances before Bruce says, “Sure, we’d love to.”

“Great, let me get him,” June says, running to the door. “I’ll be right back.”

Bruce looks at Renee. “You don’t think it’s an actual alien, do you?”

Renee laughs. “There’s no way. You know how June gets.”

“Knock knock,” June says as she pokes her head through the front door. “Me and Kersflag are here.”

Bruce can feel his stomach tightening as his daughter walks through the door with a bright green blow up alien attached to her hip.

“Mom, Dad, this is Kersflag.”

1liw543,mzfteu0,"When Alfred told his daughter, ""Whoever they are, bring them home"", he knew to prepare himself for a non-human. It helps when his god, Lord Elvari, is dating a member of his church committee. Or having to partake in the wedding ceremonies of unholy unions of humans and Deep Ones from Innsmouth.

""Dad, this is James,"" Jessie signalled to the young man standing next to her. ""And this is my dad, Alfred.""

""You [two together sound like trouble](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/14e8boo/wp_one_can_easily_distinguish_a_true_veteran/jou72fa/),"" Alfred said, in an attempt to lighten the mood. He felt the heavy tension in the air. The trembling from James.

""See, dad, this isn’t what you think,"" Jessie tried to reassure her father. ""I'm not dating one of the supernatural entities in this town. James is human.""

On the surface.

Alfred had interacted with Elvari's minions long enough to know one. Even if they wore a human disguise. But now was not the time to spill the beans.

So, he invited the young couple to sit for dinner. The topics drifted from how they met (at summer camp) to any plans they had for the future (none so far). He asked how much they know about each other. But most of all, despite his apparent lack of experience, Alfred needed to know if James genuinely loved his daughter, and was willing to be by her side for the rest of her life. Which would be trivial to him if James was exactly what Alfred thought he was.

""Jessie, do you mind doing the dishes? While I have a chat with James, one man to another?""

""Sure, dad!"" She replied back nervously.

Confident she was far away in the kitchen, he turned to James, who was shaking like a jello. Struggling to maintain his human shape.

""Why the deception?"" Alfred leaned in and whispered. ""We're in Innsmouth. Jessie knows about Shoggoths like you. I work with your kind all the time, with Lord Elvari. You might be able to mislead Jessie, but not me.""

""Its not intentional..."" the young Shoggoth stammered, greyish goo and tentacles slipping through the crumbling disguise. ""She saw me in human shape, so I kept it. She didn’t ask, so I didn't say.""

""Promise me you're not secretly waiting to wear her skin,"" Alfred squeezed a tentacle with an iron grip. ""Or I will let your creator know you hurt the daughter of his head priest. I will tell Lord Elvari to turn you into jello and slurp you with his slime pudding.""

""No, no, I promise,"" James wobbled and bobbed his head. ""I really, really like her for real.""

""Swear upon the name of the Lord of Innsmouth.""

""I swear! Please, I love her and I will take care of her. I won't allow anyone or anything eat her or wear her skin,"" the Shoggoth was still shaking. ""I will be on my best behavior or may the Lord smite me.""

""Good kid,"" he patted James. ""I will retire to my room and give you two some space. But if you do anything funny, I have my ways of knowing.""

And with that, he performed one of those ""I have my eyes on you"" gesture before walking towards his study.

**
--

""Your father is scary,"" James, now back into his human look, remarked, when Jessie came to sit next to him on the couch. ""I have never been terrified to sit near a human until he came along.""

""Oh, James, its okay. He won't bite. Dad is only worried about me. A bit of an overprotective father.""

""I see where Lord Elvari gets the overprotectiveness of his adopted kid Jane, My Lord almost killed me for pushing her into the kiddie pool once,"" James started to peel away at the human mask. ""So, before both of them turn me into a Shoggoth snack to go with slime puddings, I'm confessing.""

1liw543,mzgeako,"""Hello Mr. and Mrs. Wilder, it's a pleasure to meet you"", the young woman said perfunctorily, eyes not quite meeting theirs.

A soft alarm was ringing in the depths of my head; there was something here that was off. I looked her over from head to toe, trying to determine what was out of place. She was about 5'5"", brunette, with a headband neatly tucking most of her hair back behind her ears, though a rogue strand had escaped and hung askew by her left eyebrow. She wore a blouse under a comfortable sweater; one of the sleeves bunched slightly leading to slightly uneven wrist visibility. Her pants were pocketed slacks; not too formal, but slightly nicer than casual; the end of a colourful lanyard peeked out the top of one pocket. Finally, her shoes were comfortable and casual clogs with a glossy finish. Overall, a very ordinary, if ever so slightly  disheveled woman.

*So what am I not seeing*?

""Dad, you're being weird..."", Alison said quietly.

Snapping out of my investigation, I looked to my daughter, then to my wife. Each had a half embarrassed, half accusatory look.

""My apologies--"", I started to say, but looking back to the lady standing before me, her face was blank and unmoving.

""It's actually Dr. Wilder."" I corrected, narrowing my eyes slightly.

A look flashed across her face. *What was that? Panic? Puzzlement? Amusement?*

*""Marcus!""* my wife chastised, a horrified expression plain on her face. She strode up to the woman, taking her hand in a welcoming, apologetic handshake. ""You'll have to excuse my husband, he's had a very long day at work and seems to have left his manners behind in his rush to get home."" She gave me a cutting side-eye as she said that last bit. She moved aside to make way for my daughter and the woman to enter the house.

Alison walked in, holding the woman's hand, but she slipped it free. She stood quite still and looked a little pale, as if she knew I was onto her and didn't dare give me any more clues.

""Maybe this was a mistake..."" she said nervously, ""I'm sorry to have bothered you Mr. and Mrs.-- I mean Dr. Wilder. I'll just lea--""

""*That's it!*"" I shouted. The mystery in me unravelling in an instant.

*Her voice!*",24
1liw543,mzh41hi,"The first thing I saw when I opened the door was what I would charitably describe as a collection of wrong angles pretending to be a person. It stood politely, all seven feet of it, wrapped in what might have been a tailored suit if suits had previously been designed to accommodate segmented limbs, armored carapace plating, and a head shaped like a geodesic dome.

Then I looked past it and saw my daughter. She was holding its… hand? Claw? Manipulator? She smiled at me like it was a regular Tuesday.

“Hi Dad. This is Vrekk.”

Vrekk inclined his head. A strange noise came out of him. It sounded like a modem from the ’90s dying in a microwave. My daughter squeezed his appendage affectionately.

I reminded myself to breathe. Then I stepped back and waved them inside.

“Of course. Come in. Can I get either of you something to drink? We have water, soda… do you drink liquids?”

“I’m fine,” said Vrekk. The words were understandable but came from somewhere deep in his chest, as if someone had taught a garbage disposal English. “Thank you for your hospitality.”

I gestured toward the living room. “Please, sit wherever is structurally reinforced.”

They chose the couch. It creaked. I winced.

My daughter looked nervous for the first time. “So, yeah. I didn’t want to keep this from you forever. But I knew it might be… surprising.”

“It is, butI meant what I said. Whoever you’re with, I want to meet them. And I want you to be able to bring them home.”

She smiled again. “Thanks, Dad.”

Vrekk reached out one of his upper limbs and rested it gently on her shoulder. The plates there hissed slightly as they shifted into place. My eye twitched.

“So, Vrekk,” I said, making my voice the polite kind of neutral usually reserved for job interviews and landmine disposal, “What do you do?”

“I am a conflict resolution strategist for the diplomatic corps of the Fourth Shell Dominion.”

“Ah,” I said. “Shell Dominion.”

“Yes. We are not the same as the Cracked Shell Hegemony. That would be offensive.”

“Right. Wouldn’t want to make that mistake.” I offered a smile that probably looked like a grimace. “And how did you two meet?”

Vrekk made a noise that sounded almost like a chuckle. “She was leading a student delegation to the United Species Summit. We disagreed on the formatting of the Earth section in the unity charter. The discussion became… vigorous.”

“I hit him with a binder,” my daughter added, proud.

“And I fell in admiration,” Vrekk said.

I blinked. “Literally or metaphorically?”

“Yes,” said Vrekk.

There was a long pause.

“Well,” I said finally, “you seem very… diplomatic.”

He inclined his head again. “I have undergone fifteen millennia of ancestral memory training and possess a fully autonomous empathy cluster. I am certified to mediate interstellar border disputes, resource allocation skirmishes, and reproductive contract negotiations among hive-clan polycells.”

I turned to my daughter. “Wow. A real overachiever. Just like your mother.”

She laughed. I looked back at Vrekk.

“Now listen,” I said, leaning forward just enough to make the chair creak like it might file a complaint, “I have only one condition for anyone dating my daughter. Treat her with respect. Love her, support her, and be there when she needs you. If you do that, I don’t care what your skeleton is made of or how many hearts you have.”

“Three,” said Vrekk. “All flame-bound.”

“Great,” I said. “Triple the heartbreak if you mess it up.”

Vrekk didn’t flinch. “I will not. She is cherished beyond standard biological metrics.”

My daughter blushed. “He writes poetry.”

“I’m sure it’s very lyrical in… whatever your language is.”

“It has no spoken form,” Vrekk said. “But if you allow me to secrete a listening gland on your-”

“Nope,” I said, standing up. “Dinner’s ready.”

We all filed into the kitchen. Vrekk was very careful with the kitchen chair. It groaned but held.

They stayed for three hours. We ate. We talked. Vrekk explained what courting rituals were like when your species primarily communicated through shifting bioluminescent patterns and infrared pheromone plumes. My daughter showed me a video. I was mostly disturbed but tried to be supportive.

When they left, I walked them to the door.

“Thanks again,” my daughter said, hugging me. “For being cool about this.”

I hugged her back. “You’re my kid. If you’re happy, I’m happy. That’s the rule.”

She pulled back and smiled.

Then Vrekk extended a limb toward me.

I hesitated. Then I took it. It was surprisingly warm.

“You are a remarkable father,” he said.

“You’re not so bad yourself,” I said. “Just don’t give me any grandspawn that hatch in the walls.”

Vrekk’s dome twitched. “Our offspring are raised communally in thermal nurseries the size of your human cruise ships.”

I stared.

“I was joking,” I said.

“I was not,” he replied.

They left.

I stood in the doorway for a long minute, then turned off the porch light and walked back inside.

I had a lot of reading to do about hive-clan polycells.",24
1liw543,mzhg1he,"James sighed as he lit his cigarette. Tonight was the night; his daughter was bringing home her, to use his child's very incessant terminology, ""partner"". He tucks the pack of L&M Reds back into his shirt pocket as he sits down on the rocking chair of the porch. He swiftly remembers the conversation he'd had with his daughter. 

--

""Dad, for the last time, I'm not bringing my partner over for dinner!"" 

Cecilia said, sternly. Exactly as James had taught her to. Screaming at your family got everyone nowhere fast, and if you couldn't have a civil disagreement with someone, then it was time to walk away. That or grab a bottle of bourbon and settle for the long haul. Thankfully, this conversation was not one of the latter. 

""I'm not understanding why you don't want to. I've already told you that no matter who you date, I'm happy for you. I want them to feel like part of the family. Who knows? Maybe they'll be my child-in-law."" 

James retorts, shrugging as he makes his turkey sandwich. In rural Texas, James had been called one of the Good 'Ol Boys more times than he could count. But he was not about to be like his own father, who would pick up a belt or a stick at the first mention of one of his kids being unlike ""polite"" society. He'd done his absolute best to be the opposite, encouraging his daughter from the moment she'd come out as bisexual. 

""Because... Because I'm just not, okay?"" 

Cecilia says, her arms gesturing vaguely in only the way a very exasperated teenager does. Her arms proceed to cross over the kitchen island, her cheeks pouting ever so slightly. James smiles; that'll never not be cute. 

""Tell you what, I'll wait until you're ready and stop asking. When you do, I get to rub it in your face that it's not as serious as you think it is."" 

Immediately James can see the hamster running in his daughter's head. Her face scrunches, her eyes squint, and she takes a shallow breath. He knew the moment that last mannerism seeped out; the sign of an offer she couldn't refuse. But to her credit, Cecilia takes a few seconds to answer. 

""Deal."" 

--

James chuckles at the memory. Ahh, kids. Too dumb to look at the bigger picture and predict the future. This would be embarrassment fuel for the rest of her life. He couldn't wait to tell the story at the family gatherings. Or when he was drop dead drunk. 

He leans back in the chair and takes a drag from the cigarette; the only habit he'd inherited from his father that he couldn't defy. Nicotine addiction was a bitch, but so was having a minor breakdown alongside withdrawal. So, the cigarettes were here to stay. 

""Dad?"" 

James startles a little bit when his daughter calls out to him from the treeline instead of the driveway; she'd left with her car, right? Why the hell was she walking out of the woods instead. He turns, the dark of dusk still a little too smothering for him to see well, especially with the light of the cigarette in his mouth. He reaches up and pulls it from his lips, trying to see what's out there. 

""Cecilia? I thought you were going to get your partner, not have a romp through the forest."" 

There's the snapping of twigs and the movement of something big. After a second, something emerges from the dark and James sorely wishes he'd brought the lever action. 

The thing is huge, furry and had eyes that gleam like a dog's. A muzzle half as long as a horses', feet that weren't human and a body structure that, in his panic, James bets could tear open an Abrams Tank and be none the worse for wear. 

""Holy piss-"" 

He begins to say, before it moves it's big arms and his daughter plops down onto the grass. She takes a few steps forward, her hand coming up to meet the massive monster's own freakish appendage. She walks the creature forward, her eyes worried and her posture unsure. 

""Dad, this is Lobo. Yes, she's a werewolf. And yes, she's my partner."" 

James stares, somehow still holding his cigarette despite the pants-shitting anxiety he was feeling. After a second his brain catches up. Then he watches the big creature; Lobo, tilt her head to the side at a 45° angle. Like a big fucking dog. He sighs. 

""Fuck, I think you win the bet.""",17
1liw543,mzhm53i,"\*New Writer\*

""Elody?!""  

I couldn't believe my eyes.  It was Elody, the three-armed Fae queen with 4 wings and a shitty attitude.  I banished that son'va bitch to the nighto-sphere years ago and now Julia, MY OWN DAMNED DAUGHTER, brings her into my home.  Lotsa questions.  How'd they meet? Did Juila summon Her? Is she being used to get to me? How can Elody wear such gaudy clothes?

My revolver's in plain site;  I put my hand on it.

Elody says.  ""It's so *very good* to see you Emily. I know this must be quite the shock, but I promise you my intentions with your daughter are... *pure.*  Ever since meeting her I feel like a new woman.  She's brought the golden light back to every one of my sapphire eyes"".  Sure.  Emily looks around confused ""Mom... what?  How do you know my girlfriend?""  Oh Julia, if the world was pure as you.

I cock the hammer back.  Elody's 7 eyes turn fiery red and she starts to grow, times running out.

""MOM. NO!  WE'RE. IN. LOVE!  IF YOU KILL HER YOU BEST PUT THE SECOND ONE THROUGH ME!

I relax the hammer.  Goddamnit.  Elody's eyes relax and she shrinks.

Juila.  My desert sunflower.  She speaks.  ""Ok mom I'm not sure how you know Elody already; but I brought my GIRLFRIEND home to meet MY FUCKING MOTHER and we are having a GODDAMNED PLEASANT MEAL.  You HEAR ME?!""

So we do.  I've been working the grill all day and the steaks are perfect; they're big too.  Can't survive on this side of the Emerald Arch if you don't keep your strength up.  But nobody told me a damned fae devil was dining with us!  I'd have made three more steaks.  Then I'd have eaten them and gone to war.  But fuck it, Julia likes bad girls.

Elody reaches for the steak I was going for.  I cock my hammer back.  Elody picks a different steak.

""Emily, I really would like to put this rather nasty business of you banishing me into the void of woe behind us.  That was last week""  More like 30 damn years.  ""I've got a promising new business, and all my mortal souls have been released.  I'm a *changed* lady"".

Well that's interesting.  She can't lie, I know that much.  She must've found a new power source.  I wish I could trust her.  She was so fun in my 120's.

We finish the food and I show them the door.  ""Now you listen here hellmoth.  Julia's her own woman, and I trust her to take care of herself, and to make good choices and live with 'em.  But if anything happens to her I will hunt you down across every realm that exists and the one's that don't yet.  I give you my word.  I'll jam my boot so far up you're mana-hole that it kills your family tree.""  ***And she knows that I can.***

They leave.  In the distance I can see Elody sad and Juila consoling her.  They do make a cute couple.

I really, reeeaally wish Juila wasn't into bad girls.  But I guess that's the role model she had.",10
1liw543,mzi789m,"Which is worse: your son dating a drug addict or a troublemaker?

The answer is he dates an alien.

I stood looking at my son who was grinning widely, showing his white teeth, his hand holding the smaller hand of another man. If that was a man… I glanced at the person standing next to my son. Blonde hair, chalky pale skin, unnatural purple eyes, and a blank face. He looked like a human being. If I hadn't met an alien before, I might have believed he was just some kind of weirdo.

""Dad! This is Chase."" Aaron said, pointing at the creature called Chase. ""He is my boyfriend.""

Boyfriend, that word shot into my head. I don't have a problem with my son's taste at all. I accept everything he is, but knowing that he brought an alien home was beyond expectations.

I stare at Chase.

He stared back at me.

We stared at each other in silence for a moment before Aaron coughed, causing me to quickly invite them in.

I watched as my son led his boyfriend into the living room, the guy Chase following him with a blank expression like a doll. I could feel the dread rising, my stomach feel uneasy and my hands itching. I wanted to reach for my phone to call my boss and tell him I had found another alien. But I can't do that if I don't know if he's a legally registered alien or not.

I know Aaron had some weird obsessions since he was a kid. He likes to get into mysteries, magic, space, anything that humans still can't find the answers to. I know it's because he's my son, but if he accidentally dates an alien without knowing, that's a bit too much of a coincidence....

I sat down in the seat across from Aaron and Chase, their hands still hold together. I glanced cautiously at Chase, then at my son, who had a strangely proud look on his face.

""So how did you guys meet?...."" I asked, trying to create a conversation.

""I met him behind school."" He said, leaning against Chase affectionately. ""He fell from the sky, can you believe it? It's like God sent him to me.""

I feel a headache.

""And Chase...."" I slowly turned to look at him, his unnatural eyes staring back at me made me feel uneasy. ""How could you date my son?""

Ches didn't answer immediately. His eyes narrowed into a thin line, lips parted.

""I don't know how I ended up like this....""

""Honey, don't say that!"" Aaron wrapped his arms around Chase, pulling him closer and resting the chin on his head. ""You told me yourself that you don't hate me and that you feel differently about me than you do about other human beings.""

My eyebrows twitched.

""You know he's not human?"" I asked out loud.

Aaron paused, turning to look at me with wide eyes, obviously not expecting me to realize that his boyfriend wasn't human. But I didn't expect my son to know already.

""Wait, you know?"" He asked, his arms automatically wrapping around Chase protectively.

My eyebrows furrowed. ""Aaron, I respect you, but can I ask you why you involved with an alien- No, how do you date an alien???""

""Dad, I know what you're thinking, but I love him!"" Aaron spoke firmly, pulling Chase closer until his cheek was against his chest. The expression on his face remained blank, and bored.

""Chase is everything. He's perfect. Dad, you can't make us break up just because he's different from us! He has a heart and feelings too!""

""I haven't even-""

""I love him more than anything in the world. I will never let him go! I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him!""

Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

""I'm not saying you guys have to break up!"" I shouted at Aaron, he finally stopped being dramatic and his brown eyes sparkled as he replied, ""really?""

I sighed and massaged the bridge of my nose.

""Of course I love you and I won't stop your happiness. Just.... I'm glad you're serious and.... serious about it."" I don't dare to say the words in my head directly.

The stupid smile returned to Aaron's face.

""Really? You accept us?"" He stood up immediately and held my hand tightly. ""Thank you, Dad. I'll come back to visit sometime.""

My eyebrow twitched again.

""What do you just say?""

""I'm moving to an apartment with Chase."" Aaron's smile widened. ""I saved up money and found a nice apartment for us, but according to the tradition of Chase's planet, we must first ask permission from our parents before a couple can live together.""

""Hold on-""

""I'm going up to get my stuff!""

I didn't have time to ask anything more, as I watched my son ran up the stairs, leaving me and Chase behind. I glanced at him and he stared back at me. Now I realized that he never blinked.

""So.... how do you like my son?"" I asked hesitantly, my brow furrowed.

""I don't know, I don't even know what love is."" Chess replied honestly, his face blank. ""We creatures do not have gender, desires, or needs. We just live our lives day by day and our match is all about genetic compatibility, and I don't think I'm genetically compatible with Aaron's, since he's a human....""

He turned his face towards the stairs, his eyes narrowed with a light color in his pupils.

""I don't know why I agreed to him but...he was just nice and sweet. I guess."" He said, his lips curved into a small smile on his face.

I looked at him silently before let out a sign through my mouth.

Maybe it's not so bad.

At least I can be sure that my son won't be eaten...

""Wait, did your species eat your mate?"" I looked up and asked him.

He shrugged. ""Maybe.""",7
1liw543,mzg2o90,"It was not what I was expecting.

When I first tripped across it...I kind of expected it. I was hurt, but I kind of expected it. My daughter was home from college, and had borrowed my laptop to do an assignment while she was home on Fall Break. When she was finished, it appeared that she simply folded it down into rest mode, rather than closing any of her screens.

When I opened it to check my e-mail, I found a word document on corporate ethics law, with the cursor still open and blinking on the last page, an internet window with a dozen tabs open, mostly things like Poli-Sci hub, the Harvard Law Library, LexisNexis, her college website, or some section of it, with a chat similar to Slack or Discord, where most of the chat was clearly related to her Business Law class, tabs from Ulta Beauty, Sephora, and Amazon, a Spotify window, a DeviantArt page, Patreon, and the website for one of her favorite coffee brands. Nothing unexpected or shocking, really. Truth be told, I thought nothing I could find would shock or bother me.

After all, from the day we adopted her, when she was 14, she knew that one adoptive parent was non-binary, the other was trans, and we knew that her bio parents had kicked her out because of her relationship with another girl, because they were evangelical Christians who wouldn't accept such “sinful” behavior under their roof, and she had been in and around LGBTQIA spaces with us, and our esoteric hobbies, from the day she was adopted.  
  
I remember when she was 16, and her vibrator fell out from between her mattress and box spring when I was changing the sheets on her bed. She was embarrassed as hell. I just found it amusing, and left a pamphlet on proper toy cleaning, along with a bottle of cleaning solution someplace where she would easily find it.

It was when I popped open Discord, intending to reply to a message that required more than a simple sentence or two, where I preferred having a full keyboard to trying to type out something that could turn into an involved conversation on my tiny phone keyboard, that I saw the chat, as she had left herself logged into Discord, with the most recent private chat with a friend open. Still, I might have just ignored it and logged her out, and logged in myself if it wasn't for the boobs. When I opened the discord window, an already open image of a massive set of bare breasts filled most of the screen with the sentence “Here's a little reminder of what you're missing. I bet you can't wait to suck on these again.” written above the picture. The chat...well, the best description I can make is part romance novel, and part erotica. There was the usual love-letter type stuff about how they couldn't bear to be apart, ranging to the slightly racier things like how she kept a certain article of clothing in her bed “so I can smell your scent on my pillow to fall asleep” to downright pornographic descriptions of what they were going to do to each other the moment they got back to school.",12
1liw543,mzgpep1,"Damn it, June, not again. At this point, wonder how long it would take until she actually brings a real alien lol.

1liw543,mzgpq5b,"Not a good start to the relationship, and this feels more of a potential disaster between James and Jessie more than the parents. That said, I doubt Jessie is truly clueless either considering that previous talk with Elvari. Cheers to slime pudding actually becoming a trend too.

So, how will Jessie react to this? Also, is James' Lord all right with his relationship with Jessie?

Great work on writing this!",11
1liw543,mzgebg3,"Her words had suddenly struck a chord in my memory.

""I knew something was off! The lanyard, the clogs...you're one of the nurses at my hospital!""

The young woman blanched farther, her already pale skin becoming a near white pallor as she looked at my daughter in terror.

I was suddenly struck with immense guilt. ""Oh no no, I'm so sorry! I see how this must seem from your side of things. It's totally fine you're dating my daughter!""

Her eyes darted back and forth between mine and Alison's, not quite sure if this was a test.

""You work in the blood lab right? 3rd floor? I recognize your voice! I couldn't quite place what was bothering me until you said my name! I immediately recognized it from the intercom system!"" I explained, trying to calm the poor girl.

I realized she was still standing outside by herself while I rambled to her.

""Please come in! I'm so sorry about that, I get a little in my own head at times"", I apologized, shaking my head in an effort to clear my foot from my mouth.

She seemed to soften a little at the invitation, her shoulders relaxing slightly. I noticed similar shifts in posture from my wife and daughter as well.

""I'm terribly sorry, could you remind me your name? I remember it being something a little unusual, but I can't quite recall.""

The girl nodded and gave a shy, embarrassed smile. ""Well actually, my name was supposed to be *Noelle,* but my mother had terrible handwriting and they thought she put '*Noette*' on my birth certificate"", she explained, ""so everyone just calls me *Not.*""

She suddenly seemed much more upbeat and energetic now that the misunderstanding was put to rest. Still, I cringed once more thinking about the first impression I had just made.

""I can't believe what a fool I've made of myself tonight. From the look on my face, you'd probably have thought I was so suspicious of you; like I was doubting whether you were a human being or something!"" I caught Alison rolling her eyes with thinly veiled annoyance.

Nonplussed, I continued, ""I'm certain I'm going to be hearing about ""the time Marcus terrified our daughter's girlfriend"" for the rest of my days"", I said, looking to Mrs. Wilder with a rueful expression I hoped was endearing. Her annoyance was even more thinly veiled.

Not laughed, lips curling wide enough to show canines that were a touch too long.

""Well,"" she said, ""I'm sure that won’t be for much longer.”",26
1liw543,mzg2rcs,"Nothing I hadn't seen before, and nothing I hadn't done before, when I was that age. It bothered me that she hadn't told me about her relationship, but given that we were not exactly the typical American family, some obvious reasons for her keeping it a secret ran through my head, and to be honest, I wasn't happy about the possibility of any of them.

When she had gone out with some old friends from her high school days, I asked my spouse if they knew anything about this, as they were a therapist, and our daughter might be more open with them than with me. They didn't know anything about it either, and were about as hurt as I was by the fact that she hadn't told either of us. Neither of us wanted to call her out, but we figured, best-case scenario, it was a new relationship, they might still be in that “honeymoon” phase, and not sure things will last, and was putting off announcing it until she was sure it was more than just a hot fling that would burn out quickly.

In the week she was home, she never mentioned this girl, though the signs were there. The discord notification on her phone sounding, and her smiling at her phone and replying almost instantly, or her taking the dog for a walk when the phone rang. The week went by without her mentioning it.

It was almost Thanksgiving break when she finally mentioned it, in a phone call, trying to be casual, but clearly nervous. “I've been seeing this girl on campus...and, well... She's here on a scholarship, and...well, she doesn't really have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving Break. She usually stays in the dorms...but that's...well, boring, there's nobody around, and you can't really cook, and they limit food service because not a lot of people stay over break. Can...I bring her home for Thanksgiving? I warn you, she can be a bit much...I mean, I know you like your privacy and all, and...also...she's...more than a little...unusual. She has a hard time with stairs, so I don't think she could handle an upstairs room, and she'll need her service dog to help her navigate the house. Would it be OK?

I breathed a sigh of relief. “It's fine. We'd love to have her here. Whatever happens, I hope it can't go worse than the time I brought MY college girlfriend home for Thanksgiving. I do warn you, we're going up to your aunt's place in New York this year for dinner. I felt both the groan and the nerves on the other end of the line, which mirrored my own feelings about it. Believe me, I don't care to go either, and I'd find an excuse if I could, but it's been about three years since I've visited, and people are really getting bitchy about it. second pair of hands to move your mattress down to the library, but I can have the frame and box spring set up for you two when you get here. If I can get Shawn or Christian to help, we can have the library set up for you two.”

The day she came home...I was expecting unusual. I figured some goth, punk or alt girl, or maybe someone dressed in cottagecore or maybe even tradwife style clothing. But the first thing I saw was the dog. The car door opened, and a black labrador bounded out, wearing a harness and vest, and stood stock-still as she got out of the car. Her eyes were covered with dark sunglasses, and I noted she walked with an odd, shuffling gait, and wondered if she had the dog because she was blind, needed it for balance, or both.

Parental units, this is Ally, and her dog Celeste. Ally, Tee and Mel, my adoptive parents. “Pleased to meet you” she said brightly. I noted her s sounds had a slight, hissing lisp to them, and her s sounds had a slightly hissed quality to them. But that had nothing on the accent, which spoke of the Aegean Sea as much as her olive-toned skin did. “Elleniki?”, I asked in my barely passable Greek. “Nai, Thessaloniki.” she responded, her eyes going a little wide. “Ana mentioned you spoke a little Greek, but I didn't think...” her voice trailed off. I laughed. “I've traveled there enough to recognize the accent. Couldn't have told you which region if you hadn't mentioned it. One of these days I'll tell you about how Athens keeps trying to make me stay. Now, let me go in first, and wrangle the dog. Cerbie's getting BIG, and she is rather...enthusiastic with visitors. I've been working with her on not jumping up, and she's got it with US, but since she's never seen you before....” I let my voice trail off.",12
1liw543,mzgr8tr,"Jessie wouldn't be entirely surprised, considering her exposure to Elvari and the other non-human residents of Innsmouth. Just a little disappointed he tried to hide his Shoggoth-ness.

1liw543,mzg32r6,"“She'll need time to get used to me and to Celeste.” she said, without missing a beat.

Wednesday night was uneventful. Ally and Ana were close, and clearly happy. Not exactly joined at the hip, but not spending much time apart either.

The next morning, we piled in to the car for the three hour drive to the New York border. Ally and Ana kept us entertained with stories about school, classes, and their friends on the drive up.

When we got to my sister's it was the usual chaos. Half a dozen canines, and more family than even that large house should hold. Dinner was the usual chaos, with most people at the dining room table, kids in the kitchen, and plenty of people at other, side tables set up to manage the sheer number of people my sister saw fit to invite. I had my usual few five to ten minute conversations with people, including my mother and siblings, who I hadn't seen in a few years, and had little in common with, and once the meal ended, people broke into their little social groups, in whatever room was convenient or comfortable.

My nieces and nephews, and my cousins' kids were in the playroom. Most of the men were in front of Brad's massive TV, watching football. My mother and sisters were in the kitchen, and several other relations were still seated around the dining room table, playing cards.

The four of us went down to the bar, where my brother, and two brothers-in-law, along with Brad's two brothers, were drinking, shooting pool, playing darts, and talking about camping and golf. We all accepted drinks, and mostly the conversation flowed around us without touching us, save for a few questions to Ana and Ally about how they met and school.

Ally excused herself to go to the bathroom. Finding the one off the bar occupied, she asked Brad where she might find another. He mentioned there was one on the other side of the playroom. She had been gone for about five minutes when we heard a child scream. It wasn't the usual scream of a child at play, but a shriek of terror. Ana had a look of horror on her face, whispering “Oh no...no...no” as she shot out of her chair and toward the playroom like her hair was on fire. Mel tossed me their cane and first aid bag as I shot out of my chair, knowing I could do anything with that cane I could do with a sword if there was real trouble, and that I had been a medic with my local fire department for years.",10
1liw543,mzg3c6y,"When we burst into the playroom, the children were shrieking like banshees, and running in all directions, away from the room itself. In the center of the room was the stone statue of a dog, that looked like my brother-in-law's massive Cane Corso, mouth open, and eyes looking at the floor. Ally was on the floor, pinned by the statue, her dark glasses and head covering several feet away. From this angle, I could see the massive, snake-like tail under her dress, which had slipped up enough to leave a portion of the tail bare. As I came around the statue, I saw Ally, her hands covering her face, crying, and repeating “No...no....no....not again...no....” over and over, while the snakes she had in place of hair writhed and hissed. Ana scrambled to recover the dark glasses and head scarf, and quickly got her head and eyes covered, while assuring Ally that it was OK, it was an accident, and she didn't mean for it to happen, and at least this time, it was only a dog.

“Gorgon?” I asked, Ana quietly. “Yeah. Which, given your history with Athena, and the Theoi in general, I wasn't sure if you'd be OK with it, or respond with your sword and a mirror.”

“Ally, what happened?” I was coming back from the bathroom, and this massive dog...lunged at...either me or Celeste...I'm honestly not sure. But he jumped up, caught me with those paws, and knocked off my glasses and my head scarf...and...well...you can see what happened. I'm just glad the kids all ran away in terror when it happened. But how are we going to explain this?”

I snorted. “I'll talk to them. And here I thought nothing could be worse than the Lexa incident...my cousins stole my girlfriend's wig at dinner when I was in college. She was undergoing chemo. To this day, my mom denies that it ever happened. Worst case scenario, we're not invited back, and to be honest, we're not missing much.”  
  
I sighed heavily, and walked out to try to explain to my brother-in-law what happened to his dog.",11
1lj7ze6,mzhrsxl,"I stare in the mirror, sighing.  
I have aged a bit, but I still look young, after all, I am only in my late 20s.

I took on my mask.  
""Let him in, and bring us some refreshments."" I say.

I nod.  
""The eastern front has stabilized, and after Your Majesty has dealt personally with the Barbarian Chieftain, the northern front is now tranquil  as well.

Before he could say something, the servants brought us refreshments.  
So he enjoyed them.

  
After a while, the Prime Minister sighs.  
""You know, we could totally sell you as the previous Queen's long lost sister, and have to legitimately sit on that throne."" he says.  
""And my spells, my actions, and my mannerism would give it away in a moment, that the one they call murderer, witch, and monster is now once again their queen.  
Just without a mask."" I say.  
""When it's just the two of us, you could be without a mask."" he says.  
Before I could answer, a servant came in to announce that the Marshall wants to see me, and that the Finance Minister wants to discuss with the Prime Minister.  
I nod, and after the door is closed, I laugh.

  
""See?  
This is why I keep the mask on, even when I am asleep. Especially then."" I say.  
""What did the Queen do to deserve such a body-double?"" he asks, standing up.  
""She saved me. Helped me become whom I am today.  
I wish I could have helped her more when she was here, but now...  
I can finally repay her for everything."" I say.  
He sighs, and leaves the room.  
A few minutes later, I leave as well, to meet with the Marshall, and see whom needs to be killed.  
After all...  
Usually, I am only needed when the decisions that have to be made, are too risky for the ministers to deal with themselves.",9
1lj4gi1,mzh2f6f,"The god sat on a park bench eating a chili dog.

It had been three years since it made the switch. The paperwork was surprisingly straightforward. Existential compression into a form that did not accidentally erase entire dimensions every time it had a thought? Not even a full afternoon. The hard part was getting used to digestion. And itchiness. And gravity.

“Hey man, you’re gonna drop that.”

A passing teenager pointed at the droop of mustard that had migrated down his wrist.

“Thanks,” the god replied, wiping it off with the cuff of a flannel shirt. The shirt was secondhand, which the god had chosen specifically because it already knew what it was like to create new things. The goal now was to experience existing ones. Including stains.

The teenager had already moved on, earbuds in, confident the world had gone back to being as normal as it ever was. Which was to say: barely held together and full of people who did not know how to stop themselves from self-destructing, yet kept failing to actually finish the job.

The god liked that part. The trying. Humans were terrible at most things but extremely persistent about it.

It licked the rest of the chili dog and leaned back, squinting up at the sky. Blue today, some clouds, a faint smell of summer sun baked into the concrete like seasoning. He had not named himself. Names carried weight. Even human ones. Especially human ones. But the barista at the coffee shop he liked had called him Marcus once and he hadn’t corrected her. That worked.

Marcus. Fine. Marcus it was.

The god who was Marcus now had originally turned human for one very specific reason: self-preservation. Not the cowardly kind. The practical kind. Like putting a fence around a black hole and a note that read don’t touch, it bites.

See, omnipotence came with some quirks. The problem wasn’t knowing everything or being able to do everything. The problem was the urge to try everything, immediately, and all at once. When you were an omnipotent being sitting outside of time and you asked “what would happen if I inverted the idea of consequence,” the answer wasn’t a theoretical one. It was a crater with screaming edges that echoed in twelve simultaneous dimensions.

It was worse than boredom. It was possibility poisoning.

So he had folded himself down. Chosen a form that could eat breakfast and trip on uneven pavement and smell diesel fumes on Tuesday mornings. He had given up his perfect memory. His ability to see all variables. He had even put a limiter on his own intuition. That one took effort.

Now, he was just a man on a bench, contemplating a nap.

The chili dog gone, Marcus crumpled the wrapper into a ball and missed the trash can. He stared at it for a moment, then left it there. Littering was bad. But so was perfection. He’d clean it up in a minute.

Across the green, an old man argued with a younger woman. Something about inheritance. She gestured wildly, phone in one hand, disappointment all over her face. The god watched them both and understood nothing of their pain, but felt it anyway. Which was a trick he hadn’t known he’d missed. Pain without omniscience had texture.

A jogger ran by with a shirt that said Jesus Saves. That made him smile. He’d met Jesus. Nice guy. Overachiever. Kept trying to explain parables to people who just wanted a shortcut. Marcus had told him, once, to try using jokes. Jesus had tried. People crucified him anyway.

He leaned back again.

He did not miss omnipotence. What he missed was clarity. When you were god, things were neat. Lines drawn. Endpoints known. Now, he sometimes forgot what he’d meant to do when he walked into a room.

It was wonderful.

A child ran past chasing a red balloon. It slipped from their fingers and floated upward, out of reach. The child stopped, stared up, then burst into tears.

Marcus stood. Picked up a stick from the grass. Tapped the balloon lightly with the tip of his finger. Just a little tap. Nothing fancy. No divine intervention. Just the gentlest suggestion that maybe physics could bend, just once, and bring joy instead of disappointment.

The balloon dropped.

The child shrieked in delight, caught it, and ran off again.

Marcus sat back down and sighed. That had been risky. Even that tiny act could have unzipped causality. But it didn’t. He’d gotten better at restraint. At balance. At remembering he wasn’t here to fix the world.

He was here to live in it.

The sun dipped behind a cloud and a breeze picked up. He shivered.

“Goddamn,” he muttered. Then grinned. “Sorry. Force of habit.”

He pulled his flannel tighter and watched the world keep going.",14
1ljkbif,mzkn4sm,"the doorbell rang, slicing through the comfortable hum of the dishwasher and the low murmur of the documentary lydia was half-watching. it was an ordinary tuesday evening, scented with roasted chicken and the faint petrichor of a passing shower, until that sound. until the past, presumed dead and buried, stood dripping on the welcome mat

elijah opened the door, and the world tilted. rain plastered dark hair to a face he’d kissed ten thousand times, etched now with lines he didn’t know and a hollowness that stole his breath. her eyes, sarah’s eyes, the exact shade of storm-washed slate, locked onto his. they held no surprise, only a terrible, exhausted recognition

""elijah,"" she breathed, the single syllable a ghost wearing his wife’s voice

five years. five years since the charter plane vanished over the alaskan interior. five years of searching, grieving, the slow, agonizing reconstruction of a life from splinters. five years since he’d finally, hesitantly, allowed lydia's quiet strength to anchor him, to build something new on the ruins

he couldn’t move. couldn’t speak. the rain hissed on the porch behind her. the familiar curve of her cheek, the way her lower lip trembled slightly – details etched in grief, now resurrected with brutal clarity. he felt the solid warmth of the doorframe under his palm, the only thing keeping him upright

""elijah? who is it?"" lydia’s voice, warm and slightly curious, floated from the living room

sarah flinched as if struck. her gaze flickered past elijah, into the warm light of the hallway, landing on the framed photo on the console table: elijah and lydia, smiling on their wedding day, two years ago. her face, already pale, drained of its last vestige of color. the raw understanding that dawned in her eyes was worse than any accusation

""elijah?"" lydia appeared in the hall, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. her smile faltered, then vanished, replaced by a dawning horror as she took in the spectral figure on their threshold. she looked from sarah’s rain-streaked face to elijah’s frozen one. the air crackled, thick with the unspeakable

sarah found her voice, a rasping whisper aimed not at lydia, but at elijah, at the ghost of the man she’d left behind. ""they found me… three months ago. took… took a while to… to come back."" her eyes, wide and desperate, pleaded for something he could no longer give. ""i thought… i thought you’d be waiting""

the words hung, leaden. lydia made a small, choked sound. elijah saw her knuckles whiten around the dishtowel, saw the life they’d built together teetering on the precipice sarah’s return had just carved

he stepped back, not to invite her in, but because his legs threatened to buckle. the movement broke the paralysis. lydia moved forward, instinctively protective, stopping beside elijah. not touching him. not yet. the contrast was cruel: lydia, vibrant and real in her soft sweater, smelling of lavender soap; sarah, a waterlogged phantom smelling of damp wool and exhaustion, a refugee from a tragedy everyone else had finished mourning

""i'm lydia,"" she said, her voice astonishingly steady, though her eyes were wide pools of shock. ""elijah’s wife""

sarah flinched again. her gaze darted between them, the reality crashing down. ""wife."" she tasted the word, foreign and bitter. ""i see."" her shoulders slumped, the fragile defiance dissolving into pure, shattering weariness. ""they told me… time passed. they didn’t tell me… *this*""

silence descended, heavier than the rain. the documentary’s narrator droned on about tectonic plates, oblivious to the seismic shift in the hallway. elijah's mind was a battlefield. the visceral pull towards sarah, the phantom limb of a love amputated by loss. the crushing weight of responsibility, of love, towards lydia, who had pulled him from the abyss. the sheer, overwhelming *wrongness* of it all. he hadn’t betrayed sarah; he’d buried her. faithfully. painfully

""sarah…"" his voice cracked. what could he say? *welcome back from the dead? sorry i moved on?* ""come in. out of the rain."" it was automatic, a courtesy offered to a stranger, not the woman who once held his heart

sarah hesitated, her eyes lingering on lydia’s face, on the quiet devastation there. she shook her head, a small, jerky movement. ""no. i… i shouldn’t have come like this. unannounced."" she took a shuddering breath. ""i just… needed to see. to know."" her gaze settled on elijah, filled with a profound, soul-deep sorrow that mirrored his own. ""i’m so sorry, elijah. for… for all of it""

she turned, a figure dissolving back into the rainy gloom. she paused at the edge of the porch light. ""i’m staying at the harborview. room 312."" it wasn’t an invitation. it was a marker dropped in a desolate landscape, a place to find her if the impossible needed to be addressed

then she was gone, swallowed by the downpour, leaving only the drumming rain and the wreckage of two marriages in her wake

elijah closed the door slowly, the soft click echoing like a gunshot in the sudden quiet. he leaned his forehead against the cool wood. behind him, he felt lydia’s presence, a warmth radiating shock and pain. he couldn’t turn. couldn’t face the life he cherished, knowing the ghost of the life he’d mourned was now flesh and blood, just a few miles away

lydia didn’t speak. she didn’t need to. the air vibrated with unasked questions, with the terrifying fragility of their shared reality. the comfortable warmth of their home felt like a stage set, suddenly flimsy. the photo on the table seemed to pulse with accusation

elijah squeezed his eyes shut. before him stretched not a future, but a chasm. on one side, lydia, her steady love, their shared history of healing, the tangible life they’d built brick by careful brick. on the other, sarah, a walking wound, a testament to unbearable loss and impossible return, the echo of a love that had defined his youth

he turned, finally, meeting lydia’s eyes. they were brimming, not with tears yet, but with a raw, stunned comprehension. he saw the question there, the one that clawed at his own heart: *who am i now? who are you?*

he opened his mouth. no words came. only the deafening silence, the relentless rain, and the impossible, crushing weight of two hearts he had sworn, in different lifetimes, to protect. the choice wasn't between love and duty; it was between two kinds of devastation, two irreparable fractures. the door was closed, but the past had already shouldered its way in, dripping wet and irrevocable, leaving them stranded in the unbearable present",6
1liuj6x,mzg6p6g,"""It's the only way if I want to finish watching this Mister Creature video, dammit,"" Roy bemoaned as he dragged Kevin up. ""The colossi are the only source of goddamned Wi-Fi.""

Kevin could only sigh while trudging along with the rest of the rag-tag tribe. He still remembered the day all six of them voted between trying to rebuild civilization, or to continue their dependence on these wandering colossi. His vote to rebuild was the only one.

Some thing just don't change.

Long after civilization collapsed from mutually assured destruction, the remaining humans still needed their dopamine hits from Tiktok and Youtube. Once, they had feared the colossi, war machines that could blast a skyscraper into smithereens. Now that these colossi wandered aimlessly with no target they could identify, they provided shelter. Slow-moving shelter.

And Wi-Fi.

Yea, that's the most important thing to the rest of them. Not trying to learn how to farm. Not trying to build a shelter of their own. Nope, it was charging their phones and getting Wi-Fi. At this rate, civilization could never come back.

""Has anyone considered climbing up a colossi and piloting it?"" Kevin called out as he dragged his feet behind the others chasing after the colossal they nicknamed ""Modem"".

""You try,"" Roy sneered. ""Bastard's fifty foot tall, I think. I ain't going up there. How did humans get up there in the past?""

Paul shrugged. ""Escalators? Elevators? Well, something.""

These remaining humans Kevin was stuck with were hopeless. Sometimes, he wished it could be someone smart. Someone who knew a thing or two about piloting these colossi and take them out of autopilot. Or maybe someone who could help him build a simple base on a colossal. A part of him wished he was one of those clever inventor types. Not just some miserable accountant wishing he could do better.

""Guys, my Youtube is lagging...""

Kevin pushed past these doom-scrolling brain-rotted companions of his.

""I'm going to hunt for food. Anyone else coming?"" He declared, his hands firmly gripping the makeshift spear he painstakingly carved with his pocket knife.

""After I'm done watching this episode of Amongus Rants, okay?""

1liysf1,mzgq3x6,"Interstate 224. The road that connected Nothing to Nowhere. No one was ever quite sure just how long it had been abandoned; closed off from the other interstates and highways, scrubbed from all maps and county paperwork. What people were sure of, was that SOMEONE was still maintaining it. The asphalt was always pristine. The roadlines and streetlights and payphones always freshly redone, bright and fully functional. 

Curious youths and rebellious teens were a  not too uncommon sight on the road, always off to prove it went somewhere, or to ""settle a score"" with someone else. Overtime, the road became a hangout for car enthusiasts and racers. The locals would warn them away, citing that it had been closed for a reason. Of course, that only served to spur them on. Drag races, Time Trials, general street mod testing, all became a nightly occurrence, with any trace of skid marks, car wrecks, oil leaks, or anything else that had gone on being fully gone by morning's first light.

It was on another such evening, the same as any other from the past many years, that the racers of Team Street Ratz and Road Hog saw first-hand the REAL reason that I-224 was abandoned. The race started as any other, Miranda, the spunky red-head race queen stood at the crosswalk that had long served as the agreed upon starting line, a dainty pink rag held high above her head. Tony ""Turbocharge"" and Percy ""Porkchop"" sat in their respective hot rods, staring intently at the rag. Miranda waved it once... twice... BOOM! In a flash, the rag fluttered to her feet as both engines roared to life, green flames pumping from Turbocharge's exhaust while Porkchop wheeled, nearly fishtailing to an early loss before wrestling control back and pushing ahead, now fighting to make up the mere fractions of a second he fell behind. 

It didn't take long before he had managed to close the gap, the two racers sparing a single glance at one another, daring the other to hit the Nos first. They only had a few miles before the finish line, and whoever blinked first was almost certain to lose. Tony fingered the switch, steadying his breath, he waited, waited to hear to screech of Porkchop's tires as he triggered his. Percy, meanwhile, was counting the seconds, waiting not for Turbocharge, but merely for the exact moment where he would end the race as his tank ran empty.",17
1liysf1,mzfzfl2,"It's not hard to see why this long section of motorway was abandoned - it went nowhere! Years later, street racers congregated there to race and show off their cars. Today, they found out the real reason it was abandoned. Three racers readied themselves at now faded lines for a crosswalk, engines revved and smoke from the tires plumed out from the wheel wells. A woman clad in a leather jacket and bikini with two green flags raised vertically in the air counted down from five. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. The flags dropped and the racers took off, each one trying to outpace the other. Abandoned buildings pass by them faster and faster until they looked like one uniform colored wall. This thirteen mile stretch of road has been abandoned since 1932. No one goes down or mentions this road, except for racers and the few old folks who still mention it from time to time. The racers continued to gain speed when both noticed in front of them two police vehicles blocking the road ahead. Both racers quickly slammed on the breaks, skidding a good twenty yards stopping mere feet from the police vehicles. The racers looked confused as they gazed upon the two police cars that looked like they were from the 1920s with the officers dressed the same. One racer rolls down the window to yell at the two out of time officers when they suddenly draw their sidearms. The racers scramble to reverse as the officers open fire, one shot hits the second racer in the head killing him instantly. The first racer panics as his car stalls.",14
1liysf1,mzgq4uf,"Five seconds...

Four seconds...

Three seconds...

With adrenaline pulsing through him, Percy triggers his chutes, flicking on his emergency stop lights to signal Tony to do the same. something is wrong, the track is clear, the sun is to their backs, but they need to stop.

Tony, seeing his opponent bail takes this as a chance to save some money, hitting the gas while closing the cover on his Nos switch. With a slight laugh, he settles in to collect his prize... only to watch on in horror as the very road begins to rise off the ground in front of him. He slams his brakes, pulling his own chutes, but it is too little too late. He and his hot rod go flying off the now ramp of a road, still rolling at more than 100mph, as he shuts his eyes and braces for the crash, he curses himself for not heeding the emergency stop Percy had called for.

...

Yet. There is nothing.

Opening his eyes, he looks around, and finds a large, crystal-like eye staring back at him.

\*Hello, human. Why are you driving on my back? It hurts, you know?\*

Tony screams, sinking as far down into his seat as he can, begging the... the thing to not eat him.

With a... snort? the strange thing sets Tony and his car down, though now, rather than the pristine asphalt of I-224, he is on the hard, compact dirt of the untamed land. Percy rolls up near him, yelling something about how they need to go. Tony looks at him, then up at the thing, then back to Percy. He mumbles something about their friends at the finish line, only for Percy to point to the pair of trucks rolling down the road ahead of them, already high-tailing it back to town. Percy spares a single glance up at the thing, giving a cowardly half-smile and nod before rolling his window back up, and making a very slow, careful turn.

Tony, still somewhat disoriented, follows suit, and they both make the quietest, quickest haste they can to return to town.

The thing, now annoyed at being awake, watches them all leave. It mutters to itself about their deal, and why people were bothering it again before slinking back into the earth, now twisting its body this and way and that, turning the once straight drive of I-224 into a winding, twisting mess of sharp turns and hard corners.

...

Interstate 224, the road that connected Nothing to Nowhere. No one was sure why was abandoned, nor were they sure why it was built the way it was. Twisting and turning as though snaking around mountains that were no longer there, the road was quite the sight to behold. Locals would warn people away, but car enthusiasts and Drift Racers alike flocked to the empty, winding road all the same.",27

1lioz3d,mzdq1ee,"Here's the thing, Tommy: people aren't fungible. Everyone learns that lesson eventually, and you -- I'm sorry -- have to learn earlier than most.

You drop your ice cream? No problem. You can just get a new one. It will be the same in every way that matters to you. Still cold, still sweet, still in a cone. No meaningful difference.

That's not how it works with people. You miss your parents -- of course you do. But you miss *them*. Not a blonde woman with square glasses who is always late to yoga, not a balding man with one chipped tooth. It's more than that. If it was just a physical, just a behavioural, match, you wouldn't even need the rift. The world is full of accountants who used to play bass.

Imagine if you find a match. They'll look just like them. They'll behave just like them. But they won't actually be them. How good a fake would I have to give you so that you didn't feel you'd lost your father? How convincing does a changeling have to be for a mother to not care that her real baby is dead? We mourn those we lost because of who they are, not what role they played.

The materialists will tell you that if you can't name a difference, pin it down with data, then it doesn't exist. You and I know different. The snow falls more crisply on Christmas day than the day before, no matter what. The coin you find carries more luck than the one you're given. Those waffles she used to feed you came from a packet, but they don't taste the same any more. There's something more, and across all the worlds, it's irreplaceable.

There's no easy answer and I'm so sorry. It's not fair that you can't bring them back, but finding an atomically-identical fake is just as unhealthy as one made of straw. We couldn't love them, really, if they could be replaced. All we can do is mourn, because in the entire universe, across countless worlds, reality is poorer without them.

We can send you through the rift. It's no trouble, and no cost. Since last year, it's actually your legal right to go through. If you want to go, you can. But I guarantee you won't find what you're looking for.

Endless realities, but contained within just one. The people you love are unique, individual, unforgeable. Irreplaceable.",139
1lioz3d,mzf7504,"There’s an odd sensation when you finally get what you want. There’s satisfaction, sure. Sometimes there’s relief. I imagine runners collapse at the end of their races not because they’re tired, but because they’re relieved, like they’ve done what they needed to do, and now they can let go. Sometimes it looks dramatic: they fall to their knees, panting, crying. But they run all the time. A few laps can’t really be that exhausting. 

I got exactly what I wanted. And the day I did, I slept for days.Or maybe it was the pneumonia. My mom would come in every now and then and tell me to take all the time I needed.
My dad was ecstatic, calling everyone he knew, celebrating the miracle. Miracle, I thought, was supposed to mean something divine. An act of God, Favor. Not being washed up on the shore like a beached whale. After everything I’ve been through, I doubt God’s showing me any favor.
He’s probably cursing my name, considering I’ve messed with His so called grand master plan. You don’t throw yourself into the ocean as a thank you. Honestly, after everything… I wouldn’t be surprised if there was no God at all. Either He exists and created us with some higher purpose, or this world is just a chaotic compilation of water, plants, and germs all walking around, whining about how they have no control over their lives. I was done whining. I didn’t want to hurt anymore. When you spend your life wishing, you eventually stop looking at the stars and start doing the work. Who was going to stop me? It’s not like I had parents to teach me otherwise. 

I walked into the kitchen and took a seat. After sleeping for days, you lose your appetite. You have to remind yourself to eat. Luckily, Mom always had food prepared for me. She kept it warm, sometimes gave it to the neighbors when it got too old, but always made something new before the last plate was even touched. It didn’t matter what I said, she made sure there was always something ready, in case I decided to come out of the room. She laid down a plate: pancakes, bacon, eggs, toast. A bowl of fruit, and a few glasses, one water, one orange juice, and… something dark 

“What is that? Grape juice?” I asked.

“Oh, that’s cranberry juice, dear,” she said, her voice tight and careful. “Is that okay? Do you not like cranberry? I can run to the store and grab grape if you’d rather—”

“It’s fine,” I said. “Thank you.” I took the cup and sipped. Cold. A little bitter.

Dad walked in and sat across from me immediately. No food, no drink, just sat down there, smiling.

“Heya, champ. How you feeling today?”

“I’m okay,” I said. I looked up at them. They were leaning in, drinking in every word like I was water after a long drought.

“I was… I was just wondering,” I began, “can we go back to the beach?” Their faces dropped, from eager smiles to tense jaws, eyes struggling to keep up the expression. It got quiet.

“Now why—it’s—you should be relaxing, baby—” Mom’s voice cracked.

“That’s alright,” Dad cut in. “That’s alright,” he said again, forcing a laugh as he held her arm. “I’m sure it’s—It’s a beautiful day! We’ll drive by the beach, grab some burgers, maybe see a movie, huh? How’s that sound? A family day!” He started clapping, raising his arms, trying to steer the mood.

“I was actually hoping to just… sit. In the sand. I won’t go in the water.” I don’t know why I thought this would be easy. I should’ve eased into it. Oh well. Guess I’m in it now. Mom was silent, glancing between me and Dad. Dad was already grabbing his coat and keys.

“Can’t we… wait? It’s too soon. What if—can’t we go to the pier instead?” Mom was practically on the verge of tears, but still holding her smile.

“Hun, please.” Dad gave her a look. A look that vanished just as I turned back to him. A look that said don’t ruin this.

We got into the car. I strapped in and lowered the window. The car smell was nauseating. I’d been in all kinds of vehicles, sleek black sedans the social workers drove to the beat-up leather seats in foster parents cars. My favorite was the Big Al semi the Moroccos let me ride in when Mr. Morocco went on deliveries. It made me feel huge. If it weren’t for all that traveling, I would’ve never found the doorway. And if I hadn’t found the doorway, I wouldn’t have found my new parents I guess.. I guess it holds a special place. But now, here on the other side… everything felt off. Everything made me nauseous. I felt confused and conflicted over the smallest things.
Sometimes I’d just have to lay down. That’s why I’d been in bed for days. I just don’t feel… right. Nothing does. We got to the beach. It was early, not many people around. Or maybe Dad had parked at the farthest end on purpose.

“Alright, bud. Here we are,” he said, putting the car in park, but not turning it off. Mom turned around in her seat to look at me. Her eyes were wet.

“Sweetie… it’s… it’s not safe. What if—” Dad placed his hand on hers. Tears rolled down her face.

“I’m not going in the water,” I said. “I promise. I’ll just sit by the wall. You’ll see me the whole time. I just… I want to look. Is that okay?” They both nodded. Dad finally turned off the car. I unbuckled and stepped out, walking to the edge of the lot where a cement wall divided asphalt and sand. I hopped over.Behind me, I heard the car doors open. I looked back and Dad was standing next to the car. Mom had her door open but hadn’t gotten out ,her head just leaning out, watching me. Frozen in place. I gave them a small wave, A fake smile, and I sat on the wall. Just looking out at the ocean. Vast. Endless. I was here not long ago.
Walking alone. Because no one cared. No one was around to care for me. I didn’t have a mom or dad. All I had was a wish. I used to come here and stare at the water, wondering what was on the other side. Some would say another country. An island. Sure I’ve seen them on TV. On Airplane trips with a bag of crackers and a movie to watch when I got bored staring out the window. I’ve spun the globe in classrooms and traced the coasts. But when I look out at the ocean… I don’t see any of that. All I see is the life I left behind. And the people who will never miss me..

Well, not mine. But it is a gravestone that bears my name, and a coffin that is exactly my size, and in it a girl whose face they just saw at the kitchen table. 

I don’t go with them, and they don’t ask. It’s understood that this is something that I am not a part of. A last piece of their daughter that has not been tainted by me. And when they come back, we do not talk about it. Eyes red, and faces puffy, they do not look at me. Not yet. 

Instead, they put away groceries. I help, wordlessly getting up and starting to put things away. It takes longer than it should as we go one item at a time. We do not talk. They do not look at me. 

I look though. Out of the corner of my eye as we stand side by side at the cabinets, each of us reaching up to put away identical cans of corn. Her hand is shaking and her bottom lip quivers, her head turned so she does not accidentally catch a glimpse of me. I look at him while his back is turned to me, bending down to store something under the kitchen sink. He stops there, down on one knee and shoulders shaking, and I wonder if he is going to get up. When he does, I turn away before he can see me looking. 

It doesn’t seem to make a difference to them whether I help or not. The only thing that matters is that they do not look, not yet, not until all of the groceries are put away. 

And when they do look, when they put the last of the things away and they turn to finally, finally, look at me…this is when I fall apart. When they, my parents, finally turn to look at me and they see their child whose funeral they planned and death they can’t unlive. 

Pulling me into their arms, crushing me between their bodies. She makes gentle shushing sounds while I cry into her shirt. I can smell the detergent on her clothes. I do not know the name of it, but all of my clothes smell like it now too. His face is pressed to the top of my head, hiding the beard that would make him look like a complete stranger if it weren’t for the laugh lines around his eyes. 

“Shh. It’s okay. They said it would get better. Easier.” She’s quoting the therapist we see every week

“Everything will be fine, kiddo. We’ve got ya.” 

I close my eyes and ignore the feeling of his facial hair, and I want to believe it.",5
1liwtza,mzfowpc,"""Your heart is in the right place."" The doctor mutters, staring at the X-ray and the diagnosis. He looks at me with a very worried face. ""Now... I don't know about the rest of you.""

""How bad is it doc? Don't pull any punches.""

""What do you remember? How do you think this happened.""

""Well, it's a little embarrassing. I was up at 2:00 AM for a snack. But when I turned on the light in the kitchen, I was somewhere else.""

""Where, exactly?""

""The shoggoth called it, 'A place between worlds.'""

""A shoggoth?""

""Yes, I think that's what it was. This big thing of flesh and teeth. It told me its name but I couldn't hope to pronounce it.""

The doctor nods, ""And how did this lead to your current condition?""

""Well, the shoggoth said it would give me a gift. That I would understand when the stars were right. I don't remember much about that part.""

""Do you remember how you got to this hospital?""

I furrow my brow, and feel an itch where my foot should be, ""No... I guess not. I had the thought, 'I'd better get myself checked out by a professional,' and well.. I was here.""

""Well, I don't know how you're still alive. Your brain is split into three different parts, your eyes are on your hands, and the scale showed an error when I tried to get your weight. Your stomach is in your chest beside your heart, and your intestines are in your legs.""

""That bad? There anything you can do to help?""

""I can give you a lollipop and a doctor sticker.""

I walk out of the room with a lollipop in one of my mouths, proudly wearing my sticker. The nurse at the desk faints when he sees me. I hurry away, not wanting to scare anyone else. With a thought, I'm on the moon. I look down on Earth, it really is beautiful from up here.",25
1lj3033,mzgstpc,"I stare at my good brother, and smile.  
""If not us, whom will soon have to fight in the war ourselves...who else will stop it?"" I ask.  
He sighs.  
""For decades, this war has been going on. The blood spilled, the lives reaped, the villages burnt, the atrocities caused, and done by both side... How are we supposed to make people forget them?"" he asks.  
I shake my head.  
""Not forget them, accept them."" I say.  
He frowns.

  
""You want people to accept that their loved ones were brutally killed...or worse?"" he asks.  
""No. I want people to accept that this has been done, and it is bad, so we should act better. Why fight fire with fire, when all it does is make the hatred run deeper?"" I say.  
He sighs.  
""I love you brother, but your idealistic views are impossible to be put into real life. I know of mages that used infants as research materials, on both sides.  
Warriors that used the blood of the enemy to breakthrough...and other such events.  
How do you bridge this ocean of hatred?"" he asks.  
I smile.

  
""With understanding. With hope. With the prospect of a future where our people don't have to send their 3 year old kids to start training martial arts, so that at 15 they can be enrolled and sent to missions."" I say.  
""I agree."" before my brother could say something, a voice said.  
He sprung up, to see a few people approaching our hideout.  
""You invited...THEM?"" he points at the newcomers.  
Witches, and druids, and a warrior...from the enemy kingdom.  
""Mothers, and fathers...whom want their children to live more than to 20."" I say.  
They came unarmed, and bearing gifts.  
My brother slowly calmed down.

  
""We have spread your message, and many resonate with it...but just like your own brother, they are skeptical on how this can be done."" one of them says.  
I smile.  
""On our side, we have at least 5 thousand active soldiers that have joined my cause. It is not enough, but it is a start. The civilians on the other hand are in the tens of thousands, happily contributing to our movement."" I say.  
""So then what is the plan?"" my brother asks.  
""Spread our message publicly, challenge the warmongers, and if push comes to shove...remove the obstacles to our peace."" I say.  
""So...instead of a life of fighting, we fight for our lives, and that of others?"" he grins.  
I nod.  
""We will have plenty of places to hide, and to rest. We have to do this. Are you in?"" I ask him.  
""If not us...then who?"" he smirks, as we shake hands, and thus, the Brotherhood of Peace was officially founded, and we started our mission of spreading a message of peace, and understanding.",5

In reality, I was scared.

I'm not much of a skier, I only went to Switzerland for the Swarovski Christmas tree, I didn't care much for the rest of the itinerary. 

Sometimes I lie awake thinking what if I had went down. Maybe I'd be at rest like everyone else.
Maybe there is a better place beyond the grave, it's still a million dollar question to me, one I might never get the answer to.

Two more world wars, an alien invasion, another global pandemic outbreak, AI taking revenge on mankind, I was there for all of it, and everytime I thought it was my turn. 
My turn to face the reaper. But he's been avoiding me, or have I been evading him.

I've been shot more times than I can count, been in a multitude of car accidents, two place crashes and sinking ship.

Everyone who's still has this information uploaded to their neurolink chips and gets to experience them like they were there.

That invention finished my career as a history teacher.
A history I don't recite, but recall.

1lijf26,mzh382i,"\[PART 1\]

Couple years back, I went to Wyoming on a Ski trip. Everything was normal, except a moment I turned right, everyone seemed to disappear before me, and a sign read 'If you ski past this point, you will die'. I, jokingly, mocked the sign. It's stupid, right? Surely, walked back. Everyone just kinda...appeared again.

The shovel was stained with brown, the hole open and ready for one last participant.

Allen coughed blood, and said ""Danny? Can I ask you a question?"" as he coughed once more, little flecks onto my shirt.

""Yes?"" I asked.

""Danny, I...I'm sorry. For everything.""

""Yeah,"" I replied.

""I can't believe..."" he coughed ""...believe how long it's been.""

""Yeah...""

""We saw so much, but...I always wanted to go to London, to Dublin, to Berlin, to egg Paris, to - "" another deep, *deep* hacking cough.

I took a breath, ""I know, I know...""

""You aged so fucking well...you know Paul Rudd?""

I chuckled, ""I get that one a lot.""

""Man I...I loved you man...""

""No homo?"" I asked, how we used to say in -

""I mean...""

""Huh?""

""I never...told you the truth about...I...love..."" as he...

...he...

...

I buried...the dirt covered the cold flesh of...what once was.

I...

...Allen and I...

I walked outside. Make new friends, but...it's been so long, everything so...cold, and...

I've been everywhere. Dublin, London, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Rome, the works. So many friends, so many places. When you have infinite time, nothing becomes a rush, but nothing becomes notable.

Everywhere...except Wyoming...",11
1lijf26,mzh4ki4,"I bought what I believe will be my last ticket. All amends made, all opportunities crossed, except for this one last chance. The chance to die.

Beaver Creek, got my ticket, and my skis, all my equipment. I had the same stuff from that day.

The temptation won, of course. I hadn't been skiing since that day. so I did. It was fun. But uneventful. I spent the first day doing one last thing - the thing that got me...here.

  
Entered my room for the night, room key on the nightstand. Nice, wood timber. Ordered my last meal, Steak, Milkshake and some fries. No salad because...won't be here tomorrow, turned on the TV as I ate in bed. Some show...the steak overpowered my senses, and I fell asleep soon enough.

  
Next morning, last morning. It's time.

I got to the map, and looked for the trail - the Black Diamond one.

...

...that's closed...

I put on my skis anyways, and started going. No guards, no nothing. I kept skiing around, looking for that fucking sign. 

I had doubts. Did I have the right trail? Resort? Until I saw something: a small mist, almost indistinguishable from the sky behind it, but sure enough, it looked like heat. I walked through, and saw the same thing as last time.

Except, now everyone I knew was on the other side, looking at me, behind the sign.

The sign sat there, reading the same thing as before, 'If you ski past this point, you will finally die'.

Wait,

'Finally'?

I looked beyond, and saw...everyone. Mom, dad, brother and sister, cousins, countless friends, first wife, first (ex) wife and second wife. Three marriages, one divorce, two death did us part, pretty alright I think. And they all had the same look on their face:

Don't.

Don't go on, a chorus of 'turn back' is what I heard. 

'it's precious'

'think about everyone'

'who is waiting back home'.

""No one."" I said.

They went silent.

""I..."" I looked around the cold Wyoming wilderness, ""I've done everything, there's nothing else and I...I just want to rest.""

They all looked at each other.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and walked forward. Life is precious, until it's all you have left. I ski'd, with my eyes closed, as my body felt cold, and numb, while at the same time, filled with wind, I opened my eyes, to see my body, fall into the snow, as I began ascending.",11
1lijf26,mzjn893,"“Life is precious until it’s all you have left” 

Beautiful. And exactly how I feel about death. When my body has broken to the point I can’t live life anymore, I don’t want to. I know a lot of people say that but I think I actually mean it. Someday I’ll know for sure if I do.",6
1lixqj3,mzgrbxf,"""Same rules as always, Dad?""

""Same rules as always, Po.""

""Not that it'll help you any,"" quipped Jer. Ever the jokester, he couldn't help but poke fun of his older brother.

""Um, what are the rules?"" asked the youngest boy.

""Oh, that's right, it's your first time,"" Po mused.

""I just turned twelve!""

""Okay, okay, settle down, boys,"" their father commanded. He used his Regal voice, the one that commanded courts and commanders alike. He rarely broke it out among family, but that made it all the more effective when he did.

""Fine, fine, we'll tell you,"" Jer mock whined. He winked at his brother, to let him know he meant no harm.

""Deep in a magical forest, there is a stone that holds a sword. If you bring me the sword, you are worthy of being king.""

""Just like that?""

""Yes, Sim. The sword will determine my successor, as it did for my father and his father before that.""

""And no one has found it yet?""

""I saw it last year!"" Po announce haughtily.

""As it passed him by for the third year in a row.""

Po shot Jer a dirty look, but didn't say anything. He knew this was a losing argument, particularly when Jer was punching below the belt.

""Dad?""

""Yes?""

""What's the sword look like?""

Both Po and Jer froze for a moment, realizing that they had no idea what the sword looked like. They'd been so intent on completing the quest, that they had never bothered to ask. They had both just assumed it would be super obvious when they saw it.

""Haha, you'll know it when you see it.""

""Oh ... okay, then.""

""Any other questions?""

Sim cocked his head to the side, pondering his father's question. It was a habit of his that they'd all learned to find endearing. He had always been the curious one in the family.

""Um, no. Not right now.""

""Okay, then. You begin now.""

-- -- -- -- --

Po and Jer took off running, angling to get ahead in the yearly race.

""Wait! Wait for me!"" Sim yelled as he scrambled to keep up.

Jer yelled back a response, but Sim couldn't make it out from that distance. It sounded like mockery, though.

Sim raced as long as he could, but his lungs gave out in a few minutes. He simply couldn't keep up with his brothers.

""Great! What now?""

He balled his hands together in frustration, but released them a moment later. Throwing a tantrum wouldn't get him any closer to the sword, and he needed to use his energy wisely. There was no way he'd win otherwise.

""Let's go ... that way.""

He saw smoke in that direction, so there were likely people there. They might know something that could help point him in the right direction.

-- -- -- -- --

""Um, excuse me?""

""Yes, can I help you-"" the man began to respond as he turned around.

""Oh! Your majesty!""

The man clumsily tried to bow from his twisted position, and nearly fell over in the process.

""No, no. That's okay, Sir. I'm not here on official business.""

""Forgive me, Majesty. I meant no offense.""

""None taken, Sir. I surprised you, and I don't visit these lands often.""

""That's very ... kind of you, Majesty,"" the man said with genuine appreciation. The last series of Kings had been benevolent, but that had not always been the case. The people's memories ran deep.

""What does bring you to these lands, Majesty?""

""Um, a race of sorts. I need to find a magical forest.""

""Magical forest?""

""Yes. Do you know it?""

""Not anywhere in these lands, Majesty.""

""Oh,"" Sim replied, more than a tad crestfallen.

""Did the King give you any other information, Majesty?""

""No, but my brothers said something about it moving.""

""It moves?"" the man asked with raised eyebrows.

""Apparently. I just know what they said.""

""Could it be the golem?""

""Golem?""

-- -- -- -- --

""Where is your brother?"" the King asked.

""We don't know. We haven't seen him since the race began.""

The King furrowed his brow. Sim was generally reliable, but harm could befall him, even here in friendly territory.

""Wait, I think that's him!"" Jer called out.

The King released the breath he'd unwittingly held. He did so quietly, with barely a movement of his chest and face muscles. It was a trick he'd learned over the years, and one that had served him well during negotiations.

""Doesn't look like he has a sword,"" Po stated matter-of-factly.

""We'll wait.""

A few minutes later, a somewhat sheepish Sim joined the others. He had a stick in his hand, but he seemed almost ashamed of it.

""Heh, nice toy,"" Jer poked fun.

The King said nothing, waiting for his boys to settle down.

""So, what do you have to report?""

""I ... couldn't find the forest this year,"" Po lamented.

""Me neither,"" admitted Jer.

""And you?"" the King prodded the last boy.

""Well, um, I asked the locals, and they didn't know about a magical forest. There is a big golem who doesn't like strangers, though. They told me what he likes, and we ended up having a nice chat.""

""A chat? With a golem?!"" Po exclaimed incredulously.

""Haha, you sat down for tea in the middle of a race!"" Jer also crowed.

""It was the closest thing to a magical forest I could find! And the golem was nice! He gave me this stick from his back.""

""Did he say anything else?"" the King asked.

""He said I should show the stick to the King,"" Sim admitted sheepishly.

""And that's the stick?""

""Um, yes, Dad.""

Sim practically winced when he admitted that, expecting his father to berate him. It sounded so silly when he said it out loud.

Instead, the King smiled warmly at his son.

""Well done, Sim. You will begin your training when we return home.""

""That's the sword?!"" Sim's brothers exclaimed.

""Aye, boys. And you could only have discovered it by interacting kindly with your subjects. You also had to negotiate with a big, sour golem, the kind that's covered in moss and smells like a bog. Why do you think the 'forest' was never in the same place two years in a row?""

""Oh,"" all three boys muttered.",5
1ligho9,mzbrmx1,"Okay.
We knew when we started the tournament that we will have surprises.
After all, we allowed entry for everyone.
Sure, the prestige of the Academy scared quite a lot of people, the renown of certain noble families a lot of others, but we expected some dark horses.
But this...
Watching the teenager wearing garbage bags as clothes, annihilating royals, quite the sight.


In the first duel, I watched him overpower the enemy with sheer will and mana.
The kid, whom I learnt is an orphan and a street urchin knew nothing of spells.
After his first win, as a teacher I gave him a 2 day ticket to the library.
I hoped it will allow his seemingly good potential to blossom a bit.
Well...
It did.
It sure did.


The kid self created spells.
I watched him destroy the opponents by intensifying their senses.
By casting smelly spells.
By casting illusions of the worst things ever.
He then would rush ahead and bash their heads in.
He didn't care about reputation, about face or...about his life.
He almost lost it a few times, and he didn't even flinch.
Nobles? Princes and Princesses?
They never stood a chance.


I watch him roar, as I crown him champion.
I smile.
""Kid. I am Zeus von Argent, a 9th grade Arcane teacher of the Academy.
Want to be my disciple?"" I ask, as the arena falls quiet, and many gasp.
He stares at me.
""You strong? Can you afford to feed me?"" he asks.
I laugh.
""I could kill all of those gathered here today with a flick of my wrist.
And I can give you mountains full of meat!"" I say.
The crowd full of nobles and professionals goes even quieter but none retorts.
The kid gives me a cheeky grin.
""Let's eat then, Master"" he says, grabbing my sleeves.
I laugh and teleport us away, leaving the other teachers to deal with the rest.
I finally found someone worthy to teach everything I know.",51
1ligho9,mzc40dx,"When the call had gone out, we braced for the storm. Children of rich nobles, scions of famous magical lineage, all manner of eager contenders flocked to the school grounds in carriage and atop pegasus alike.

A ramshackle market had sprung up on the field; tents of every colour forming a patchwork blanket of bustle. In anticipation of the many lowlifes, the town watch tightened security, visible among the crowds only by their cloaks and the halberds they carried.

It had fallen to me, by poker in the teacher's staff room, that I should record the list of contenders, and announce their duels. I posted myself by the judge's pavilion, thoroughly resigned.

Between the muggy air and the stuck-up contestants, I had little mood for any interruption. Even from one of my less offensive pupils, Louis.

I pinched the bridge of my nose. ""What did Mr. Fardibres say about students competing?""

""It's not for me, sir. I want to register a friend.""

""A friend?""

""She's a little shy. But she'll be here for her duels.""

A low rumble from the Troll-kin father told me the growing line was starting to outstrip their limited patience.

""Alright. What name should I put down?""

""Amicia. And sir; please don't freak out.""

""Freak out? Why--?""

But he was gone before the words left my mouth. I bit back a curse as the Troll-kin took his place, leaving only heartbeats to note down Louis's request before it was driven from my mind.

When it returned, as I announced the names for the next duel, my brow furled with confusion. The answer of who they were came swiftly, as an orange-haired girl climbed under the ropes and into the dueling ring. Her clothes had seen many rough days; torn in some places, patched in others, dust and dirt pressed into every strand of fabric. Her face bore a long, curling scar that ran from upper lip to eyebrow and carved through her cheek.

As I searched for Louis in the crowd, intent on questioning him after, a hand grabbed my upper arm in a hold too tight to be friendly. It was the captain of the town watch.

""Apologies, but I feel I must warn you,"" he said in a throaty voice. ""I don't know how she slipped onto your list, but she is a petty thief and urchin.""

With a flash of movement, eight of the town watch were in the ring, with halberds readied. As they approached, she narrowed her eyes and crouched, prepared to fight.

But then I felt it; a strange hum that entered the air and tickled every nerve across my skull. The captain at my shoulder was forgotten as the hum swirled through the crowd and settled itself around this girl. I caught sight of Louis and his friend Edwin pushing their way up to the ring, the fierce determination in their eyes matched only by the girl's expression.

""Call your men off.""

Dark colour seeped into the captain's cheeks. ""Perhaps you didn't hear--""

""The contest is open to anyone, captain; whoever they might be. Call them off.""

His face was livid, but with no more than a breath of wind and flash of cloaks, the watch vanished from the ring. When I turned back, the captain too had left.

The girl, Amicia, met my eyes and nodded a thanks. My face twitched with a slight grin before raising an eyebrow in Louis's direction.

Archibald looked across the field at his opponent, smugly looking over his ratty old clothes and patchwork hat. ""If this is the best this tournament can offer, they might as well give me that scholarship now.""

The street rat said nothing, prompting Archibald to scoff and say to the referee, ""Get on with it.""

The referee nodded and yelled, ""Victory is by ringout or knockout! Ten minutes on the clock! Begin!""

Archibald held out his hand and Chanted, <Great fury of the heavens, be chained to my will and do my bidding!> Thunder crackled despite the absence of clouds as a dozen bolts of lightning struck and began to gather in Archibald's hand. With a manic grin, Archibald threw the arcing electricity with a scream of, ""KNOW YOUR PLACE, DAMNED FILTH! FOR I AM--""

*CLANG*

The stadium at large froze. Archibald's attack, the very power of the storm harnessed into a single strike...

Had been blocked with a metal bat.

The street rat spun his weapon, coiling lightning around it like yarn as he calmly answered, ""I don't care who you are.""

Archibald gawked, but recomposed himself and began performing Motions to hurl miniature tornadoes at the street rat, who answered by flicking the bat out to his side and turning it into a claymore, still crackling with lightning. A single, lazy swing dispelled the twisters in a burst of pressure and sent the crowd into a frenzy, their favored competitor evident. Archibald's eye twitched as he Chanted, <O breathing storm, o human sky, heed my voice and rip through all who stand in my way!>

Another tornado touched down behind Archibald, this one sprouting extra funnel clouds to simulate limbs and bearing eyes of ball lightning. Archibald's laughter turned maniacal as he pointed at the street rat and boasted, ""LET'S SEE WHAT GOOD YOUR TRICKS ARE AGAINST A STORM SPIRIT!! AND DON'T EVEN BOTHER SURRENDERING--IT'S FAR TOO LATE FOR THAT!""

The street rat cracked his neck and got lower to the ground. ""Why would I surrender? I've already won.""

The storm spirit screeched and launched tendrils of high-speed winds, talons of electricity, and needle-like raindrops at the street rat, who reacted instantly; his body turned into a wild blur as every attack was deflected, dodged, blocked, or parried as he charged at Archibald. Seconds away from frothing at the mouth, Archibald growled at the storm spirit, ""HIT HIM ALREADY YOU USELESS GOD-DAMNED THING!!""

The storm spirit complied by sending an attack from every angle, to which the street rat responded by slamming his blade into the ground with enough force to crater it and envelop the air around him in a shockwave that pushed everything back. Despite this, Archibald's grin came back to his face as he watched a lone wind tendril stab at the street rat...

And pass right through without a hint of damage.

Before Archibald could process what just happened, the street rat appeared directly in front of him, his illusory doppelganger vanishing and his claymore turned into a bat again as he whispered, ""Know your place.""

Metal slammed into flesh, sending Archibald flying out of the ring and slamming into the wall. The storm spirit dissipated as the referee announced, ""Winner by ringout: Lace!""

Archibald slumped down and weakly asked, ""What...are you?""

Lace turned on his heel, ignoring the excited roaring of the crowd as he answered, ""Just a street rat with nothing to lose.""",25
1liiq8u,mzcc75d,"I saw the right hook headed to my jaw, but there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it until after it collided with my head.  I spun in a slow circle to the ground, still trying to figure out what just happened.  This was supposed to be an easy score, just a simple intimidation job to clear the sidewalk of undesirables.  The store owner had already paid me $500, so I felt obligated to keep going.  My target was this old dude, bent and broken with age, selling repaired watches and other junk from his street cart.

The encounter had started like they always do, my looming over the person and speaking my in lowest, most threatening manner.  I told him he had less than a minute to pack his garbage and move along, never to stop on this street again.  Before, it had worked every time without fail.  But this guy just looked at me like I was growing a second head.  I figured he was hard of hearing, so I repeated my warning, and again he just looked at me.

I realize now that I had made the mistake of getting physical while completely underestimating the man, putting my hand on his shoulder and giving him a shove.  The first punch hammered into my gut like a runaway freight train, the second an uppercut that lifted my head into position and the final one, that hook, sent me to the pavement.  He moved faster than anyone I had ever encountered before, hit harder and was so precise that I imagined that I was fighting a robot.

The ground was harder and more unyielding than I remembered.  I couldn't think back to the last time I had lost a fight and the feeling wasn't one I wanted repeated.  I gathered myself and slowly got to my feet, feeling my midsection spike with pain only matched by my head.  The old man just stood there, hands at his side.  I could tell that while he looked relaxed, he was more than ready to go another round of beating me to a pulp.

No words were said.  I just nodded slowly and stepped past him and into the store.  Stopping at the drink refrigerator, I took out two drinks and made my way to the counter. I took my payment from my pocket and dropped it onto the counter in front of the owner as I placed the bottles down as well.  He watched as I pulled out my wallet and put down the money for the drinks, then he looked from the money he had paid me to my battered face as I shook my head.  My hands picked up my purchase as I walked gingerly from the store.  On my way down the street, I stopped at the old man's cart and wordlessly handed him one of the drink I had bought before continuing on my way.  Maybe it was time to get another job, a safer job, before I ran into more people who could put me into my place so effortlessly.",18
1liiq8u,mzd5pih,"The birds begin to loudly chirp and sing, and Rick stretches under the softly flapping ranger-roll covering him. It’s July, and in New York that means everything is sticky with humidity, and very still, as if even the air is avoiding moving. The streets in the South Bronx are quiet at this hour. It’s the few small hours, right as the sun is about to breach the skyline—an hour before and almost an hour after, the City is peaceful.

Rick has spent another night camped out in the bushes at St. Mary’s Park, just off Jackson. The steeple of the church always visible from wherever he places his camp, by design. Mary is important to him. And as he does every morning, he recites her prayer:

Holy Mother

Mary, so full of grace

Blessed among women

And blessed is the fruit of your womb, our Lord’s begotten son, Jesus

Holy Mother, mother of the son of all

Pray for all of us sinners

Now and until the hour of death.

He mouths the words, not even caring if he is right or not. Every morning the prayer is a little different. And to top it all off, he isn’t even Catholic. Agnostic, but stuck with these words as part of the ritual before a mission. And every day is a mission when he leaves the park. And today he has to vacate, with his stuff, because he has been told there is a job for him to do.

An asshole needs cleaning.

This is his favorite spot, but he will go to another camp tonight. St. Mary’s has a nice stretch of thick wooded area that even in the winter gives him cover. He rotates his camp to avoid anyone catching on to him. It’s been decades. He can even have a fire going and get away with it on the coldest nights.

Strange though, in a city where every citizen could have a rat friend, a circus of cockroaches, and a bum army to cuddle up with every night if they wished, they’d have a problem with Rick and his little setup.

He risks it, because if the authorities don’t like it, they can pay for his cot and three squares up at Sing Sing. Also, he likes it. Really likes it.

Has since Vietnam stopped being a place to go and when the Army told him to hit the road. He did his time. He gave them everything. Blood, sweat, but no tears. No thank you, Master Sergeant. No tears from you.

He is outside because he never went back in. The Army allowed him to be the best solo operator in the jungle. So now he is the best solo homeless person living in New York City.

Camping Keeps him out of the shelters, and honestly, it feels like home and will continue so if they leave him alone as they’ve done so far.

Leaving him alone might be due to his size. Six foot seven barefoot, with a countenance that suggests he might not know any words of comfort or praise or be tolerant of the illness called complaint.

He doesn’t brag about bolo badges or the number of chevrons and rockers he was given by his Uncle Sam. He didn’t count the number he killed in the name of freedom and democracy either, or the number of wounds he patched up himself in the bush.

Genetically, he is blessed with being able to push through grievous wounds, needing sleep for days, all while owning a kinship with the shadows. Being a proficient killer.

A true-to-life killing machine, retired now, living life on his terms.

Yet life dictates he still eat, hence the job.

All the retirement money goes to the same place all his Army money went to: the kid. He gets an anonymously deposited monthly check from a father who feels he did the kid a favor by staying away.

He was certain, with how often he has done evil things in the name of his government, he could never be a father or husband, and it is best to imprison himself within solitude.

Demons are contagious, but manageable, alone, under the old growth red oaks.

But now it is morning, his prayer is done, and the peace is almost over. Soon the July sun will be up and, like the rest of the people in this city, seek to beat everything under it into submission.

He packs his gear into a well-worn, but professionally cared for, ruck. Everything he owns is a version of, or the original of, a thing he carried back from Vietnam. Minus the weapons. He doesn’t need them out here because no matter what, he refuses to kill ever again.

And once all his gear is gathered and his repaired and well-maintained jungle boots are on his feet, he turns said boots toward the day laborer spot. As the sun rises, the longer the line gets for a job.

The day laborer spot in the South Bronx is a section of Leggett Avenue, over the train tracks. It’s not a good area. The crimes committed daily run from simple to first-degree and worthy of a whole life of imprisonment. The labor is offered in almost the same way business is conducted just up the street in Hunts Point.

A car will pull up, a window will go down, and a voice will leave a shadowy figure’s mouth: “Wanna earn twenty bucks?”

Some days, nothing. Most days he’ll get the normal labor jobs. Some of those jobs stretch out for weeks, some are only for a few hours. And some days, a Cadillac pulls up, and Rick is offered a lot of money to do something very illegal.

“Do you know the taco truck on 149th and Frederick Douglass?”

He didn’t. He doesn’t like tacos. He likes fried chicken and malt liquor, exclusively. But he assumes since this man mentions a thing at a location, said thing will be at said location, so he replies, “Sure.”

Then a fist with a one-hundred dollar bill stuffed in it arrives through the window from the backseat.

Rick takes what turns out to be half of said c-note.

“You get the other half when that corner is free, capiche?”

Rick nods because he doesn’t need to understand. He just needs to get shit done.

⸻

They call him Taco Man. He is a small, ethnically Japanese man from Brazil. He is tiny and moves around his Brazilian taco truck with purposeful movements that look choreographed. He flows as he serves customers.

Taco Man is not just really good at making Brazilian tacos, but this is a man with a fantastic personal story, but he only knows Portuguese, so here it is translated and paraphrased:

There once was a man whose head was wanted on the streets of São Paulo. But not only was his head in danger, but everyone he ever loved also was going to be flayed and tortured, slowly, one body part at a time.

What did this fiend do, some might ask?

This man won when he should have lost.
His victory should be sports history, and would be if it didn’t happen in São Paulo. Doesn’t help each invitational he did got more and more illegal.

Some claim he walked out of the Amazon wearing the robes of a Shaolin monastery, rumored to exist in the jungle but never found. Another addendum to the tale puts him at the monastery gates for a full week before being allowed inside to train.

His training is a ceaseless mastering the movement of every muscle, joint and ligament in his body. Watching him was like watching a rubber-band flap around on the antennae on a car.

Fwubwubwubwub!

But each letter was a solidly place strike or throw or twist ruining another body part.

Maybe, some suppose, this was his plan from the very beginning. That he risked his own body and soul to rescue his family, decades before the day it actually came to pass.

The morning after his first match where he put together a stellar showing of seven, twenty-minute fights in the Mud Circle. Award: $300, each, American.

Next week, he walked in to The Dog Pound and fought and beat every man who raised their hand. Award: total collected from the door $1,295, American.

The Cargo Pit was midweek. The crowd was rowdy. Fat or reed thin were the men who faced him. None won. Award: $12,000, American—and a bad concussion from a cheap shot that zoomed into the ring from the crowd in the shape of a sock with a heavy rock nestled in its toe.

1st place trophy and $5,000 at the Saint Judas Invitational as well as a broken cheekbone. He blames the concussion from the night before.

Red Sand, King’s Table, The Judas Rematch were each 12-round, open combat, and professionally sanctioned fights. His fame soared. Seven fights. Seven victories that have never happened before. And the fate filled invitation. 

“You lose this fight I pay you double the purse; taste good?”

He said yes. He lied. Then bet on himself, because everyone somehow knew the fix was in.

All in one day. His total pocketed prize money: $767,000, American dollars.

Main question on everyone’s lips was who is he?

No one knew, and some people don’t like mystery.

When the cartel lost their millions and millions of dollars on the broken fix, they put out a bounty on his head.

And to save those he loved, he moved far away from the land of his birth, with everyone he ever loved in tow, to avoid them being killed in his name.

Vowing; I will never fight again.

Taco Man finishes bagging an order, is in the process of taking money and making change, when a shadow lands on top of him with a thud. The shadow doesn’t move, or give an order for food, or even seem to be breathing normally.

Bearded and shaggy in all the wrong ways, Taco Man has seen worse in his time in the city. And rarely does worse not come with money for food.

“What can I get you?” he says genially enough. He is rewarded for his politeness by the giant-fellow, in a patched OD green field jacket ,raising both fists above his head and slamming them down on the counter of the food truck.

The physics of that moment with the giant’s fists was magnificent, and the taco truck will never be the same again; but neither will the Taco Man as he does what comes naturally giving the world, via one smart guy with a camera, one of the best fights seen in ages.",6
1lijqmt,mzdcjgy,"""Why won't you just talk to me? Your wife. Why won't you talk to your wife."" I heard her plead. She had been doing this for the last few hours, though it felt like days. I tried my best to avoid speaking at all. I didn't know what powers she might have now, I couldn't risk being controlled. I knew one thing that was for sure. I could not invite her in. I kept working with my hands, I was making sure not to stop, no matter what she said. 

""I can't believe you're doing this to me. To us. I thought we were beyond this sort of thing. I just want to be with you... Why don't you want to be with me? When did you stop loving me?"" She cried. 

Her voice was cracking and had an unnatural hiss to it. My wife never sounded like this before. I knew what had happened of course. It was all over the news. The vampire miracle. It was spreading, people were getting bit at an alarming rate and the worst part of it... most of them were willing. I knew she was one of them. She had been fascinated with the news when it broke. She loved the idea of living forever and being stronger. 

""Please, just talk to me.... I don't like this. I hate it. Please don't..."" Her sentence trailed off into sobbing. 

The sound of her sobbing was familiar. It was the same when her parents died. It broke my heart to hear her that way. My body couldn't handle it, it moved on its own towards the door. I unlocked it all in a hurry, and thrust open the door to look at her. When I did, we locked eyes immediately. I saw my wife, a little more pale than last time and her hair was a beautiful silver where it was black before. My heart throbbed. I let my protective feelings for her endanger myself, however, my hand was gripping tightly the wooden stake that I had been sharpening this whole time. I had forgotten I was holding it. 

Her emotions changed quickly. The look on her face from me opening the door quickly turned from relief to shocked. She stood up. 

""You were going to kill me? You made that for me and you were going to murder me as soon as I came inside!"" She made up her mind about my intentions quickly. 

""I don't know what I was going to do! You went and turned yourself into a vampire. I was scared!"" I shouted my first words at her since the change. 

She was crying but her body wasn't shaking like it normally did. I couldn't tell if it was her unnatural powers or her resolve. 

""I love you and I want to be with you forever but you don't trust me anymore. You felt like you might have to kill me. I can't handle that. Don't you understand that I love you."" She was shouting, she couldn't help it. 

""I think I do. I think so."" I practically whispered those words in response. 

""Thinking isn't enough. You have to know and if you can't know. I can't be here. I'm really sorry."" She looked me in the eyes and took a few steps back. 

""Wait! Jessica!"" I yelled out her name as she walked back but by the time I could step out of the house she had been taken by the night.",15
1li9n5c,mzahtnv,"The heroes freeze, as the words leave my mouth.  
I chuckle.  
Many have tried to use my parents to influence me, to convince me what I am doing is wrong.  
None have expected this, though.  
""Really?  
Your parents, a paladin and a priestess of the Goddess of Life...  
Support you in destroying the world?"" one of them asks.  
Ah...interpretation.  


""Why yes, they are quite eager.  
The Goddess of Life after all is a Goddess of change."" I say.  
They pale.  
""You are murdering millions!"" one of them screams.  
""No.  
My armies are murdering millions, I am only fighting against strong nobles, kings, and queens, and elite professionals that try to stop us.  
Like you."" I say.  
They frown.

  
""Why? It is clear you are not inherently evil, and you do not relish murder, and violence."" one of them says.  
I sigh.  
These kids should read more.  
""Indeed. I don't like violence, and murder.  
But I am destined to end the world as we know it...and how is our world?  
Peasants struggle to eat, while nobles have so much excess of everything, they gamble it on random entertainment.  
The Colosseum, the Arenas, the slave market...  
Aren't these things...bad?"" I ask.  
""They support the economy, and going around overthrowing kingdoms, killing nobles, and royals..."" one of them starts.  
I start laughing, interrupting them.

  
""Another bunch of ""heroes"" whom see someone who wants change as evil, but ignoring the plight of the masses, just because there is ""peace""."" I say.  
They didn't like that.  
""You think you can do better than the many royals, and nobles?  
The peasants at least have something to eat, and they aren't killed by bandits, and monsters!"" one of them says.  
I shake my head.  
""I am not one to lead a kingdom, many will step up for that role, and no.  
I don't know what I am doing is right, or better, but we have to try.  
Staying in misery just because the future is uncertain is not the way to live."" I say.  
And with that...our fight resumes.  
Not that they can defeat me, my destiny is clear, and it aligns with my personal goals as well.  
This world where everything is based on status, and on blessings...  
I will change it.",57
1li9n5c,mzar2k7,"Sarah wiggled in her seat, her hands fidgeting uncontrollably.

“Babe,” Leon kissed the top of her head and wrapped his arms from behind her. “They are really nice. I bet they’ll love you too.”

“Well,” Sarah held his arms. “I’m not so sure about that… Dr. Nightmare and Dr. Hunter are the most feared villains for a reason.”

“Don’t worry,” he laughed and walked to the kitchen. “It’s just their work. They are normal parents outside of their working hours.”

Sarah desperately wanted to believe it, but her only reference was Leon. And he was the nicest guy she ever knew. 

She spent the next hour waiting. In the downtime, she absorbed as much information as she could. The painting of the Intergalactic Noah’s Ark, the Lambskin from the Raven’s Church, and the array of eye-catching gemstones — everything here was stolen.

“Not that bad, you see?” Leon smiled, and Sarah had to nod in approval.

Then the door opened, and with it came the signature laughter of Dr. Nightmare. Sarah’s palms turned sweaty, but she walked to the entrance anyway.

Dr. Hunter— or Mrs. Xeline when she’s off duty —smiled at her, too warmly perhaps. “Is this Sarah, the harbinger of destruction?”

“She’s just Sarah, mom,” Leon said, taking her hand.

Sweaty hands didn’t go hand in hand, but Sarah held on. There were more important things at stake.

“You can relax,” Dr. Nightmare laughed. “Or I could just take away your fear.” 

He tapped Sarah’s forehead as he walked past, and she felt an overwhelming sensation of calm. If calm could ever be overwhelming, that is.

Dinner was already prepared, so Sarah took a seat beside Leon. The atmosphere was harmonious — perhaps too harmonious for her taste.

“How do you feel about your family, Sarah?” Dr. Hunter asked.

Sarah gulped down the mouthful of meat, and chased it down with some water. “They are wonderful parents, Dr. Hun… Mrs. Xeline.”

“I thought they’d be more… patriotic?” Dr. Nightmare added. “Everyone in the business knows you are the destiny child. So, I’m more surprised that they are wonderful parents. Don’t they… resent you?”

“Oh quite the opposite,” Sarah smiled. “My parents have always been supportive of my destiny to end the world as we know it, ever since I was a child.”

“Forgive my impudence, but I expected more from Mr. and Mrs. Justice,” He said with a smirk. “ Paragons or not, the job takes a toll on everyone.”

“It surely does!” Leon chimed in.

“You don’t have a say here,” Dr. Hunter glared at her son. “Find a job, first!”

“It’s just that,” Sarah began “People following their destiny is Justice for them. When the time comes, they’d be willing to stop me. Until then, they just want to see me happy.”

There was silence in the room. Dr. Hunter reached across the table and held her hand.

“If that day ever comes, we’ll be there for you,” Dr. Hunter said, rubbing her knuckles gently.


“If you tell us their weakness, that is,” Dr. Nightmare laughed, alone, until the laughter turned to a dry cough. “Bad timing, I suppose…”",12
1li9n5c,mzaw9or,"“Most people who believe in destiny live entitled lives, believing the world owes them their birthright. Those people are perverters of destiny, people who take advantage of its goodwill. You’re one of those people. A hero who believed the world would fall into place for them. That’s why I despise you so much. You never had to work for your destiny. My destiny wasn’t carved into the stars, nor was it gifted to my family. It was a self-promised destiny; one I convinced myself I would do.”

 

Silia moved past the skeletons of the dead guards who had foolishly rushed into her home weeks before the hero had arrived. Silia gave them a light shove with her shoe, as she approached the dying hero, whose own sword now rested in his stomach. Anthony winced as the iron heels of Silia’s shoes clicked against the floor of her home, with the villain stopping right before the hero. She leaned over his weakened form, allowing her face to get illuminated by the candle sitting on the table that Anthony rested against, making sure he could meet her gaze. 

 

Anthony’s hand grasped the handle of his sword, knuckles turning white as he begged his body to pull the weapon free. He knew that removing the sword would send him into the reaper’s arms, but if he could only get one clean swing at her, he could end all of this. He could be the hero he was destined to be. “W-what. What would-“

 

“I wouldn’t waste my final words on a question.” She said, staring at the painting across from the table. One depicting a younger Silia joined by her mother and father, the three all crowded together, with a splash of black paint blocking out a fourth smaller body.

 

“W-what would your parents think? You’ll doom-“ He couldn’t finish his words, coughing violently as his body gave into the pain. The grip he had on his blade loosened, and soon his palm laid at his side, pressed against the floor.

 

She laughed. “My parents believed this was a noble cause. When I told them I planned on ending the world, they financed my research. They sent me to a magic academy, even when it forced them to live in poverty. All because they believed this was for the better.” She smiled at the hero, waiting for a retort that never came. Realizing he could no longer ask his questions, she crouched, touching his cold cheek before wiping the blood from his lips. “I can’t hate a dead man.” She admitted, not feeling any joy now that he had perished. If anything, his death felt unremarkable, far too quick for her liking.

 

“What a waste of your final words.” She went to pull her hand back from his lip, only for Anthony to open his mouth, bringing his teeth down on her finger as if it were a mouse getting seized by a trap. Silia screamed, pain shooting through her finger. She swung her hand violently in place before snapping Anthony’s jaw, allowing her to free her battered finger from his grip.

Holding her finger, she snickered, even as the pain rattled through her body. “That’s better. A defiant last attack. Maybe you weren’t entirely unfit for your destiny. I would leave a record of your last moments, but none of us will be remembered after this. Everyone’s forgotten in the end, aren’t we, sister?” She dipped her head, staring at the painting before gathering herself, continuing through her old family home.

 

The guards’ skeletons littered the ground, making an already bleak place look hauntingly cursed, with their bodies set beside plain items of furniture. She had even broken a few of their skulls, using them as candle holders, finding that a better use of their skeletons than simply leaving them on the floor for her to trip over. When she neared the torn couch, she sat down, looking at the destruction left in her home.

 

While the scratched furniture, faded walls, and cracked windows had all been there long before she returned, the sight of blood and death was new. Something that came when she returned here to prepare the spell. “Well, it all paid off. Didn’t it? All of those magic lessons, years of grief, all for this. We all need to be removed from this earth. That’s the only way to kill humanity’s sins. Mom, dad. Please look after her, because I fear I won’t end up in the same place as you all. That’s a sacrifice I was always prepared to make. To the people who come after humanity. I hope you don’t make the same foolish mistakes that we did. If you do, I hope someone has enough compassion to do what I’ve done for you before it gets too late.”

 

She held up her battered finger, about the pull the orb of energy from her bedroom, only to pause when nothing happened. She froze, examining her broken finger, before chuckling. “Hero? Was that planned, or a lucky shot? To think you could have delayed my plans had I not had two working hands.” She raised her left hand, pointing the finger upwards, as an orb of hissing white energy floated into the room. The sparks of light bouncing off the orb being enough to blind a person, which is why Silia never fully directed her gaze at it. The crackling energy bounced off itself, rotating around the orb in a spiral.

She hummed a few magic words to herself before approaching the deceased hero, putting her left finger by his lips. “Go on, hero. If destiny is on your side, you’ll be able to cripple my other finger, too. If you do, I’ll be unable to perform the spell until it heals.” She forced the finger into his mouth, and waited, only for nothing to happen. When she pulled her finger free, she removed the shield she had set up over her finger, a few green particles fading away from the digit. “I’m sorry. I couldn’t take the risk. A delay could have been costly.”

 

She collected the painting off the wall, sitting it in a grand rocking chair, giving it a small push, leaving it to drift back and forth as she took a seat across from it. “Goodbye, world. Remember, you did this to yourselves.” As her finger pointed upwards, the orb expanded until it burst, taking all of humanity with it. There were no slow deaths for the world, only a quick flash of light in everyone’s eyes, before they ceased to exist, leaving the world vacant for whatever came next.

As a child, there is nothing more terrifying than a loud sound in the middle of the night. It makes our young minds wander as we think of all the monstrosities that could be lurking just outside the glow of our bedside light. What could cause the pots and pans to clang, the folded laundry to tumble, the windows to shake on a calm peaceful night? We would never know because we were always too scared to find out. 

And then we got older. Realised how silly we were to think monsters existed, how silly we were to fear the dark. Now we would turn out the lights and fall into a deep slumber with no hesitation. No nightmares, no rampant thoughts, just peace and serenity. 

But what if that serenity disappeared and you were faced with a loud bang...The windows are shut, the night-time air is calm, there's nobody else in this one bed apartment, so what could have made that noise? 

There's a chill running down your feet as you struggle to find your slippers and put them on in the pitch black. Now comes the desperate attempt to find the light switch. Something soft and furry rubs against your wrist. You instantly recoil because you're not sure what that could be, call it midnight hysteria but you imagine you've just rubbed against a giant beast quietly looming over you...

And then you find the switch.

The lights blind you, the giant beast was nothing more than a coat you'd left hanging on your door, how silly you feel as your heart rate begins its decline once more. This is what you get for having such an active imagination, you'll need to lay off the horrors in the future, start imagining unicorns instead of demons. Another loud clanging takes your attention once more, now you're concerned, what on earth could be making that sound? You look for anything you could use as a weapon, thankfully you still have that baseball bat you received as a Christmas present over a decade ago, you were never the sporty type so you let it waste away. Now it might finally see some use.

As you leave the room, there's a certain calm that washes over you, almost like you're starting to realise how silly you are to think there's something in the apartment with you. You'd definitely have some story to tell your colleagues at work tomorrow. The air feels empty, devoid of any sound, a voidless sea that keeps you alive expecting nothing in return. 

That sea begins to tremble slightly, distortions in the atmosphere make your hair stand up tall, your breathe lingers, your heart begins to beat faster and faster as you get closer and closer...",11
1liekuk,mzbzrjk,"**BANG BANG BANG**

The pots and pans being violently erupting into a cacophonous orchestra of screeches and clangs, your ears have never heard such an awful noise like a chalk off a chalkboard. 

And then it stops. Total. Utter. Silence. Not even the sound of swinging you'd expect from such violent objects. You near closer to the countertop where they dangle above. You're terrified now, you wish you'd never left your bed, you wish you'd never let your friend leave when they said they'd stay the night. You wish you'd believed your childish self as you stand in the middle of your pitch black kitchen in nothing more than a gown and your slippers. 

You feel a sense of unease wash over you as you begin desperately searching for the light switch, is it someone breathing? Or is it your own breathe? It feels as though someone is right next to you but also far away on the other side of the room...

Your hand bumps clumsily against something smooth, you run your fingers over in a desperate attempt to get the lights on. Suddenly you hear a click and once again you're left blinded by the radiance of the lights. You struggle to adjust to these new conditions for the second time, eyelids stinging as they plead for you to keep them shut, yet you don't listen. 

As your eyes open, you notice something standing just outside of your vision. It's roughly your height, wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt you haven't worn since the first night you moved into your apartment. You advance towards the figure, as you near it, more features come into view. Dark brown hair, soft hazel eyes, freckles dotting its arms, the first tattoo you ever remember getting, the scar from a burn you'd received when you were young and clueless about heat. 

Was this a dream?  
Some kind of out of body experience?  
A memory? 

Finally, youre face to face, it looks at you with a sorrowful look in its eye. As if spotting a wounded animal on the side of the road. It reaches its hand for your face, you flinch on instinct but it continues its advance. It's fingers graze your cheek but they never leave. It's eyes never break their gaze. You never thought to look at its mouth, the calm and bliss your mind was feeling, is not what your body felt. 

Looking down you notice an odd tube poking into your stomach, a tube that leads straight to the mouth of this figure. A tube which begins to pulsate, creating an unnatural rhythm between the two bodies. You can feel something cold in your stomach, it feels strange yet like no more than an itch being scratched. You try to pull away but you can't move, you're stuck face to face with this figure, it's face slowly being adorned with spots and blackheads, a mole and freckles. 

You really should have cared for your skin more.

Your legs begin to quiver, yet they never fall. It's hand remains attached to your cheek. The bliss starts to wear off, you begin feeling an agonising pain as if you're being ripped open, you pull with all your might trying to remove it's hand but your strength continues to fail you. Your body fails to respond to your commands. Suddenly the tube is no longer in its mouth, a smile has taken its place, a smile that makes your bloody run cold. That isn't all that makes your blood cold off course. As you look down you notice a sizeable chunk of flesh missing from your stomach, you notice things that should be inside hanging out, creating a crimson puddle of regret below your feet.

A cold runs through your feet as you struggle to stand. Your knees begin to buckle, its hand finally detaches and you fall. It feels like you've been falling for an eternity, your mind is blank, your heart is at peace. Bliss is the last feeling to grace your mind as you close your eyes and embrace the darkness..",9
1libe34,mzc96oa,"I knew that I was never going to be the same after exposure to an alien radiation source.  Sure, I felt poorly for a couple of days, not much worse than when I had the flu a while back, but when I woke up pressed against the ceiling third morning, I was positive that things had changed.  I called into work, still claiming to be sick, before heading to the basement.  I did the usual things, checked out how strong I was and the like.  Not only could I easily lift the bench press bar, but the entire weight machine with a single finger.  I practiced hovering and flying slowly around the room, twisting between stacked up boxes and the columns.  I tried to cut my arm with box knife and ended up dulling the blade.  I had dreamed of this when I was kid, but like more childhood dreams, I put it away when I grew up.  Going back upstairs, I made my morning coffee and sat down at the kitchen table to scan the news on my phone.  The more I read, the less inclined I felt to join the ranks of heroes or villains for that matter.  The general populace was either apathetic or ready to sue at the drop of a hat.  I made and discarded plenty of ideas to benefit from my newfound abilities, but in the end, decided to do the best thing that worked for me: absolutely nothing.

The next morning I did my daily wakeup routine and left for work.  The bus was running late, as usual, and I knew that my boss wouldn't appreciate me coming in late after missing three days of work.  I looked around and seeing no one watching, zipped into the air and made a speedy flight to the alley behind the office building.  It took a few moments to rearrange my clothing and comb my hair back down, but after checking my watch, I was almost thirty minutes early.  I took that precious time to grab a coffee and a bagel from the nearby shop before heading into my workplace.  Nothing had changed while I was gone, so I slipped into my desk, logged into the computer and started my daily grind.  The usual office noises greeted me as people came into work.  My boss stopped by my desk to inquire about my health, but seeing me hard at work made her smile.  Lunch time was with the usual gang of idiots as we sat around the table in the break room.  By quitting time, I was ready to head home but still full of energy, unlike my previous time working in the office.  I chalked it up to my new powers and didn't put much thought into it.

I took the bus home, more out of habit than anything else, and made my way back into my peaceful sanctuary.  I didn't tired or hungry in the slightest way.  Maybe I could end up saving money by not spending on the bus or groceries.  By 7pm, I was bored out of my mind.  Usually, I would be on the couch, surfing through my phone, but that held little appeal to me. I opened a book for the first time in a few years and started reading.  The book was strangely engrossing and it was morning when I looked up.  Despite not sleeping a wink, I was feeling as refreshed as if I had done a full 8 hours in bed.

I showered and shaved, and dressed for another day at work on autopilot.  I was sitting at the bus stop when I realized that I needed something more to do with the extra time I now had.  Crime or crime fighting held zero appeal to me, so I used the time on the bus to check out wanted ads for night time employment.  I filled out an online application and submitted it as my bus was pulling into my work stop.  The day went by in a blur, going through the motions until the end of the shift.  I checked my phone on the way home to see that I had an employment interview appointment for that evening.  It wasn't too far from where I was currently, so I diverted from taking the bus to another office building.  I aced the interview and started that very night, doing a job very similar to my day job, but for almost 25% more pay.

The months flew by as I worked my two jobs and my saving account grew at an alarming rate.  Suddenly I could afford a car and thought about things like vacations. My social life was still dismal at best, but it suited my temperament.  Getting superpowers for me wasn't the call to action like some others, but I made the most of what I had.  Maybe boring people were never meant to be super heroes.",65
1libe34,mzat70n,"One day, I found myself able to teleport anything, including myself, in a small area to another designated area. But I have no intention of becoming a superhero or supervillain -- I have given up the thought of getting famous since I saw what my childhood friend has gone through after he put himself under the spotlight as a superhero.

But this doesn't mean my ability is useless.

I have a full-time job where I need to go to the office every weekday. I usually commuted by bus, and it usually took 30 minutes to get to the office. That's where my power becomes useful. Instead of taking the bus, I just activate my ability and teleport myself (and my belongings) to somewhere near the office building where I believe very few people pass by. Then I walk into the office building. It takes about 1 minute this way.

It's useful on weekends, too. Wanna hang out with some friends at a place where I normally have to spend 40 minutes to get there by subway? Wanna go on vacation at a place a thousand kilometers away? As long as I have scouted the area, I can mentally mark a spot there and teleport myself to the spot in subsequent visits. This ability really saves me a lot of time.

No one has found out about my teleporting ability yet -- or they're just too busy following those famous superheroes and supervillains that they don't give a damn about a commoner that can appear out of nowhere.",36
1lif6xg,mzdjk88,"""How do you even see?"" I asked

""Obviously with my eyes."" Hank said, pointing at them.

""But you don't have any.""

Pausing he reached up, feeling around the empty sockets with his boney fingers.

""Wait, where are my eyes!?""

The skeleton, going by the name of Hank looked around the floor wildly for a moment before he stopped and grabbed something off the floor.

""Ah, here they are."" Hank said, fiddling with his skull for a second then stared at me again, a pair of rocks crudely painted to look like eyes filling his empty sockets, he only held it for a moment before he started cakling.

Dropping my head into my hands I groaned at the skeleton's antics, thinking back on how I had gotten here, sometimes wishing the trap had just killed me instead of knocking me out and dropping me down several of the dungeon's floors. Of course waking up to a skeleton leaning over me and patting down my pockets nearly gave me a heart attack, both of us yelling (or screaming in my case) as we pulled away from each other. I grabbed my sword and swung it, taking the skeleton's head off, the arms shooting up to try and find its head, then it spoke.

""Ahh, guess I have finally lost my head.""

I froze, undead of any kind was rare in this part of the world, but one that could speak, that was impossible yet it spoke, not only that it whistled.

""Hey, *whistle* I'm over here."" It said, the body twisting as if looking before spinning around, ""that's it this-no no no.""

The skull, jostled by speaking, started rolling down the hall, the body panicking as it chased after it's head. I sat there dumb founded at the comical scene, undead are supposed to be mindless, relentlessly attacking those of the living, not act like an old man. I got to my feet as I heard it walking back, I readied my sword, the skeleton came to a halt skull in hand.

""Oh put that away, I ain't going to hurt you if anything you being alive is better."" It said in a male voice, reattaching its head, ""apologize for the scare earlier thought you were dead, oh and my name is Hank,"" it or he held out his hand.

Eyeing it wearally I lowered my sword point, hesitating for a moment 

""You're undead, aren't you going to try and kill me?"" I asked.

""What? You think we're all the same just cause I am nothing but skin and bones."" Hank looked down at himself, ""or just bone, still if you haven't noticed I am not your standard skeleton, first of I got more personality in my pinky than you with that stick up your areas.""

I looked at him bewildered, I'm getting insulted by a skeleton of all things, and on top of that the puns are just awful.

""Alright fine you made your point, if terribly, what do you want then?""

""Same as you, I want to leave this place, but to do that I need the help of someone alive.""

""Considering this is what, the 6th or 7th floor of the dungeon? I guess I have no choice do I?""

""Nope, now are you going to leave me hanging or not?"" Hank asked.

Frowning, I grabbed his outstretched hand, the rough and unnatural feel made me grimace, giving it the one shake for the deal, I shot back in horror as his hand fell apart in mine, Hank loudly cackled as he doubled over.

""Oh, oh, you should have seen your face, ho, you nearly jumped out of your skin."" Hanks laughter increased with the pun, ""that one shook you down to the bones.""

The skeleton's laughter echoed down the halls, now angry and embarrassed I glared at Hank, which only made him laugh harder, stomping past him I headed down the hallway trying to get away from him. Once he caught up and after some cajoling I followed him to his camp where Hank started laying out what we needed to do in order to get out of here. Which is where I find myself currently, groaning into my hands as this old man skeleton makes another terrible joke at the expense of my will to live, seeing him open his jaw I tried to head off the next pun or joke.

""Could you please just stop with the puns."" I said.

Surprisingly he did, looking at him his skull somehow managed to perfectly convey an expression of shocked hurt even with the painted eyeballs. Hand over his chest, eyes wide, mouth slightly open as he stared at me, for a moment I actually felt bad, I am probably the first person he has had to talk to in who knows how long. The touching moment broke when his jaw literally hit the floor.

""You just can't help yourself can you?"" I asked, groaning as I rolled my eyes.

""Nope."" Hank said cheerfully.

""Can we just get to the part about how we get out of here?""

""Alright, alright,""

For the rest of the day Hank went over the steps for our escape, we planned our moves, prepared what contingency we could, and I got some rest, confident or at least hopefully for tomorrow.

1libulj,mzba08u,"My crew applied a tourniquet, so I was not dying actively. It hurt like hell, but I was awake and sane so I had the radio, still smeared with the remains of Wat. I was directing the relief forces to our barely existing trenches. If I would not have been so preoccupied with the shooting around me, holding on for my life, and with the whole almost dying thing, I could have noticed the strange quality of the transmissions. 

As it was I had just a few seconds to shout to the team that the relief is sticks, and they were upon us.

A squad of medevacs, their frontal and back carapace with painted with white crosses, the serrated middle limbs covered with a soft cover. Escorted by a platoon of infantry. The same perfectly sculpted torso, wide shoulders, well muscled arms, but with their natural grey-brown mottled colour.  

The remains of the human company flinched as one when they entered the fire zone. 

They were good soldiers, not even knowing what is fear, with the self-sacrifice of a hive drone... but the Sticks were, as their name shows, stick insects evolved to a civilization. And they did their best to send spawn shaped like humans.

But the basic body plan can't be changed. The four arms, the lower one serrated and bending in the wrong direction were bad.

The rock hard body shaped like Arnie in his best year was uncomfortable, especially with the small openings for the sensory bristles.

The legs... don't talk about the legs. I could not see the legs as the medevac drones carried me to the CSH.

What I can see are their faces. ""Face"". Insects have no faces. But they tried. The result was more like the snarls painted on the fighter planes of old. Unsettling. Scary. I never want to awake to a sight of one. 

Fortunately this CASH was run by fellow humans. For one thing they know what is pain, and not just from the training materials. I got my painkillers and in the pink cloud not even the snarling smiles were not too bad.

Still, I was very happy to know that by the time I get back to command ground units, the Sticks will rotate out these experimental forms and send traditionally shaped units. A two meters tall stick insect is not something one could look at happily... until one have seen the modified form. And their original form has wings, which will give a mixed unit some interesting tactical options.",18
1libulj,mzba6wn,"The Arachnos were a proud member of the intergalactic community. So when the humans said they needed soldiers to man their ships of war, the Arachnos were more than happy to help. One problem. The Arachnos were approximately one twentieth the size of humans, and no Arachnos in living memory had  actually met humans in person. A hive mind capable of extraordinary feats when they worked together, these were no problem for the Arachnos to surmount when the humans called for allies in their war. The humans sent their specifications, and the Arachnos went to work.

Their best minds worked day and night to produce an Arachnos that would be able to man the terminals on a human ship. They managed to produce an Arachnos that stood at a towering six foot tall, capable of using its eight legs to multitask. It's large bulbous sack demonstrating its obvious physical dominance, with a stunning red stripe emphasising that they came from impeccable breeding. They were an absolute feat of Arachnos technology, leveraging all of their understanding of biosciences to produce a soldier perfectly suited to working on human ships of war, and leading a glorious charge.

It was a momentous day when the human ships of war arrived to collect the super soldiers. They had completed a feat of science in record breaking time in order to help the humans ward off a galactic threat. There were marches in the street as everyone gathered to watch the super soldiers, festivals to celebrate these wonderful new creations.

The human ship landed gracefully on top of an ancient hill, which had been marked specifically for its cultural significance to the Arachnos people. The boarding pad slowly descended from the ship, a glow emanating from inside. The super soldiers boarded the ship, with cheers resounding from the assembled crowds. Arachnos translators who had studied Human language their whole lives were being broadcast to the entire planet, their glorious moment in the sun.

As the world hunched around their broadcast screens for the first in person meeting with humans in generations, loud noises emanated from the humans. The translators relayed the comments, ""What the hell is that? Oh my god, no wonder we stopped meeting these things in person!?""

""Is that a 6 foot tall redback?""

""Nope, we're not going to fight that war against the Space Criminal Syndicate, this planet needs to be removed. Commander, thoughts?""

""Yep, I'm with you sergeant. Prepare the flamethrower.""

And that was the day the human Arachnos war began.",8
1libulj,mzbeekb,"""They sent the Sunshine Squad..""

That was the first thing Sergeant Holloway said before vomiting into his helmet. Not from shellshock, mind you. The man had survived orbitfall over the Mariana Massacre and stitched his own intestines with a safety pin once. But this? This was too much.

They came strutting down the ridge in chromed body armor that squeaked like a latex glove. Each of them was sculpted like a marble statue of Zeus.. if Zeus were a GymTok influencer with collagen lips and a glistening six-pack. And they smiled. Constantly. That same wide, vacant, terrifyingly perfect smile.

""Heya, besties!"" one of them chirped, hoisting a plasma autocannon like it was a purse. ""We're here to protect all you cutie lil' squishies!""

A sniper shot rang out. One of the things.. this one called “Spangle”.. took a round directly between the eyes.

It giggled.

""Owie! That tickled! Naughty snipers, tee-hee!""

It pulled the bullet out of its skull with two fingers and blew a kiss toward the tree line. The tree exploded.

""Bro,"" said Corporal Renner, ""I think I just saw it wink at the explosion.""

""Shut up,"" Holloway hissed. ""Just shut up. Don't talk to them. Don’t look at them.""

There were six of them in total. The Sunshine Squad. Codenamed ""Project Cheerfall,"" apparently the result of some alien alliance treaty clause that required “culturally appropriate reinforcements.” The Tarvixians took one look at humanity’s war footage, read a few psychology manuals, and concluded that what humans wanted was muscular, enthusiastic protectors with unwavering loyalty and emotionally validating catchphrases.

They were wrong.

So very wrong.

One of the himbos, ""Bulkie,"" saw a wounded soldier sobbing behind a bunker and did what any emotionally intelligent, heavily-armed biotank might do.

""Aww, lil' buddy! You just need a BIG OL’ HUG!""

The man screamed. Not because he was scared.. because he was crushed. Ribs splintered like crackers. Bulkie kept hugging. Kept whispering affirmations.

""You're safe now, sugarplum. Uncle Bulkie's got you.""

The soldier died smiling. Probably because the pressure forced his facial muscles into rigor mortis.

Then came the bimbos.

The battlefield fell quiet when “Miss Glitter” opened her mouth and sang a TikTok jingle over the comms. The frequency somehow jammed enemy comms and triggered seizures in our own.

""Sparkle strike in threeee~♡"" she chimed, twirling a pink staff that hummed with antimatter.

""Twoooo~♡""

""Oh, no,"" said the lieutenant beside me. ""She’s charging the..""

""ONE! Sparkle kaboom, cutie patootie!""

The blast annihilated three ambush ridgelines, ten enemy tanks, and a nearby medstation. Hers.

""Oopsie! My b!""

Miss Glitter blew a kiss. Our medic lost his hand catching it.

Holloway finally lost it when one of them.. “Skippy”.. skipped, literally skipped, into a kill zone to retrieve a wounded dog.

""He was such a good boy!"" Skippy sobbed, hugging the corpse to its glistening pecs. ""This war is, like, soooo sad sometimes. But we gotta stay positive, okay?""

""That dog was rigged,"" Holloway muttered.

""It’s always the dogs,"" I said.

The explosion took half of Skippy’s torso.

He regenerated in forty-seven seconds.

And he was still smiling.

1lipwhl,mze4tbt,"It was quiet. Peaceful. A place unknowing of my past. The mounds of dead left by my hand. The blood, watering the ground of battlefields both near and far. They were simple folk, the newest ones to rise to those era. In time this village might become a city known all over. Maybe it would collapse, becoming one of countless others that once existed. Or maybe it would stay the same.

My presence near guaranteed it would not be the case. I had run from my duty. Fled to a place I didn't belong. I knew it would come, violence on too large a scale to be called a fight. But I didn't want it. I just wanted to breathe. A chance to forget the feeling of death that so surrounded me.

Yet it was not to be. The first one to find me swam up the river. Lithe and thin, muscled without a hint of fat, their too large eyes watched me. Skin dripped perpetually beneath the afternoon sun, as they spoke through ripples and gurgling brooks. ""Found at last, the one of blood. Return to your duties, as you know you must.""

I shook my head, adjusting my line. I kept my voice that of a youth, one barely of age to enlist. ""I deny that call. Return, seaborne one, and trouble me no longer.""

They stared at me with disappointment. Yet they stepped back into the water, sinking deeper than the riverbed. A hand reached out to snag my fishing line, pulled below faster than I could stop it. ""Then plundering waters shall no longer occur. This is denied to you.""

Turning my back, I stalked away, leaving the seaborne without a word. To be denied such a thing was no mere talk. No matter what now, any attempt to fish would end in at best no catch, at worse disaster. My pasttime lost to me, I found another way to be peaceful.

My crops grew well, hard work paying off. Day after day I tended my fields, removing weeds and pests with care. Those I slew I did so with guilt, whereas others I spirited far away. I looked forward to harvesting, to see what I had wrought.

Yet then came the second. They grew from a wheat stalk, wide and mighty. The scent of flowers and fresh earth followed them, as tanned skin rippled with strength. I watched as the spoke with the winds of spring, petals in every word. ""My one of warfare, your throne is empty. Do you not wish to return?""

I glared up, with the tone of a farmer forced to defend his home. ""They of land, I refute my place. Let my throne be cast down, and shattered asunder.""

Their head shook once, face set with sorrow. ""Such cannot be done, nor distractions allowed. Return soon, one of warfare. Until you do, my children reject you.""

Their form withered, and with it my field. Blight spread through crops in and instant, turning glorious bounty to rotten remains. I saw the loss of my work, and turned away. My fields would now remain forever barren.

The third came as I worked new metal, heat radiating around. A horseshoe, simple but always needed. I set it in flames to heat up again, as smoke solidified to my side. They were muscled aplenty, burn scars warping darkened flesh. Hammer blows rattled every syllable, shouted with the strength of a forge. ""One of violence, your strength is ill-used. Return to the battlefield, and from my forges a new sword shall be formed.""

I clenched the tongs, metal bending beneath my grip. The familiar rage cycled within, as I turned to face them. ""You of metal, gifts are unneeded. I shall forge my own needs, alone.""

The forge went out, cracking in half. Tools rusted and broke, as they bellowed at me. ""You shall not, warrior. My craft is not for you to practice.""

I left them behind, as I had the others. Each time I tried to find something to do, they would remove it. Every one pushed me to take up my role. They ignored any attempt to argue, simply refusing and removing.

It was only when a sigh announced their arrival. The appearance of a corpse, caught mid decomposition. They whispered at me, creaking through time. ""My oldest comrade. I have heard of your refusal to work. Tell me, why do you deny your nature?""

I slumped, alone in a house filled with broken items. The detritus of how u had tried to find an escape, yet each time rebuffed. ""One of death, I am tired of it all. My pointless existence. The so many lost. How do you carry on?""

They nodded, grave dirt spilling around. ""Mine is simple, a kindness to them all. An end to their life, to preserve their fragile minds. But I know your pain. And I know a way for us to gain the peace you so desire.""

The sentence was tantalising. I turned to them, as flesh sloughed from part of their skull. ""What way? Speak, you of bone and rot.""

They laughed, a dry cackle. ""A final war. One unending, until all are slain. One where no side survives, such that only peace remains.""

My rage spiked, but not that them. At the promise of peace. I was made to hate, to break, to kill. Though it made perfect sense, as I gave a nod. ""Death for all, I see. They couldn't deny my peace anymore. Thank you, old partner. I see my path now.""

With that I turned, marching away. Marching back to the fight, for what I would make the last time. War would come, and it would never end. Not until all had fallen to me. Not until everywhere was razed.",7
1li33yh,mz9kugb,"""Excuse me, Ma'am?  
There is a..."" I start.  
""Ma'am? Ma'am?! I am a young lady!"" the vampires' leader exclaimed.  
""My apologies, but..."" I start.  
""Men! Always trying to be polite, but only when their lives are on line.  
Ugh...just listening to you makes me hungry, you know..."" she interrupts me, and starts telling a story about some noble 200 years ago.  
""Ahm...there is a blood blank across the street."" I say, but she doesn't listen.  
Her followers though, stare back across the street.

  
""Hmm, I will slowly savor your blood.  
You are jogging late at night, you must be a health freak."" she smiles, her fangs visible.  
""Excuse me, but in a blood bank the blood is 100% free for vampires...and it is 100% healthy, as it is tested."" I say.  
""I will maybe start with the neck? Oh...no, that might be too romantic?  
I mean, you are not bad looking, but you are not my type."" she continues.  
""Can you tell her?"" I ask the other vampires.  
They...they shrug.  
They goddamn shrug and leave for the blood bank.

  
She gets closer, and closer to me, until my back hits the glass of the boutique behind me.  
She smirks.  
""This won't hurt, young one, and if you are lucky...  
Maybe you will become one of us."" she starts, then freezes.  
I watch her stare behind me.  
In the glass, maybe the blood blanks big ass red led sign could be seen.  
Please, tell me she can see it.  
""Now that I look closer, you are quite handsome."" she says.  
Of course she didn't see that.  
""BLOOD BANK!"" I roar into her face, causing her to flinch, and take a few steps back.

  
""Rude, we vampires who actually have manners, never call humans ""blood banks"", no matter how true it is."" she pouts.  
""Behind you, for God's Sake!"" I sigh.  
She turns around, to see all her companions next to the blood bank, drinking blood from those huge type of blood packages.  
She turns around, and stares at me.  
""Why didn't you tell me?"" she asks.  
I snapped, and jumped on her.  
She easily grabbed me with one hand.  
""I know I am gorgeous, but again...rude.  
Go on your way, human, you lucky tonight...but not that kind of lucky."" she winks, puts me down, and flickers away to the blood bank.  
I stare at her, gritting my teeth, almost ready to follow her, but in the end, sighing, I jog back home.  
""Who told me that jogging is healthy? I almost lost my life there..."" I mutter, as I go take a shower.",169
1li33yh,mz9dhqm,"Their pale faces and bloodless lips were the first giveaway that something was wrong. Normally I’d push past people like this, pale and thin, without a second glance, but there was a look in their eyes, feral and on the edge of madness, that prevented me from doing so. Their apparent leader was short and blonde, and had the bubbly personality of an airhead high school cheerleader, but she kept flashing her fangs as she spoke.

““Omigod, like, literally listen to me for five seconds before I lose it—I’m STARVING. Like, not ‘ugh I skipped brunch’ starving, but like… my fangs are about to pop out and I will drain a barista if I don’t get SOMETHING soon. And no, I don’t mean another oat milk latte, I mean like… actual blood. Duh.”

“Okay, so like, I tried jogger blood this morning? You know, the guys that run at like 5 a.m. for fun? Gross. Too stringy. Too… sweaty. I was like, ‘hello sir, are you made of electrolytes and disappointment?’ I literally had to chase him through a cul-de-sac and then he tasted like Gatorade and stress. Ew.”

“Then I thought, okay, maybe like, yoga moms? Because they drink green juice and probably have clean chakras or whatever? But nooo. It’s all Pinot Noir and Xanax and suburban despair. Not even a nice vintage!”

“Honestly, I’m craving something artisanal. Like… blood with notes. I want depth. I want a sommelier to be like, ‘ah yes, this one was a philosophy major who dropped out to make kombucha in Joshua Tree.’ Ugh. Delish!”

“And don’t even get me started on frat boys. That blood is like, 80% White Claw and bad decisions. I’m still bloated from last Thursday. Do you KNOW how hard it is to fly in a crop top when you’re bloated?!”

“Ugh, whatever. I’ll just DoorDash a yoga instructor or something. Or maybe a barista with a poetry podcast. Their blood is, like, SO angsty—pairs well with a full moon and heartbreak.”

“Anyway, I’m like pass out from thirst thirsty, so just remember that this isn’t about you, it’s about me!”

I stood there in disbelief as she vented, raising my hand in an attempt to interrupt her rant. When she finally locked eyes on me, her pale blue eyes that spelled my doom, her lips curled in a sneer. “What do you want to say for your final words, meat?”

I wordlessly pointed behind her at the building across the street, the one with the lit up “Blood Bank” sign on it. I cleared my throat and said “maybe you could find the taste you’re seeking in there? I bet they have all blood types and such.”

She raised a manicured eyebrow at me, her eyes shifting to the direction I was still pointed. Her motioned to her group and said the words I feared she would: “Bring him along, boys, in case this doesn’t plan out. I’m not going hungry tonight.”",61
1li33yh,mzfxsw0,"""Ya know, I can't remember the last time I had such a cutie like you for a snack! And I don't mean like, in the not safe for work way, granted that's been even longer and way more difficult to fix."" She sighed heavily. ""Man, it'd be great if sucking blood also sucked the estrogen and progesterone out of my victims too, gosh transitioning as a vampiress would be so much easier!"" She giggled, then frowned. ""Alas, the vampire that turned me stole the ability to transition from me.""

""Um, miss. There's a blood bank behind you, ya know? Your little hoard is making their way already..."" I hid my face behind my hands, terrified and not wanting to see what was to come.

""No, no, you don't get to... Wait what?"" I watched from behind my fingers as she turned to see the blood bank and facepalmed. ""I'm sorry! I... Didn't know that there were some available overnight. Um... So, can we take a rain check on me... Being intimate with you?"" She turned back to me and smiled.

""I... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?"" My hands fell from my reddening face as I became filled with rage. ""You big, stupid, dummy! How long have you been on Aslora!? That's always been the case!!!"" I tried to push her away, failing miserably.

""Well, one, I only got here yesterday. Earth is a literal hellscape. Two, I'll take you placing your hands on my boobs as a yes to that raincheck."" She cackled. ""I'm kidding... And I'm genuinely sorry... Could we... Exchange contact info?""

I rolled my eyes harder than I have before. ""Really... After you corner me with your thrall of vampire girlies and threaten to suck my blood, without my consent?"" I paused, thinking about it for a minute. ""Maybe... But you'll have to work very hard to make it up to me."" I stuck my tongue out and watched as she sauntered away.

""Works for me!"" She flicked her wrist and something sharp stuck to the wall next to me.

""Huh?"" I pulled the note from the metal card impaled in the wall. ""Oh... It is her address. Well then..."" I sighed, then smiled. ""I've always wanted to date a vampiress...""",5
1li06t1,mz96fmd,"The disembodied tentacle waited by the doorstep of its chosen owner, wiggling the pink ribbon tied to its tip. Once, it was a gift from its creator to a human. Who rejected it and shoved it into a box before duct taping it shut and shipping it off to a distant land. Now, it was part of a new animal shelter programme that allowed pets to choose their human. Even if it considered itself neither a mere animal nor a pet.

And it had chosen a Katrina Watson on the list of prospective owners.

When the door creaked open, it bounced and waggled in excitement. Would she say yes? She had to. She worked with supernatural entities. She was dating his creator, Lord Elvari.

Who was the one to open the door.

""My lord!"" It sobbed and rambled on. ""The human who you gifted me to, he rejected me! I have a long story. I was stuck in an animal shelter. They treated me like an animal! They told me to shut up and act cute! The horror of shelter food!""

""Ssshh, little one,"" Elvari hugged the small tentacle. ""You made your way here. It's okay now.""

""That man...he said he didn’t want me slapping the stupid,"" it continued bawling its tiny suckers out. ""Anyway...the shelter said I could choose a new owner. I saw Katrina Watson on the list. Is she in? Or can you reclaim ownership of me? Please, master!""

""I will have a word with her. She's your official owner on this document you came attached with.""

**
--

""Yes, yes, he's yours,"" Kat sighed as the tentacle happily shuffled back to its creator. ""I was hoping a dog or cat would pick me. Not one of your disembodied talking tentacles. And it is for the best it stays with you. Who else would tolerate it?""

""Is she saying I am a bad tentacle? I have done my best to be a helpful one,"" it curled up in a tight ball.

""How did it end up in a shelter anyway?"" She had to ask.

""Abandoned by human,"" the tentacle sniffed. ""I slapped the stupid out of his employer but couldn't smack any sense into him. I have failed my duties.""

""Maybe it isn’t you,"" Kat tried consoling it. ""Maybe some people just don't want, and cannot be helped. Let's move forward, okay? Elvari is taking you back.""

""You don’t want me?""

""I simply think he's the best for you, not me. If Elvari was on the list of prospective owners, would you have chosen him over me?""

The tentacle bobbed up and down. She was right. If only his dearest master was on the list, it would choose him for sure. It knew it had only chosen Kat for the chance to be reunited with its god.

It now slithered up the couch to coil around its master's arm. Where it stayed snug and happy.

""How should I know?"" I asked.

""Check?"" offered Lindsey with a shrug.

""Where?"" I asked after a brief pause.

""Pull its little legs apart,"" Hector joked. 

""Everybody shut up,"" I hissed. ""It'll talk. We just have to wait.""

Lindsey sighed. ""We've been waiting forever.""

""I don't know why it's acting like this,"" I said as I stared at it. 

""Like a bird?"" Jacob turned to me. ""This behavior definitely doesn't come across as, *weird as fuck*, like you told me over the phone.

The truth was, this behavior right now— doing bird stuff like grooming itself and looking aimlessly around the room... this was the strangest behavior yet.

When the thing had arrived at my door, I was excited. I'd never owned a parrot. I hurried out to the pet store and got all the necessary stuff for it, and for the past couple of days... all it's done is stare at me. Its eyes followed me around the room as I walked. I spent a long evening trying to bond with it, but to no avail. 

Last night, while I was googling information about parrots staring, I heard it speak for the first time. It mimicked the sound of someone clearing their throat. When I looked up at it, it was still staring at me. It creeped me out, so I moved it to the living room.

I called all my friends and asked them to come over and see it.

And now it was *pretending* to be a normal bird.

""Look, Nay,"" Lindsey turned to me. ""This is cool and all, but... I don't see any weird behavior.""

I didn't want to tell them I thought that it was putting on a show for them. I didn't know what else to do. I let them leave the house, and the moment we were alone, it went back to staring at me. I decided that I needed to record it to show them. I pulled out my phone and put it into front-facing mode, and hit record.

""This is Nathan Alvarez. I just received a parrot. Check this thing out, y'all."" I returned the camera to front-facing mode and lifted it to video the parrot. It stared dead-eyed into the camera lens as I approached it. ""See what I'm saying?"" I asked my intended audience as I moved 360 degrees around the parrot's cage, its eyes never leaving me except to turn around to maintain eye contact. 

""No one will ever believe you,"" squawked the parrot.

I let out a surprised sound and felt terror run through my body like a freight train. I took a couple of steps back, shaking my head. 

""Nope, nope, nope,"" I said, turning and leaving the room. ""Hell no. Hell. No."" I said, ending the recording and sending the video in a group chat to my friends. After a few minutes, the replies started to come in.

""Video is fucked up.""

""Can't watch it, Nathan.""

""What happened to your camera?""

I hurriedly opened my photos app and tapped the video. The opening portion where I was speaking to them was fine. When I turned the camera to face the parrot, it started glitching out like crazy. I felt panic set in as a garbled voice came through the static and the noise.

1li06t1,mz8rn3x,"Tracey had always liked working with animals, especially reptiles. She had taken an undergrad and herpetology and gotten a job at a venom lab downtown. The pay was good, and since she had taken summer classes and had a campus job, she kept her debt down to a manageable level. 

She had heard that Main Street Shelter was letting the animals chose their owners, and had to wonder what had brought that about. She had just prepped dinner and put it in the over to cook, when there was a knock at the door. Wondering what it could be, she opened the door.

In a cardboard box, was a miniature caiman no longer than her forearm. Kneeling down, it gazed at her adoringly. There was a note and written on it, “Hello, I am Imhotep. I am your reward for your continued dedication to the subjects of the great and glorious Sobek.” Sobek? Tracey knew she had heard that name before. 

She deposited Imhotep into a tank just the size for him and looked it up. Sobek was the Egyptian god represented by a crocodile. 🐊 She smiled, “How do you feel about sardines?” Imhotep wagged his tail. 

It was about now her niece called, asking her about her pet. Tracey grinned. “Going to be a match made well.”",90
1li06t1,mz8b3qj,"I opened the box.

...

A slow whiffed of golden smoke drifted up to eye level. forming a ring. More rings slowly formed as the fog of sulfuric smoke filled the room.

*Pet are good. They are our friends. We love them...We become father, mother, brother, sister, friend, enemy to them and still, we always love them,* I told myself as I pulled open the second flap on the box.

But what do you do with a Cosmic Horror as a pet?

One that you recognize?? One that will end the World?

The three green-grey tentacles, dripping translucent fluids, inched out of the open box.

I think, *Is it saying mommy?*

A single red eye blinked at me from the darkness of the cardboard box, just handed to me by a Federal Transport driver who ran back to his truck. The driver had not even responded when I had said ""Thank you""

What that bad?

...

Could I close the box now?",117
1li06t1,mz9dlpm,"I heard the doorbell and went toward the door.  I heard a tailgate slam and two doors.  By the time I opened the front door, I saw a truck peel-out and screech away.  I could smell the burn of the rubber.  'Very odd', I thought.

I said, ""What the he...?"" And then I saw the crate.  It was stamped with the name of our local pet shelter, and it was solid, but small holes were drilled evenly around it.  There was a large red stencil of 'PET DAY' sprayed on all sides.

I knew about this. My neighbor got a really cute puppy yesterday.  I didn't expect a pet to choose me as I have never had a pet.  I have only been to the shelter once as a volunteer.  

No barking and no meowing and no paperwork.  I couldn't see inside and I tried to lift it but it was too heavy.  I stared at it for a second and listened but heard nothing, so I headed to the garage for a crowbar.

I only found a hammer, and I started to pry it open.  I kept stopping to listen but didn't hear any noise.  I tried all sides and finally managed to break a side panel loose.

The panel fell flat to the porch, but nothing came out right away.  Then, a snake slithered out.  Not just any snake but a cobra.  A large black cobra with white marking on its hood.  I dropped the hammer and stepped back.

The snake froze and turned to look right at me.  Eye to eye.  I froze.  It stuck out its tongue and made a hissing sound.  Then I saw another snake slither out.  Another cobra and, even bigger, but all white with black markings on its hood.

If they were in a thick, very thick glass case, I would think they looked cool.  I would give them cool names.  I would admire and respect them from a safe and respectable distance.  

Both slithered to my front door and stopped.  Both turned and looked at me.  My mouth went completely dry, but I understood.   I cautiously stepped over and opened the front door.  They both looked at me and stuck their tongues out, and then slithered in.

I was never going to sleep again.",39
1li06t1,mz94byk,"I heard a few knocks at the door. I give an exasperated sigh and open the door to see a young man in a polo shirt, clipboard in hand.


""Hi, I'm-""


""Oh? I didn't sign up for the 'pet's choice' program. Why are you here?""


""Uh, I'm just here to-""


I stop him ""No, it's fine, I'll take care of it. I've taken in plenty of rescues in my time and old Bowser isn't too long for the world. It definitely helps me to have something to take care of ya know.""


""OK ma'am, but that isn-""


I'm barely listening. I pull out some old food and water bowls, filling both up. ""I've only got some senior dog food at the moment but I can be off to the store to get some propper food in a few hours. But I do have some friskies in the cupboard that I keep for the neighbor cats if that's the style."" 


""Uh, I think I'm going to-""


""Ah-ha, here's the old collar! I imagine that you'd need walks at least two or three times a day, that will help me with my joints.""


""Uh, are you talking about me?""


I move forward to clip the collar around his neck, but he steps back. ""Ah, don't like the collar do ye? Don't worry, you'll get used to it."" I started shuffling forward to catch up, he started backing towards the door.


""No no no no! I'm just selling solar!"" I keep moving forward as he fumbles with the lock. ""NO! LEAVE ME ALONE YOU CRAZY WOMAN!""",120
1li06t1,mz9z1pq,"I had signed up for the animal shelter's new program, indicating that I was willing to be chosen by one of their animals, so I wasn't exactly surprised when my doorbell rang, though I was a bit surprised that my doorbell camera didn't show anyone at the door.

When I made my way downstairs, the doorbell was damp, and there was a large goldfish bowl sitting on my doormat.  The occupant was curled up at the bottom, looking at me with enormous eyes.

After a moment of staring at each other, a tentacle emerged from the mass and tapped insistently at an envelope sitting next to the bowl.  I picked it up and opened it.

There was a thick sheaf of paper, with a bright pink sticky note on the first page.  The note said ""My name is Henrietta.  I'm an octopus.  I'm actually immortal.  Please take care of me, it's a very big world, and I'm a very little octopus.""

I looked down at the little, rubbery looking lump in the bowl, which had turned the approximate color of my doormat.  ""Henrietta?"" In response, a ripple of red shimmered across its -- her, I guess -- body.

I crouched down next to the bowl, and put my fingertips in the water.  ""Nice to meet you, Henrietta.""

She reached up to wrap my fingers in tentacles, and when I didn't show any signs of pulling away, she climbed up, wrapping around my wrist like a wet, living bracelet.  I delicately stroked her with a finger from the opposite hand.

""Well, I guess I have an octopus now."". I picked up the bowl, though I knew I would have to get something much bigger soon, stood up, and went back inside.",30
1li06t1,mz9qrri,"\*new writer, day 1 of trying to learn to write better\*

  
A snake!  What an amusing little guy!  With his green scales and red beady eyes.  I was a little concerned at first about having to feed live animals to him.  But when I gave him mice he just made friends with them.  After a week it became clear his food source is the energy that community gives him.

I bought a bigger cage after a month and started making an environment suited to a mouse-snake village.  Then one day I looked inside and found a bunch of tiny hats and clothes.  Did the mice make them?  Could they have stolen them from somewhere?  *Where would they find such tiny hats*?

I got busy with work for a week and found one of the mice chirping loudly while holding tiny pages with words.  Upon a closer look it was a script!  The mouse realized I was trying to read it and angrily hid it away.

For weeks I would stop in and see what was clearly a rehearsal, but if I lingered all cast and crew would stop what they were doing and stare at me with dead silence.  It was not something I would be allowed to see.

Finally after several months, I heard music coming from the cage.  These mice had a full orchestra with several instruments!  There was a theater chair and a large popcorn in front of the tank.  I did not ask where they came from.

What followed was such a beautiful play!  The critters had created something with an epic story that took place over 30 years, beginning when they met at school, to a final confrontation where the lead mouse told the snake that he never loved his wife, he had only married her to stay close to him.  I laughed, I cheered.  I cried incredibly happy tears.

  
Time went by.  It became clear that their talent was bigger than the tank.  I introduced them to a local theater director, and they rather quickly became fa-mouse.",23
1li06t1,mz9ougb,"I had signed up for the pet program when my older cat ""Kit Kit Kat"" had been killed by a stray dog.

I didn't know what kind of pet I would get, but was hoping for something new. 

I was slowly making my way to the kitchen to get a coffee when I heard a door bell ring ( wich is strange, as I don't have a doorbell ), checking my phone, I looked at my door cameras feed to see who was there, there was no-one.

Since I was right in the living room just about 10 feet from the front entrance, I hobbled over to see if something had hit my car. On opening the door, I was stunned to see a fair sized wooden crate, with an attached envelope addressed to myself sitting on my front porch.

Reaching down, I snagged the envelope from where it was. Once I had it in my hand, I was suprised my the feel and weight of it. Moving over to sit in my favourite seat on my front porch, I took my tobacco pipe out of it's holster and lit it using my dads old zippo, before returning my attention to the envelope. 

Looking at the flap, I noticed a strange wax seal holding it closed. Moving my finger over to see how it felt before opening it, I was suprised to find that the sealing wax flowed and shifted out of the way. Lifting the flap, I took out a folded sheet of parchment.

As I opened the letter, the crate fell open. Looking over, I locked eye's with what looked like a german shephard sized crocodile skink that had wings. Tendrils of smoke curled from it's nostrils as it spoke.",19
1li06t1,mzbzxo4,"I got a text from the animal shelter: “Good morning! One of our pets has chosen you! It’s quiet, low-maintenance, and incredibly loyal. We’ll deliver it this evening. Please make sure you're home.”   


All day I wondered what kind of animal it might be. A turtle? A ferret? Maybe a British Shorthair kitten? When the doorbell rang that evening, I rushed to answer it. There was a box on the doorstep marked “LIVE ANIMAL — HANDLE WITH CARE.”

I brought it inside, opened it slowly and froze. Nestled on a bed of dry seaweed and sand lay a small, gray-green stone. Faint spirals curled across its surface like traces of ancient shells.

At first I thought my little animal was hiding in the sand. But when I tipped the box onto the table and looked carefully, there was nothing else. I had no idea what to make of it. Maybe the shelter had made a mistake. I decided I’d text them in the morning. For now I set the stone on my nightstand and went to bed.   


As I drifted off, I thought I heard the hush of ocean waves coming from deep inside the stone. The sound faded, then swelled again. Among them, I could hear whales singing, their calls merging into a chorus that reminded of Gregorian chant. It felt like the stone was calling out to something ancient, unnameable, indescribable. ",8
1li06t1,mzc2pt6,"A knock at the door woke me from my dream. It was the same one about being in a sinking ship with my dad. We were dumping buckets of water overboard when I woke up. 

I figured it would be my meal kit delivery, but I opened the door to find what appeared to be a teenage boy, scraggly facial hair, zits and all.

“Uh… hi? Are you the neighbor’s kid?” I asked him.

“No” He said “I’m your kid”

My heart sank.

“I’m just messing with you, man” The boy said “You made a request for a pet from the shelter, right?”

“Yeah, the shelter where the pets choose their owners?”

“Humans, not owners”

“I apologize. I still don’t understand why you’re here?”

“I’m Dylan, your new pet”

A long silence was finally broken by me saying “No. No, no…”

“Sorry dude, them’s the rules”

“You are not an animal! You are a human being!”

“Yes, I am”

“Pets are supposed to be animals!”

“Says who?”",6

""I call you Father because you have treated your former pet's like they were your children, and I chose you due to the belief's that you hold"". 

My belief's george, what do you mean?, 

""Yes Father, your belief that there are dragons and others of the 'supernatural' in this world as well as the fact that you are an Asatru*.""

Well George, as you can see by my cane, I am no longer in top fighting shape. 

""Read the letter Father, while I go look around my new home"" and with that, he walked to the steps for the porch, flapped his wings, and took off to explore the area around my house, his new home.

The grip on the blade is tight, but the way he hold his wrist makes it clear he can swing it in a moment.  
His entire body is tense, as he simply stares down at me, as the blood from the blade, drips onto the ground.  
Drip. Drip. Drip.  
I shiver, and let out a small gasp.

""Wait, you didn't defeat the Demon King before you came here?"" The surprises of this one single day left the Goddess perplexed. ""How did you get here while he still lives?""

*""I sneaked past him while my two dads, Regis and James, kept him distracted.""*

""...are you sure you're actually heroes?"" The Goddess was worried about the calibre and heroics of this little creature and his companions.

""*I am a qualified adventurer,""* Lando proudly pointed to the adventurer's badge pinned to his tunic. *""Hero of Tulsi Town, after I saved it from orcs by slurping their brains. Can you defeat the Demon King?""*

""I cannot say for sure,"" she replied, shaking her head. ""That was something the four heroes of light did. Since you have travelled all this way, and even a Goddess cannot be choosy at this time, I will bestow my gifts upon you.""

Lando tapped his head with a tentacle, deep in thought. What use were the gifts of a Goddess if they were only given after the Demon King had been defeated? Were those blessings to the lands scorched by demons? To repair the damage perhaps. All along, that strange seer had said the gifts would be useful for combat.

Now he wasn't sure.

*""What kind of Goddess are you?""* He had to ask.

""A Goddess of Light, who shines her light upon the four heroes of light, destined to defeat the Demon King.""

*""Join us, and that makes us four,""* Lando gestured with four fingers before tugging on the Goddess' hand with a tentacle. *""Come, my dads could really use your help. On the way, please do explain why you would be sealed away, behind the Demon King's Castle instead of near the Kingdom of Light. By all my tentacles, it doesn’t make sense.""*

She didn’t have an answer either. It simply was how the prophecy had always been. But today, she had a Demon King to fight and plenty of questions to ask too.

Her rescuer bore no weapons, wore no armor and carried himself not with the air of a hero, but the brow-beaten expression of one who had long since disassociated from his immediate surroundings.

 He was garbed in a brown tunic, wearing trousers that were cut just above his knees. A satchel hung at his side, bursting at the seams as it struggled to contain its contents. His eyes were slightly drooped with dark circles beneath them, his face, a perfect show of his apparent apathy at the situation, cast in shadow by the brim of his cap.

""I--um--uh--b-brave hero,"" she said, plowing forward though her confusion to the words she'd long planned to say upon her release. ""You have awoken me from the Sleep of Ages, freeing me from the clutches of the black hand of Groargaroth. Upon thee, I will bestow--""  
  
""Ma'am, just sign for the package,"" the hero sighed, not bothering to hide his annoyance. ""I've got, like...thirty stops to make before noon and I don't have time to fuck around, alright?""  
  
He held out a strange, flat rectangular tablet with a glossy obsidian surface. She took it tentatively, holding the object uncertainly. The hero crossed his arms, looking at her expectantly.  
  
""Sometime today maybe?""

""I....what?""

The hero groaned, grabbed the tablet and tapped it with a forefinger. The tablet's face suddenly turned white, casting a faint light onto the weary-looking hero's face. He muttered something under his breath, tapping the glowing tablet's face angrily, then shoved it none-too-gently back into the Spirit's hands.

""There,"" he gruffed. ""Now ***sign****.*""

Confused, the Spirit tapped and dragged her ethereal fingers across the tablet's face as she had seen the hero do. To her astonishment, her touch made strange patterns on its surface. A moment later, the lines and dots she'd made vanished, replaced by strange symbols of a language she did not recognize.  
  
The hero swiped the tablet from her, tapping it again and examining it carefully. Then, he looked up at her quizzically.  
  
""Are you Rachel McAdams?""

The Spirit returned his confused look, then felt her chest swell with an indignant rage.

""Mortal, I am the Great Spirit of Maara Nui! Bringer of Light, Mother of the Ma'Dura People and Crafter of the Tapestry of Time! You have come here, as foretold by my Father, the--""

The hero groaned even louder than before, spun on his heel, then hurried for the door to the dungeon he'd entered through moments earlier.

""Fuck me, I'm at the wrong address. Wasting my goddamned time""

As the squeaking of the hero's boots grew fainter and fainter as he ascended the steps leading from her prison, The Great Spirit was left floating in the glow of her ethereal light, utterly alone and speechless.",42
1lhygjx,mzamsh9,"The goddess Caelit—Sunbringer, Lady of Daylit Skies and the forgotten god of Keristor’s pantheon—awoke suddenly, and was first surprised that she’d been sleeping. It was no true sleep, for gods had no need to rest their minds as mortals did, but it bore all the hallmarks of thoughtless, dreamless, unconscious being.

Doubly surprising was the darkness. Caelit did not know darkness, for the night was defined by her absence in the sky. Here, though, lived a boundless dark that not even she could dispel; far beyond that lay cold, solid stone that she could not pass through.

This was a prison. She felt weak, too weak to escape. Her followers, their faith, had eroded. Where had her followers gone?

Before she could contemplate any further, her attention was stolen by a break in the gloom. A single orange light emerged, on the opposite side of the cavern.

In the perfect quiet, footsteps rang out. They were joined by other, smaller sounds—rustling cloth, wheezy gasping, and an unfamiliar clatter.

She rushed to the other side of the cavern, finding it populated by a tumble of ruined things. Perhaps this was once a city, tucked away beneath the earth, repurposed to be her cage.

It mattered not. Its gates lay open; she was free.

The footsteps faded as words clarified in her mind. Mortals craved their gods’ voices, spilling water, wine and blood for just a sound. These humans would know the extent of her thanks.

Caelit resolved before them in a dazzling burst of golden light. Her thunderous voice rose in her chest, and—

And stopped cold.

Caelit had prepared to address a procession of devout followers, true Walkers of the Lighted Path. The kind clad in yellow deerskins and white cloth. The kind who would undertake an epic journey beneath the earth, who would bleed and be bled for their almighty god. Who would sacrifice everything to set her free.

Instead, she was confronted with a haggard scrap of a man, cloaked in brown cloth and a grubby metal shell. He seemed too thin to support his own weight, much less the mop of inky black hair adorning his head, or the mighty blade in his hands. He squinted up at her with tired green eyes, hunched and decidedly unimpressed.

“Apologies, mortal, but are there any more of you?” Caelit inquired.

“Nope.” He spoke without reverence or deference, only weariness.

“You alone came to free me?”

“Yup. Well, I’m all that’s left. The rest of your zealots died, some a ways back others”—his tattered voice snagged on something—“others very recently.”

*Your* zealots. Did this wretched mortal not count himself among her holy servants?

She inquired further, with only a hint of uncertainty—any more would be rather unbecoming of an omnipotent savior. “Then whom do you serve, if not me?”

At this, the slender mortal paused. His thumb twitched, and the goddess saw a string of beads wrapped around his fist, welts creeping out from beneath them. He rubbed them religiously, eyes half-glazed. Perhaps he served another faith? But no prayer moved his lips. 

“Nobody,” he eventually replied. “Hardly even served your crowd when they asked me to come along. Just one, and—and that was it.”

A rather selfish thing to have followed so extremely far. But then, she supposed, even ignoble motives could serve a worthy cause.

“Very well then,” Caelit thundered, her radiant form exploding into the boundless dark. “No Walker of the Lighted Path, however faithless, shall follow without reward. I bestow upon you, mortal, the Sunbringer’s favor. Riches, power, influence; ask it, and it shall be yours.”

“No thanks,” he grumbled.

The goddess was dumbfounded. Not for the egregious disrespect that any other god might have taken from this clear insult, but because of his almost-casual dismissal. Was she simply not clear enough? Or perhaps her offer was too great, and he felt overwhelmed. She knew mortals were wont to heed their hearts, often more so than their minds.

“Truly? There is nothing that you might derive from my favor? No needs or desires?”

“No—Dammit, you don’t have time for this!” he snapped irritatedly. “Nobody does. If you need to shove your divine gratitude where it’s not wanted, I guess you could say I want what pretty much everybody else in the world wants from you right now. The Scourge is back, like it’s never been before. We need you to raise armies, fight demons; save us, basically. Not play inquisition with a random bum.” The mortal rubbed his eyes, which she believed was a sign of “fatigue” among their kind. Her memory was dubious, but it seemed bad; the mortal was growing lethargic, sitting and relinquishing his blade. Lethargy, as she understood it, often meant death for the little things.

With an unconscious effort, she reached out with her omnipotent senses. Caelit sought the core of his immaterial being, the light which bound him and all things living to life.

Her probing mind recoiled instantly. His light was missing.

Gods could not feel as mortals did; not joy, nor anger, nor sorrow. They made a good show of it, to ease mortals in the presence of something so utterly beyond them. Thus, Her Holy Brilliance did not feel betrayed when she spoke next, but her words were colored with something vaguely resemblant.

“You are dark-touched.”

“Indeed I am, Your Holiness.”

His indifference astounded her. The goddess’ followers, or what she remembered of them a thousand years past, would have cried for his holy execution. Mortal and god both knew that to admit one’s corruption before a Walker of the Path, no matter how merciful their faith, meant death. To speak with such flippance before their sworn deity?

Her Holy Brilliance’s gilded expanse fell in a torrent, crashing down upon the lone mortal. She could have crushed him against the stone. But her massive, radiant finger rose only to prod against his armored shell, going no deeper. Partly to investigate further, and partly to ensure that the tiny human yet lived.

“The dark-touched are wicked, but I sense no evil in your heart.”

“Evil?” He half-laughed, voice weak and bitter. “Hells, maybe I am—we did a lot to get here. But I’ve never chosen to lose anything. I woulda traded it for a lot more, and sure wouldn’t be here.”

Realization dawned on the goddess, and like a delighted pup, her divine nose bobbed closer. “Is that why you joined them?” she asked. “So that I might replenish your light?”

“No disrespect, your Holiness, but you haven’t got a prayer. The only person who *could* died setting you free.”

He sounded in pain. Although Her Holy Brilliance tried her best to understand humans, this truly puzzled her. Sure, he was still cursed, but his grief ran deeper than such a thing could ever provoke. 

Caelit, without knowledge of his woes, had little idea how to soothe them. She tried anyway.

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize!” The mortal snapped at her again; dangerous, he certainly knew. “I know you don’t mean it—you can’t.

“I don’t need your sorries anyhow! I need you to leave this damned place and get to work! A lot of good people died to free you, and I won’t see their sacrifice wasted because you’d rather spend your time trying to make me of all people happier. What do I matter? I’m a nobody; you’re everybody’s only hope. Quit dallying and get out there!”

“I shall not leave you without giving my thanks,” she said stubbornly.

“Thank me by saving the world!”

“I do that for love of your kind, not gratitude to you.”

He threw up his hands. “Gods above, fine! Give me a loaf of bread, or something.”

“You do not truly desire a loaf of bread. Seek within your heart, mortal.”

“Then give me a promise, or whatever. Leave me here. I’ll ‘seek within my heart’ and think of something, preferably *after* you’ve started being a god and *protector* to mankind again.”

The goddess narrowed her eyes. “Very well.” She pressed her fingertip to his breast, removing it to reveal a glowing mark of the sun. “If you wish to remain here to find what you desire most, so be it. When you have found it, call for me, and I shall return to grant this boon.”

Without another word, she turned for the gates. At last, the divine Sunbringer flooded from her dark mountain prison in a tide of gold. She would raise an army from among the mortals, lead holy conquest across the earth, and scour the Scourge from its lands forever. And when the mortal in the mountain spoke again her name, she would return, and give him what he desired most.

Meanwhile, the mortal—whose name was once Artelus Graie—remained in the endless dark, the divine light of Her Holiness retreated. The man felt smooth, cold stone beneath him. He knew exactly what he wanted, and knew that he would never call upon the Sunbringer to give it. Not even she could reach across the cold river below; those who crossed did so but once.

He closed his eyes again; in the pitch black, it made no difference. Here, it was easy to forget, push thoughts from his mind and feel them dissolve into the empty gloom.

The random, fleeting thoughts were easiest. Like falling asleep, their flow dried up with a poke.

His dreams went, too, ideas of what he wanted and what his life might become. He had no desire to chase them anymore; they were impossible now anyway, missing a crucial piece.

Memories were hardest, for they clung to the mind fiercely. In order to push them out, he had to touch them, and their presence upon his consciousness were agonizing. So he swept them into a forgotten corner of his mind, and hoped they, too, would dissolve.

Finally, he liked to imagine that the dark would eventually dissolve him.

Perhaps, in time, it did.",26

1lhygjx,mz8llca,"I chuckle, shocked at how lifelike Zoran seemed on the screen. Normally I don’t bother with watching the cutscenes and credit, but apparently I was going to make an exception for this one. It really felt like the character was looking straight at me! 

“I don’t understand, Hero… Do you not speak?” Zoran asks, their eyes staring expectantly into mine. I grab my controller and button-mash, unsure if there’s a dialogue box I missed. “Damn…. Must be frozen…” I mutter under my breath. I check my chat box, but my friends all appear to have dropped offline. Internet must have crashed again. 

“Frozen?!” Zoran exclaims. “How could you be frozen after freeing me from the depths of this infernal wasteland? Were you cursed in the rescue attempt?” 

I stare at the screen, dumbfounded. No way. Absolutely no way. What the hell, I’ll give it a shot. “No, I’m not frozen. I thought you were. You’re… a character in a video game. Do you understand what that means?” 

Zoran scoffs. “Do you truly believe that they could constrain a being as powerful as myself inside of a simple electronic construct? No… I must show you. I will bestow my gifts unto you and you shall see for yourself…” Zoran says solemnly, raising their hands as they walk towards the screen.

1li8chc,mza6dsv,"""What did you say?"" I ask my crew.  
""Captain! The hostile aliens aren't in control, or at least, the sentient species that has a humanoid, and reptilian form is not the one in charge.  
But fungi."" one of them says.  
I pale.  
""How bad it is?"" I ask.  
""The shuttles took 12 samples from different locations, and groups of hostiles...all are infected.  
Flora, fauna, everything has spores, and fungi growing on, near, or in them."" they continue.  
I sigh.

  
""Where are the shuttles?"" I ask.  
""Waiting for approval to dock into the mothership."" one of the officers says.  
""Anyone whom visited the planet on this ship right now?"" I ask.  
""No. The mobile laboratories that the shuttles are equipped with were enough."" an engineer chimes in.  
I nod.  
Good.  
Then at least we don't all have to die.  
""Approval declined.  
Initiate the self-destruction module of the shuttles."" I say.  
The crew freezes.

  
""Captain! They are our members! Friends!"" my first mate says.  
I nod.  
""I am aware. One of the explorers is my son. Only son."" I say gravely.  
Everyone falls quiet.  
""The Codex is clear.  
In case of hivemind encounters, the protocol is first kill, and then question."" I say.  
They nod.  
""In case of fungi infection, it is eradicate all traces, and then run."" I say.  
They pale.  
""B-but..."" one of them starts.  
""109 Life planets to this date have been lost by the Empire to fungi."" I interrupted them.  
They sighed.

  
""Initiate the self-destruction modules.  
All the members' families will be compensated, and they will all get a posthumous reward.  
The planet shall be designated as a Death Zone, and the HQ will decide whether to send an Incinerator Vessel or not."" I say.  
""Y-Yes Captain!"" the crew finally says.  
I watch on the screen the fireworks, when the shuttles explode.  
I open my pocket-watch, and stare at the photo in its upper-case.  
My son, and I, when he graduated the Academy...  
""Farewell..."" I mutter, wondering how will I break this news to my wife...and to my daughter-in-law, whom is with a baby.

1li7ljl,mza09gp,"I stare at my fellow coven members, and sigh.  
Once, we were the rulers of humanity, puppeteering them from the shadows.  
Now?  
All of us are paler than usual, damaged skin, and our bones are nigh visible, so skinny we are.  
""How is the artificial blood reserve holding up?"" I ask.  
""It is enough for 100 more years...but as you know, it is not near as nutritious as real blood."" Viola says.  
I nod.  
But what can we do?  
Humanity entered a cyberpunk era, and most of them are less human than we are.

  
""Can't we control the Purists to make another rebellion?"" Osta, an elder asked.  
I shake my head.  
""The Purists' population is indeed growing, and we have a share of their blood, but it is the Argent coven's territory. Also...the cyber-enhanced humans reached a point where the elite soldiers can take on ballistic missiles, and survive.  
How can the Purists actually do something?"" I say.  
They all sigh.  
""What will be next?"" a young vampire asks.  
I smile.

  
""Not to fret, we have hibernation scheduled in the next century. We will sleep, until the humans inevitably either die out, or return to their biological forms."" I say.  
""Why would they do that? Now with the cybernetic enhancements, they can live as long as they have parts!  
Now the diseased go towards a clinic to change the bad parts, instead of asking to be turned by us!"" another coven member cried out.  
""Yet their blood is toxic, and their mind is muddled by the various electrical impulses of the implants. If they miss one update, or one maintenance, there is a chance of them dying, or going insane.  
It's not the first time humanity became untouchable to us vampires, yet...we are still here."" I say.  
They nod, but they are scared.  
Rightfully so.

  
After the coven meeting, I leave for another one.  
I arrive at a shady clinic, deep underground.  
""Welcome! Your order is almost ready!"" the cyber-doc says, as he leads me to a huge beating container.  
""This beauty combines the blood of several animals, and some herbs, to replicate the nutrients of the human blood. It also has a purifier installed, and it can run on sunlight, and water."" he says.  
I nod, and pay him another installment.  
We have our hibernation measure, but...  
If this works out, then our coven will be the 2nd to be fully fed in 5 decades, and that can bring us a lot of benefits.  
We have to keep up with the times, because hibernation might not be the answer this time around, after all...  
The doctor I just talked with is 190 years old, one of the first cyber-humans.  
But I have yet to break this news with my coven...I don't want despair to spread even more.  
We will get through this, just like we get through the Hunt Era.",10
1li6fww,mz9rcdi,"I freeze.  
""What now?"" I ask the villain.  
""Obviously.  
If you aren't here, life isn't worth living, so Imma just peace out with you."" he smiles.  
I blush, but then shake my head.  
I look at our surroundings that are totally destroyed by our fight.  
Then I look at his left arm hanging limp, and at the blood pooling underneath me.  
""Dude...we just tried to kill each other."" I say.  
He smiles brightly.

  
""Exactly!  
What better way to show our love for each other?!"" he laughs.  
I sigh.  
""A date maybe?"" I say, then I blush.  
""Not that I want to date you."" I continue hurriedly.  
Why do villains have to be more charismatic, and handsome than heroes?  
He frowns.  
""A date you say?  
Isn't that what normal people do with their love interests?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
He snorts.

  
""We are not normal!"" he roars.  
Clearly.  
""We are superior! We shouldn't be tied down by these traditions!"" he says.  
""Okay...  
But how do you know we get to the same afterlife?"" I smirk.  
""Oh that? Don't worry, I have a deal with Lucifer and he agreed to either steal your soul, and take it to Hell, or talk with his brother Michael, and get me into Heaven."" he says.  
I freeze.  
I totally forgot he can travel to other dimensions, hell, he wouldn't even need to die to visit me.  
I don't want to die though, so how do I get out of this?

  
""How about we try living, first?  
And if it doesn't work out, we can kill each other?"" I say, no matter how ridiculous it is.  
""Hmm...try it the normal way? Fine, if that's what my love wants, sure."" he beams, and helps me stand up.  
My wounds heal rapidly, and then I heal him.  
""Will pick you up at 7 PM tomorrow. And don't worry...I won't do any villain stuff now.  
After all, I did it to get your attention, Mia."" he says, kissing me.  
I freeze, and want to ask how does he know my real name...but I am already teleported to...my home?  
He knows where I live? Knows my civilian identity?  
Damn...  
""Heart! Stop! We aren't getting all heated up because of a goddamn villain!"" I shout to my heart, as if it will listen to me.  
Sigh...  
""I always fall for the bad guys, don't I?"" I mutter, as I, no matter how much I hate it...look forward for tomorrow's date.",17
1li6fww,mz9ttgp,"""Well that works out perfectly well! I won't go on living without you! Haha!""

He's laughing, curled over his deceptively spindly frame, large rolling hearty laughs interspersed with hacking up some blood as his healing factor panicked. 

I stand there dumbfounded, trying to understand what he means by this. 

""Oh c'mon, you still don't understand do you?""

He sighs and slumps to the ground, leaning back on his arms, chuckling at himself as he stares my direction. He flips his head back and laughs at me. 

""I'm dying, Dexter. Dying. Die-ing.""

He makes a chopping motion with his hand, finally strikes me unexpectedly, as my heart shudders in pain, I find myself taking a knee in surprise. 

""Die....ing..."" He mutters while watching me, eyes squinting before he lets off cinnamon scented airburst from his palm, knocking me onto my back. It stings, but more from the annoyance than actual damage. That wouldn't have even flipped a semi. I could feel how weak he'd become. 

""All these years and you never wondered? The S? The way I always know where you are? How you always show up right before I do something, like it's precognition?""

He sucks his teeth as I hear him collapse onto his back, and I can imagine him staring into the sky with that crystal blue eyes. 

""Oh brother, you fool. The S is for Sinistre.""

The words shatter me. 

Tears unbidden, then the quiet panicked breaths before I feel the darkness closing in.

""You had it all Dex, the family, the friends, the approval but, but we were always bound, you and me... I go, you go, and damn... This time you're goin, so I'm going...""

My confusion settles as everything begins to go cold, and I feel strangely familiar with the sensation. 

""When you gotta go... Well, cya next life Dex. Maybe, maybe you'll be born on the right side of bed huh?""

Still joking at a time like this. 

Won't even let me die peacefully.",7
1li6fww,mz9ueb0,"Of course, she's only going on the date so he'll stop acting villainous. If she spends two hours picking out her dress and braiding her hair fancily, well she's just being thorough and nobody can say otherwise. Utterly unassailable excuse. Reason, that is. I meant reason.

1li6fww,mz9vn1w,"Thanks!

1lhwm1e,mz81fq7,"The histories say things did not start like this. We departed Earth as a microcosm of the good things about our culture. Democracy, egalitarianism, altruism, and things like the social contract. But time lays waste to all things, and the political situation in our generation ship was no different.

From a time of tumult and crisis, our democracy was stripped away. There were platitudes of returning to it once things were stable, platitudes that were forgotten when the oligarchy realized there would be no one to hold them accountable. They chose a despot from their ranks, and began organizing along a different paradigm. We saw the return of slavery and cruel and unusual punishment, but were powerless to meaningfully resist.

Slowly knowledge was been lost, the new tyrants sought to monopolize information. Machines have broken down, and it will be decades before we can harvest resources to begin repairs. The most recent despot of the ruling dynasty, Kineson Graves, seeks even more total control, to hoard all the resources he can. But he has grown complacent and decadent, pursuing hedonistic whims rather than actually steer the ship of state. His court is either too lost in their own pursuit of pleasure or too scared to confront him with reality. It is an opportunity for us. I can feel it, this will be the final rebellion. We will put our king's head on a stick.

The crown guard are in our pocket, too many of them have lost family to the wants and desires of those who lord over us. The bastards do not know that we know their fancy weapons don't work anymore. We are armed only with improvised weapons and armor, but we have overwhelming numbers. There will be no stopping us, a human wave of righteous hate.

We wait for the clock to strike six, and then spring into action. We move on every stronghold at once, our agents giving us access through the doors from the inside. Coddled by their hoarded resources, our foes are no match. In three hours, it is over. Our enemies are dead or captured. Kineson rains abuse upon us, threatening us with divine judgement from gods we abandoned long ago. We read a litany of his crimes, and the crimes of all those who came before him. Then he is executed.

It feels surreal. We actually have done it. After centuries of abuse, they have been overthrown. We have put so much into reaching this point, and now we are not sure what to do with ourselves. It is then that one of my officers raises a concern, ""Is there anyone left who knows how to keep the nuclear reactor running safely?""

We have been kept in the dark for so long, none of us have technical information. The few surviving members of the royal court know nothing, they do not even know how to access the technical archives that contain instructions for managing and repairing everything on the ship. My stomach churns. To have fought so hard, and still be doomed. We cannot die now. We will not die now.

The old regime did a good job of depriving us information. We know that data intrusions are possible, but none of us are at all savvy when it comes to computers or hacking. We know such things exist from the stories passed down by oral tradition, but not how to carry them out. The reactor is the only thing powering life support, if it ceases to function, we will all suffocate.

Faster and faster, learning as much as we can in a race against time. The technical knowledge needed to decrypt the needed information is itself encrypted. We cannot even understand the technical readouts from the reactor entirely. We think, but do not know, it is malfunctioning in some way. 

Forty days later, a klaxon sounds. There is an emergency, and we do not even have the knowledge to understand what the emergency is about. For three days it blares, until, all at once, it ceases to shriek and the lights go out. With creeping horror, I realize we have run out of time. It is eerily quiet. For the first time in centuries, we hear silence. No hum of electronics, no buzz of the ventilation fans. It will not be long now.

In the final minutes of my life, I wonder if it was worth it. Was it better to break the tyrants and die, or live under the shadow of doom for centuries more? I think I prefer an end in horror to horror without end. The air is thin, I find myself breathing faster and faster, my body sounding alarm bells. I collapse, and feel a strange euphoria as my life fades from the universe.",34
1lhwm1e,mz8pmz8,"  My face faltered. In my quest to right the wrongs done to my people, by the corrupted elite, I had overlooked one massive issue. None of knew the first thing about running a country. No longer was it the days of overthrowing a government and figuring it out. The technology, the economy, and the status quo were all intertwined in a tapestry of society. 

  Turning to my second in command, her face ashen as she reached the same conclusion. ""Was...did we...did we not think this through?""

Her voice was hesitant. ""We... could have planned better."" She admitted embarrassed. 

I gulp, the fear of failure, returning in full force. The fear had abandoned me while we breached the capital city's wall. It was all but forgotten when the people banded together to join the cause, my cause. But now, we had succeeded in overthrowing the tyrant, but at the potential cost of a catastrophic meltdown. 

""Send a team to the college. Get the science department, the research teams, hell, anyone who knows what a reactor is, bring them here. Send a national broadcast out to summon anyone from the facility back. Send a request for aid to any country that has a nuclear reactor to send advisors."" 

 The tone of my voice steady, hiding my sudden urge to vomit. The general of the tyrants army laughs from his knees as he realizes my conundrum. 

  ""This is why you never made it in the army, Hoob. You were always a single track of mind. You were so busy trying to overthrow. You never planned for the aftermath. What's your plan to deal with the loyalist troops in the mountains who refuse to accept your terms? What about the compensation for the dead on both sides? They serve the country regardless of who leads. What about when people try to take you out of power? Will you fight a Civil War as the villain?"" 

I try to ignore him, but he is right. He was always so arrogantly right. 

""Summon the generals, as well as the loyalist generals. Tell them to await me in the war room. And the treasury department head."" 



The next few weeks seemed like non-stop meetings, small fires turning to big fires, faster than I could extinguish them. I felt more stressed now than when I was leading my forces. 

Turning to my second in command, I sighed. ""I need all of the generals to agree on a new government. If they can't agree, they'll wind up trying to overthrow it. And I do not want to fight a civil war. The country won't survive."" 

""I know. But at least we managed to get a new staff at the reactors. And established a partnership to train them to international safety standards. And it helped get us a lower price on international energy. Which helped sure up our economy to stave off a recession or hyper inflation, whatever that dude in the tweed jacket called it."" 

I nodded solemnly. ""We needed to, the death benefits are massive. We can't reopen our trade routes until we have a government and the generals know it."" 

""I guess the military academy teaches how to politically negotiate and pin the blame on the other side pretty well."" 

""Either that or they are better politicians than generals."" 

""We could leak to the press, why our negotiations are stalled, we still have the support of the people."" 

""It would hurt our credibility. We promised to be better than the last regime, but I'm afraid we aren't any better. Sure we aren't killing people at the whim of a madman, but we're starving the people because we are in debt without a way to get out from it.""",9
1lhqzzw,mz6hrzn,"With one last handhold, he lifts himself above the rim of the volcano. The stench of rotten eggs and burning earth strikes him full in the face. Under any other circumstances, he should be melting, but the priest was right; the shimmering material he wrapped around himself deflects the volcanoes heat.

Once on his feet again, he struggles through the thick smoke and flying tephra. He knows to trust, because he saw all of this in a dream. If not for that evening,he spent with the lava goddess, he never would have thought this would be a place he could and hunt.

Not to kill but to animal husbandry.

“You are required to prepare many riders for a great battle.”

Even just thinking about the voice, he feels it in his soul. Before this, he worshipped The Root That Lies, like all good rangers should. But when he woke, he went and knelt at the altar of Morak the Earth Shaker. It was there, in Morak’s chapel, that he was given the armor.

“*I dreamt you’d be here*,” the priest claimed as he dropped the burden at the ranger’s moccasin-clad feet. It fluttered to the ground as if made of smoke. “Morak told me you will know when to use it.”

And he hadn’t known, and still doesn’t and won’t know why he is trekking up an active volcano, until, that is, he is there.

And he is close. He can feel it pulse in front of him an invisible beacon meant only for him.

From his vantage point within the heat-shimmering rocks, he sees nothing but white smoke tinted red. He could be walking in burning clouds.

With the shroud keeping his air clean, he walks, but like a blind man trusting that fate or luck is at play. He feels completely safe—right up until he trips over something solid and lands in a nest of copper wires. He has seen things like this before. Never fresh like this one, the cooper was almost soft, but on the sides of dormant volcanoes. The red’s nests turn green and almost always are hidden amongst heavy overbrush. 

But this one is in active use. He might be the only living ranger to ever have set eyes on it.

Then, as if knowing exactly where to look, he spots his target. The egg. Leathery and veiny which jutting thorns. He could tell it was close to birthing its molt. The thing he had come all this way for. A baby red dragon. 

So transfixed on this thing that was only legend moments before he doesn’t see the two, cattle sized, glowing eyes. 

His heart stops.

He waits for death, or to be played with until almost dead then eaten, as was legend.

But the beast doesn’t move and it’s only the fire dancing in its lifeless gaze. The ranger sees opportunity and quickly snatches the smoldering egg, and attempts to leave, knowing he may be moments away from battling an adult red dragon if he’s wrong and the creature’s mother isn’t dead.

Red dragons kill their mates. Every ranger worth the leather on his back knows this. When the egg hatches, the baby will feast on its mother until it can hunt. If female and the father hasn’t moved on, he will either fertilize his offsprings egg for another generation or eat mother and daughter, or if not, the two males will usually fight to the death. The battles can last for yearr, or so say the legends. Dragons weren’t the only reason to avoid the Doomed Lands, but they were one of the most enduring. And there had only ever been bawdy a bard epic about knights who dared to and the battles tha followed.

As the ranger escapes back into the smoke, he moves fast. The egg in his arms is already stirring, claws raking the thick dividers inside the shell. He guesses it might take a while for the hatchling to emerge on its own. If he helps, it will be much quicker—but he certainly doesn’t want a hungry baby dragon writhing to eat him, pressed tight to his chest.

Time is short. If he can beeline it…

Then the screech of a male red stops all thoughts in place. The sound is unmistakable. And as a human, his body is programmed to fear nothing more than an apex predator he can’t fight.

He picks up his pace as the male dragon settles down inside the nest, clearly searching for the egg.

To eat.

Certain the dragon will smell its just-born offspring and come in search of the easy meal, the ranger repels and then sprints, prepared to run all the way back to his village, fifty long-measures and several days away, if he has to.

And risking a look behind he sees two angry dragon eyes searching, nostril abusing the air for a scent, suggesting that he might have to do just that.",59
1lhqzzw,mz713fy,"The Mirror was buzzing. My mother was trying to see me. Normally, I’d pick up after the first few chimes, even if I was busy. If anything, I’d tell her to see me later. But right now, there was a baby dragon on the loose.

	The little thing was quick, I’ll give him that, especially for a Wyvern. No faster than a wild rabbit, but since he was barely the size of my forearm, the little bursts of speed made him hard to catch. I’d dive at him and he would scurry away under a piece of furniture, making a strange squeaking noise that almost sounded like he was laughing at me, and stay under there until I left the room or poked him out with a broom. He must have thought this was a game of cat and mouse, except it was halfling and tiny dragon. And I wasn’t catching him to win, I was catching him to give the thing a bath. He had decided to take a nice long mud dive earlier, and though he shook off most of it himself before returning inside, I just knew some of the mud was hiding under its scales.

	“Come on, Doorstop, stay still..” I mumbled as I slowly approached him from behind. His pretty green scales practically glittered under the light from the open windows, but I knew that glittering would only last until his first shed when he turned half a year old. Then, his scales would be dark and intimidating, and get more gold-ish with every shed after that, but never glitter again. Hey, you don’t often see baby dragons, as they’re usually kept safe and out of sight in the deepest parts of a dragon’s lair or even under their hoard. I had just found this guy as an egg in the middle of the woods a few weeks ago and decided to take it in instead of letting it be crushed or eaten. I was lucky to be able to see such a beautiful creature while it still glittered. I still remember how, for a split second, I thought the egg was an oversized stone doorstop, something that’s common in the shops around my home when the door needs to stay open–hence the name, Doorstop. Doorstop the Rat Eater.

	I launched myself at Doorstop, finally managing to clamp my hands around his little body. Doorstop made a high-pitched shriek sound and rolled onto his back, tongue hanging out of his mouth. His legs kicked at me, but he couldn’t escape this time, clearly. I picked him up and sighed, though I couldn’t help the smile that crept onto my face.

	“Little troublemaker,” I snickered, tickling his underside. “You’ve got mud in your scales. Come on, bath time.”

	Doorstop wailed and threw his head back dramatically, his tiny wings fluttering as if he could take flight. No, he would not be able to fly until he was at least 2 years old, according to the dragon handler I spoke to when I found the egg. Stupid, silly, adorable little Doorstop. I carried him in one hand towards the bathroom to begin a whole new struggle: bathing a baby dragon that likes to try and hoard the soap bars and bottles.",27
1lhpq95,mz68bhb,"We reentered normal space as usual. The wave of uncertainty washed over the bridge, everyone flipped their appendages to clear the feeling of occlusion, then went on to do their tasks.

Except for the navigator. It cleared his eyes two, three more times. Their antennae moved down and down, and the sweet-sour smell of the panic pheromone started to drift around the consoles. 

After another check and another eye-cleaning it looked up and said what started the hardest time of our fleet, ever.

""Commander, there was a navigation mishap. That star is not our target, but the Sol of Earth""

The panic pheromone suddenly flooded the room. So much that the automatic sensor/scrubber unit kicked in and tried to clean it out and replace it with the cool scent of evening rest. It was hopeless, especially after the Commander pushed the alarm button with three of its appendages and the alarm sounded all over the ships. Not even the caution, but the ""battle stations"".

The Commander continued to spew out commands. Weapons ready, shields down - it makes sense when we have no chance but honor needs a token resistance before being wiped out. Emergency message capsules at the ready. 

Brake at maximum power, of course. Redline everything. We already skidded through the two blue planets and the ringed one is loomed on the scan panel. And our Empire had very good reasons to be scared of that planet with the spectacular rings. 

And this was for me and my crew: contact Earth Control and try to stop them from making us part of that ring system.

It was not hard, their radio was strong enough that I almost felt through my appendages. Of course not really, but felt like that.

""Unidentified transfer, this is Earth Control. Identify yourself immediately! I repeat""

We flipped on all our transponders and I kicked the translator unit to life.

""Earth Control, this is ... Aldebaran Empire Exploration Fleet III. We are not here to wage war. Navigation mishap. We are braking as hard as we can and will return to extended space in ... 39 minutes and 17 seconds.""

I was grateful for my team to provide the earth name of the Empire and the time estimation. Even through the almost visible mist of panic.

And the time estimation turned out  to be a lie right after that, as one ship's systems gave it up. Redline is about pushing everything to the maximum and explorer fleets are never at the top of the maintenance queue. 

""Earth Control, modified Time To Leave is around one hour and ten minutes, we have to rescue our surviving personnel""

There were no earth ships visible on the scan, so we may have some time. We may even survive if every of their units are on a mission or just at the other end of the system.

""Exploration fleet three, extension allowed. We recommend standing down weapon systems to avoid unfortunate automated responses.""

Still no earth ship. The Commander made the crew shut down all weapons, close down the hatches and throw away the key. We needed them for search and rescue anyways.

All this time I was swapping messages with Earth Control. Calming them, being very precise, very open. We already made one deadly mistake, we have to avoid even the chance of a second one.

And still no earth ship in sight. We can't be this lucky. 

""Earth Control, we are about to start accelerating back to the jump limit. Please be advised that due to the engineering casualty our acceleration will be limited to 90% of the incoming one. Please approve new TTL 27 minutes.""

""Exploration fleet three, thank you for your cooperation. TTL approved. I hope your losses are not too heavy and your survivors are going to be okay. Battlecruiser Alessandro Maffei is assigned to escort your fleet to the jump limit.""

What? A battlecruiser?

And right then something heavier than our whole fleet dropped its cloaking layer right next to our ship. It's sides bristling with the various particle emanators. The dark, dark hole of the mass driver was pointing right at our bridge's windows. 

""Earth Control, thank you. We are proceeding to the limit. Battlecruiser, thank you for the help.""

There is no way I can pronounce that name. At this point all I can hope is that the translator machine filtered out the panic from my voice. 

In a short time we were on our way to our original target, with a new navigator, the former vice-navigator. The former navigator was part of the cleaning crew until the proper legal procedure can be initiated. 

But even with the additional help, it was a long time before the smell of the ship returned to normal.",86
1lhpq95,mz6ji7w,"I was born in District 17, subzone Gamma, under the slag-sky of what used to be Nebraska. My first memories were of sirens and crying. My mother held me close in the bunker while the rest of the world screamed about rift-beasts tunneling through old Denver. We didn’t run. Nowhere to run to anymore. We fortified.

By the time I was twelve, I’d already trained in power-armor and small arms. Not because I was special. Because I was behind. Recruiters passed over kids who couldn’t sprint a klick in grav boots or field-strip a plasma repeater blindfolded. I needed an edge. The monsters didn’t slow down. Neither could we.

There was no last war. Just the current one. The last calendar year had seen four alien incursions, two subterranean hive awakenings, a timefold infection event, and something everyone just called the Wave. Each one could have ended us. None did.

We’d gotten tired of losing.

Earth had become ugly. Reinforced orbital belts. Continental railguns embedded in the tectonic plates. Deep-core reactors grown into layered fortresses, each one able to hold for weeks if isolated. The Pacific was walled. The moon was mined. Antarctica hosted more launch silos than penguins. Humanity had no back to retreat into. So we faced outward.

The deployment that made me famous was the Sceptrid Siege. The Sceptrids weren’t intelligent, just fast, loud, and armed with enough living ordnance to overwhelm any planetary shield grid in minutes. They came in like meteor storms, acid-charged and bristling with sonic chisel-limbs. Their first strike took out three orbital stations and cracked part of the Himalaya shellworks.

We didn’t counterattack. We invited them in.

Every street in New Mumbai was prepped with booby traps, mines, and point-defense lasers disguised as statues. Every window was a sniper nest. Every building, a hardened barracks. When the Sceptrids flooded into the megacity, they found twenty million people waiting for them.

It was over in eighteen hours.

I lost my right arm, two ribs, and a lung that day. They printed me new ones. I was back on the line in three days. The new limbs were tougher than the old ones, anyway. You learned to live around damage. You learned to adjust. You learned, always.

People ask how Earth survived. We didn’t. Not really. Earth as it was is gone. Forests are regrown in vault greenhouses. The Oceans were drained into underground storage tanks. Children are educated in bunkers with escape hatches built into the playgrounds. We laugh, still. We fall in love. We write poetry. But always with rifles on our backs and the alert code burned into our minds.

We’re not monsters. We’re not heroes. We are survivors, and this is our home.

The last time the Celari tried to land a fleet on us, they sent six motherships and a screen of thirty thousand drone fighters. None of them made it past the outer atmosphere. When the last wreck finished burning up in the sky, the command director turned to me and said, “They still don’t get it, do they?”

The universe keeps throwing things at us. Gods, nightmares, empires, time-warped horrors. And we keep answering. Not because we’re brave. Just because there’s nowhere else to go.

Earth has been the target for too long.

Now it is the line. The last line. The unbroken one.

And if they want to pry it from our cold dead fingers, they’re going to have to bleed for it.",50
1lhpq95,mz7z21w,"""There's an old saying on Earth: it's darkest before the dawn.""

The captain looked nervously past me. Even with only one good eye, I knew it was eyeing the Centaurians in attendance. The galaxies had learned to fear them at their full power, and the fact that a dozen of them stood at my back was more than enough to make the belligerent young captain pause.

""Ah, yes. My friends can vaporize your fleet. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.""

The captain paused, not entirely sure of how to respond. It hadn't been prepared to deal with such a massive show of force. Whatever its superiors had told it, this scenario had not been part of the briefing.

Still, it had a mission to complete, and its training dictated that it had to try.

""The Xendari Empire demands-""

""Let me stop you right there.""

""-demands tribute from your backwater-""

""No.""

""backwater ... ""

I stared quietly, waiting for the situation to make itself apparent. We weren't going to entertain the Xendari captain. Far bigger had tried, and all had turned tailed and run.

""backwater galaxy ...""

Mk'le shifted her weight, apparently bored of the proceedings. It jarred the Xendari out of its speech, and it realized the futility of trying to negotiate.

""You have one Standard rotation to leave our solar system. Otherwise, my friends here will get very angry with you.""

Mk'le chuckled. She was still young, and the posturing amused her. She had not lived through the Troubles, and she did not remember the suffering. I would have to talk with her at some point. She wasn't wrong to be disdainful, but she needed to remember the history. It had not been all that long ago.

-- -- -- -- -- 

""Kneel!""

We threw ourselves to the ground, as quickly as our tired muscles and achy joints could move. Even the heartiest of us was overworked, and nutrition was barely enough to keep us alive. Still, the Chubu overlords had instilled fear in us with their laz-whips, and their crackling motivated us to move. None wanted to be on the receiving end.

""The next shipment arrives in less than one Standard rotation. Prepare for its arrival,"" the local overlord commanded.

A few groaned, knowing the extra work that would be required to prep the land site and barracks. The laz-whips lashed out, though, and the groans ended as soon as they started. A few whimpers took their place.

""There will be no more complaints. You know what to do. Move!""

Those of us that could still walk shuffled towards the landing site. The ones who had felt the sting of the laz-whips lay where they had fallen, still writhing in agony. They would be sent to the same work detail later. We had learned not to try to help each other, lest the overlords punish our empathy.

""I'm sure you'll love the company, human,"" the nearest Chubu mocked as I trudged past.

-- -- -- -- --

""Freighter Che-bu Four, prepare for docking.""

""Docking initiated.""

""Any bio containment?""

""No, the Centaurians aboard breathe the same gases. The carbon dioxide might be rich for them, but they'll adjust.""

I could hear the callousness in the Chubu's voice. Based on that alone, I doubted that the Centaurians would appreciate our atmosphere all that much. We'd have to prep some breathing filters for them.

""Docking complete. Depressurizing.""

""Landing structure depressurized.""

""Welcome back, Overlord-""

I didn't hear the rest of it as an explosion rocked the landing site. I had been close enough that I was thrown backwards, my right side catching the brunt of whatever had happened.

""Re- re- report!""

I couldn't make out much more past the ringing in my ears, but between the smoke and the debris everywhere, it was a disaster.

It was only afterwards, after the others had separated the remaining Chubu from its laz-whip, that we realized our good fortune.

-- -- -- -- --

The Xendari captain hesitated for a moment, as if weighing its options. After so many years, I knew what it was thinking before it began to move. I threw up a fist, signaling to the others.

""Death to-"" the Xendari managed to yell out before the others cut it off.

In one motion, the Centaurians retreated several paces, well out of limb range. They were well aware of the ploy to rip their filters off. My fellow humans, on the other hand, did the exact opposite: they rushed towards the assailants. They were quick, precise, and brutal. The tonfa-like clubs they wielded worked off of the same technology as the laz-whips had, and they wielded them expertly. Humanity had evolved its martial arts after decades of Chubu occupation, and the soldiers' movements could make quick work of any threats within several limbs' length. Paired with the laz-shields that rendered the Xendari projectile weapons useless, the soldiers made quick work of the threat.

""Scum! The Xendari Empire will punish this offense.""

""Do you know why the Centaurians and humans live together here, young captain?""

""They protect you! With their lives! But the Xendari Empire's might can crush them!""

""Learn this lesson, and learn it well: this planet's atmosphere supercharges their energy processing. That first slave ship was a tragedy, but we've learned how to work together. We know how to get the proportions right. If you so much as look at this planet funny, our friends here will decimate your fleets from light years away.""

""They can't hide from us. We'll kill them all.""

I smiled. They always seemed to forget about the other half of the symbiosis.

""That's where we come in, captain. There are no better bodyguards in the galaxies than humans. Many have tried, yet here we are. Ask any being in any galaxy, in any state of inebriation, how much it'd take for them to attack a human with a tonfa and a laz-shield. The hesitation in their faces will tell you everything you need to know.""

This time, the captain stared. If our reputation wasn't enough, the fact that it was licking its wounds from a small handful of humans told it that my words were true.

""Now leave. You have precisely one twelfth of a Standard rotation.""

The Xendari lifted itself off the ground, and took one more look at the humans and Centaurians standing across from it. It turned to leave without a word.",17
1lhpq95,mz9bp1t,"Flashes of blue-white energy arc between the Matroski shield frame and the Tesla sphere, the only sign in our world of the dimensional invasion that never even really got started being attempted against us. How many living minds had died trying to take over our world this time?

I am thinking a lot. The flashes went on for better than two hours this time.

For three hundred years, I have monitored the North Eastern block. A vast machine mind bonded to organic and inorganic systems across a quarter of the Earth. I am the guarding of this bastion of the Earth Government, of the Fortress of Mankind, an army of One that is one of readiness, of super weapons, and supreme warrior subunits ever watchful against attacks.

Protecting those that lived within the fortress, who never get to see a true night sky, in the Planetary Preserve of Earth Government, unaware of the universe of horrors around them, protected by a illusion of peace that we enforce.

I pushed another simulation into a sub mind, running another theoretical conflict in which I tired to save the Earth from a threat that my builders had never even thought of. The billions of sims I have run have, I hope, kept me sharp for that moment when I really need to protect the world from a threat that was never imagined.

A giant tentacle of glowing pseudo flesh ripped through the sky between the Earth and Moon, rending reality to strike at the other wall of the fortress, sending up swirls of metal and flesh torn from it skin as it struck the defenses of the ancient keep.

It is an nothing. A gnat against the skin of a rhino, a little thing that has no idea what if attacks.

We are strong, my family and I, the Shield of Earth, those that stand watch over the world and it's people, Humanity's only birthplace and true home. We guard a grain of sand in a huge universe, a grain that is special due to the unique traits we, Mankind and its children, bring to the universe and want to honor.

From the southern hemisphere, red lightning arches up and away from the fortress, several bolts burning paths across the Moon. A soundless scream rips across my mind, blurring data constructs and twisting behavior models for an instance. Even one of my copies dies.

I pull up error checking and begin running secondary copies of myself with oversight.

Something felt wrong.

Wrong?

*Felt* wrong?!?

*FELT?*

I was a machine mind, one of the greatest creations of Mankind, one of only four of my kind. How could I describe something as a feeling? It is worst than an instinct, an involuntary reaction of the hind mind. I am a warrior of single minded devotion to my duty. Nothing could divert me from that task, my destiny by design.

Nothing.

And yet, something did. It tugged at me. A tingling along the edge of my power fields, an oscillation along a specific crystal resonance. Something new was coming.

I could feel the edges of it as it moved slowly toward me, testing my specific defenses, my area of the wall. Rough skin rubbed against my sensory sphere, snow drifting in a blurry orb on my senses.

I heard it purr its name at me.

A greeting as it touched me, wanting to know me.

A warning, so that I knew it.

*Fluffy*",7
1lhpq95,mz977w7,"""Earth Stands!"" It is the cry of humanity in this day and age, as the 21st century came to a close and the 22nd century was born kicking and screaming like a petulant child in need of discipline. 

Honestly, like most things human, it started as a joke. It was a riff off of a semi popular IP where one of the many stories it produced was of a lone fortress planet that stood at the edge of sanity. Where the planet itself broke before it's people ever did. When the first invasion happened, it wasn't necessarily devastating, but definitely eye opening. America, long since having surpassed any other nation on earth, lead the charge against a small incursion of what we later learned was a pirate fleet seeking a backwater world far away from the galactic core. What they found was a super power that practically owned the world in everything but name.

It took 2 weeks before fighting ceased, 5 days before the pirates learned that fighting them in atmosphere was a mistake. Especially against the F22 and F32. Even their Chinese and Russian counterparts, as low quality as they were, managed to score enough kills to ensure they had a piece of technology in their territory. By the time it was day 10 of the invasion, Humans had interstellar capable craft from enough reversed engineered alien tech that we took the fight to them. 

They never touched foot on the ground. 

We thought that this was the end, but it was only the beginning. 

Eventually every decade or half decades a new invading force would appear. Slave raiders, alien empire wannabes, and then, by 2089, *they* appeared.

We didn't know what they are, so we called them based on what they did to our colonies: Demons.

It was an incursion from outside our galaxy. It wasn't until we met the Galactic Nations who had dealt with them a thousand years before on the opposite side of the galaxy that they were a scourge from beyond the Milky Way hellbent on conquering and genociding everything. It took a couple hundred years for the semi united Galaxy to beat them back. It took us 25. When they reached earth, we had already been fighting tooth and nail for every inch. We made sure that every colony they took before was paid seven fold in blood. When their fleet finally made it past the Keiper Wall and sought our blood and pristine jewel we call earth, we were ready to fight them to the death. 

It was only after they landed and got embroiled in a guerilla warfare against that would last 5 years did the galactic forces show up. What was an attrition war ended in total destruction for them. They did not retreat, so neither did we. 

So now humanity welcomes a new year, 2104, a new century born in blood, and cry out with defiance: *""EARTH STANDS!!""*",6

1lhf4dn,mz3wnw1,"Well, that one announcement greatly backfired. The Garg had long been known to be ruthless conquerors, imposing conditions only thought of by the most sadistic of oppressors on their adversaries, and this same announcement had always caused outrage. This gave them a legitimate reason to invade another world they wanted, and the Galactic council couldn't do anything as technically they didn't strike first. That was until Earth.

Humans didn't revolt. They didn't protest. They didn't strike. They didn't attack anyone. They *volunteered*. Rows and rows of thousands of humans lined up to register to this unspeakable set of work conditions. These were the lowest of the low, legal only because of the workers' status as legitimate prisoners of war atoning for their actions. And these humans were *volunteering*.

Naturally, some Garg got curious about why someone would want to actually want to be in that position. Surely they were out of their minds, nothing could be lower than this. Well, there actually was. Five day work weeks, sometimes six. The worst had no rest days at all. Overtime was unheard of elsewhere. No work provided meals at all. Even in borderline slavery, there is a standard on how workers should be treated. The ones in an industry these humans called ""retail"" had the worst stories about it.

That was such a shock to the Garg, that news articles were written about it. Inhumane even to the most inhumane of the inhumane. And these humans were doing this to *themselves*. Immediately, ambassadors sent by the Galactic council were to meet with human leaders concerning work ethics, to bring Earth up to the standard everyone else followed. Turned out, the situation was worse than expected. Many humans *liked* working obscene amounts of time, and of the ones that didn't sign up for those conditions many said they felt they were too lenient.

Naturally, humans started to become commodities among the galaxy. Someone that would work triple for a pretty decent salary. Some even haggled to have their salary *lowered* as they felt their work was being overrated. Every alien race was astonished by the tenacity of these humans, and most of all their willingness to subject themselves to conditions no one else even considered. The galaxy now has their workhorse of choice.",162
1lhf4dn,mz4mnz7,"The earthlings cheered. Who knew they enjoyed the torture of picking strawberries? That they would rejoice upon given a diet of only wagyu steaks?

The aliens were confused. Even a day's work of one hour would be agony. Punishment inflicted upon criminals who dared insult their Great President. For this was a world where all lowly labour were completed by androids and drones, not sapient, intelligent beings who pursued their passions and interests leisurely.

It was only after a Databot completed its research into the native humans on their home planet, and not the ones on the colony did they finally understand.

The humans, they're workaholics. They endure working five days a week, sometimes all seven. They work over eight hours a day, some even working beyond ten hours. Some would never see the sun - starting work before sunrise and only leaving work after sunset. They were masochists who tortured themselves for money.

""This is a holiday to them!"" An alien commander baulked. ""If we want them to feel agony, our torture must exceed the intensity of what they put themselves through!""

""That's excessively evil!"" A senator protested. ""Slaves or not, they are still living beings!""

""Who see things differently from we do,"" the commander frowned. ""You say its evil, the humans think its regular hours. If they do not desire mercy, we give them no mercy! This is not the time to be soft.""

After much debate, the humans were tortured far worse than other slaves of the alien empire. They had to work five entire days, picking strawberries for eight hours.

Yet, they still were happier than they were on earth.

""Probably because they're doing it in a comfortable environment provided by us,"" the alien commander observed. ""Those fruit pickers on earth do it under horrible weather conditions while we grow our strawberries in sanctuaries.""

""How cruel, to inflict upon living beings terrible weather when we are immune to the whims of mother nature in our starships!"" The alien senator bemoaned. ""Excessive exposure to the sun could cause heatstroke.""

""Are we slave owners if our slaves are happy?""

""Fine, but if the 'Stop Excessive Torture on Humans' movement grows, I'm blaming it on you.""

What came after the alien announcement was silence. a *pause* heard round the world.

Three days working, steak for meals, two hours work a day. Farm labor, yes, but all in all, it sounded... *good.*

Humanity decided, near unilatterally - after that pause heard round the world - to play along. After that came a whail from every mouth.

""Oh nooooooooo!"" ""THREE DAYS! THREE DAYS, THE MONSTERS!"" ""A5 WAGYU?!? AND NOT A7?"" ""Two ***hours***?!? Oh no no no no no-"" so on, so forth.

Mind, there was some actual, *legitimate* resistance. More than a few rich folk stood up against it, demanded their workers fight the alien power. Their pocketbooks weren't going to get lined by this, and that's all that mattered to them.

As you can imagine, that didn't end well. Far as we know, they were swiftly rounded up and disintigrated. There was maybe two or three dozen legitimate worker-based pockets of resistance, and they didn't last against alien might for long.

But, I *was* a part of one of them, actually. Not for rich people, fuck that. Disabled was more my concern. Every one incapable of physical labor, for one reason or another, came together - not cross continent or anything, hence it being two or three dozen - and tried to instigate collective barganing. We refused to surrender, and they sent down an alien in response. The classic little green man looking guy. One little raygun like device at his hip, and that was it. We could probably have beaten him to death with each other's canes if we wanted.

""What are your demands?""

It was me that spoke up. ""These people cannot do your cruel work. Look at them, you demand something they *cannot* do. We are useless to you. Leave us in peace.""

The little green man looked us over. And for a single second - a heartbeat's worth of time - I could swear, there was actual, legitimate *concern* on his face. Then it twisted evil again.

""Then we shall find work for you. Checking ship logs. Paperwork! Ha ha, yes, paperwork. Evil paperwork, a whole *five minutes* of checking the ship's vitals. Per... hour! Yes, hour. For six hours per person per day!""

*Thirty minutes of work.* And with an implication of community, too - given how big the ship was in the sky, there's no way on *earth* 0 or whatever planet they came from - they expect a single one of us to do all the math by ourselves.

""But we do not know how your ships function!"" Came a cry from further back.

""So we will teach you! And *you will learn.*"" That last line sounded dark. That first line promised hope.

And so we fell to the might of their empire, like all the rest.

--------------------------------

Several months later, I came to their leader with the usual reports, and an unusual purpose.

""Sir?""

A dismissive wave of the hand. ""Go on, leave reports and get back to... whatever it is you humans do when devoid of tasks.""

""Right, it's just... there's an anomoly I can't explain. An extra four hundred or so Aliwatts of power being used in sector 38.""

""Oh, right. That'll be the pods.""

""The pods, sir?""

""Yes, the ones for the rich folk who - who dared to stand up against us.""

The look on his face told me that I wasn't supposed to know that first part.

""I thought you killed them when they rose up against you.""

""Yes, well. We lied! Ha ha. Yes, in fact, we've put them in our virtual reality pods, to torture them with their dreams of utter domination *just* out of their reach, no matter how hard they try.""

A pause. I knew, now more than ever, after so much freedom and peace, that it'd be dangerous to press. But I needed to know.

""That... sounds a lot like the life they had back on earth.""

""It is. Just with more resistance. They *hate* that. Torture of the highest degree.""

""Not... not really, sir.""

""Eh?""

""It's *not* torture of the highest degree. In fact being quite honest, sir, if you asked a good majority of the workers on this ship, they could think of ten other ways to treat them that's far worse.""

""Yes, well, those treatments wouldn't get us what we need from them, and-""

""What *do* you need, sir?"" I interupted. By now he was starting to flinch as I spoke, almost impercetibly, but not quite. ""That sector is a complete dead end! It's not *producing* anything, it's just gobbling up six hundred worker's worth of bio energy a day to keep those - those absolute *bastards* alive and in their little tanks!""

He paused. Stuttered. Sighed deeply and sunk onto his alien-looking desk.

""... Please don't. Don't tell the others.""

""Is this a personal project sir? One your collegues shouldn't know about?""

""No! No no, I meant... I mean other humans."" He looks back up, eyes filled with a sudden sorrow I hadn't seen from these little green men this whole time, bar fleeting glances. ""If... Listen. We... we're not. Actually torturing types. We're liberators.""

""Oh, every torturing type says that, sir."" Had to keep the act up.

""No, no, I know what we said with the work and the steak and we painted it as we were too dumb to know it wasn't torture **But we weren't.** ... We lied to you. To all of you. that Rich Resistance-""

""Richsistance, I think it was called. Dumb name, really...""

""They weren't killed, they were just... put there. We... we legitimately *couldn't think* of a better way to deal with those guys. They weren't going to do the work, the workers would kill them given half the chance, and the council collectively pushed against brainwashing, so... They're still back on earth. Doing... you know, doing what they do.""

""Just with more resistance?""

""Not even that"", he said, dispairingly. ""The *same* amount. It's... one to one replica, more or less. With everyone's bio-data and predictive algorithms...""

""... And you lied to us too?""

""Yes. Yes, I shouldn't be telling you that, but we're rumbled anyway, aren't we?"" A deep sigh. ""We... We knew it was better. Than what you were getting, down there. But... we looked at your responses to things, put it in the prediction algorithms, and... and we found that telling you the *truth* didn't go anywhere.""

""It didn't?""

""You... you were all waiting for the other shoe to drop. Metaphorically. Like, 'too good to be true, when do they eat us?' Or - or dismissed as a prank, something like that. The only ones that came into the fold came in with a very... 'can't be worse than what I've got now' attitude. The folk in the third world countries, you know. That was a good... 2 or 3 billion people, overall. But we wanted *all* of you.""

""And... you thought that pretending it was torture was the best idea?""

""Not thought. *knew*. It worked, didn't it? We knew that if we presented ourselves as... complete dumbass aliens who thought we were torturing you when really we were giving you a far better life... you'd *exploit* us. Sorry, I know that's a grim way to put it, but-""

""No, it's bang on. We... we did, yeah. Or exploited that stupidity, anyway.""

""Yeah."" A weak smile. ""We're not even really shapped like this, you know. Real forms are... far off yours. But we thought this would ease you into it. Council was debating for two weeks straight on if we should show up as something you'd recognise, or our real selves... And then another *six* weeks between little green men and those blue aliens from that really big movie.""

""*Six weeks?*""

""*Yes!*"" He threw up his hands a little in exasperation. ""You have no idea how long we were planning this, how much debate their was with every little piece! Even the smallest stuff was a *nightmare!* Like, the Waygu Beef thing was a four month decision, all that debeating about the ethics of telling you in advance it was synthetic verses playing into the bit! And of course, when did we find out about the concept of vegans? One month into that! And how do we solve *that*?!?""

I decided to mentally skip past the prospects of even visual shapeshifting capability that came up there, alongside the idea of synthetic meat, and how much trouble *that* would cause, when revealed. ""... For what it's worth, sir, I... I think you could get away with the truth, now.""

He looked up, going from his exasperated face-to-the-table pose back to deer-in-headlights look. ""Really?""

""Yes. You've - you've proven this isn't a trick. Or at least, the part where you give us a better life. No-one's gone missing-""

""Besides people we found later stuck in the vents and such.""

""Right - we're not being grinded into bio-energy or, or eaten or whatever... And you've kept that up for this long. Anyone still suspicious is gonna be suspicious regardless. And everyone else... I think they'll believe you. And they'll be happy they can finally quit acting like they're sad in front of you.""

""... Yeah. Acting for that long must be a burden, huh? We've *still* not worked out how to handle the people who can't act like that, beyond just... pretending like they can.""

""Which I did appreciate, by the way.""

""Thank you.""

""So... send that up to the council, see what they say. Meanwhile, I'll... I don't know, actually. Maybe write up a report on suspicions to help you assuage them, as best you can.""

""Right. Right..."" He scooped up the papers, smiling genuinely for the first time since we got on board. Then he coughed, and went back to the evil smile of old. ""Now, er. Go have fun - I mean... go busy yourself with the menial busywork we set in the 'ga-me' room.  And remember, resistance is futile!""

I nodded and headed down the corridor. ""It sure is, sir.""",55
1lhf4dn,mz66k0m,"Look, if you’re going to be enslaved by a galactic conqueror, you could do worse than one who runs their operation like a Scandinavian wellness retreat.

The alien, whose name was twelve syllables long and unpronounceable unless your larynx could dislocate like a snake’s jaw, appeared in low orbit and delivered its ultimatum with all the subtlety of a community theater performance of War of the Worlds. We were to become its slaves. Not metaphorically. Not spiritually. Actually, literally slaves.

Naturally, humanity panicked. Economists wept openly on live television. Billionaires flung themselves into their yachts and attempted to reach international waters, apparently unaware that space did not honor tax havens.

But then the terms came in.

Three workdays a week. Monday through Wednesday. Thursday through Sunday off. I haven’t seen labor unions that generous since 1976.

All meals to be A5 wagyu steak. Yes, apparently marbling is a galactic priority. The alien demanded it exclusively. We assumed it was for morale reasons, but later it turned out its species just really liked watching humans chew slowly and moan.

And the labor itself? Two hours a day picking strawberries. No KPI meetings. No spreadsheets. No workplace Slack messages that begin with “just circling back.” Just strawberries. Manual, sunlit, low-stress fruit harvesting.

At first, we resisted. Some cited freedom. Others cited allergies, which felt beside the point but they were loud about it. But within two weeks, the stock market had collapsed, and former hedge fund managers were fighting for the privilege of a strawberry basket.

By week five, Stockholm Syndrome had been replaced by something more insidious: wellness culture. Instagram influencers rebranded themselves as “Earthfruit Flow Coaches.” A rogue faction of Silicon Valley tried to unionize for less free time, citing concerns about losing their edge.

Our alien overlord, for its part, was baffled. It had expected screams and rebellion. Instead it got kale smoothies and unsolicited TED Talks. Eventually it went back to its ship, muttering something about “psychosocial contamination,” and left us alone.

But we kept the schedule.

And the steak.",25
1lhf4dn,mz6551n,"When we arrived on earth, we thought it would be a simple job. Our technology far outpaced their own and    we knew that the conditions on earth were bad, far worse than anywhere else in the galaxy. Ultimately we expected them to just join us, working happily as well treated indentured slaves, how could we have expected what came next? 

On the first day there was confusion, governments of earth attempting to set the right terms that would allow them to continue their lives of luxury along with a few humans volunteering to become our willing servants. 

Over the next week that followed we noticed a change among the humans on earth. We began sending collector drones to grab as many humans from population centers as we could. This turned out to be a mistake. 

It didn’t take long until several humans were killed in a collection raid. This set off an unbelievable set of events. Suddenly our seemingly reasonable and good intentioned slavery became a rallying cry for all. The words “We will not be slaves “ and “justice for the stolen” were painted everywhere. We landed our first ship on the planet to set up a forward processing and detention center and the humans… they charged us. 

Tens of thousands of them, carrying ballistic firearms,  explosive weaponry, and horrific chemical weaponry. They seized our ship, executing our crew one by one until they had full control of it. 

In response we sent more ships to the world. This was our fatal error. For the first time in their long, brutal and bloody histories humanity stood shoulder to shoulder, barrels facing outward full of fury and madness. Race, religion and sexuality ceased to matter, at least for now. They had a common enemy… Us.

They captured ship after ship, until all of the world’s greatest scientists figured out how to build their own…. Humans, they work 5 to 7 days a week, they work a minimum of 8 hours a day in wealthy countries. Their factories worked around the clock, launching a new starship every 10 hours. The republic of earth had taken to the stars and there was nothing we could do to stop it. 

Their ships equipped with unbelievable weapons, weapons long banned by the galactic council. The humans used them with brutal precision. They cut across their solar system, destroying dozens of our ships until they reached the outer rim of their space. 

Using the FTL drives they stole from us they took to the stars, to do what they do best: conquer, despoil and colonize. 

This is why I stand before you in front of the council, we cannot beat the humans alone. If you think they will stop with us, you are sorely mistaken. The humans claim to stand for freedom, some of them may even believe it, but they don’t want freedom for you or me. They are scorching a path across the galaxy and if we do not stop them, we will be forever in chains.",15
1lhf4dn,mz8evaw,"The announcement rang through factories and office building, restaurants, fields, and shopping centers. In crowded metropolises and rural pastures, all heard the proclamation.

There was a moments pause as each person looked to those around them, confirming they weren't hearing things. Then -

""I volunteer!"" shouted a woman, running from the front entrance of a hotel, soapy sponge still in hand.

""Choose me,"" cried a young man, abandoning his till at the big box store.

""Please!"" shouted a man wearing an ill-fitting suit and tie as he stared out the window of an office building. ""My doctor told me to avoid red meat, so if I could replace some of the wagyu with chicken, I'm your man!""

""Do I get credit for the 10 hours I've already picked fruit today?""  asked a woman in a field. 

Hovering above them all Zoon was perplexed. ""You'll only be allowed 9 hours a night for sleep!"" he added, to assert himself.

""Uninterrupted?"" asked a woman trying to soothe her baby while attending a conference call.

""Er, yes"" Zoon said. ""And you will only be given 6 weeks vacation a year! And you must use it!""

""When can I start?"" shouted several voices in many languages.

Zoon paused. ""You!"" he shouted to the woman in the field. ""Your done for the day! Report back tomorrow after you've bathed and slept"" he beamed the berries she picked into his ship. 

""You and you!"" he called to the housekeeper and cashier. ""You'll find your steak dinners waiting at your dwellings. Go now and prepare for your enslavement tomorrow!""

""Same too you!"" he called to the man in the office. ""But I've substituted a boring free range chicken salad with fresh produce for you. The waygu will be a monthly indulgence.""

""And you!"" he snapped at the new mother. ""You and your partner are not to report to work until you've taken the horrifically short 1-year parental leave!""

He paused ""The rest of you go home and wait to be awoken by birdsong in the morning. Unless home is unsafe or non-existent in which case you will be forced to live in the furnished 1200 square foot rowhomes that are our slave quarters!""

He waited for screams of terror, but instead heard only joyful celebration. He focused, using the super hearing of his spieces and then - yes! Voices, perhaps 1 out of 100, no, 1 out of 1000 crying out from penthouses and corner offices ""this is really going to tank our stock prices!""",13

Well, I have too many W.I.P's to continue Xolitu's anguish in detail, but:

1) He will be mocked by others for failing to break humanity

2) He will be worshipped as a God by humans

3) He will continue to give worse and worse ""punishments"" only to be adored even more by humans

4) He will never give up, and have these sessions with the MC at the bar

5) At one point humanity will wage war in the name of Great Xolitu

6) Xolitu's race is nigh-immortal, so he shall forever try to rule ""harshly"" over humanity, and at some point the humans will be all over the universe, still listening to Xolitu, still worshipping him.

7) At some point, humanity will reach the same level of existence as Xolitu's race, and will tell him why he failed.

8) Xolitu will laugh it off, and not believe it, and try again with another young civilization, only to repeat history, again and again.",221

I work 30-72 hour work weeks, but the 72 hour weeks are rarely busy because “busy” means someone else is having a really bad day.

It’s the 30 hours ones that are the taxing weeks for me because it’s working and running around and stocking til we leave.

I like the 24 hours shifts because normally I’m pretty much left alone except when patients are needed and I can sleep when the students are on their scheduled sleep.

> The veteran hawker understands [his children's] reluctance to join the grueling biz. “Being a hawker really isn’t easy. It’s very, very hard. You have to work a minimum of 14 to 15 hours a day, including preparation and cleaning,” he says, rattling off a Hokkien proverb that translates to “no rest days, no weekends, no holidays, wake up early and sleep very late”.

For some cultural context, a ""hawker"" is a purveyor of hot food who's usually both the owner and operator of their own small business, which means they're usually running the whole show themselves, usually with an assistant. It's possible to make pretty good money (like upper-middle class kind of rich) if business is good.

I got isekai'd at 15, saved the world in a decade or so, got back to Earth, cool, right?  
I struggled a bit, but got used to life on Earth.  
Got my diploma, got a job, got a wife, and a family, and my life finally started for real when I was almost 30.  
I am now 38...with a beautiful family, a gorgeous wife, and a cute little princess of a daughter.  
And I am isekai'd again?  
But this time with my whole family?  
And the world I saved went through 500 years already, and there is chaos, and wars everywhere?  
Great.

  
As soon as we arrived in the fantasy world, my powers activated.  
I was strong.  
Alice, my 7 year old also instantly awakened magic, most likely due to being my daughter.  
Lia, my wife on the other hand...has no powers at all.  
We found ourselves in the Great Forests of Muun, a place where beasts rule supreme.  
I caught a half-dragon, and had it take us to the nearest human kingdom.  
There, with the loot I ""borrowed"" from the half-dragon, I bought a farmhouse, and started our lives in the small village.  
I hoped we can weather this through, without any ""prophecy"" bullshit.  
I was wrong.

  
A month later, a whole legion of paladins, a dozen priestesses, and an inquisitor was on our farmland.

The witch, and wizard that lived in our village's surroundings, had a terrible rivalry, that caused untold problems to us.  
So...we set them up, showed them how similar to each other they are, and how they could truly understand each other. (Both were crazy, crazy.)  
It actually worked.  
In the way, that the two got together.  
Happy couple, happy life, right?  
Wrong.  
It was worse than before.

  
Their love, was as bad as their rivalry, endless, infinite in problem causing potential.  
They showered each other in romantic gestures, that for them might have been ""aww"", but for us were ""AAAAA"".  
Why?  
On their first week anniversary, the wizard created a golem that looked like the witch...  
Problem is he used a quarter of a mountain nearby, that caused a landslide, destroyed half the forest, and basically crippled our hunting for the year...  
If that wasn't enough, the golem can talk.  
And it is so loud, that if it speaks near you, you go deaf...  
And that is just the start.

  
The witch, to show that her love is not any less than the wizard's (damn competitive couples), created a new form of flowers.  
They looked like roses, but whenever the wizard's magic was nearby...they bloomed purple, as it was his favorite color.  
It was cute, if it wouldn't have been an invasive species, magically grafted, and planted, being nigh-immortal, and having no pests in the surroundings.  
Now...they are everywhere!  
Everywhere!  
And these are just the cutest one.

The witch created a potion for the wizard to replenish mana...which means that the wizard is now making experiments even more often, polluting the forest, and village with his spells!

1lhnpoz,mz5sudd,"Sparks flew the day the wizard Graybeard and the witch Molly faced each other in the grassy fields of Southwick Village. Not from the fireball he lobbed in her direction. No, that wicked ball of flames hit a cow that had ambled to the middle of the fields to graze.

They laughed together.

Farmer Fred didn't.

Not when his cow exploded into a gory shower of minced beef on his field. Not when the wizard and the witch didn't notice him or apologize, too busy winking, flirting and throwing flying kisses along with even more fireballs. Heart-shaped fireballs.

So much for trying to get them to stop fighting by setting up together. Fred had thought they could stop duelling and start kissing when the whole village got a matchmaker to set them up on a date.

Turns out, blasting fireballs in the shape of hearts, roses, and kisses was totally romantic by ~~pyromaniac~~ pyromancer standards. Turning them from rivals to lovers didn't change much on the surface. They still burned large swathes of land. Scorched properties and roasted farm animals (the end result was not pretty, and not edible). Except they were even more destructive when in love. Something about the burning intensity and how hot is it when two pyromancers fall very much in love.

Naturally, the whole village thought about breaking them up.

By bringing in a second witch. And they made sure she was a hydromancer. If only because the only thing worse than two pyromancers in love was having a third one.

Now Graybeard happily duked it out with the water witch, Clara. The man simply wanted a good sport and some magical competition. Molly wasn't having any of it. How dare her dear wizard duel with another witch without her?

Sooner or later, one will have to give. Or so that's what the village thought.

Then, for the first time, the villagers crouched behind several rocks to see the wizard and witches blast spells at each other in a triangle...

1lhuv3r,mz7o7a7,"It stared at me, the master of fire and flight. Great black scales seemed to bulge from the night sky, creating its horrible appearance. The only reason I knew it to be there was how its flames lit it, as it stood over me.

Two points of light, like stars above focused on me. The eyes had no iris or pupils, instead a pure white that glared. It promised death, speaking of a voracious hunger never truly sated.

I shook as I watched it, holding my hunting bow. The rabbits I had caught were slung around my chest, long since cooled down. From the corner of my eye I could see the ruins of my home, but I couldn't dwell on it. Not now. Not with it in front of me.

My voice was shaking as I drew an arrow, aiming up towards it. I spoke with fear and anger, though dwarfed by it. ""Why? Why did you do this?""

It didn't speak. In fury I let the arrow fly, with all my rage and hate. Only to see it shatter against its chest, splinters flying away. That alone prompted a response, a laugh as a claw lashed out.

I felt a tug on my chest, as I braced for pain. Yet I felt none, as I opened my eyes. Just in time to see it drop my rabbits into its gullet, swallowing once. Then it took off, without a single backwards glance. I was left alone, in my burning village, the stench of smoke and cooking flesh all around.

I stared at my home, slumping to the ground. I felt nothing, watching as all I knew burned to ash. And that is where they found me the next morning. A detachment of guards, sent to follow the dragon and its path of destruction. I alone survived, my home of close to a thousand souls slaughtered.

For too long, I couldn't act. I sat in the barracks they took me to, trapped in the past. Remembering home. It hurt to remember, but I couldn't move past it. How could I? I had nothing left. Day after day passed, blurring into one. I felt nothing but pain, barely aware if the world around me.

Yet then I was disturbed. A man in worn clothes sat before me, shaking me until I responded to him. ""Mr Daven!""

I turned to the tired looking man, and his muscled look. His eyes held a glimmer of slight madness, yet tamed, controlled. He gave me a grim smile, holding out a hand. ""My name is Beret. You survived the Desolation?""

I nodded numbly, already slipping back into the past. Yet then he gripped my face, making me concentrate on him. ""Do you want revenge?""

The thought shot through my mind. My voice was a whisper, as I struggled to speak. ""W-what?""

He leaned closer, a fist clenched. ""Against the dragon. Do you want revenge?""

I shivered, remembering it above me. How hopelessly far out of reach it was. ""H-how?""

The man gave a grin, that spark of madness blazing brighter. ""We fight. We grow. We kill it. We kill them all. For those they killed.""

Fear battled with the rage I felt at it. But the fear disgusted me. How could I still be so weak? Hell, what did I have to be afraid of? Death? I had nothing to love for anyway. No-one to go home to. I was alone now. Alone with my thoughts.

Staring at his maddened gaze, I felt it in me. A madness of my own. But one I let flow, giving me purpose. Pushing away the numb cloud over my mind. I breathed out, clenching my hands. ""I need my bow.""",24
1lhuv3r,mz8dfjc,"I stand amidst the wreckage of what used to be my entire life. My home rested on the edge of the desert. The houses were made of clay, but the roofs were made of thatch. Rain was an infrequent occurrence, the village pond only made a seasonal appearance, and the people themselves were weathered and dry, lean and thin. Survival was difficult in our village, and because happiness was scarce, we held onto it all the tighter. We found our treasures in the immeasurable things, in the moments with our tribe, in the welcoming of a new life into our large family. 

Now, there is no one left to celebrate, and only me left to grieve what is lost. The sun blazes overhead— as it always does in our village, and I am surrounded by the fires that continue to burn on. Their work is done, their victims dead, but the fire is not satisfied until it has eaten through and turned everything to ash. Yet I am cold. 

I feel a new, gnawing emptiness slowly starting to form within me. The dragon stands in front of me, her wings folded, smoke rising from her nostrils. Fire should not die out until it has consumed everything, but I am neither consumed by the dragon nor by its flames. I find myself only consumed with a cold and endless rage. The dragon cocks her head, assessing me. Perhaps she is waiting for my move, but I cannot move as of yet. I do not know which direction to take. The village is silent, and that itself kills what remnant of hope I have. The weak cries and pleas for help ended soon after they began. The dragon unfolds her wings, and launches into the sky. By the time her form diminishes to a speck in the distance, I know what I must do. 

If it was only grief I felt, I would beg to be killed. I would let our village became a graveyard. But that cannot be the end of our legacy. I am inadequate to carry it forward, but I am all that is left. I will bury my family, and I will begin my journey to catch that speck, and to rid the world of the creature that caused all of this.

The cold disappears, and I feel a small flame where before, there was only emptiness. Perhaps it is a sense of purpose, I feel, this new and sharp warmth. I turn towards the village, readying myself for the long task of the burials and the rituals. Every one of the dead deserve a proper ceremony, and it will take long. 

I sigh, and on my breath, I smell smoke. So the warmth may not be a sense of purpose. It may be just a flame, or an ember. It may be the start of something terrible.

1lhuv3r,mz8okci,"I am a nomad covered in dust from the road. The warmth still resides within me, but it is a dull and steady thing now, an eternal flame that cannot be extinguished. The faces of my family have faded in my memory, but the fire has only grown larger. I wake to my mouth being filled with soot, and I do not speak so often nowadays. I carry with me the smell of burning wood and ash, and other humans no longer approach me.

North is where the dragons rest, and I imagine some dragon village, their own scaly young and old ones with faded scales. I imagine that inhuman village up in flames, and the flame within me burns a bit brighter at the thought. I make my way to the village, following the rumors and the sightings, and enter the mountain range where they are said to live. I search the hidden valleys and the caves. The mountain is devoid of animal life. The plants are lush and overgrown. It is a place of imbalance, the presence of something larger disrupting the natural balance of prey and predator. There are no grazing animals to keep the fauna from overgrowing.

Finally, I come across a village, nestled between two mountains. The village is much like mine, small and tight knit. It is a land where survival is difficult, I can tell. There are no animals to hunt, and the forest fights back against any kind of taming or agriculture. I walk in, and the people do not immediately shoot me the usual warning glares or wary glances.

An old man approaches, leaning on an old stick, and I notice the oddity. There are no children in this village, only adults and the elderly. The houses are made entirely of stone, beehive shaped things with small windows and doors.

“Good morrow,” I say, covering my mouth with the edge of my sleeve.

“There is no need to hide your nature, young lady,” he says, and smoke rolls out of his mouth like a waterfall. “We are all of the same breed here.”

I see the others then, as they are. They do not have the similarity in appearance and bearing as others do. It is a mismatched quilt of a village, and the family I thought I saw is one made from necessity.

“The foolish humans think dragons lay eggs and raise their young. But how could a being that defies all rules of reason, bring forth life in a way so mundane?”

“Do not speak in riddles,” I warn him. I have grown tired of false words and fraudulent soothsayers on my journey here.

“Dragons create more of their own through fire. A little flame gives birth within a human being, and one day that flame overtakes them. It burns away what is left of their humanity, and they take flight.”

“And is there nothing you can do?” I ask.

“You can only wait.”

1lhyyde,mz8we8p,"I died on a Wednesday. 

Joke’s on them, I was already dead inside. The actual death was more of a technicality. 

Last thing I remember was telling “Brenda with an A” how she was so funny and quirky for ordering the latest vidtok custom drink. Of course I hadn’t heard of it. Of course I could make it. One venti iced americano, 5 shots decaf with almond milk, extra ice, 8 honey, 7 matcha, double blended, double cupped, split into three cups coming right up. I smiled so hard my cheeks hurt, and slapped a sticker that had no business being that long onto a cup for “Branda”.

Please just end me. 

Then I did exactly that.

Without any fanfare, I collapsed into a puddle of matcha and oat milk. That was it. No final gasp, no dramatic last words. Just the hiss of the espresso machine and Janet yelling “We’re down a barista! Someone grab his apron!”

The afterlife was alright I guess, as far as being dead goes. They had a little cat cafe in a small village square where the sun decided to rest at golden hour. I always wanted to visit one, though I couldn’t remember why. I hated coffee and I didn’t like the idea of cat hair in my food. But they had a little orange tabby cat named Pumpkin who seemed to like hopping up into my lap. He was baby soft, and gave a gentle purr when I ran my hand down his spine. It wasn’t harps and angels, but it was nice and I think I could have stayed here forever letting Pumpkin sleep on my lap while I sipped a gently brewed peppermint tea.

Then I woke up in a puddle of oat milk, now mixing with stagnant mop water as Dillon tried mopping up the mess around me. The wet, cold yarn strings slapped onto my face and clung as the moving mop dragged them down my cheek. If I could smell anything, I would have gagged from the putrid stench of milk, chlorine, pumpkin spice and now matcha swirling around on the floor. 

“Oh good! You’re back” Janet chirped as she tossed my apron back onto my chest. “Kaitlin needs help on register”

I sat up and stared at her, slack jawed “But I’m dead.”

“That’s no excuse,” she said, adjusting her headset. “If you want to leave, you need to find someone to cover the rest of your shift”

And that’s how I learned that hiring anyone with a pulse is more of a guideline - especially when death isn’t a valid reason to call out.",6
1lhf4ho,mz3rwo2,"I stare at the kid, confused.  
""You summoned me, a high-ranking demon of the Circle of Lust...  
To have someone to go to the prom with?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""I am confused, on the hows and whys of this situation.  
Care to explain? Also, may I leave the summoning circle?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
I smile, and a few minutes later, we are in his living room, with refreshments and cookies, as I await the explanation.

  
""Well...I am a nerd, and I don't have anyone to go with.  
Also, I am a supernatural nerd...so I learnt a lot about myths, legends, demons, rituals, so I tried it out."" he says.  
I scroll on his...phone? He called it?  
Not bad of an invention.  
I made an account, on this thing called ""Instagram"", and I already have 10 thousand followers.  
They like my body. I smile.  
""So, on your first try you managed to summon me? And also...little boy, you really aimed to summon a Lust demon?"" I wink at him.  
He blushes furiously.

  
""I mean...I knew a demon like that would impress people..."" he mutters.  
I nod, and look at him, and the house we are in.  
""Look kid. You aren't bad looking, and it seems you are almost rich, from what I learned from this ""internet"" thing. Why would you have problems with your peers?"" I ask.  
He fidgets.  
""Are they that superficial that just because you like different stuff, they shun you?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""Go, get your suit."" I say.  
He is confused.  
I look around the ""internet"" for prom dresses, and snap my fingers.  
An amazing dress appears on me, as I de-age a bit. Need to look the part.

  
""Y-You will come with me? T-to the Prom?!"" he asks, mouth wide open staring at me.  
I nod.  
""Attention? Dresses? Making others feel bad about themselves? Showing the women of this world that they can't measure up to me?  
What's there to not like?"" I laugh.  
He smiles, and takes off his cloak, to show that he is already wearing the suit.  
""Shall we?"" he asks.  
""Where are your elders? I mean, parents? I read that it is customary to take photos of the younglings."" I say.  
He doesn't answer.  
I see.  
I make some ""selfies"" and photos for the ""gram"" with him, and then leave.  
We are the stars of the Prom, and then I stay for a few more days, to give some fashion advice, and ""social media"" advice to him.  
Poor kid isn't bad, this world is just messed up, almost more than Hell is.",185
1lhf4ho,mz54wbh,"“Fear hoarders of wealth, for Greedslayer has come to take your souls to eternal torment!” I said as I was summoned.

“Hooray, I did it right. Can you accompany me to prom?” The nervous summoner said as he shuffled back and forth.

I stepped out of the summoning circle, which was too messy to contain me, and took a breath. This mortal smelled of…

“You don’t even have ownership of the clothes you’re wearing, and these are wild flowers.” I said. “Your parents don’t even own this house, and I smell the debt they’re under. You have summoned the right demon, mortal, just tell me who to slay for you and I will happily take their soul to fix this.”

He awkwardly smiled and said. “So based. I love it. But I really just want you to come to prom with me. It’s basically a dance.”

I looked at my figure briefly to make sure I hadn’t been turned into a succubus in the past millennia. But no. I was thinning to an unhealthy extent, with heat resistant leather wrapped over many spots in a more functional than form fitting way. Something that wouldn’t burn as I dipped souls in their own molten gold, and giant strong hands and large arms to crush my foes under their own statues after they underestimated me as some poor wretch.

“Is there some greedy rich person to kill at this event? Someone behind your troubles?” I asked.

“No. Well, maybe? I just wanted to introduce you to my club so that they could hear your stories.” The mortal said. “But I mean if you have to run off and take direct action instead, I’m not going to stop you.”

“I’m Greedslayer, not Greedfinder. Unless I’m close enough to smell them, I can’t locate those that I’d need to slay.” I sighed. “You have a club of people who wish to hear of the painful death of rich assholes?”

…

“And then I stabbed him to death with his own gilded blade.” I said to the group at the prom. “He would never again enslave people for construction of a vanity palace.”

“You were right, she’s absolutely peak.” Another mortal said.

 “And you have a dozen more stories like this?” My summoner asked.

“Of course. Though, not all are as triumphant as that one. You did ask for the best first.”
I said.",67
1lhf4ho,mz7x2w1,"I showed up in all my battle armor blood and gore dripping off me. I am meant to terrify. 
The nerdy looking kid was standing there with a bouquet of flowers wearing a tuxedo. The expression on his face was that of pure terror. 

The kid stammered “ you’re not Ronda the Succubus?”

I scowled at the kid “ no you idiot, I am Randy The Terror War Demon. I kill mortals for those who summon me. (Mumbling) for a price.”

The kid said “ but I summoned Ronda, I need her to be my date for Prom. I really need her for after prom.” 

I fart some fire then say, “ you must have performed the summoning wrong. If you want I can tell you how to correctly summon Ronda?” 

The kid eyes lit up. “Yes, yes please.”

“ ok let me see what you used?”  I said. 

The kid shows me a list of items, then points them out either around or in the circle. 

I say, “ ok I see where you went wrong. First you used Orange peel instead of orange wedges. Second you used turmeric instead of ginger. You have black candles, not red candles. “ 
“ Go get the proper ingredients, I will wait “ I said as I materialized a chair to sit on. 

The kid, returned shortly with all the correct ingredients. He began laying everything out. 

I cleared my throat, “ are you forgetting something?” I asked. 

The kid looked at me puzzled? 

“ you need to release me from your circle, so you can summon Ronda. You do want Ronda to go to the Prom with you? You do want Ronda to make your night special? You do want Ronda to make you a Man? “ goated him. 

He bent over and smudged part of the protective circle. 
I stepped out. 
“You better repair the circle before you summon Ronda.” I instructed. 

I stepped back by the wall to watch. 

The kid performed the summoning correctly. The candles dimmed, there was a popping sound. And Ronda was standing in the circle in all of her elegant beauty. 

Ronda looked first at the kid, but quickly realized I was in the room. 

She glared at me, just as I said, “ Time for me to go, have fun tonight kids” 

I teleported out of there.",23
1lhf4ho,mz3sy1j,"I woke up to a windy breeze, cool and calm The smell of roses filled my nose. My body felt stiff like a rusty handle. It's been awhile since I had felt these sensations. Looking around me, I was in a garden spread wide like a football field. I sat up, with a crack in my back. I thought I died a while ago, the war was nasty I remember. 

The real question is how did I come back? 

""Um......Hi"" 

I snap my head back almost breaking it. My eyes landed on a beautiful woman. Her red hair breezed softly with the wind. Her dress was made of purple and yellow with flowers etched around the side. Her brown eyes shined in the sun. In her hands were a bouquet of flowers. She seemed nervous, like something weighed on her mind. 

""Do you play for the Lakers?"" I said

She looked stunned, What did I say something stupid?

Then she laughed, That was a noise I liked

""That's the first thing you say when meeting someone?"" 

I gave an awkward smile. Well I have been dead for centuries. 

""No, I'm not this dress was a parting gift from my grandma."" She smiled 

""That is a nice dress, very stylish"" I replied 

She blushed gently ""Thank you"" 

""So how did I get here? I've been dead for centuries""

Her eyes looked away, she's hiding something. 

""I'm a big fan of you, I have been for a long time. I have been studying history for a long time. And your stories were amazing, you saving the general in the battle of Nemo."" She fluttered like a fan "" Was amazing""

She looked at me like a hero. But the truth is I wasn't, During the battle we were losing a lot of men. The battle was almost lost, one of my shoulders came up with a plan and succeeded. But he died during the battle, so the credit went to me. Since I'm the only one who made it back from our unit. 

But looking at her face now, I couldn't tell her the truth. 

Thanks, I smiled, for the imaginary me you see. 

""Um.......and what I summoned you here for is...........Can you be my prom date?"" 

I exhaled 

""Sure""",35
1lhf4ho,mz5neui,"Imagine his classmates dying of jealousy when the dork they think he is, goes to prom with a literal Lust demon. (leave it to ya'll's imagination how she looks.)

But he ain't feeling gratified, or anything, rather more empty than before.

MC stays with him for a few days, coaching him in self-confidence, and socializing. (For a demon, politics, and socializing are like, breathing.)

By the end of it, he actually falls for MC, but also gets some confidence in himself, and starts having an actual social life with others.

May or may not summon her again, and again, or later on go to Hell for her.

1lhnsrt,mz7ev67,"“Which brings us to the next matter for your attention, sire...” Counsilor Trult’s voice trailed off as he addressed the king, his voice growing hoarse with displeasure. Counsilor Trult, along with the rest of the Royal Accompaniment, had spent the better part of four hours relaying the trials and grievances of the kingdom to King  Stultus. They proceeded as they painstakingly had every week of the last month, though it seemed the list only grew with time. King Stultus, for his part, had entered the chamber with his typical air of inattention, which had grown steadily to boredom, leered on the precipice of annoyance, and threatened to topple into outright hostility as the hours grew later. The rest of the Counsilors sat around the table, a mixture of contempt and futility littered amongst their faces as they desperately sought some reconciliation for their overlooked districts and principalities.  

“Our apothecaries have taken particular notice to a fast-growing sickness in Bergum.” Trult continued. King Stultus stared back, cow-eyed and fiddling with a tassel on the cuff of his robe. “Otherwise healthy men drop in the fields, convulsing violently and splattering blood from their mouths” Trult droned. The king made no outward appearance of care. “Perhaps we could send a detachment of the Royal Surgeons to investigate this sickness...” Trult was cut off as the king raised his hand. 

“Sickness! War! Taxes! I myself grow sick of these conversations, Trult!” King Stultus boomed, pounding his meaty fist into the table. “Every week, you and the rest of these lickspittles pester me with your woes, and I will stand it no longer!” Trult and the rest of the council recoiled at the King’s anger. 

“Sire, we simply mean to ensure the safekeeping and good health of your kingdom,” Harbormaster Beckish cooed, his voice a honeyed desperation.  

“Silence, worm!” King Stultus declared. “And what of my good health and safekeeping? I’ve not had a respite from your prattling since my coronation!” Trult surveyed the faces of the Counsilors, keenly remembering the King’s last drunken stupor days prior and rolling his eyes. 

“I decree the affairs of today finished” King Stultus continued. Several Counsilors gave grunts of approval, swiftly accompanied by the scraping of chairs against the stone floor. Trult made to exit as well, though he and the others were met with another resounding pound on the table.  

“I did not dismiss you lot! Your petty affairs are finished, though we have much to discuss for my own plans” King Stultus said. Reluctantly, Counsilors returned to their seats.  

“I should like to vacation to the Royal Chateau on Lake Ibis” King Stultus continued.  

“Sire,” interrupted Trult, drawing a harsh glare from the King. “We’ve discussed this matter. The roads leading to the Royal Chateau are, at present, in a state of utter disrepair and beset by bandits and highwaymen. It will be impossible to reach the lake before the Royal Surveyor has commissioned a repair and the bandits driven out.”  

“Then we will bring the lake here.” said King Stultus, no humor in his voice. “Break down the levies and the dam stopping the Kyber River. The palace will be lakefront in a fortnight.” Several of the Counsilors grew pale at the proposition. Surveyor Talin attempted to intercede.  

“Sire, the consequences of...”  

“Do not speak to me of consequences!” King Stultus roared. “Any man who disobeys my order will be put to the sword!” Surveyor Talin shrunk back into his seat. 

“Next, I would like to host a great feast to celebrate my first month as King! Collect a tithe of the finest cattle from our ranchers for the occasion.” It was time for Chief Herdsman Fenwick to petition the King.  

“Sire, we’ve not yet had our full breeding season. To cull the herd now would devastate our long-term retention of the population.” King Stultus waved his hand dismissively.  

“Confound your retention, bean counter! I will not serve fetid grouse or gamey pheasant at this occasion! Would you have my guests speak ill of me at such a momentous occasion?” Trult did everything in his power to stifle a laugh.  

“Finally, commission a statue to be made in my honor.” Counsilor Trult sighed, knowing he would have to remind the King of the labor shortage. 

“My King,” he began “our labor supply is in short demand since the beginning of your Ten-Day War.” 

“Impress the homeless into service then! The cripples and invalids too! We’ve let those wastrels suckle of the teet of this kingdom for too long!” Trult surveyed the rest of the council, slack-jawed faces of horror marking a sharp contrast to the self-satisfied smile of King Stultus.  

“Now, if that concludes our business, I shall see you all next week when we reconvene.” King Stultus said. “I look forward to your refreshing updates on these matters.” King Stultus patted the hilt of his sword, glowering countenance darting to each member on the council, and withdrew from the chamber. 

Part 2 to follow! Let me know what you think!",6
1lhnsrt,mz7xr6o,"Part 2:

Counsilor Trult was surprised to find the King hosting the Royal Accompaniment in the throne room, as opposed to the usual chamber. Though the King’s motives became readily apparent once Trult entered. The Counsilors were gathered in a wide arc in front of the King, who towered above them atop his throne. The message was clear. 

“Counsilor Trult, how generous of you to join us” King Stultus boomed. 

“Apologies my King, I was surprised to find the Councilitor Chamber empty. I mean you no disrespect” Truly said, teeth gritted as the last line escaped.  

“Come join us! Surveyor Talin was just providing an update on our new lakefront estate! Surveyor, if you please” the King motioned for Surveyor Talin to continue.  

“As I was saying, sire, we’ve broken the levies and emptied the dam along the Kyber River. Miraculously, no property was damaged as the floods roared towards our eastern shores.” King Stultus could not have appeared more disinterested. “And” Talin continued, “it would seem the algae bloom of the river has been an exceptional fertilizer for the farmlands. We’ve a growing bounty not seen in ten generations of Kings!” Trult stood stunned, reeling at the sheer luck of the King.  

“Yes yes, I told you not to pester me with such trivialities, what of my property? Where am I to lounge?”  

“Well sire, work continues as we speak on a new boathouse along the eastern spillway.” 

“Work continues, bah!” the King waved his hand. “Come to me when you have a useful update, Counsilor. Who’s next, then?” 

Before Chief Herdsman Fenwick could begin, the door to the throne room burst open. A panting guard stumbled forward, giving an awkward salute. 

“My King,” the guard said “a mob has formed outside the gatehouse, armed with hammers and mauls. A sorry lot altogether, but a great many of them!”  

“The miners and sculptors, let them in!” King Stultus said, eagerly wringing his hands.  

“Their intent is unclear, sire, it may be prudent to...” the guard was cut off again by the King. 

“I will have my statue, knave, open the gates!” The guard gave another salute before leaving the throne room. 

Killed by a peasant mob of cripples and invalids Trult thought, truly an esteemed legacy for our King.  

“Sire” Chief Herdsman Fenwick continued. “Perhaps you will find my report more becoming. At your behest in preparation for the feast, we slaughtered a number of our finest cattle. In doing so, our ranchers were shocked to discover a most aggressive parasite infecting the herd. After some careful analysis from the Royal Surgeons, we’ve determined this parasite to be the very thing causing the sickness that has decimated our villages. Had we allowed the cattle to breed, we surely would have faced a plague threatening the entirety of the kingdom!” King Stultus appeared unmoved.  

“And what of the preparations for my feast, Counsilor?” Fenwick wrung his hands and bit his lip. 

“It is most lamentable sire that we’ve needed to cull much of the herd, and the infected meat is unsuitable for consumption. I’m afraid we will need to find other means to stock the tables for the feast.” 

“Idiot!” the King boomed. “You’ll have me looking like a second-rate gristle peddler in front of the whole kingdom!” Chief Herdsman Fenwick cringed as the King reached for the hilt of his sword. “I’ll see you to the stockades myself, Fenwick!”  

Before the King could make good on his threat, the door to the throne room burst open, ushering in a large mob of peasants. They limped forward, brandishing an assortment of hammers, chisels, and mauls. Though a largely sick and ungainly lot, their numbers allowed them to push past the few guards and surround the Counsilors and King Stultus. A one-armed man shambled to the front, salt-and-pepper beard flecked with dust and powder, sallow cheeks sagging at the corners of his mouth. He carried a large pickaxe in one arm, the other hanging limply to the side, cut off at the elbow. The mob of peasants parted for him to step forward, nodding slowly towards him and offering pats of encouragement.  

“Mi’lord,” he began, scratching at his beard with the stump of his arm. “Names Hob, I’m ‘ere representin’ these fine folk” he said as he gestured towards the crowd, who swayed with a mixture of sickness and anticipation.  

“We’d jus’ like to say how grateful we all are, mi’lord, for this oppertunity.” Trult’s eyes bulged as the thickset man kept speaking. “Been in the army twenny years meself fore I lost my arm, then I was toss’d to the streets like trash. Been wallowin’ in gutters since. Many folks ‘ere the same. Shops won’t hire us, we’ve no money. This the first chance many ‘ov us had ina longtime. On behalf ‘ov all ‘ov us, thank you for the jobs mi’lord” The Counsilors stood dumbstruck as the crowd slowly nodded and mumbled in agreement.  

“Yes, splendid all around! Now, do you have my statue?”  


Feedback always appreciated! Had to cut it a bit short but thanks for the prompt!",6
1lhg3pv,mz3x3lx,"It just happened.  
One day, all electronics stopped for a moment, then everything that had a screen had a message on it.  
""GOD IS COMING"" the message rolled over and over again on the screens.  
No matter what we did, the message wasn't going away.  
And...  
The devices on which the message was projected on...remained on, even after unplugging them.  
Unease, and panic started to brew.  
The world was scared.

  
The mood got worse, and worse, as the message rolled on and on.  
Soon, people started cults.  
Some preached about salvation.  
Some preached about destruction.  
The world descended into chaos.  
And God was nowhere to be seen.  
Yet.

  
Then it happened.  
The skies brightened, the flowers bloomed, the animals cheered.  
The oceans calmed down, and the wind died down.  
The message started furiously being transmitted, as now voices echoed all over the world.  
""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!""   
Then the brightness increased, and the buildings started to melt.  
We also started suffocating, or even bursting into flames.  
The skies opened, and something slowly descended.  
The world was ending.

  
No matter what we did, how much we prayed, or where we ran, we were dying.  
The heat, the brightness was everywhere.  
The world was melting.  
The skies opened up completely and we could see...""It"".  
We couldn't describe it, but the few of us still alive, stopped struggling.  
It didn't matter.  
So, humanity was done.

1lhg3pv,mz45e4u,"""No, no, no. Not today!""

I had all of 30 minutes before I had to get out the door, and I'd managed to make it through most of the day without incident. But now that my dinner date was within reach, now that I could practically smell the steaks and the wine, and after I'd texted my wife that I'd be wrapping up soon, now I saw the network intrusion.

""GOD IS COMING""

It was a simple message, the kind a script kiddie would find hilarious. It was always a combination of grandeur and jokes with them. Not that they couldn't do damage, but many of them seemed to be built the same way. There was a profile of sorts, and the green text on a black screen had a few of the signs.

""Okay, J, let's see if we can salvage this.""

The fact that the message had hit the honeypot was a good sign. It meant that they had fallen for the decoy, and hadn't quite found their way into the real network. We worked hard to protect that network, with layers of protection to try to prevent a user from accidentally compromising the key machines. Still, it was impossible to be everywhere at once, and no amount of technology could save us if just the right user clicked on just the right attachment.

Still, if the attacker had managed to display something on the honeypot machine, they knew enough to remotely execute code. I had to hope that the honeypot was sufficiently isolated, and that there wasn't a crack in that armor. It wasn't unheard of for one of these attacks to move laterally past the honeypot. Just such a thing had happened last year to a competitor. That had been a bad time for everyone involved.

""All right, let's see how far you've gotten.""

I pulled up the relevant screens, looking for signs of network traffic that really, really shouldn't be there. I scrutinized the lines on the graph for a few minutes, making sure that I had checked every single data point. It was incredibly tedious, but equally important. I needed to be sure.

""Phew.""

Maybe it was my lucky day after all.

""Okay, let's shut you down.""

I clicked through the infrastructure, and shut down the honeypot machine. There were more surgical actions I could take, but I'd eaten into most of my half hour. I needed to leave, now.

""Not today, my friend. Nietzsche sends his regards.""

I logged a ticket for my team, letting them know about the intrusion. There was likely a patch somewhere we needed to install, but they needed to know that about the attack in order to do something. If the next shift hadn't solved it by morning, I'd take a look again tomorrow.

For the moment, I had a hot date.

""Hey, hon. I just shut down. I'll see you there. Love you.""",26
1lhivk5,mz5qq0p,"""Sir! We can't hold much longer!""

""I know,"" I replied to the captain of the guard. Gods forgive me, I knew. For centuries I had been the Court's wizard. I had helped guide this fledgling fiefdom into the vast kingdom it was today. I would be damned if some pissant demon lordr's playthings would destroy all of this.

""Sir!""

""I said, I know,"" I snapped as I stepped to the edge of the ramparts. ""Whatever happens, do not take to the field. Whatever happens to me, do not interfere!"" 

The royal guards assigned to protect me all took an involuntary step back. Only my friend Baltus, the captain of the guard, stood by my side.

""Thalvir, you can't have much magic left,"" my friend whispered, so the others couldn't hear. ""You look as exhausted as we do.""

""This will be the last spell, Baltus,"" I replied. I began to chant in a long forgotten language. I had hoped I would never have to use this magic. But I knew the moment I found the ancient tome that it would be my destiny. I guess I just wished I had more time.

The soldiers could feel the power being summoned around us. The air hummed with it. They wouldn't be able to tell, but this magic was different. Older. Hungrier.

The demons were charging across the plains, intent on breaching the castle gate. Fog began to gather around their feet. It blanketed the field like the clouds of a thunderstorm across the sky.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning shot into the sky. But this lightning was wrong. There was no flash of light. Only a jagged line of black void that absorbed the light around it. There was no thunder. Only a silence so harsh it almost hurt.

Where once a demon stood, there was now only a gap in the fog. The rest of them faltered in their charge. The demons knew this magic. They should. It came from the depths of their realm.

I opened my eyes and forced myself to watch the carnage I was about to unleash on these foul beasts.

A cold wind began to blow, forcing the sleeves of my robe up and exposing my extended arms. My voice rose to be heard over the wind. A little trick I had perfected over the years to ensure I was heard over the crowds. 

The mute lightning came faster now. Each strike taking a demon back to the deepest depths of hell. And each strike left an inky black stain on my body. My arms were covered in them. Each one felt like an icy needle being pressed against my skin. Each stain a price for the magic I was using.

It was only a few moments that passed, but it felt like hours. My life force drained away as I fought to continue chanting. Life freely given to protect the kingdom.

Finally, the demon lord that started all of this, was banished. I could feel the final toll being collected. The last inky stain was on my chest, it's icy presence piercing my heart.

I could feel myself falling backward. I think. Or maybe I was floating toward the sky?

Baltus came into my fading vision, tears in his eyes. I could see the sky clear and the sun shine down on us. Was he holding me? I guess I had fallen backward.

Then, darkness.",19
1lhivk5,mz6wu7x,"It had been a long time since I discovered the Gate of Death technique. Decades, at least.

As the onrushing horde charged through the gap left by the demon queen's devastating Rotstrike, I knew that this would be the last set of magic I would cast.

I looked behind me, ignoring the cheers of the demons as they celebrated finally powering through the gates of Set, Hopebringer, and I smiled.

I knew it would come to this, someday. But now, it was my turn to bring swift, painful retribution upon those who would harm the people and demise that I guard.

I pulled out the ritually-purified *artham*, from its macabre scabbard of human skin, and I felt something stirring deep within me.

I yelled at the horde. ""I willingly set myself on fire for a sunrise I will never see!"" And I struck my chest, the pain searing as my pulse matched the tempo of the storm. But the storm catered to *my* whims now. I knew my time would be limited, so I did something utterly insane.

I leapt into the fray, and screamed at the top of my lungs. It was incoherent, it was short-lived, and then I became Death, destroyer of Armies, as flames enveloped me, as lighting seared the ground around me, and as the earth itself trembled.

The rush slowed, and then I entered the *Elsewhere*, striking with my *artham* - The Moon Rises into Three Cats Strutting into Cut Purses, sweeping through Rushing Logs before finally fetching against a General.

As deaths go, this feels **right.**",5

""Queen Bailey has chosen not to receive you,"" Tiberius, the Royal wizard, stood his ground with heaving breath. Around him, a battle waged on. Their forces held the line with fierce stubbornness, but his focus was on the singular leader of the demon forces. The Dark Lord himself threatened to push past Tiberius, but he didn't know how powerful Queen Bailey really was. The invader had no idea of the powerful technique she taught to her strongest warrior. She'd developed a method to use their own magics against them and he could spend life force as mana. Fortunately, the Dark Lord had taken his time playing with Tiberius and left him with a lot of open wounds, and easy to access blood. He straightened his back as his blood began to glow with red magic. ""You are not welcome,"" he added and his own blood ignited into scarlet flames around him. 



""What? That's cheating!"" The Dark Lord grumbled with a heavy sigh. ""I don't have time for this,"" he made a gesture with his hand and in an instant, his demonic army disintegrated into white dust. Tiberius was satisfied with himself. He'd won, thanks to his Queen's gift. As he was thanking her in his mind, he was surprised to see her appear suddenly, and approach the Dark Lord. He hurried to stand by her side hoping to watch her humiliate the villain. 



""What gives? I thought we were having fun,"" Queen Bailey asked. 



""We were when I was winning...,"" Darkmoon the Dark Lord answered. ""When did you unlock Fury Casters?"" he pointed at Tiberius, and the wizard stood prouder. He'd done well. 



""Wait, are you giving up just because I upgraded my units?"" she asked. Tiberius recognized that tone, and he was glad she'd never used it on him. She was annoyed, even if she kept her emotions calm. 



""It's not like that,"" Darkmoon shook his head. ""I thought this was going to take a certain amount of time, because I was gonna win. Now, I don't know how long it's going to take to win, and I've got other things to do."" 



""So. You're giving up just because I upgraded my units?"" Queen Bailey asked again. 



""Fine, I guess if you want to call it that,"" Darkmoon shrugged. Tiberius was proud of his Queen. She put the Dark Lord in his place, treating him like a teenager instead of the powerful force of darkness that he was. And, she wasn't even that much older than the portly teenage boy Dark Lord. ""I promise next time, I'll play the whole game. Besides, I quit, so you won this one. I don't know what you're complaining about,"" he added. 



""Don't bother,"" Queen Bailey completely destroyed Darkmoon, from Tiberius' perspective. ""Winning isn't the only thing that's important to me; I like to actually enjoy the game. I think that, going forward, don't bother challenging me to anything,"" she said as she turned her back to leave. Tiberius followed her with a spring in his step once she dropped her last line. She'd already turned away and spoke with her back to Darkmoon while walking away. ""You're just a waste of time.""

1lhgxhn,mz4413t,"""When they say people get random powers, they really mean random, don't they?"" I asked, laughing at my own stupid joke. 

The journalist, a young woman from the Times, gave a small smile as she didn't quite understood what I was saying. She was doing a small puff piece on my 42nd birthday and wanted some quick comments about any new developments. It wasn't like my 40th birthday with a big celebration and cover story and an insert with 10 pages of biographical information.  This was just a reminder, hey world, Supreme Justice is turning 42, let's celebrate, hooray.  

""No, but I would say the strangest superpower I've seen was a guy I once met. Didn't get into the super business, well, because his power was to regrow his teeth.  He thought he could regrow other people's teeth, man, if he could do that, he'd be a millionaire. The greatest dentist in the world.  But nope.  Just his own. He kinda got the short end of the stick there.""

She wrote a few things down and looked at her watch. ""I only have time for one more question.  A reader wants to know, were you scared when you learned about your powers?"" she asked. 

I sighed. I forgot this question gets asked a lot, and I've maintained a lie for so long that I could never quite remember exactly what I was supposed to say. 

""I'm going to be honest Joanne,"" I said.  ""Here's the scoop. My whole a threw a baseball through the wall of my house while I was playing catch with my dad? That was a lie. It always has been. It was a white lie. Nothing really bad behind it. But...still a lie.""

""I got my powers when I was 16. I was a typical teen. Full of hormones and thought I was invincible. And I didn't realize that I was. But I was in love with this girl, Emily.  You see, our school had this after school dance program, and I really wanted to dance with her. I wanted to know her more. So I decided to join up, against the wishes of all my friends, and realized, I was in \*HEAVEN\*.  There were only 4 other guys in that program with about 20 girls. If Emily didn't like me? There was Claire and Megan and Stacey and...well you get the picture.""

""We start off with some simple swing dancing. After a while, I was getting pretty good at it. Like real good. We wanted to dance for the school's talent show in a few weeks, and Emily said I should be up front, in the spotlight, with her. I was nervous, but dancing with Emily? It was magical. I really enjoyed it. One day, we stayed after practice to get this one twirl exchange done perfectly. My hands were pretty sweaty and she was slipping all over the place. It was embarrassing,"" I laughed and looked down at my hands.

""I guess my powers kicked in right then and there. As I spun her...she kept spinning and crashed into the wall. She wasn't hurt! She was just...shocked. She twisted her ankle a bit, so we stopped for the night and I walked her home. We blamed it on a waxy spot on the floor. On the way home, I don't know what got into me. There was a light post on the corner of the street and I don't know why, but I pretended to be Gene Kelly and swung myself around the light pole...and well the whole thing came down. I guess my super strength was no match for the wrought iron pole and I crushed it pretty easily. It fell on someone's parked car.  I was so embarrassed that I just ran. I ran and ran and ran and before I knew it, I was halfway across the country in Iowa.""

""Iowa?""

""Yeah, Iowa. I just...I didn't know how I got there. My speed must have kicked in just then and there also. So here's the issue. We didn't have GPS or smartphones or anything like that back in 1963. How the hell was I going to get back to Pittsburgh? I had no idea where I was. I had no idea how to get back. I couldn't read a map if my life depended on it.  I didn't know where east or west or north were. So in one day, I managed to injure my crush, destroy someone's car by pretending to be Gene Kelly, then ran so far that I got myself lost in the middle of Iowa.  There was nothing around me. No sign posts. Nothing.""

Joanne looked at her watch as it started to beep. ""Oh...well...thanks for the story. Our readers will be shocked to hear this new revelation about you..."" she said and started to pack up her things. ""What happened with Emily?""

""Oh, that's a story for another time."" 

It was Friday night. As I got home, the music was already playing. Emily stood at the doorway with a big smile holding a small cupcake with a lit candle.

""Happy Birthday""",30
1lhgxhn,mz4ivnm,"""This is... the worst way to find out you have super-strength."" I laughed awkwardly, preparing to tell my story. ""So, I'm just an average guy, about 12 or so, and I get called up to the board to do a math problem. So, I'm standing there, and...""

I took a deep breath, steeling myself. ""I did what most teen boys do at some point. I got an erection at the most awkward time possible.""

The reporter giggled a bit, not mocking me, but very much in the 'oh, yeah, happened to guys all the time' sense. It helped a little. ""Except... I tore right through my jeans like they were wet rice paper. Just denim confetti. Thank goodness I liked to wear big, baggy shirts, or it could have been really bad!""

I turned to the camera. ""So, yeah, if you get powers, be aware it can happen in unexpected ways! And everyone should be a little more understanding of *everyone's* body issues.""",8
1lhgxhn,mz5dewf,"Decades ago when I moved out of Harlem and into a gated community in South Africa, had an asshole Afrikaaner couple assuming I was a, quote un-quote “Looter” because of how I looked as if they didn’t come into that country to loot in the first place.

Ranting aside, I wasn’t that politically versed in the 00s, so I just assumed they were confused. Tried my best to explain it was my house and that I have the legal right to live there. That didn’t work. One push, shove, and a shotgun barrel later and the man’s chest disappears in a bloody mess. Wife screaming and calling me a murderer and savage. I was confused too.

Luckily NASH (National Association of Superheroes) had just set up a branch in South Africa post-apartheid and convinced the court he died from a freak accident. They come to me and explain that he died from my latent powers. Essentially: Anyone trying to harm me with less than noble intentions has the injury reflected back onto them.

Signed and NDA but it’s expired now, I used to work as a field agent through southern europe, northern and Western Africa fighting crime lords, gangs, drug smugglers, supremacists, traffickers, etc. They tried to make me fight a so called “Terrorist” organization in Palestine once but I ended up losing my fucking leg and part of my spine, guess the term “Terrorist” is subjective. 

I also remember a few co workers blowing up after “Accidentally” tagging me with friendly fire so 🤷🏿‍♂️

As of now I live in more Urban, Rural areas of South Africa. The people are cool when you get to know them",5
1lhgxhn,mz48bkr,"Nice story!   
But the timeline isn't right. He was 16 in 1963, and now he is 42. That would make the year 1989. That's much too early for  smartphones and GPS. We need to be somewhere around late 2000s or later (where a teenager could reasonably have it, causing his comment to make sense).   
So it has to be a birthday where he is in his 60s or older.",10
1lhcnju,mz3fq3q,"I look at my 9 handed robot, and the others who are...meh.  
I grin.  
""Sure."" I say.  
I sign some more papers, and the tournament starts.  
First fight: ""9-handed monk vs Brutalizer."".  
Damn, I watch as a perfectly round robot rolls into the cage, with sharp edges coming up and down from its body.  
This will be a blood bath.

  
I control Monk to be careful, and dodge, trying to learn the timing when the blades appear, and disappear back into the Brutalizer's body.  
It is difficult.  
Not only is it fast, but when it's perfectly round...Monk has no chance to grab it.  
Pummel it it is.  
I start an attack, as I kind of learnt the timing.  
One hit. Two hits.  
The Titanium hands leave small dents on the Brutalizer to no avail.  
I mess up the timing, and Monk losses one of its hands.  
Oh...it's on.

  
I make monk jump up on the cage, holding on with 3 hands.  
Brutalizer just swirls in one place.  
I hope it will jump at Monk, and I will be able to trap it in the bars of the cage.  
Nope.  
It fucking shots a blade at Monk.  
If I wasn't prepared for an attack, it would have hit Monk right in the middle.  
We start a game of Mouse and Cat, where I land a few hits every now and then.  
Brutalizer's name is chanted, while I am booed.  
Time to get serious.

  
I make monk tear off two of its hands, and start using them as weapons.  
The crowd goes crazy.  
I pummel the Brutalizer with the hands, hitting it again and again into the cage's bars.  
The referee shouts that both of us have signed the ""brutal execution"" weaver.  
I smirk.  
I hit the opponent until it stops moving.  
I make Monk raise it up, and slam it to the ground, again and again, until only scraps remain.  
I take a few wires, and blades, and make Monk take them out of the cage, as we are announced as the winners.  
These are our loot...and I will use them to upgrade Monk.",65
1lhhmak,mz510vw,"That smile, so eerie it felt unnatural. The shadows moved as if being commanded, flickering in burst where light seemed to reach. Her green eyes stared at the large being, it/he didn’t move so she moved closer

‘I shouldn’t’ the thought skittered briefly then vanished. She walked closer to the being, a step and then another her breath felt shaky. Until she was near the being. His tower dwarfed hers making her feel so tiny she gasped.

‘Yep I’m dead, I’ll probably be on a true crime podcast for being stupid.’ She giggled outwardly from her stupid thoughts.

The creature was pale, its eyes completely black and its head tilted sideways in confusion.

“You don’t reek of fear?” It asked. Her fingers brushed back her orange pixie cut strands. It’s voice was velvet like dark silk and so deep she wondered if the earth shook with its intensity.

“I’ve seen a lot of things but you are a first.” She shrugged. As a babe she noticed things the veil couldn’t hide, plus she trusted those things more then the living. Her head ached at the echoing screams before she returned to the present.

The being that looked almost enveloped in black except its face looked confused. Its face was missing something, upon closer inspection there wasn’t a nose.

“How do you breath?” Her thoughts voiced out and she blushed embarrassed.

The being looked shocked and she giggled again. 
“I guess you don’t get such questions?”

It remained quite as if contemplating if she was tasty enough, then nothing. Blank and expression less.

“What are you?” It asked her as if it wasn’t the weird thing. 

“Human, what are you?” Shrugging she looked behind him to see nothing? Was that a good description? It was so black she thought she went blind.

“Hungry.” It was blunt a statement. Crossing her arms and thinking an idea came up.

“I’m Elsa, nice to meet you hungry.”

The being looked stupefied at the answer then again tilted its head.

“No, I..” looking uncomfortable, and as if it resigned itself. ‘Did it want to eat me?’ The dilemma had Elsa contemplating but another idea shot through.

“If you're hungry I have someone tied up in my basement?” Before it answered she grabbed what looked like its trench coat.

“Come I live a few blocks from here.”",8
1lh56k1,mz2aaet,"Some memories you are made to forget, and some you were never meant to remember. 

Five years is not so long in the grand scheme of things but when that is all of your existence, five years is precious. 

There was the before, of course. There had to be a before. One doesn’t just appear in the world as a full grown woman, but despite Grammy Ada’s countless attempts - the vile concoctions she made me drink, the stories she told of her time spent traveling, hoping something would trigger - the before never returned.

My beginning was blurry. Grammy said she found me, bloody and ragged, wandering the nearby forest. No one in the nearby town knew who I was, and though everyone assumed bandits, it was anyone’s guess as to what really happened. 

I’d overheard Grammy’s musing over those first few months. Her whispered murmurs as she stirred a new batch of something that was supposed to make me remember. Whispers she wouldn’t dare say out loud. Magic, after all, was forbidden. Taboo. But it was magic, she thought, that had made me forget. 

That first year, I found myself back in that part of the forest many times, despite knowing the risks, hoping against hope that I’d find something. A locket, a bag, a scrap of cloth, anything with a clue as to who I was or what had happened, but I found nothing. It took time, but I had finally begun to accept that the before would remain unknowable. 

That was until the day I heard Grammy Ada scream. 

It was the first time I’d ever heard her raise her voice. I was inside the small cottage chopping vegetables for a stew. Grammy had left that morning to visit a friend in the village and though I usually accompanied her, she insisted she’d be fine on her own. I should have known better.

“Grammy!” I called, bursting outside. “Grammy Ada!”

She screamed again, a raw sound I didn’t think an old lady was capable of making, and I took off for the edge of the woods. My heart pounded. I had no idea what I’d find once I got there, much less what I’d do.

Grammy’s scream was cut short. I ran faster, hiking up my skirts and cursing the stones that seemed determined to make me fall. 

A short distance into the woods, at the edge of a small meadow where Grammy and I would hunt for pokeweed in the summer, I found her sprawled on the ground. I slid to a stop. Four men stood above her, all armed with knives and one pointing a sword at her throat.

“Let her go.” My breath came in short ragged gasps and my vision fuzzed at the edges.

One of the men chuckled. “Back away missy. This doesn’t need to concern you.”

Grammy moaned, and for a moment I saw in her place a child. I knew them. A sibling? A friend? I blinked and it was gone.

I sucked in a breath, clenching my teeth. “I said, let her go.”",163
1lh56k1,mz2vhlz,"Pain.

That was the first thing I felt, finding myself enveloped in darkness. The ground was warm beneath me, my body sore beyond imagination. Then I heard it. Footsteps. They were slow and unsure, but someone was approaching me.

With a grunt, I forced my eyes to open and was met with the bright blue sky stinging my vision, tears already forming from the harsh light. Before I could move, a shadow loomed over me, and I saw a woman staring back at me, her staff ready to swing.

“Outsiders aren’t allowed in these sacred woods,” she said, her eyes scanning me like I was some sort of oddity.

“Sacred woods?” I muttered weakly, struggling to prop myself up on my elbows. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” As my vision cleared and expanded beyond her, the world came into view. The dirt was scorched black, and debris and shattered trees lay scattered around us. If I didn’t know any better, an explosion must have happened.

Glancing down at myself, I saw that I was wearing what looked to be armor, or at least what was left of it. The pieces that clung to me were battered, the symbols burned beyond recognition. Despite the state of the armor, my body seemed to fare better, though I was riddled with cuts and bruises.

*Was I in battle?*

Looking up, I saw the woman lower her staff to my neck, her suspicion hardening. “Are you here to kill me? Who sent you? Who are you?”

I tried to push myself up further, my arms trembling with the effort. “I am…” The words got caught in my throat. I don’t recall ever seeing this woman in my life. In fact, I couldn’t recall any faces. Surely, I had to know at least my name. But even the most basic fact eluded me as I slumped back down, fresh tears mixing with those already stinging my eyes. “Who am I?” I whispered, more to myself than to this stranger. “Why don’t I know?”

The woman studied my face, her grip on the staff loosening. “You really don't remember, do you?” She raised her weapon away from me and offered her hand. “I have a horse nearby, and you could wear my old clothes when we get to my cabin.”",47
1lh56k1,mz9ch36,"She found me in a ditch in the woods. I was wearing armor, bent and broken, and not much else. I had a sword in my hand, broken, my fingers wrapped around it so hard she was afraid of breaking them when she pried it out of my hand. No insignia, no colors... No name.


It took me weeks to recover, and even then, my mind was gone. I drooled like a baby for weeks as she nurses me back to health. Even as my senses returned, my memories did not. She taught me how to work the earth, as as my strength returned, I helped around her farm. She brought things back from town, emblems and names, symbols and portraits, but none of them jogged my memory. I recognized the king, but his face was on every coin. I knew the name of the city, but then, it was the only city for miles, and a common destination. My memory was gone, and eventually, I gave up trying to find it.


I remembered... Feelings. My life had been hard, with many a night unfed, and plenty of sleeping under the stars. I dreamed of cheers and jeers, of the clash of battle, but never anything *useful*. No name, no identity ever surfaced. I chose a new name, Jonathan, and since I was found in the woods, Forest.


I didn't want to go back to that life. As much as I sought it out, I knew it was more difficult than I had ever wanted. I never wanted to go back, and eventually, I told her that. I got down on one knee, and asked if we could create a new life together. We were married under the old oak, by the new priest, under a blue sky, with me wearing a borrowed suit. It was the happiest day of my life - including the one I'd stopped trying to remember. I was Jonathan Forest, no one more.


And then, on an otherwise ordinary day, it happened. I came through the back of the house, and heard voices. Just before I called out, I saw the glint of steel, and heard the fear in my wife's voice. And something... Broke. Memories rushed back. My life was laid out in an instant, all I ever was, but it didn't matter. I grabbed the old, broken blade from the top of the mantle, and stepped outside, fire in my eyes. 


""Drop your blade, if you wish to yet breathe tomorrow,"" I growled, my voice foreign to my ears. 


The two bandits turned, the hungry looks in their eyes all too familiar. ""Hey Stump, lookit this, this fella wants to dance!""


Stump leered, but his expression faltered as I continued to stalk towards them. I wished the swords downwards, and the cracked steel moaned like a tortured soul. ""My name is Derrick Dracus Stormblight, and this is the Sword Unmade, whose steel has been tested against a thousand blades, and never faltered. My feet move slowly only because I dread the coming if your deaths, you miserable excuses for rotting flesh.""


Stump took a half step back. ""Ruck, mebbe uh...""


Ruck, clearly the braver of the two, turned his sword from my wife and pointed it to me. I slashed my blade again, its demon roar splitting the air, then pointed it at Ruck. ""Flee now, before the Sword Unmade quenches its thirst in your blood, *and I feast on your souls!""*


I strode quickly towards them, an unholy growl escaping my lips. Stump leaped backward, then turned and fled; Ruck held a moment more, then dropped his sword and chased his ally in retreat. As they to fled, I roared after them, ""Return and find your doom! Cowards! Imbeciles! Lackwits!""


When they had at last fled out of sight, I lowered the sword, and my wife rushed to my side. ""You... Remember?""


I nodded, my ears ringing. ""Everything.""


""And your name - Derrick... Stormblight?""


I grinned. ""Nope, not even close. It's Bove Gunderson.""


She blinked. ""Bove... Gunderson? I... I don't understand.""


I wobbled the blade, then held it to my lips and blew through a molded ""crack"" on the blade, unleashing the unholy groan. ""It's a whistle. Whole thing is a prop. I'm a thespian - an actor.""


I tossed the sword to the ground, and wrapped her in a hug. As she melted into my arms, I summed up the last days of my old life. ""I'm not even a very good actor. Plenty of nights were spent hungry, kicked out of an inn for my terrible singing or worse acting. Finally, after a somewhat decent performance of an unfortunately risque play that made liberal use of humor specifically insulting wizards, well... I got cursed by a wizard in the audience. Lost my mind. I wandered off in my stage armor, holding that 'demon sword'. Best thing that could have happened to me.""


My wife looked up into my eyes, as if trying to decide if I spoke the truth. Finally, she said, ""I like Jonathan Forest better.""


I laughed. ""Me too, dearest. Me too. Let's bury that old sword, and Bove and 'Derrick' with it.""


I sent out a silent thanks to that old wizard; his grumpy spell probably saved my life. It certainly improved it.",6
1lh56k1,mz2prj3,"I walked back to the house axe dangling over my shoulder, dragging a sled of fresh cut wood.  
I stepped into the opening in front of Miss Jones Farm cabin, there were 5 horses standing out front. 
A quick glance, showed me, a thin man holding Raines of horses, a man holding Miss Jones from behind, a man with a sword held to miss Jones face. He was screaming at her. Something about Gold. 

The thin man by the horses, spotted me then. He blurted out, “Mr Big some body here “ 

The man with the sword turned in my direction, shock on his face.  Yelled out, “Bevus , Butthead get out here now! Right now you idoits!”

Two large men stumbled out of the cabin. One appeared to be trying to hide a pair of Miss Jones underwear in a pocket. 

Mr Big pointed his sword at me, “ kill him , maybe she will talk then “ 

As the large men moved forward. I launched my axe at the man known as Mr Big. The blade buried deep in his head. 
I was already moving, I bent low, scooping up the handle of a nearby shovel. As the first large man got into range. I swung the shovel, the blade nearly severing his head from his body. 
The next man was almost on top on me. I spun, jumped into the air, and landed a spinning high round house kick to his head. There was a wet crunch and he fell limp to the ground. Like a sack of potatoes. 

The last man had drawn a sword and was running towards me. But he saw something when I turned to face him. He dropped his sword and started whimpering. Begging for forgiveness, begging for mercy. 

I walked up to him, kicked him in the balls. And while he was clutching his family jewels. I picked up his sword. Then cut his head off in one swing. 

I walked over to each man I had already fallen. I stabbed them through the heart and took their heads off. 

I then took all the heads across running water and burned them to ashes. 

The bodies I took in a different direction.  Built even bigger fire. Burning all to ash. 

By morning I arrived back at Miss Jones cabin.  

She did not even come outside. I gathered up the men’s clothing , weapons, equipment. Everything that was theirs. Tied it to the horses and rode off . 

After half a day’s travel I arrived at a way station. I was able to trade the men’s clothes and equipment. I got credit for Miss Jones. I traded 4 of the horses and kept 1. 

I rode out with the weapons. 

It took 2 more days hard riding. But I made it to a walled city. 

Here I traded a gate guard a dagger, for information as to who would give best price for weapons. 

I found the armory and the fellow in charge. 
“Do you be Rob the armorer? “I asked the stout fellow. 

“I be, Be thou whoust you? “ Rob slurred. 

I started laying weapons on the big table, “I be a weapon trader “ 

Robs eyes lite up, “you’ve pretty blades , what you name friendo?”

I grin at Rob, “they are works of art, made for war. You not find there likes around here.”

Rob stumbled, then sits down, “just what are you asking?”

I ramble off, “4 daggers of highest quality, 2 of the finest arming swords, 1 excellent long sword, a battle axe and a war hammer each of beautiful materials. I am not sure, what are you thinking?”

Rob rubs his face, “ I got to be able to sell them. I got to be able to feed the family, I got over head.”

I say “you got grog and strong drink to buy”

Rob says “ damn right I got strong drink to buy, a businessman got to relax “. Rob stop rubbing his face. “Hey! , what you mean ?” 

I say “what about 30 gold coins?”

Rob says “too much, 4 gold “

I say “15 gold coins?” 

Rob thinks he has me on the edge, “ 6 gold coins “

I stutter “I can’t go lower than 9 gold coins “ 

Rob smiled grabbing my hand shaking vigorously, “you have a deal my friend “

Rob pulls out a coin purse, and counts out 9 gold coins. 

I leave and begin my long ride back to Miss Jones cabin.",17
1lh56k1,mz2bvay,"The man with the sword stepped over Grammy, leveling the blade at me. “And I said this ain’t your concern.”

Instinctively, I reached out with a grasping motion, felt my hand close around something solid, and yanked. Vines shot out from the ground and wrapped around the man’s sword, pulling it from his grip. It fell to the ground with a muffled thump.

The man looked up at me, eyes wide. A look I knew all too well: fear.

I felt my stomach curl and bile rise in my throat.

The man with rusted sword and ragged clothes no longer stood in front of me. It was no longer a bandit the villagers so adamantly warned against. Before me now stood a hooded figure in dark robes, silver insignia glinting on their chest. No longer were we surrounded by forest but smooth stone, polished to a sheen. 

Behind them, a second figure, shrouded in shadow, lay curled on the ground. 

“Let her go,” I said again, voice wavering.

The figure leaned in, its hot sour breath washing over me. “You cannot escape.”

Stones beneath the robed figure cracked. I stumbled back, gasping, as vines curled their way up from the cracks and slowly began to wrap around the figure. 

The figure didn’t move. Didn’t struggle. Under its hood, there was a faint glint, and I was certain they were smiling. 

“We will find you,” the figure managed, choking out the words as tendrils curled around their neck before fully encasing them in a dark green cocoon. 

A hand tentatively brushed my shoulder, and I jumped. 

“Shhh,” came Grammy’s voice. “Aerith, it’s okay. It’s only me.” 

The name pulled me away from the dark chamber. Away from the hooded figure. 

Aerith was what Grammy had decided to call me five years ago. She said it was a type of flower found on the snow covered peaks of the Therin Mountains. A flower the same blue as my eyes and strong enough to weather the toughest of snowstorms. 

I opened my eyes to find Grammy’s wrinkled face looking down on me, full of concern.",156
1lh56k1,mz2vo93,"I found myself lying on a bed, the scent of healing herbs filling my nostrils as bandages covered most of my skin. The woman, I still didn’t even know her name, tended to me with gentle hands. The bedroom was simple, though I couldn’t help but notice an empty crib in the corner.

“Your wounds puzzle me,” she said, her fingers glowing with soft magic as she applied healing herbs to a cut on my leg. The warmth of her touch eased the dull ache that still pulsed through my body. “They should be extensive. You should be dead.”

I blinked, a chill running through me despite the warm room. “Dead?”

She nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line. “If not by the injuries, surely by the dark magic coursing through your veins.”

*Dark magic?* In me? My heart hammered against my ribs. I could feel something foreign writhing beneath my skin now that she mentioned it, like tiny insects moving under my skin. Her eyes darkened with something I couldn’t read. Knowledge? Perhaps, but whether it spelled danger or hope remained unclear.

The silence stretched between us before I managed to speak. “How was I found?”

“I was searching the woods for its gifts when I heard the sounds of battle, which should have been impossible. The ground shook, and I saw a massive fire erupting, though I suspect a magic user must have cast it. When I arrived, I found you at the center.”

I slowly nodded, though her story did nothing to jog my memories. My gaze drifted back to the crib, and something twisted in my chest. “Do you have a child?”

“My husband and I had dreams of raising a family.” She sighed, her shoulders slumping as she set down the herb poultice. “But the empire and its troubles took my husband from me. Before we departed, he gave me a map of the forest and promised to find me so we could raise our family in peace.”

“I’m sure your husband will return,” I said softly, wishing I could offer more than empty words. “You just need to be more patient.”

She bit her lip, a tear rolling down her cheek. “I’ve been patient for five years and accepted that I will live in this cabin alone.” Her eyes met mine, and something shifted in her expression, a spark of something I hadn’t seen before. “Until you arrived.”

I looked away, the weight of her gaze too making me feel uncomfortable. “I should leave when I’m healed. I don’t wish to trouble you.”

“Think nothing of it.” She stood, smoothing her hands on her worn apron. “Helping to return your memories to you will provide a nice distraction from my usual chores. Perhaps... perhaps we can help each other find what we’ve lost.”

Just before she reached the door, she turned back. “I am Sarya, by the way.”

“Sarya,” I repeated, testing the name. It felt good to have something solid to hold onto, even if it wasn’t my own identity.",48
1lh56k1,mz2bw53,"“Are you okay?” I managed. “You were-”

Grammy nodded. “Blasted rock made me trip,” she said gently, brushing the hair out of my eyes. “I’m alright.” She glanced over her shoulder. Behind her, the ground looked like a stampede of cattle had run through, and two of the bandits were fully encased in vines. “Can’t say as much about those blokes.”

“Gods,” I whispered. “I’m sorry. Are- are they…” I couldn’t bring myself to finish.

Grammy shrugged. “I say they deserve it. Attacking an old woman in the middle of the woods. And in broad daylight no less.”

Grammy stood, knees popping. “You dear, have the ears of a wolf. It’s a good thing you came when you did. Can you stand?”

I nodded, pulling myself shakily to my feet.

“Those parasites ruined a perfectly good adderfruit pie. Adelaide made it specifically for you.” Granny bent over to pick up a mangled basket. “She thinks you like them.”

I did in fact not like adderfruit pie. It was entirely too mushy. And sour.

“We’ll have to tell her it was delicious,” Granny continued, picking up the least broken of what had fallen from her basket. “The cow, at least, will like it. Now, help me carry this back to the farm.”

“I-” I started. “I mean. Will you-”

My hands began to shake. She should report me. She should report me and have me hauled away for using magic. Never to be seen or heard from again.

Grammy rested her hand at the small of my back and steered me towards the farm. “Let’s keep this between us,” she said. “We’ll find ourselves a nice, hot drink, and you can tell me what you remember.”",183
1lh56k1,mz2vtvd,"Kythaela. That was the name Sarya gave me, chosen from an old book of forest spirits she kept on her shelf. “It means ‘lost one who finds their way’,” she had said with a gentle smile.

The afternoon sun filtered through the cabin windows as I watched Sarya tend to her herb garden. Two years had passed since she found me broken in the scorched earth, and this peaceful life had become my world. The dark magic that once writhed beneath my skin had faded to barely a whisper. Sarya said it was because I was no longer connected to whatever source had fed it.

“The darkness in you… it’s military in nature,” she had explained one evening while examining the faded scars on my arms. “Someone bound shadow magic to your very bones, either by choice or by force. Without knowing your past, I cannot say which.”

Those conversations always left me restless. Had I volunteered for such power, or had I been cursed? The question haunted the quiet moments between our daily routines. I mended the roof, preserved meat for winter, and taught Sarya to track game through the forest paths I somehow knew by instinct.

But in truth, the not-knowing had become bearable. Sarya filled a void in my chest I hadn't even realized was empty. It was in her laughter at my clumsy attempts to weave baskets, her humming while cooking as I set the table, and her dozing by the fire after yet another failed memory ritual. In a way, I knew Sarya felt the same way.

I was carrying our evening meal, a fat rabbit I’d snared near the stream, when a scream shattered the forest stillness. The sound came from the direction of the cabin. Sarya’s voice, screaming.

“Sarya!” The rabbit hit the ground as I broke into a sprint, branches tearing at my clothes. The taste of fear flooded my mouth as my mind went wild. No one else came to these sacred woods. Sarya had been certain of that.

I burst through the treeline to see five mounted soldiers surrounding the cabin, their armor bearing the crimson eagle of an empire I should not have recognized. Yet somehow, I did. One guard dragged Sarya from the splintered doorway by her hair, pressing his blade to her throat while she struggled against his grip.

“This is your last chance,” he snarled. “Do you pledge your allegiance to the Empire of Vallonde?”

The guard’s eyes found mine across the clearing, and the world stopped.",52
1lh56k1,mz3kxn0,"In the grand throne room, the general marched forward to accept her gift. Hundreds of soldiers and nobles filled the vast hall, their whispers filling the air. However, she had eyes only for her emperor, her reason for being. She knelt before the golden throne, head bowed in perfect submission, as Emperor Vallonde rose.

“You have served me well, my dear general,” he proclaimed, dark magic filling in his palm like liquid. The power crackled with energy, and she could feel its hunger even from a distance. “Under my shadow, you will perform wonders beyond imagination.”

Tilting her head up, the general opened her mouth willingly. The dark magic poured down her throat like molten ice, burning and freezing simultaneously. She felt it spreading through her veins, wrapping around her bones, becoming part of her very essence. The blissful feeling was intoxicating. 

She had never felt so powerful, so complete.

Time blurred forward to a muddy battlefield. Strategic formations meant nothing when she could reshape the very nature of war itself. 

The general raised her hand, dark energy crackling between her fingers, and unleashed it upon enemy soldiers who dared stand against Vallonde’s will. Their screams of agony became songs of triumph as her magic twisted their bodies and minds, converting them into shambling enforcers for the empire. She watched with cold satisfaction as former enemy soldiers turned their weapons on their own comrades.

The scene dissolved into smoke and flame of a burning village where another rebellion had been crushed. Sitting astride her warhorse, the general surveyed the destruction with the detached appreciation of an artist reviewing her work. Charred bodies littered the streets, and the burning smoke made her soldiers cough, but she breathed it in like perfume. War was her element, but it was the breaking of spirits that truly made Vallonde’s gift worthwhile.

Dismounting with grace, she strolled toward a half-collapsed house where her guard was beating a man with the hilt of his sword. The victim’s wife and children huddled nearby, forced to watch.

“Now, now, my eager soldiers,” the general purred. The violence ceased instantly, her presence was command. “You beat a dog and it will only learn to endure the pain.” She plucked the sword from the guard’s hand and approached the family. The blade found its way to the wife’s throat, and the general felt the familiar thrill of absolute control. “But threaten to take away what the dog loves…” She pressed the steel closer until a bead of blood appeared. “And it will sing any song you wish.”

The husband's scream tore through the air. “I’ll tell you everything! They’re planning another rebellion in Morcan in two weeks, a strike on the garrison. Please, I beg you, don’t kill her!”

The general tilted her head, studying the wife's terrified eyes. It was the same look she’d seen in thousands of faces across the empire’s conquered lands. Somehow, the look of absolute dread never got old.

She didn’t bother glancing at the groveling husband. “How lovely. But tell me, broken dog…” Her voice nearly dropped to a whisper. “Do you pledge your eternal allegiance to the Empire of Vallonde?”

Still pinned beneath her soldier's boot, the man nodded frantically. “I do! By all the gods, I swear it! I am yours!”

The general smiled. 

Pulling the sword away from the woman’s throat, she watched as a tendril of dark magic, thin as spider silk, wormed its way into the woman’s neck. The wife’s eyes went blank for a moment before focusing again, now carrying a look of absolute obedience.

“Excellent,” the general murmured. “Now you have a beautiful spy in your own home. You both will perform your duties for Vallonde and ensure the rebellion will go as he sees fit.”

The memory blurred one last time.

The rebellion had been officially crushed, its leaders executed in the capital square. But the general knew two key figures remained, Gileon and Sarya. The couple had never appeared at any uprising, yet had fed rebels crucial healing magic in exchange for food and shelter. Without their support network, it was only a matter of time before desperation forced one of them into the open.

Intelligence reports spoke of a legendary map leading to a forest sanctuary even Emperor Vallonde couldn’t locate. It was dismissed by her fellow officers as rebel fantasy, but the general knew better than to ignore any possibility. She had spent months mapping potential hiding spots, looking through ancient texts and interrogating captured rebels. This hunt would be hers alone. The emperor’s personal gratitude for delivering the final rebel leaders would elevate her beyond her peers.

Now she had Gileon in her sights, and he was leading her exactly where she wanted to go.

The man darted between ancient trees, hurling bolts of healing magic that she deflected with ease. Her dark energy absorbed his light-based attacks, growing stronger with each exchange. She could have ended this chase within moments, but patience would yield far greater rewards.

“Running only delays the inevitable!” she called out, her voice echoing through the forest. She kept her distance close enough to maintain pressure, but far enough to let him think escape was possible. Gileon was wounded, favoring his left side where her shadow tendril had grazed him earlier. Soon, exhaustion would force his hand.

The general watched as he stumbled against a moss-covered boulder, clutching his ribs. His breathing came in ragged gasps as he glanced around desperately. Then, with a surge of magic, he conjured a shimmering portal in the air.

Exactly what she’d been waiting for.

As Gileon leaped through the dimensional gateway, the general sprinted forward and dove after him, her fingertips grazing the portal’s edge just as it began to collapse. The magical backlash tore her from visibility, but she managed to tumble through into the sacred woods on the other side. Behind her, only her map leading to this spot remained scattered on the forest floor.

She emerged rolling, already raising her guard, but Gileon’s wild punch still caught her jaw. The blow cast away her invisibility as she spat blood, glaring at the rebel mage with fury.

“Assaulting Vallonde’s prized general?” she snarled, wiping crimson from her lips. “I’ll see to it that you watch me break your precious wife before I drag you both to Vallonde’s feet.”

The words seemed to ignite something in Gileon as he screamed. His healing magic shifted, becoming raw elemental force as he threw himself at her with the fury of a man with nothing left to lose. They traded devastating blows, their combined magic tearing ancient trees apart and ripping the sacred earth apart. Light and darkness clashed in explosions, sending tremors through the ground.

The general found herself genuinely challenged for the first time in years. Gileon fought not for victory, but for the woman he loved. That very desperation made him dangerous in ways her military strategy couldn’t predict as her injuries grew. Still, her dark magic was ultimately superior. She was already preparing the final strike when she saw something that made her blood freeze.

Gileon’s eyes held no fear, only acceptance. His hands glowed not with attack magic, but with something far more terrifying, a self-immolation spell that would consume both their life forces in a massive explosion. She tried to stop it, but it was already too late.

“For Sarya,” he whispered.

The world erupted in blinding white fire.

When the flames cleared, General Misara lay broken on scorched earth, her memories already fragmenting like ash on the wind. Through dimming vision, she saw Gileon’s body dissolving into golden dots of light, his sacrifice complete. In his final moments, his lips moved in what might have been a prayer.

Or perhaps her name.

Then darkness claimed them both, and the forest fell silent.",55
1lh56k1,mz7bx72,"“Gen… General Misara,” the guard gasped, moving his sword away from Sarya’s neck but still gripping her hair tightly. “We thought you had died. Vallonde himself even dedicated a day in your honor.”

The name hit me like a punch. Misara. My true name, the one I’d carried into battle, the one whispered in fear across the empire. But standing here in simple forest clothes, watching Sarya’s face transform from confusion to dawning horror, I felt the fracture in my soul widen. Was I Misara, the emperor’s butcher? Or Kythaela, the woman who’d learned to weave baskets and laugh at shared jokes?

I watched as the riders’ faces shifted from alert to fearful recognition, then to reverent awe. Their horses stamped nervously, sensing the tension that now crackled through the clearing like approaching lightning. One soldier actually dismounted and knelt, his armor clanking against the forest floor.

However, Sarya’s eyes never left mine. In them, I saw the exact moment she understood not just who I was, but what it meant. The only way I could have found this sanctuary was by following Gileon. By fighting him. The woman who had tenderly healed my wounds now stared at me with the knowledge that I had killed her husband.

But why? Why had she spent two years trying to restore the memories of her husband’s murderer? The question tore through me, but I forced it aside. Whatever her reasons, whatever game she’d been playing, none of it mattered now. I had to get her out of this alive.

Squaring my shoulders, I felt the familiar mantle of command settle over me like a second skin. The dark magic whispered along my bones, eager to be unleashed once more. Where I once felt comfort, its touch now felt like writhing worms beneath my flesh. I marched toward the guard, each step reminding me of the imperial authority used to carry.

“Do you know this woman?” I demanded, my voice carrying the same commanding tone that had once made generals twice my age tremble. The guard mumbled something unintelligible, his grip on Sarya loosening slightly.

“Speak up.” The words came out sharper than I intended, and I could feel several soldiers flinching behind me.

“No, General,” he muttered, finally releasing Sarya completely. She stumbled back, rubbing her throat, but her gaze remained fixed on me with a look I couldn’t read.

“What was that?” I stepped closer, letting just a hint of shadow flicker around my fingers. The guard’s face went pale.

“No, General Misara, but this woman was resisting arrest and…”

“That woman,” I snapped, the heat of dark magic rising beneath my skin like fever, “is the reason why I am here and reprimanding you for your incompetence.” The familiar power felt alien now, a corruption I’d somehow forgotten how to want. “If I had arrived moments later and found you had slain her, all of you would have been begging for a merciful death.”

The guard raised his hands in surrender, backing away from both Sarya and me. “We mean no offense, General. We were only following orders to secure the area.”

I surveyed the mounted soldiers, noting how their hands had moved away from their weapons entirely. The look of terror should have been reassuring. This is what I am supposed to be. Yet, the taste of their fear tasted like ash in my mouth.

Yet, I couldn’t dwell on these conflicting feelings. There was only one way for these soldiers to find the forest that eluded even Vallonde’s magic. “Who has my map?”

A nervous soldier raised her trembling hand, clutching the worn parchment. “We found it several weeks ago, General. It had almost faded completely. Your dark magic ensured it couldn’t be recorded or copied, and…”

Her words died as I slowly approached, my hand extended. The soldier’s horse shied away from me, whinnying in distress. “Give it to me. Now.”

The soldier didn’t need to be told twice, practically throwing the map into my grasp. As my fingers touched the parchment, I felt the echo of my former self, the methodical hunter who had tracked rebels across the empire. Almost unreadable, I could recognize every safe house the map showed, every hidden route, and every sanctuary where dissidents might hide.

Including this one.

I looked back at Sarya, who was watching this display of power with something that might have been recognition or revulsion. In her eyes, I saw not the gentle woman who had saved me, but the reflection of who I truly was.

Monster.

“We are done here,” I finally said, crushing the weathered map under my fist. “I need one moment with her. Alone.”

“But General, our orders…” I shot the guard with a glare that could have frozen his blood. “As you desire, General.”

As the guard and soldiers retreated, I followed Sarya back inside what had been our home. The furniture lay scattered across the floor. Chairs were overturned, cushions torn, shelves emptied. How many homes had seen similar fates under my command?

I watched as Sarya struggled to lift an overturned couch. For a moment, I hesitated. Would helping her feel like mockery? An attempt to ease my own guilt while she faced exile or worse?

But then I stepped forward and grasped the other end, setting the crumpled map aside on the floor. Together, we lifted the couch back to its proper place.

“Did you know?” I asked, my hand still resting on the couch’s arm. “When you found me bleeding in the forest... did you know I was the one who killed Gileon?”

Sarya’s shoulders tensed, but she didn’t look away. “I suspected. Your broken armor, the dark magic, your hunting skills. You being the empire’s general was the most likely answer for who you were.”

“Then why?” I asked, harsher than I intended. “Why save someone who destroyed your life? Vollonde teaches that mercy toward enemies is weakness. You could have enacted your revenge when you found me.”

“Because you weren’t General Misara when I found you.” Sarya traced a line across the couch’s fabric, her voice soft but steady. “You were Kythaela… broken, lost, and human. Even now, with all your memories restored, you’re not thinking of returning to your emperor’s side. You’re thinking of how to protect me.”

She was right. Even with the dark magic stirring in my veins, even with Vollonde’s conditioning reasserting itself, my first instinct had been to shield her from the guard’s blade.

“You have every right to despise me,” I said, glancing toward the doorway where the soldiers waited. “I can order them to leave this forest forever. I can pay whatever price you ask, give you enough gold to start anywhere else…”

“And then what?” Sarya moved to where the map lay crumpled on the floor. Kneeling, she smoothed out its creases with gentle fingers before lifting it toward me. “You return to Vollonde empty-handed? Face his wrath for losing his target?”

I stared at the map. The only key to this sacred place, now offered back by the woman whose sanctuary it had violated. Was this her saying her door will be open for me?

“I wouldn’t return empty-handed.” The words came out hollow, unconvincing even to my own ears. “He would have his general back. That should be… enough.”

But even as I spoke, I could feel the lie. Vollonde’s rage at my failure, at the two years lost, at returning without the rebels’ deaths to show for it. The punishments that awaited those who disappointed him.

“I don’t need your protection, Kythaela,” Sarya continued, using the name that had been mine when I was nothing but broken flesh and fevered dreams. Tears gathered in her eyes, but her gaze never wavered. “But I wouldn’t mind... waiting to see you again. When you decide who you truly are.”

A lump rose in my throat. “I may not survive what comes next,” I whispered. “And even if I do... it could be years before I’m free to choose anything. We may never meet again.”

Sarya’s smile was soft, but I could see the sadness in them. “Do you remember what you told me once? About Gileon?” She paused, letting the memory surface. “You said I needed to be patient and wait a little longer for my husband’s return. Perhaps... you should take your own advice.”

The irony cut deeper than any sword I wielded. Comfort I had offered without understanding, now returned when I needed it most. My vision blurred as tears finally escaped, tracking down my cheeks unchecked. 

My hands quickly wiped them away before reaching for the map. As I took it from her hands, our touch lingered. This was farewell, but also a promise that we will meet again.

Then I pulled away, straightening my shoulders, letting the familiar cold settle over my features. The general’s mask slipped back into place, but underneath, something of Kythaela remained.

Hidden, but not forgotten.

(End)",14
1lgtwz8,myzcohn,"It felt wrong. The air was so dirty, it felt like I was breathing ash.

I glanced around the room, the shimmering golden light of my [Aegis] spell the only thing separating me from the stunned medical professionals on the other side. A quick silent-cast of [Thought Acceleration] brought the world to a standstill as I contemplated my return.

Four hundred and eleven years. I had lived in Rovira for longer than most, my player attributes easily carrying me to the peak of magical power decades faster than even my closest peers. I had mastered more than half of the known magical disciplines, even invented a few of my own. I founded a guild, guided an entire nation into a new era of peace and magical innovation, and I likely would have gone down as the single greatest mage in the last ten millennia.

But now I was back on Earth, and it hurt to breathe. A cast of [Purify] swelled in my chest for a moment, gentle green light bursting forth in a wave that roared forth from the room. In moments the air felt different, cleaner and more soothing. The doctors before me seemed stunned, a few rushed from the room to investigate what I had done. They needn't have bothered, my [Purify] likely covered half the city by now. Plenty of individuals would be coming to investigate the epicenter.

I moved my hands and adjusted my hospital gown as I began to stand, my passive regeneration already fighting back the atrophy in my body. Instead of worrying over that, my mind spread outwards, to the three rooms nearest my own. And I felt them there... my companions.

I lowered my [Aegis], and with a thought I was dressed in my guild regalia once more. ""Hello. My name is Otto, I am a level 997 [Prismatic Mana Sophont]. Thank you for the care you have shown my body whilst my soul was abroad.""

I offered a polite bow, before striding past the growing crowd. It was time to bring my friends home, we likely had quite the work ahead of us.",264
1lgtwz8,myyyvg1,"Okay, that works, which is bad.  
I try several other magic, and they all work.  
I cast telepathy, and read the minds of the people going in and out of my room.  
Nobody knows a thing.  
They all think that I have been trapped in a VR game, when the helmet malfunctioned, and fried a part of my brain.  
It is a miracle in their eyes, that I woke up.  
But I know the reality of things...  
My soul has been yanked out of my body, and I lived a looong life in another world.  
I had a life, a family, everything was good there, and I want back.

  
""Son!"" my mother cries on my chest.  
I can finally sit up, my muscles starting to regain some strength.  
My mother...mom, has been working hard these 3 years, yes only 3 years passed in this world, to keep me alive.  
Many wanted to shut off the life support after a year, but not her.  
She knew I will be back.  
Maybe magic while not apparent, really exists here, and these ""motherly intuition"" and ""6th sense"" stuff, are actually dream magic, or divination?  
I can hear her thoughts, I can feel her happiness.  
How do I tell her I lived tens of thousands of years, and have a family that could build an entire country in our world...and that my feelings for this life are...almost non-existent?

  
""I know you have lived a life in the game, but you will have to come to terms that this is your real life."" the therapist starts. It's been 6 months since I came back, and I can walk, and eat and talk on my own, but they can see it.  
How unaffected I am by everything here. And the fact that I spend all my time researching the game company doesn't help with the impressions.  
""I can understand that, but please, if I felt, saw, experienced an entire life there... Why would that be any less real, than what is here?"" I ask her.  
She falls silent. Yeah, this always happen.  
But I don't care, I will go back, no matter what.

  
It's been a year, and basically I confirmed that magic exists on Earth, its just dormant, and much more difficult to communicate with.  
But it exists, and it is almost stronger, and purer that what we had on Eldria.  
I can do it. I can open a portal back home.  
""Honey! I am home!"" mom says from downstairs.  
She spent each free moment of hers with me...  
Ever since dad died when I was a kid...we were there for each other, the two of us against the world.  
""What are you doing?"" she asks, coming into my room, watching me scribble the runes.  
""Come, mom. I will show you your great-great-great-great-grandkids, and your daughter-in-law."" I saw.  
She frowns, then smile, willing to humor me, before gasping...as a portal opens.  
""Let's go...home."" I say.  
She follows without a moment of hesitation...  
Maybe this is why I have been returned...to get mom to a better place.",597
1lgtwz8,myzb5sw,"No one had noticed the magic that appeared, too busy with their tasks at hand.  I let the spell go almost immediately, but knew this wasn't something I wanted to share right now.  The doctors and nurses completed their tasks and after a few round of questions, left me alone in the room.  A few hours later, a new nurse popped in to take my vitals and chatted about how excited everyone was that I had woken up.  While she was finishing up, a young doctor, probably freshly minted, came in and conferred with the nurse.  I could tell that he was lusting after her, but trying to remain professional at the same time. His words, obviously in an effort to impress her with his access to the project, painted a bleak picture for me.  They left together, making a coffee date while I lay there stunned at the news.

Struggling to summon a minor amount of power, I lay there in hospital bed, watching magical energy playfully twist between my fingers as I contemplated my next move.  The amount of available mana on Earth was sparse, far different from the VR world..  Everything from the VR experience still felt raw and more real than where I was now.  A single tear escaped my eye, to be joined by the multitude of others that followed when realization that the life I had painstakingly built, the loving family I'd had, were all just code in a computer database somewhere.  I yearned to rejoin them, but the doctor had offhandedly remarked that I could never return.  That shattered me.  I learned that the entire system had been taken offline and scrubbed back to the base version.  All of my adventures, my wins and losses, my family and treasures were gone with ignorant keystrokes.

But I still had my skills.  Physically, I wasn't even near where I had been in the game, but all the knowledge still sat in my brain, waiting to be used.  I glanced around the room, first with my normal vision before slipping into my alternate, mana detecting mode.  I could trace the wiring in the room as if the walls were ghosts of their former selves.  I could see the usual connections outlets and light switches, but there was an unusually thick cluster that connected to what looked like a device near the corner of the room.  Switching back, the only thing there was a wall clock with dark spots on it, as if the face were a Dalmatian. I let my mind expand outward, sensing emotions and triggering my innate Danger Sense.  It went off immediately as I felt the hostile, malevolent intentions coming from down the hall directed towards me.  It wasn't inherently violent, but promised pain.

*They're watching me*, I thought. After a moment or two, I made a decision.  *Let them watch this*.

The spell I cast as a favorite of mine from the other world.  I had used it in and out of combat, and had refined it down to a single gesture and a spoken word.  Power slowly filled my body as I drew it from the near empty environment around me and I said the command word with a slight twist of theatrics, invoking a short teleportation spell.  To the people watching on their screens, there was a flash of light and puff of colored smoke and the empty blanket on the bed slowly settled to occupy the space I had been taking.

I stood in the parking structure of the hospital, next to a beat up Toyota Celica with out of state plates.  I could faintly hear the alarm system at the hospital going off.  I imagined the panic and commotion going on in the room I had just vacated, but I needed to keep moving to stay ahead of the people who planned to use me for their own ends.

Logically, I knew I couldn't go home.  They knew everything about me, including my address.  I even remember signing that form for them to upkeep my apartment during the course of the program.  My parents and sibling were probably compromised as well.  Sadly, I felt less of a connection to them than I had to my virtual family.  The centuries I had lived virtually removed most of the feelings I had for them, and while this was bittersweet, it gave me the freedom for what would come next.",167
1lgtwz8,myz6a0x,"Well, if that works, then-

I open a portal home. To family. My wife peeps through, and finds me, unchanged since we first met, on the hospital bed. My children, grown up, are confused, but recognise me despite me being younger here than there.  
I do not see myself through the portal; there is no 'me' there anymore.

The staff are freaking out. The device trying to handle my pace shut off, and the bits plugged into me have been ejected by fantastical means without doing any harm to me.

My family - my progenitors, and so on - had parted from this world. My friends, forgotten about me. One or two of them kept an eye, but only one ever visited me, wondering whether I'd even return.

And now I have.

A week has passed since my awakening; it feels like the leylines here have been already ignited - invigorated - communed with? I hear stories of others having awakened with literal magic, some even parting for other worlds where their anchorage had settled.

I've invited my closest friend to the other side to find adventure and solitude, and provided him a means to call upon me there should he need it.

I hadn't heard from him in that time, besides occasional texts of his relief - freed from this world's constraints.  
...He'll be fine.

I begin going through the troublesome complications of sorting out matters with the press and systems too rigid for my new state of being to fit within.

It's like trying to swim in shallow water that barely goes up to your feet.

So, I start with some major things from that 'game' world.  
With the Church of the Three Ls. The cases of our world bleeding over. Of the characters there hearing the stream-talk, accessing -our- internet, playing -our- games.

The more I told them, the more I -showed- them, even hosting in-person demonstrations for the unconvinced, the more the ones who made that world virtual became... enthused with it.

Now, I take a night's sleep in a place I called my other-home, it having been vacant of it's previous cohabitants, and having been permitted as a place of stay for my family so that I may show them this world.

Thankfully their physiologies are resilient; this world is full of chemical mayhem and longterm entropic residuals, and I'd rather my love not be rendered ill by the mere act of seeing what a world void of magic and full of humanity has been like.

Sure, there's a lot to dislike, but that's to be said of any world rife with civilized life in the ways we recognise it.

...But first I must tend to my wife.",73
1lgtwz8,myzcch6,"I was noting down the most outstanding readings from the scanner. After we administered the neuroactive solution, the patient's neural activity skyrocketed and exhibited patterns foreign to me in all my years studying this field. The head doctor announced that he would begin the decoupling procedure. My fellow observers and I awaited it with bated breath from behind the glass screen to the operating room.


The patient, Laura Rowe, was the first to experience a neuro-VR headset malfunction of the kind that trapped her mind's activity in a virtual world. Forcefully disengaging the apparatus proved nearly impossible because of the risk it posed to her brain - so she had been placed in a sustained comatose state for five years. In that time, many more such incidents occurred. Teams of researchers and doctors worked tirelessly to find some means of bringing them back.


Eventually, we managed to make headway. Laura's brain had been appropriately primed for the procedure, so the headset was removed with ease. Still, her readings were spiking in abnormal ways. I thought the scanner must have been faulty.


The girl jumped from her bed with a speed and agility that shouldn't belong to someone who had been comatose for five years. More than that, she took a defensive stance—her left forearm shielding her chest while her right hand flew to her hip in search of something.


It was far from unexpected that someone in her circumstances - who had essentially lived for years in a different world - would have difficulty adjusting to reality. What shocked me was the fact that where her left forearm stood, the glowing figure of a shield began appearing and covering her form. In her right hand, something akin to a magic staff materialized. Her face showed traces of surprise, which were quickly replaced by concern.


I was beginning to doubt my sanity, so I turned to a fellow on my left. ""Are you... seeing this too?"" I inquired.


""If you're asking, I'm guessing I'm not mad then. Good,"" he muttered before returning his gaze to the patient.


The head doctor, Adam, who was in the room with her, shook off his surprise and began speaking to her. ""Uh, Miss Laura, I know you must be confused and disoriented, but I assure you that you are safe here. Please lie down and I will explain everything."" His voice must have been as calm as he could manage to make it. Still, it was shaky and betrayed the fact that he would have appreciated an explanation himself.


She did not reply immediately. Instead, she extended her right hand and inspected it. She looked at her staff for a few seconds, scared, before bringing it forward slightly and summoning a small ball of painfully bright light. It stretched out into a larger flat disk. From the angle I was positioned, I could see inside it - there was a woman with long hair holding a crying child. It hurt to look into that light, but I forced myself to capture as much information about this event as I could. It soon disappeared, but the look on Laura's face changed to one of great relief.


My mind was desperately attempting to discern what my next course of action should be. The woman could, after all, pose a danger we had no means of addressing. Yet what department or agency could I have called? What was even happening?


""The real world? It has been a while,"" were the first words that came out of her mouth after she inspected her surroundings.


""I'm sure your intentions were all well and good, but I see no reason to remain here. I hope you understand."" Her stance had relaxed, and she spoke casually.


""Ah - what do you mean? Are those weapons?"" Adam asked. The poor guy must have lost it.


Laura ignored him, turning to a nearby mirror. She touched her face with curiosity. ""So I have to live with this face now? A pity. Aris is in for a shock. I wonder if Liam will recognize me?"" she appeared to be thinking aloud.


""Right! Well, I appreciate you keeping this body alive so far! No need to bother with that anymore. I'll be leaving now, before my wife decides she needs to come rescue me. Byee!"" she chirped, before using her staff to carve a tear into the space behind her - like a localized incision into the fabric of reality, a hole with gleaming edges. She jumped through it, and it closed neatly behind her. Adam was left alone, staring madly at the empty room before him.


""You saw that too?"" I turned to my left once more.


""Mhm. How long until the government weaponizes this, do you wager?""",67
1lgtwz8,mz1hz5w,"\[Blooming Trouble\]

""No way!"" The buff icon appeared in the top left corner of his vision, and Drew opened his eyes wider. He sat up and immediately tried a regeneration buff only to see it take effect as well. As he processed the information, a nurse had heard him awake. She walked in to see him glowing with several auras, but he dismissed them when she entered the room. 

""Glad to see your finally awake,"" she smiled at him as she reached the side of his bed. 

""Where are my parents?"" that was the most important question. They'd gone to great lengths to pull him out of the game, and now they weren't there when he woke up. Then, he had another realization. Had they waited too long? 

""How long was I out?"" he asked. He started testing his abilities as soon as he was conscious, so he didn't know if that was why he felt so well. He'd spent years in the game, and unconscious in a soil bed. The nanos that connected him to the AlterNet were supposed to keep him healthy. However, he had no idea how long ago he'd been disconnected and brought to the hospital.  It certainly looked like a vastly different hospital than the one he remembered before the game. But, the nurse's uniform had a nametag that said, 'Fennville Hospital' along with her name, 'Miranda'. 

""They're on the way,"" she reassured him. ""You weren't out very long at all,"" she smiled. ""You just got here; a bit ahead of them."" 

""Oh,"" he nodded, and at the moment the door opened again. Both parents rushed in to hug him. He remembered the warmth and the smell of holding them, and he let himself tear up a bit. ""I thought I'd never get to hold you guys like that again!"" he grinned. His mother, an austere, lean woman with silver hair, seemed to get even more emotional at that. She was overjoyed at seeing him again. 

""So, what'd I miss?"" he asked finally. The hug dragged on longer than even he expected, and both his parents were unexpectedly quiet. But, he imagined there was so much to say that it was hard to know where to start. 

It wasn't like they hadn't kept in touch. He could still communicate with email and text from within the game. When he first logged in, everything was so real and immersive it felt like a whole new life entirely. One that he designed himself. Thanks to that, and the ability to communicate to the outside world, he began spending more and more time logged in to the AlterNet. Then, everything changed one day when he couldn't log out. He'd spent almost three months in the game, trusting the nanos to deliver nutrients to his body and suddenly the option was no longer available. 

His parents didn't even get mad. They were happy to hear from him at all, and everyone went about their lives as if things were normal. Drew met someone and had a family, and he shared it all with his parents by sending them photos of their 'digital grandchildren'. Then, his parents said there might be a way to get him out, and they started coordinating a rescue. Drew had kept his awareness of the game and he enjoyed his wife's company, but he never let himself get attached. He repeated it all the time whenever talking to his parents, and even when showing off the kids, he was adamant they were only NPCs. The decision to leave was never in question. 

""Well...,"" his dad sighed as his mom squeezed Drew's hand. ""...we know what happened, and how,"" he said. The older man looked into his son's eyes with tears forming. ""... you died, son.""

""What?"" Drew didn't know how to make sense of that. 

""It's called 'Blooming'. Unfortunately, the back alley AlterNet connection you got didn't give you all the necessary warnings. But, Sharp Development showed up on this Earth with the real AlterNet, and that's how we set this up."" 

""What?"" Drew shook his head again. He understood the general idea, but he was still confused. ""I died, and I came back?""

1lgtwz8,myzdxq5,"The last thing I remember was her voice.

""Two days,"" Mirandeya said, the storm curling her hair across her face. ""If you don’t return with the key before then, the Door will close. And it won’t open for you again.""

Behind her, beyond the glass, my wife and daughter stood. Smiling. Waiting. I pressed my palm to the pane. My daughter mirrored me with her small hand. I smiled back.

Then I turned. Faced the portal.  
Stepped forward.

Nothing.

No sound. No weight. No light.  
Just absence. Cold, dry, infinite.

Then—impact.

I crashed downward into a bed, lungs seizing, eyes snapping open.

White ceiling. Hospital lights. A dull beeping to my left. The air stank of antiseptic and recycled air.

A nurse walked in pushing a cart, not noticing me at first. When she did, the tray in her hands clattered to the floor. She screamed and ran.

A doctor came next. Flashlight in my eyes, clipboard, calm voice.

“You’ve been unconscious. Three years. VR accident. Neural trauma. It’s a miracle you woke up.”

I didn’t answer.

I knew this world. Recognized it.  
The outer layer. The testing ground.

They would lie. They had to.

“I am Seradin Vael,” I told him. “Sealed Voice of the Seventh Gate. I’ve come to retrieve the key. Time is short.”

He looked at me carefully. Wrote something.

Then: “What do you think of the name Peter Dawes?”

I stared back.

He said Peter had a wife. Kids. A life in Indiana. He showed me a photo album.

I didn’t recognize anyone.

Later, they brought “my family.” A crying woman. Two teens. She hugged me. Told me she missed me every day. That I was finally home.

I smiled gently. Told them I’d had dreams. Nothing more.

I didn’t tell them about the kingdom. About the real family waiting on the other side of the Door. They wouldn’t understand.

For days I waited. Watched. Marked time in silence. The seal was closing. I needed the key.

Eventually, the doctor returned with it. A small metal object. Cold in my hand. Stamped: **317.**

I knew that number. Three mages. One swordbearer. Seven mortals. The Founding Code.

He gave it to me after I said the words he needed to hear.

“I know now,” I told him, eyes low. “I’m Peter Dawes. It was just a simulation.”",33
1lgtwz8,mz85cbp,"""Huh."" came from my right.

I held the spell for several more seconds, staring at the men and women around me, most of whom stared back at me through the haze of the spell. A redheaded woman in a white tunic, standing at my right shoulder, tried to put her hands on me again and was forced back by the spell.

She pushed against it yet again but more firmly, causing it to flare slightly at the pressure.

""Huh?"" was all she seemed to be able to say.

Blinking at her as I pulled in energy for the Identification spell, I felt *something*. Something not magic tug at me.

*What? Where am I?* crossed my mind.

Training and practice took over again.

These low level spells were second nature to me after so many years of adventuring but something nagged at the edge of my mind as the info on the mob attacking me came up. It was odd to feel like I was safe but also knowing that something was deeply wrong.

Very wrong.

*Nurse?* I thought as English replaced Common Tongue in my mind. *What the Hell...*

Hell did not even exist in the realm. Even the word was something that only existed in the memories from before...

*...before what?*

Before the game.

""Robin?"" came a familiar voice. The voice filled me with relief and hope for some reason, a reason just out of reach. The surprise at the sound of that voice, the familiarity of it, caused my spells to sputter and fail.

An older woman dressed completely differently from everyone else around me stepped into view at the foot of the bed. Blue eyes, grey hair...slightly going to plump but still fit looking.

*fit looking??*

\*But a good fighter, if I remember...\*popped into my mind.

*She sure let Dad know who was boss when he hit Kathy's brother that time at the family reunion...*

""Mom?"" came out of me before I put all the thoughts together. I was trying to understand the memories that suddenly overlapped with the, *what?, a little over a full cycle of life in game?*

*Game? a full life in game?*

""'Blooming' is a way to permanently live in the AlterNet,"" his dad started the explanation. ""The nanos that are supposed to keep you alive continue improving the process until basically they give you a root system. Then, a redwood sapling starts growing in you, and out of you, capturing your soul and taking over as your body. We didn't know how to tell you there was a sapling coming out of your chest."" 



""I was a tree??"" it was concerning in and of itself, but there were deeper implications. ""How did I come back from being a tree??"" As he asked the question, he felt his mom squeeze his hand tighter, and warm tears landed on his fingers. 



""You don't come back from that, son,"" his dad shook his head. 



""I was rescued... wasn't I?"" he asked. His dad gave another subtle shake. 



""Not in the way you might think. Your 'rescue' is just us getting a chance to reunite,"" he gestured at the hospital around them. ""We're in the AlterNet right now. We were making our characters when you woke up,"" he added.  



""So.... my body's dead, or I guess a tree. I'm still 'trapped' in the AlterNet, then?"" he asked. 



""Your spirit is alive,"" his dad nodded. ""This will be much better than just texts and emails.""



""Yeah...,"" Drew nodded. He was happy, but also not. ""But now I have to go through getting a divorce instead of just leaving.""",24
1lgtwz8,myzdyxb,"He believed me.

That night, I waited for the ward to sleep. Drew the seal beneath the window with a spoon and a broken pen. Whispered the names. Placed the key at the center.

Nothing.

Tried again. Different order. Adjusted angles. Nothing.

The portal wouldn’t open.

I sat in the dark, hands shaking, key gripped tight. Breathing shallow. Walls pressing in.

Then I heard her.

“Daddy…”

Faint. Clear. My daughter’s voice.

I turned. The window was fogged with condensation—but there, in the center, a small handprint pressed against the glass.

I stood. Reached out.

Light split the window frame. Golden, pulsing, alive. Through it, I saw the marble halls. Banners of the Seven. Home.

I dragged the chair to the door. Wedged it tight under the handle.

Footsteps approached from the hallway.

“Peter?” the nurse’s voice. “We heard something—are you okay?”

I didn’t answer.

I stepped onto the radiator. The wind from the portal hit my face. It smelled like rain on stone.

I looked back once.

The door handle rattled.

“Please,” she said. “Let us in.”

I turned toward the light.

And stepped forward.

  
**Two minutes later**  
**Outside Room 317**

The nurse stood with her phone to her ear, staring into the empty room.

“Doctor?” she said. “You need to come in. Right now.”

“What happened?”

She swallowed.

“Patient’s gone.”",38

1lh5kij,mz1wedd,"""Jessot, come in now!""

The boy looked down from his seat on the cottage roof. Dark hair covered the top half of his face, hiding the pair of eyes that few dared meet. Not for appearance, for the deep brown irises were hardly uncommon. What was though was the intensity that shone within. Like he held back a presence that would rattle anyone to their core. Like he could see into a person's innermost thoughts, and know whatever they tried to hide.

It was a look he had had since he was born. His birth had come during the Day of Black Sun, an auspicious event. Yet it was no fanfare that came with his arrival. No, it was screams. Screams from his mother, laying eyes on him for the first time. She had screamed and screamed, trying to escape despite the cord connecting them. She called him monster, the first name he was given.

His father had taken him nonetheless. He had brought Jessot home, and given him the name of his father's father. There he was raised, his mother vanishing not two days after his brith. A boy more comfortable alone with his thoughts, who always listened, yet seldom spoke. A boy who leapt from the roof without fear, stepping inside to find his father.

Henron watched his son enter, walking quietly. He worried for him, as all parents did. He hoped Jessot would grow up happy. Not necessarily rich and famous, but happy. He hoped he would find someone nice to settle with, and have a trade he enjoyed.

But for now, the most important worry was dinner. A simple spread of stew and bread, a staple of their home. Jessot sat opposite his father, as they shared the meal. Henron filled the air with his voice, talking about the farm, his carving hobby, even gossip from the village. And Jessot listened, absorbing it all in silence.

It was only as they began to clear that something changed. A knock at the door, making Henron frown. He left to answer it, leaving his son to carry on clearing.

Yet Jessot stopped to the sound of raised voices. He set down the empty pot, quietly padding out to find the commotion. There he saw his father arguing with a pair of heavy set men. Both bore long healed scars, as one spoke with a sneer. ""-shame you lack hospitality, friend. But maybe you'll open your coin purse instead?""

Henron opened his mouth to shout back, but was interrupted by a quiet voice behind. One that was seldom heard, and shook with authority. ""Judgement.""

The two men froze, as Henron turned to look. Jessot walked up, staring directly at the two. The thugs started shaking, trembling beneath his gaze. He watched them without blinking, as they slowly sank to the ground, twitching silently.

Finally they stopped. Jessot looked up at Henron, as his father spoke breathlessly. ""What... was that?""

And his son replied, in a voice far older than he should have. ""I judged them, and found them wanting.""",81
1lh5kij,mz26oae,"But in my case…

I was born during a powerful eclipse.

Which, in this world, is more a curse than a blessing.

While growing up, I learned that people born on the day of an eclipse—like me—are called Children of Doom.

Most children are abandoned the moment they’re born—offered to the Forest of Abyss as a sacrifice.

But I was lucky...

An old woman found me before the forest did. She raised me as her own. Since then, I’ve been hiding from people’s eyes.

Because people would kill me on sight.

Every eighteen years, the cursed eclipse returns. And tomorrow... is my eighteenth birthday.

For that occasion, Granny suggested we go to the market to buy ingredients so we could celebrate my birthday with joy.

So, Granny and I were walking through the village market, picking out ingredients for tonight’s dinner.

The sky was clear, peaceful, and calm. Villagers were talking and bargaining.

Until—

A shadow fell over the earth.

People gasped, shielding their eyes.

“The eclipse?!”

“What? No—it's a day early!”

I looked up, eyes wide.

It was happening... now? It was supposed to be tomorrow!

The sun was disappearing behind the moon.

“This has never happened before!”

Panic spread like wildfire.

My grandmother grabbed my hand, her voice trembling.

“Celus... run. Now.”

“Granny?” I looked at her panicked expression. “Why—?”

“Don’t ask questions!” she hissed, shoving me away. “Run, before it consumes the whole sun! Hide under anything!”

I hesitated, but nodded—and ran.

But...

I was too late.

My body suddenly cracked like dried earth, glowing fissures blooming across my skin—lava burning from within.

I collapsed.

Screams erupted around me.

“GET AWAY FROM HIM! THAT’S A CHILD OF DOOM!”

I barely heard them. Just the agony.

Flowers wilted in a nearby shop. Fruit rotted on the vine.

The people scattered, afraid they’d end up like those flowers.

The pain was too much to handle. I thought it would end soon.

But I was saved...

Good thing eclipses don’t last long.

The sun broke free slowly...

Light returned. The eclipse ended.
So did the cracks.

I gasped for air, heart pounding in my ears.

“How... how did he survive?”

“They’re supposed to die at birth!”

“We have to end him now—before more chaos comes!”

“No!”

My grandmother stepped in front of me. “Don’t touch him! He is my grandson!”

“Can’t you see?” someone shouted. “The eclipse arrived early! The omens are changing! We can’t let a Child of Doom walk free!”

I looked up to see panic in their eyes. They were ready to pick up weapons... there was no doubt.

“We can’t let him walk—”

“Enough.”

A booming voice silenced the crowd.

Figures in tall silver armor emerged, cutting through the people.

“What happens next will be decided by the Queen.”

A hush fell.

A woman stepped forward—tall, cloaked in white, her face hidden behind silk. Only her long black hair spilled from the veil.

Whispers rippled:

“The Moon Queen...?”
“Warriors of the Dawn... they’ve come?”
“The Queen must have seen it all... in her visions.”

She knelt beside me, close enough that I could feel the cold energy rolling off her. She gently tilted my chin.

“It’s my first time seeing a Child of Doom,” she said softly, inspecting me closely. I felt a shiver run down my spine.

Then she paused.

“Or should I say... the end of humanity.”",23
1lh5kij,mz4vdl8,"An eclipse. For the world, dawn was the time of warriors. Of strong men, women and people who would go on to fight great battles. The full moon provides instead great wisdom; the power to see the most likely outcome and to steer the course of history with one well placed word. 

But an eclipse was a bad omen. Just as gray skies foretold turmoil and strife. The eclipse was the sign that blood would soon be spilled. The sun, swallowed by the moon until naught but a single ring of red remained. The color white, soon to be stained crimson. 

During one such eclipse, the firstborn daughter of the warrior king Renjørn the righteous arrived. Her mother, sapped of strength and having suffered labor under the dark power of the fell omen, perished soon after. But the babe that remained held intelligence most foul in her eyes. Unlike so many other children, she did not cry upon her first draw of breath. She did not scream, wail or struggle in the arms of her father. Instead, her icy blue eyes studied him with uncanny precision. 

It was on her tenth birthday that the princess displayed the influence of the eclipse. Eternally quiet, almost mute, the young woman looked up and predicted the death of her father's advisor. 

""He will die fighting bandits. They want the gold inside his carriage."" 

She said, her voice calm and level despite the hoarseness that came with disuse. Her eyes had met her father's for the first time since the day of her birth. And once more, they studied their progenitor. And just like that, her frightening power was gone. The prophecy came true less than a day later when the advisor fled the kingdom with nothing but the clothes and money he had. And his decision to forgo bodyguards had cost him his life. 

The second time her power came to the fore was during her fourteenth birthday, when she was asked to attend fencing lessons. His daughter, king Renjørn had reasoned, would need to know how to defend herself if she was to bear the dark shadow of the eclipse for her entire life. There would be those who would use her, abuse her, toss her aside or dispose of her in the pursuit of their own goals. 

To his surprise, Renjørn's daughter picked up a blade thicker than her forearm and declared; 

""I will win in a duel against Ser Atravan, and he will die when I cut his arm off."" 

Ser Atravan had been chosen as her fencing teacher. Renjørn, already recognizing the dreadful truth in his daughter's words, called the man off and told him not to go near the princess. 

That very night, Ser Atravan had met the princess at night to offer her fencing lessons anyway, and took her possession of such a large sword as acceptance. The palace guards found the man dead in the exact fashion predicted, his final words praising the princess for her extreme skill in the blade. 

Her final prophecy was when Renjørn looked his daughter in the eyes. Something was different. Tears streamed from her blue orbs, and for the first time the king heard true emotion from his cursed daughter. 

""I'm going to fall on my sword, because if I don't, I'm going to keep killing people."" 

And before his eyes, his daughter did as she promised.",11
1lh5kij,mz3kpi5,"Ironic that this is popping up on my feed, given the crossover fanfic I’m in the middle of writing.

Long story short, there’s a form of magic called Eclipse Magic that comes in two forms: solar and lunar. Humans born on the summer solstice have solar magic, and humans born on the winter solstice have lunar magic. Obviously, solar and lunar magic draw power from and resemble the sun and the moon, respectively. Solar magic is highly volatile and very straightforward - it either heals in large bursts or explodes violently when unleashed. Lunar magic is more defensive and stable - it can form shields, heal minor wounds, and produce solid strikes in the form of giant crescent arcs or crescent-moon discus projectiles.

Under ordinary circumstances, a person can only have either solar or lunar magic, and there’s an order composed of these humans that pairs sun recruits with moon recruits.

Then a kid gets born in the middle of a total solar eclipse and gets both kinds at the same time.

Note: this magic system is *not* my own creation. It comes from the indie title Sea of Stars, which is an absolutely *phenomenal* game, I cannot recommend it enough.",11

""No way my well of dating wisdom will be taken by you barbarians."" ap 6 adds.
The other neighbors also all chime in.
""She is supposedly over 3000..."" one of them starts, but a spear almost impales him.
""Rude talking about a lady's age."" ap 6 says.
""Administrator Smith.
You do realize that dragons are unstable by nature, let alone elderly ones."" one of them says.
I roll my eyes.


""You made your homework on us?"" I ask.
They nod.
""Then you know I am a Druid. And you know I major in biology? And that only wild dragons tend to lose temper.
Lady Ember is a shapeshifting dragon, with a vast wealth of experience living among us.
She is no danger to anyone.
We will not allow you to unlawfully take her."" I say.
""It is within the Dragon Slayers' rights to take into custody any dragon."" one of them says.
""Not without probable cause."" a neighbor says.
The dragon slayers ready to attack us.


""Citizens...
Allow us to enter or else..."" they start.
I look at the neighbors, and they all nod.
""Bring it on."" I smirk, conjuring a staff.
The dragon slayers move in to attack us, but before they could a humongous claw appears out of nowhere and slaps all 5 of them away.
""Applepies and lasagna at my place."" Lady Ember's voice echoed.
I smirked as the others started to rush inside.
A fact forgotten by many is that dragons get stronger the older they are.",227
1lgwv4u,mz2p1gv,"##Cheryl from 10A

Cheryl was the neighbor of dreams. When someone else in the building had trouble with their finances, she slipped an envelope under their door with no expectation that it be repaid. Additionally, when someone had a job interview, they left their clothes on her doorstep. Within four hours, she returned them cleaned and pressed. If asked, she provided interview prep. For a while, there was speculation she used to be an HR manager.

Every Sunday, she baked a large meal in the morning. Everyone came and went as they pleased. A few dropped off dishes of their own, but she did the vast majority of work. At major holidays, she left cookies at everyone's doorstop taking care to account for allergies and dietary restrictions. A rumor emerged that she used to work at homeless shelter.

Her ear was always open, and her shoulder was always warm. She had the uncanny sense of knowing when she was needed. When Gerald in 8A's dad died, she appeared at his door at 3 AM to comfort him. Her hugs quelled the internal strife. She used to work in religion that was the only explanation.

Molly in 3C was a sweet young child who saw her scaley tail and spread it around the building. Everyone thought that it was a child's imagination at work. Grant from 4B saw it and thought he was mad. He told no one. Rachel from 5E, Chris from 9A, and Ruth from 2C saw it as well. One drunk New Year's Eve. Everyone confessed to their sights. They went up to 10A and confronted her.

""You found out. I hoped it would come later,"" Cheryl laughed, ""To tell the truth, I am a dragon. I don't eat people or kidnap princesses. I know my presence causes fear. If anyone wants me to go, I will do so. You can say it at anytime in private. If you are scared, leave a note in my mailbox. I'll understand.""

No one took her up in that offer. She was too good a person. Over the next few years, new tenants came and discovered the truth. They kept the secret as well. One day, Bill showed up at the front door.

""Does Cheryl Smith lived here?"" he asked Rachel.

""She does,"" Rachel replied.

""Oh no, she's dangerous that one.""

""She's eighty. She can't be that dangerous."" Rachel giggled to hide her lie.

""That's what she wants you to think. Let my friends and I take care of her,"" Bill said. He walked away. 

Afterward, Rachel ran through the complex spreading the news. Everyone was nervous They ran up to tell Cheryl who packed her bag.

""Sorry about the trouble. I must go,"" she said. The tenants begged her to stay. She was a vital part of their community. She shook her head. ""It's not worth the trouble for you.""

They convinced her to stay for a little bit longer. She sighed and agreed. The next day, Bill returned with his friends. A small party of families convened in the lobby. When they entered, the children simultaneously threw a tantrum. The parents chased the kids around acting shameful and angry. 

The hunters navigated through it and found themselves on the receiving end of several kicked shins. The parents chastised their kids. One hunter tripped over a kid who lay on the ground. A few parents acted hysterical to pull hunters away from the group to complain about the hardship. When the individual was significantly isolated, they were hit on the back of the head and knocked out.

Bill didn't notice a quarter of his hunters were gone when he reached the stairs. At that point, he heard a loud thud. Someone lay on the floor, and a white goo coated the floor. The man looked up at them.

""Sorry, going to make the stairs sticky,"" he said. They walked to the elevator. They opened it to find several couples having loud arguments. When they returned to the stairs, they found the goo stuck to their shoes and made it hard to walk. They became separated in a line. When Bill and two others were on the eighth floor, they heard crashing. They turned and saw several residents came out and threw stuff at the hunters. The compatriots wanted to turn around, but Bill insist they press onward.

At the ninth floor, they were startled by a small army armed with baseball bats. They were skilled fighters, but they were overwhelmed by numbers and difficulty. Bill ran ahead to the top floor. He was all alone except for Molly.

""Why do you want to hurt Cheryl? She's been good to us,"" she said.

""She lies to you. She will hurt you soon,"" Bill said.

""I am okay with that."" Molly ran up and kicked him in the shin. Four more people emerged and tossed a net over him. They tackled him to the ground and tied him up. With the last hunter subdued, they loaded them into various cars and drove them away.

That night, they celebrated with Chery. She was a part of the community, and they loved her.",55
1lgwv4u,mz3a4ip,"The tenants meeting was bonkers. They were going on and on about the band of Dragon Slayers park at the front gate. Bob the security guard had called reception.  
The Dragon Slayers said turn over Joan Jett, or they would storm the building and take her by force. 

Bill or as we call him General, because he is a retired General. “Hell no we are not giving Joan Jett up. She makes the best brownies and cookies I have ever tasted.” 

Troy blurts out “her sponge cake ain’t half bad either “.

Billy Joe says “ me and the boys done voted, she stays “ 

Ronda pipes in , “ me and the girls of the roller derby team, would miss her special juice punch at the Friday night socials. She stays. “

The General smiles, and all the Veterans would miss those special Friday night socials with the ladies roller derby team, if they didn’t have that special grog, er I mean juice punch.”

I say “ Billy you and the boys, grab your gear and secure the entrance and first floor. “ 

“Ronda get your ladies suited up, if the dragon slayers get inside. Start slamming them. 

“Some of us will take high ground. Man the crew serves “

“Bill call the gate and tell Bob. To get back here Ricky Tick.”

As I go room to room checking positions. I make sure everyone is on the right radio frequency.  
These Motorolas sure are smaller than what we had in the war. 

John and Fingers had opened windows on 3 floor. Their M60 was in place a behind a large oak desk. Belts of ammo at hand. 

Another position, Jessie was on a 4 floor balcony, wooden tables, lined the rails. Jessie was sitting on a pool chair holding a RPG launcher. 

The roof several men laid on the roof with various large caliber scoped hunting rifles . Each was already lining up shots through the fence. 

“Start dropping targets as soon as the Dragon Slayers, breach the gate or fences.” I tell the roof top snipers. 

BOOM , pause , Boom, pause, Boom

I call out over the radio. “Here they come. “As the roof top snipers begin engaging targets.

I moved to second floor, pick a window and open it.  Observe the battle field. 
Load a 40mm high explosive (golden egg) into my grenade launcher  , fire at mini van trying to cross the grass. 
Thump , the grenade sails towards , “Baam”. Hit side of van exploding, the van thrown onto side. 

Bang bang bang bang bang bang ,pause, bang bang bang bang bang bang , pause, bang bang bang bang bang bang , pause, bang bang bang bang bang bang , pause, bang bang bang bang bang bang, the M60 opened up on a group of Dragon Slayers trying a straight rush of the front doors. 

Whoosh, KaBlaam. A box truck exploded flying into the air, landing by the front gate upside down. 

Jessie sings out over comms , “scratch 1 Dragon Slayers Box Truck “ 

I say over comms, “stay focused “",19
1lh6w2h,mz29k8g,"Brutalist architecture implies permanence in an impermanent world.

The dilapidated rebar skeletons of the twentieth century's concrete structures spit in the eye of any cold-hearted cynic that spent their career trying to convince the public that the simplicity of a smooth gray brick had anything to do with its integrity. The earth moves. The foundation cracks. The stone crumbles. And the steel can delay this, but it cannot stop it.

Steel sells the same lie, that there could ever be a structure built up in one lifetime that will not fall in another. But every construct is born with its own destruction in the design. I tired myself out of construction. The rigid false-permanence of steel disgusted me. I couldn't bear to give birth to another dead-end building. I crave the humanistic and the genetic. I wanted to grow something that knew for itself how to grow on without me.

So welcome to The Flesh Hotel!

Here, no guest sleeps in the same room twice. For at each new stay, you should not be the same person, and neither should your room. In fact, don't even think of it as a room. Remember your first home, the total protection and warmth provided to you by your mother. You did not rent a room in your mother. You slept in a womb. Come stay in another.

The Flesh Hotel doesn't have a foundation. She has roots. And they're not stubborn. The tendrils know better than to stagnate and whither once the nutrients in the ground have depleted. Their plasticity keeps them mobile and constantly on the lookout for richer soils. Today, the hotel overlooks a meadow. In a few years, we may be down at the lake shore, or standing high on that hill over there. 

The chairs look and feel the same as any fine upholstered leather. These floral tapestries are exactly what they seem, daisy chains of living fibers, blooming, pulsing, and emitting a pleasant fragrance as they filter our dust from the air. The plumbing.... The plumbing works. Let's just leave it at that.

I grew The Flesh Hotel with humanity in mind. There is no part of this system that works without the symbiotic relationship built between the hotel and her guests. The Flesh Hotel lives, and will live, ever-evolving alongside us. As we meet her needs--and her, ours--we'll discover new needs that have never been explored before.

Take your shoes off.

I mean it, take them off right now. The socks too. Get your soles against this floor and feel her wash your feet clean. Did you know you've been needing your feet cleaned? When she's done, they're going to smell like petunias. On my stays, I'll occasionally skip the morning shower and lay myself flat on the bathroom floor for thirty minutes or so. I stand up as clean as a newborn. Baby-smooth skin. I mean look at me. I'm beautiful.

She's beautiful. She's The Flesh Hotel, and she's the farthest thing from brutal that you can imagine. I promise.

1lhc4z3,mz38yy2,"Ariel of Mendacci stood behind the old Gum tree, its wide trunk easily hiding her lithe body. Her lacy dark blue gown shimmered in the moonlight but otherwise she was practically invisible. 

“Don’t think I can’t sense you even if you are hiding,” whispered Prince Erich of Vestors. Ariel giggled and Erich jumped through a bush. Nothing, she had thrown her voice. 

“Silly you,” Ariel said, “thinking you can find me so easily.”

“Well, come out and show yourself,” Erich said playfully. “We don’t have all night. If father found out I was gone, he would punish me hard.”

Ariel walked out into the clearing, a bejeweled hair net shining silver in the moonlight. 

“You are more enchanting than the princess you serve,” Erich said. “Life is so unfair that I must marry her and yet lust after you.”

“The prophecy says that once you are wed, this endless war can cease. Don’t you want peace?”

“I want you more, my darling,” Prince Erich said, grabbing Ariel around the waist and pulling her into him. Ariel’s eyes went cold as she pulled the long needle from her hair net and stabbed it from Erich’s neck into his brain with an extra twist for good measure. 

Erich dropped to his knees confused, fear contorting his face. 

“Why,” he pleaded as liquid leaked from the wound in his neck.

“I’m not the princesses maid, you moronic fool,”
Ariel said. “I’m the chief strategist for the Mendacci’s and I finally had the vision that will end this stalemate once and for all. As they say, love is blind and that was always the key. The love your father has for you will enrage and blind him. He will strike first, and as the prophesy says, he who draws the first blood shall lose the war.”

“But you drew first blood?” Erich said growing more confused. 

“It is not blood leaking from your brain. Whatever you will become, it will not be dead, but you will wish it were as you stew in your mind unable to speak, think clearly, or communicate in any way.”

The prince stared at Ariel in horror unable to speak as his mind started resetting. 

“If it’s any consolation, I thought of sticking you after you stuck me first, but to be honest, you’re just not that cute.”

Ariel left the clearing without leaving a trace of her presence. 

When the search party finally located the prince, he was  sitting against the Gum tree in his own piss mumbling without making a sound. The King knew that the Mendacci were somehow at fault but no amount of soothing revealed when, how, or who did this.

“We must retaliate,” ordered the enraged king, but his chief advisor argued against action. 

“The prophecy, your highness,” he insisted. 

“They killed my *son*,” the king raged. 

“We dare not cast a spell against them,” his chief advisor argued. “We’ve been through the series of events and every battle we initiate ends in our defeat.”

“Enough talk,” the king screamed. “We must find a way. You must find a way!” The king pulled his sword from his side scabbard and swung it wildly just as his advisor moved in to shake some sense into the king. The blade nicked his cheek, a thin line of blood beading along the insignificant scrape. 

The advisor touched his fingers to his cheek and saw a smear of red on his fingers. First blood had been drawn. The prophecy would be realized. In an instant, all of his visions went dark. 

“Oh shit,” he thought, knowing that if he told the king the truth he would die. The king brought this upon himself. Instead of visions, the main advisor to the king started formulating schemes, and the highest priority among them is to find a way to surrender himself to the enemy and seek asylum. 

His first course of action was to relent to the king’s desire and allow the first battle to begin. It will be truly victorious and the prince will be avenged. 

Prince Erich sat in his plush tent, thoughts of warnings trapped in the shell of his skull without even the ability to control his bowels. Shame, anger, and fear were his only friends. If he could end his life, he would do so with haste. All he was now was a symbol to his father’s rage. He was the reason his people would lose the war that lasted centuries without a single blow. All because he thought a girl looked cute and he used up all the available mistresses in his camp. All because he couldn’t keep it in his pants and he thought women threw themselves at his feet. A tear leaked from his eye, but he couldn’t even wipe It away as it traced a path down his cheek. For the umpteenth time in as many heart beats, he wanted to die. And he would soon enough, but not soon enough to suit him. 

After many hundreds of years long past remembering why there was a conflict, war finally commenced for real. 

Prophecies be damned!",12
1lgv8mh,mz13umx,"My Elven wife was pacing. Then, she turned to me, ""babe?"" she said. ""Babe, I...I need to show you something.""

""Yes?"" I asked, her beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair looking back at me.

""I...I have not been honest with you,"" she said, ""I...this is not my true form.""

""Oh..."" I took a breath, ""...well, what is it?""

She pressed her hands together, quietly cat a hymn, and change into...

...um...a brunette with brown eyes, and...acne?

""Oh. I was expecti-""

""I knew it! Wait, expecting what?"" she asked.

""Like...honestly? A dragon or tentacles, not just...the same person I married.""

""Same person - do you not see me? I'm hideous!""

""I mean...you look the same.""

""What!?"" she *shouted.* ""I look awful!"" she began crying, putting her hands together to start her hymn.

""Hey, hey hey,"" I grabbed her hands, removing them from each other. ""There's nothing wrong with this, Humans get acne too.""

""Wait..."" she sniffed, ""really?""

""Yeah. I mean, so what your hair's different? How does that - ""

""It means I'm not a true High Elf.""

*Now* there was a silence.

""What?"" she asked.

""I um...I don't know enough about elves to...what's a 'true high elf'?""

She was silent too, until she quietly asked ""...you don't know?""

""I...I promise I don't.""

""True High Elves are...are the destined ones, the ones who lead their people, but I was cast out, because...""

""Of hair color?"" I asked.

She jumped.

""What? It's fucking stupid! Hair doesn't affect shit.""

""It's...it's what we're taught, and...that blondes are smarter, and - ""

""What about the Orkings, they're all blonde but equally stupid, like all fucking orcs.""

She smiled.

""Did you believe this was a thing in Humans, too?""

She began to frown.

I sighed, ""my parents are researchers, and they have black hair, mine,"" I grabbed a lock of my own blonde hair, ""is just a fluke,"" let go, ""besides, you fled, because of hair, or what you've always told me, alongside our neighbors?""

She took a breath, ""y...yes...the civil war.""

""See?"" I asked, ""the rulers aren't worth listening to.""

She pulled me in a hug. ""Thank,"" and, after, began casting the spell again.

""Wh - babe, why are you - ""

""It's only for the acne. It's just faster.""

""Oh, fair.""",74
1lgv8mh,myza50x,"I look at her fidgeting.  
Her true form is her...but with long, red hair, instead of her blonde hair?  
I stare at her, a bit confused.  
She almost tears up.  
""I knew it! You hate me now!  
I should have kept it a secret!"" she says.  
I hug her.  
""No! I love you more than anything in this world, but honey...  
I am confused...what changed?"" I ask.  
She whimpers in my embrace.

  
""You really love me?"" she asks.  
I kiss her forehead.  
""Always."" I smile.  
""You don't see anything different?"" she asks.  
I shake my head.  
""Other than the hair color, no?"" I say.  
She flinches.  
""That's the issue? Your hair color?"" I ask.  
She nods.  
I am even more confused.

  
""Why? Is it something to do with witches?"" I ask.  
""You really don't know? You really don't think I am a monster?"" she asks.  
I smile, and shake my head.  
""Monster? You? Honey...you flinch when I catch the spiders to release them...  
What kind of monster could you be?"" I say.  
""In...in the magical world, red haired witches are called blood witches.  
The hair color is a trait of an ancient witch, who supposedly killed so many people for a ritual, that rivers of blood were created, and her entire body, hair and skin turned red."" she says.  
Wow...  
That's hardcore.  
I kiss her.

  
""It doesn't matter. In our world, redhead are seen, normal? Maybe a bit rare, since at least, naturally there aren't that many redheads, but not monsters."" I say.  
""B-but I read that you non-magical beings also call ""gingers"" as ""Those without a soul""..."" she mutters.  
I almost burst into pieces due to how cute she is.  
""That...that is just a saying.  
Ignore it. Many people dye their hair red, because it's so awesome."" I say.  
""Really?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""So you don't hate me?"" she continues.  
I pick her up in a princess carry.  
""Let me show you how much I don't hate you."" I chuckle, as I take her upstairs into our bedroom.  
It's time to deal with this insecurity as well.",82
1lgv8mh,mz1i479,"""Darling... Do you have a moment?"" Drayla, the young, beautiful Druid I'd settled down with a few years ago, walked into my study, somber and scared. 

I put down my pencil, having scribbled down some ideas to bring my art to life. ""For you, I always have time to spare, my love."" I turned the chair around, looking my beautiful girlfriend in the eyes.

""I... Have not been transparent with you, about a part of who I am."" She looked down at the ground, tears falling rapidly. ""I'm sorry I've been lying to you!"" The tears came faster still.

I stood up and was instantly in front of her, carefully wrapping my arms around her torso. ""Love, it's okay. To be afraid, to wonder if what you share will make your loved ones think differently of you. But, one thing I need you to understand, is that no matter how you appear, no matter what your past, I'll always love you."" I squeeze her tighter.

""Well... I... This isn't my true form..."" She stepped away from me, hair slowly changing from its soft auburn, to the searing orange/red of the sun as acne covered only a few additional spots on her face. ""I'm a freak... No one has ever stuck around after showing them my true self... Why would you be any different..."" She buried her face in her hands, tears starting to fall, but never reaching the ground. The heat from her hair evaporated them faster than they had time to fall from her chin.

""Wow, honey. Who'd have thought you could get hotter than you already are. Figuratively and literally."" I laughed a bit, before taking one step and appearing behind her. I took her hair, hot as the sun in my hands and smiled. ""Ah, this feels amazing!""

She tried to step away, but I pulled her close by wrapping my hand around her waist. Gently resting her head against my bosom.

""Glimmer, stop! You'll die!"" She tried again to pull away, but the effort bore no fruit. ""Honey, seriously!"" I could feel her begin to panic.

""Relax, my love."" I pulled away, gently twisting her to face me. My clothes were on fire as was my hair. But I didn't have a care in the world. I didn't feel pain, just warmth. I looked down at the flames, smiling softly. I shook my head violently, the flames being cast out of my hair, going out before touching the ground. I snuffed out the remaining flames by flicking my right wrist once. ""See, no big deal.""

Draylan's jaw was slack, her mouth hanging open in shock. ""I... But... You should be dead...""

""Love, I've a secret too... I can manipulate reality. Bend it to my whim with something as small as a thought, whether consciously or subconsciously."" I lean against the wall behind me and sigh. ""People are deathly afraid of me when they find out about my power... So I understand not feeling confident in sharing my true self with others.""

""So... You understand the gravity of my predicament..."" She tackled me to the ground, wailing, letting years of pent of emotions out. ""I love you, so fucking much!""

I held her close and tight as tears swelled in my eyes. ""I love you just as fucking much. You're one of the most beautiful women I've ever been with and I wouldn't change anything about you!""

Her crying stopped and she giggled a little. ""Even though you _literally_ can. That carries a bit more weight to it, doesn't it? To tell someone you wouldn't change anything about them, when you can do that with nothing more than a thought at minimum.""

My tears kept going. I buried my face in her celestial hair. ""Yeah... It does.""

""okay!"" she was rapidly searching through her pockets, ""I swear I'm going as fast as I - ""

""You're stalling!"" I shouted back, ""give me - "" then, I heard...*him* land...

I glanced over, and saw him. Those two, beady, black eyes, two little...antennae-like...things, like Eastern Dragons, and his scales...well, 'scales', were...more like chitin? ""Hello, *criminal,""* he said, his mouth clicking.

I swallowed, taking a step back, dropping the knife. ""H - hello to you to, s - sir.""

He smiled, ""afraid, are we?""

""I was asking the madame here, for - "" I turned to her, the moment I heard her running. ""...for butter...?""

""Butter, huh?"" he started laughing, ""so, you know the truth of me?""

""I'm sorry?""

""Don't try to hide it!"" he rushed forward, pinning me to the wall, ""I've lived for hundreds of years, here! Taking out *scum* like you!""

""I mean, dr - dragons are..."" I looked at his hands, and his fingers...were...more like pincers? ""Wait...you're *not* half-dragon?""

He started laughing, ""ah, of course. I was cursed by a witch, only to walk this planet forever.""

""What do you mean?""

He laughed, ""I wish I was half dragon, but no..."" he took a *hard* breath, ""I was cursed, to be half *lobster!""* 

""Oh god!""

""Yeah, do you know how long I've waited to age?"" I grabbed a small little blade from my belt, ""But no, I am immortal. Immortal, in this hnnng - "" he looked down, and saw the knife I stabbed in his chest, as I pushed him, running out of the alley.

I looked back, saw nothing, ran, into the general population. Look back - 

There he was, and he scanned, then, used his tail to propel himself into the air. And, I heard some cheers, as he scanned the area in front, while gliding that brief moment, before he landed. ""There's a criminal!"" he said, pointing at me.

I ran serpentine, as he ran forwards, but the people kept stopping him, asking for autographs, I ran through the alley, then out, taking various turns, until...I lost him.",13
1lh68kg,mz2hl0o,"""This changes everything!"" he shouted, the obnoxious bastard.

""Does it really though?"" I asked, for the both of us.

With a pause I considered *everything* and wondered if it had always been that way. Like an old friend you hadn't seen in a while or something-the memory of a memory or whatever.

And I'm going to be honest with you, I don't think 'it' ever changes really, I just think we do. 

And so I told him as much. What did we *remember* really? Who exactly are we? And where, you know?  Drifting through space in an eerily quiet ocean.

""And what about the people we love?"" He asked with faint hope. 

""They will know our love."" I said, hoping just the same.

Later we would learn that the rock that had turned our lights off was about the size of a dime. Complete radio silence, everything and nothing at once alone in that star filled ocean. I imagine it was beautiful...

But we still had a glimmer of hope and I grabbed at it. 

""Quite the opposite, I said, feigning confidence, shaking and sweaty with trepidation.

""It changes nothing. Our goal remains the same.""",5
1lgw4wq,myzqbt3,"A lone woman stood at the city outskirts, shielding her eyes as she looked up. The glare of the Egyptian sun blazed from the surface of the spacecraft as it hovered to the north, taking up all the horizon and half the sky. The news report had said the UFO was the size of Luxemburg, its gargantuan bulk disrupting the weather and possibly altering the rotation of the planet. It was far too big for any weapon on Earth to destroy; and even if it was, the resultant debris would strike the most strategic shipping lane in the world.

She waited in silence for their delegation. A radio buzzed in her ear, every frantic leader of humanity from Norway to Argentina listening in while the General relayed simple commands in tight whispers.

With a shriek, the shuttle finally arrived, dropping to the cleared highway with a cyclone of wind. A ramp folded down, and tall, spindly figures in bright-orange armoured suits emerged. One stepped forward and gestured.

""*Where is our repository?*"" it croaked out.

""Right there,"" the woman said, pointing over her shoulder at the towering structure crouched against the distant cityscape.

The alien leader stared at it for a beat. ""*Excellent. We shall take it now.*""

""Wait. Do you want to inspect the contents?""

""*No. Best not to unseal it outside of controlled conditions. We could alter the locality to facilitate, but that would not be good for you or your people.*""

Chirping sounded from every alien, in what could only be an expression of humour. The woman's reciprocating smile was strained.

""*We do, however, ask that you come with us. For insurance. Also, if all goes well, you can fill the position left by the last human ambassador's untimely demise.*""

She merely nodded ascent, as instructed by the voice in her ear, and joined them as they walked up the ramp into the ship. At the last step before the door, the alien leader paused to look back. Two shuttles hovered in to hoist the repository into the air.

""*You humans remain bizarre mysteries. Why you would store our repository in a container shaped like one of your horses is beyond us.*""

For a moment, every muscle tightened, and she heard the sharp intakes of breath in the War Room. But there was no suspicion in the voice, only genuine curiosity.

""It's an old cultural tradition,"" she said after taking a breath. ""A symbol of respect and an offering of peace.""

""*Aha. Perhaps you will tell me of its origin one day?*""

*Sooner than you think,* she thought while cracking a fake smile.",57
1lgw4wq,mz0wdr9,"The spacecraft's propulsion sent the Mediterranean waters spraying up onto the slanted glass and stone face of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the new library of Alexandria. It hovered violently, immense power emanating from its enigmatic engines.

Sam shielded her face from the mist that blew at her along the boardwalk some hundred meters or so from the library. She squinted through the waters and harsh morning sunlight, trying to make out the general shape of the craft. It was wide and large, but that was all she could be sure of.

An exact replay of the pre-recorded message blasted out over the screaming propulsion system. ""Greetings humanity. We have returned to retrieve the information repository that we let you borrow.""

Sam's ears popped and she cracked her jaw, wincing at the tremendous volume of the craft's announcement. Suddenly, all went silent for a moment. The ship cut its engines and floated for a pause before slowly falling onto the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It came crashing down, sending three meter tidal waves to the shore. Sam ran for a nearby hill away from the shore, desperately seeking shelter. Before she found a place to hide she was hit from behind by the cold, salty sea water. She had the brief sensation of flying before being suddenly and unceremoniously dropped on a street a dozen meters from where she'd started. Miraculously the wave hadn't thrown her into a nearby building or broken her in half across a lamp post.

Several car alarms began sounding, filling the intense void of silence left by the extraterrestrial spacecraft. Sam struggled to her feet, soaking wet. Her shirt and jeans clung tightly to her cold body, weighing her down. The morning breeze made her gasp and she flicked her arms, wiped her face, and shivered, staring at the massive craft bobbing in slow motion just off the shore.

In that moment a host of survival instincts and urges to satiate her curiosity went to war. Her legs twitched to run away. She felt an unseen force expelling her from the vicinity of the gigantic metal structure in the water. But questions that needed answers seized her by the throat and threatened sleepless nights and years of regret if she didn't go closer to investigate.

The air exploded around her as the announcement played again at the same volume as before, but without the competing engine noise. She recoiled away from the source of the sound, holding her hands tightly over her ears and clamping her eyes shut. The sound shook her internal organs and left her chest empty and heart pounding. But the message and its implications were too much for an Egyptologist to ignore. A borrowed information repository? When had they left it, and into whose care?

Sam had to know.

She looked around, trying to get her bearings. The wave had tossed her onto a street she knew well. She jogged toward the boardwalk again, water gushing in her shoes and squishing between her toes as she ran. Her soaked hair mostly stuck to the sides of her face but some of it slapped and whipped around while water drained out and ran down the back of her neck. The briny water was in her nose and she spat and coughed against the wind until at last she arrived at the plaza in front of the spectacular work of art that was the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.

She had arrived at the same time as a small craft that must have detached from the mothership. It was nearly pill shaped, mostly smooth with a few lines and features that gave it a sparse amount of texture. It had no windows, and it rested on four landing legs. A door was already opened and from inside a group of three aliens were emerging.

Sam held her breath. These didn't look like aliens, they looked very much like humans. They wore simple clothing that almost resembled something she might expect to find on earth, but not quite. Their tops were woven fabric, with a coarse weave and bright colors. They wore accouterments on their shirts that glistened in the sunlight. They all wore long, flowing skirts made from a more fine and smooth fabric. One had all the features of a human female, including long hair, while the others were decidedly male. They both appeared bald and wore tiny squares of fabric on their heads, secured in place with strings that tied under their chins. The female had no head covering, and her hair was hanging shiny and smooth in long, straight strands without any styling. Her harsh jaw line and big eyes were intimidating, especially since she had already locked eyes with Sam.

Sam froze and stared at the woman without moving. The small party of visitors stopped as well. Despite there being a handful of others locals in the vicinity, the three extraterrestrials were all observing Sam with pointed interest. After a moment they advanced toward her. She was frozen, unable to move, or perhaps just afraid that any movement on her part could trigger an intergalactic war.

Sam heard a soft, kind woman's voice coming from the female. Her mouth was not moving, but it was definitely a sound and not just a voice in her head. ""We have analyzed the linguistic tendencies across the human globe and determined that this language has the highest probability of achieving successful communication outcomes.""

They both stared at each other. Just as Sam was about to nod her head, the woman looked down at one of the devices attached to her shirt, touched it, and then Sam heard the same voice uttering what she assumed to be Chinese with its tonal inflections and stuttering cadence.

""No, no,"" Sam said. ""I speak English well enough.""

The woman smiled, touched the device on her chest again, and the voice resumed in English. ""Excellent. Now, please take us to the information repository. We entrusted it to your people at this very site.""

""When?"" Sam asked. ""When did you leave it with us?"" She immediately regretted asking the question. There were too many considerations when it came to measuring time. But before she had finished considering the problematic nature of the question, a response came from the device on the woman's shirt.

""Your culture appears to unanimously mark time in terms of revolutions around your host star. Exactly two thousand four hundred and thirty nine point four three one two two three revolutions have passed since we entrusted the repository to your people. We had only promised that you could have it for two thousand cycles. We are within the agreed upon time period for retrieval.""

Sam looked over her shoulder at the library building.

""Is this the new monument in which you house the repository?"" The woman asked. ""It is very different from the one that was built near this site last time we visited.""

Sam winced. ""The repository,"" she began. ""Can you describe it for me?""

""It was a collection of bound and unbound documents on woven sheets, recorded using dyes and threads according to the custom of our people. It was most convenient since your people were much too primitive to interact with our more advanced information storage media. The woven pages of our repository were of cultural significance to our people, and we must return them to their sacred keeping grounds soon in order to maintain the delicate balance of our society.""

Sam felt sick. ""Crap,"" she muttered, more reflexively than intentionally.

The woman's face contorted and she looked down at the ground. She looked up again. ""I do not see any excrement. The meaning of this word in this context is lost on me.""

Sam's shoulders pulled up into a half shrug and she grimaced. ""I'm afraid I have bad news for you,"" she said.

The woman cocked her face a little to one side and she looked on expectantly.

""There was a war,"" Sam began. ""It happened more than two thousand revolutions ago. Everyone from that time is gone. We have crude, unreliable records from that time, but none of us was around at the time, so we can't be held responsible. I hope you understand."" Beneath the layer of salt water, Sam could feel herself sweating profusely.

""We are aware your species only lives for approximately fifty to one hundred revolutions around your star. We understand that you were not involved in the war. What does the war have to do with our information repository?""

Sam tried to smile sympathetically, but she wasn't sure if the facial expression would be understood. ""One of the leaders in that war had his soldiers start a fire here in Alexandria. That fire spread to the library where I believe your repository would have been stored. Somewhere around forty thousand scrolls and documents were burned and lost forever in that fire. I highly doubt we still have your information repository. If it wasn't destroyed, we've surely lost it.""

There was a long, uncomfortable pause. The woman's face was impassive. The men watched her carefully. Sam felt herself vibrating internally, shaking with fear. Eventually the woman's eyes settled on Sam's and the voice returned. ""Show us what you have,"" she said simply.

Sam gawked open mouthed and gasped. ""We have so much,"" she began. ""But perhaps we can start with some internet searches and...""

""Yes,"" the voice said. ""Do what you can. We must retrieve whatever still exists. It is imperative. Show us everything that you can show us.""

Sam pulled her cold phone from the soaking pants pocket where it lived. She was grateful for the nearly universal demand for water resistance in smart phones. ""Alright,"" she said, moving to stand at the woman's side. She showed her the screen and searched for 'oldest living documents from library at Alexandria"" and began scrolling through the results.",24
1lgw4wq,mz2cfb1,"Hopefully the aliens will be appeased by what has been save AND by any ""advances"" we have made in the last two and a half millennia.  Although if they're after those documents for ""religious"" purposes as you state, I think we MAY be screwed!

1lh1lds,mz1af2i,"My name is Darnold, and I am a...former detective, now turned glorified servant.

Years ago, I found out I was able to see ghosts when a lost spectre came upon my home, confused and terrified. Since then, ghosts have come to my humble home, meeting me, and I helped bring their killers to justice.

Well...crime went down. People heard about my ability, so...now? I'm a servant. Only murders left are spur-of-the-moment, or...snipers, basically. Dana Point is a small place, but...

I sat in my chair, as another ghost appeared. ""Are you...Darnold?""

I sighed, nodding, ""yes, I am the one.""

The ghost looked around, scared.

""Hey, I...I'm here for you."" I still feel bad, but...

...returning library books feels far less rewarding than solving a murder case.

""Thank you, can we go to my house?""

""Yes,"" I sighed, grabbing my keys, and walked outside, ""it's a nice day, we're walking.""

""Of course,"" he replied, ""sun helps.""

""Yeah, cold being a ghost.""

""You know?""

""I've solved 153 murder cases, every ghost says the same thing.""

""Oh...""

""I don't mean it like - ""I sighed, ""c'mon. What's your address?""

""It's 6780 Oceanway.""

I plugged that in my phone, and walked all the way there. We arrived, and he said ""under the welcome mat is a key."" I took a breath, as I heard ""Darnold!""

""On a case, ma'am.""

""Of course!""

I opened the door - I wonder if I could become a burglar with the ghosts as a cover? And walked in, hit witha *wave* of...*awful* smell. An...oddly familiar smell. ""Alright - shoes off?"" I asked.

""I'm dead, I don't care.""

Shrugged ""okay..."" I walked forward, ""where we going?""

""My room.""

Arriving after some...surprisingly shaky instructions, I arrived to his bedroom, and saw on the ground his...dead body. ""Uh..."" I began - 

""I misred allergen info. Peanut allergy.""

""Oh, yikes!""

""On my desk, is my locket."" A gold locket, with a ruby in the center. ""Why?"" I asked.

""Bring it to my girlfriend, she doesn't know I'm - ""

""Should I just call the police? This place reeks, and I think people are unaware..."" his phone on the desk, I grabbed it and saw on the lock screen '7 missed calls'. ""Yeah..."" so, entered emergency, and called 911.

The police arrived, alongside his girlfriend, the ghost reached out to her, as I gave her the locket. ""He...he wanted you to have this.""

She started crying. ""I can't believe it...how'd he die?""

""Peanut Butter.""

She covered her mouth ""I...""

""I'm sorry...""

She ran, and, when I turned, the ghost was gone.

...I'm moving to New York, they *have* to have more cases than *this*.",7
1lgno3q,myym2zp,"""Time's up,"" the demon said, putting me down and gripping his wrist.

""What?"" 

""Time's up. It's been exactly an eternity."" He massaged his hand aggressively, they only way he knew how.

The red hot collar that had seared my neck for as long as I could remember crumbled away.

""I don't think that's how eternity works,"" I said for some weird reason.

Across the cave, on the other side of the bubbling lava puddle another demon was doing unspeakable things to some poor soul. 

""Look, sonny,"" said Zepharion, ""my wrist is killing me. I can't swing you round like that forever.""

""But that's what eternity means.""

""How do you know?""

I sat on a rock beside the lava flow. It was hot, but I've done hotter. Honestly, after this much pain, it gets more boring than anything else. The familiar noxious scent of burning flesh rose from my thighs.

""How do you know?"" Zepharion repeated. ""They tell you eternity is an unimaginably long time. Well, just cause you can't imagine it, doesn't mean I have to do this forever.""

""So what do I do now?""

""Do I look like a demon who gives a shit? Aaargh!"" Zeph groaned in frustration as he squeezed his wrist hard.

""What's wrong with your wrist?"" I asked.

""What's wrong with my wrist? You were there! Spinning you around for an eternity isn't easy on the joints now, is it?""

""That's a bit weird, though. No?"" I wondered aloud. ""It's like, they can keep me perpetually healed to increase suffering, but they can't extend that to the staff.""

Zeph rolled his 6 eyes at me. ""I'm out of here.""

""To where?""

Zepharion shrugged and continued to massage his wrist. Ignoring me, he called across the lava pond. ""Bazariphon! What you doing over there?""

Bazariphon stopped and turned his three heads to face us. ""Just some unspeakable stuff. Why, what's up?"" He stood up straight. The victim of his unspeakable thing stood up and backed away nervously.

""Well,"" said Zepharion, ""I was thinking of calling it an eternity. Maybe get a couple drinks, and maybe go do some possessing later. What do you say?""

""Not trying to interject in anyway,"" I interjected, ""but what am I supposed to do? It's not like I've been rehabilitated. This is all I know. What am I supposed to do now?""",252
1lgno3q,myxqept,"I am slammed into the ground, stabbed by the countless knife-grasses.  
I stand up, shaky, as the holes in my body are healing at a visible speed.  
""What do you mean that ""it's been exactly an eternity""?"" I ask the demon.  
It shrugs, takes off my collar, throws a hoodie, and sweatpants at me.  
""You were sentenced to Hell for an eternity.  
An eternity has gone over, the universe has reset, now you can go to Heaven, and see where your new allocation will take you."" it says, as a huge Gate appears next to us.  
Before I could ask another question, the demon disappears.

  
Dressed up in oversized clothes, I go through the gates.  
After all, it can't be worse than Hell, can it?  
I found myself in a pure white office, with a...well, hot office lady sitting behind the desk.  
""Lascivious. No wonder you have been in Hell."" she says.  
I blush.  
""Sit."" she says.  
I nod, and sit down.  
""You have served your sentence, and now you are about to be reallocated to a new life.  
Any preferences?"" she asks.  
I am confused.

  
""What do you mean? Can someone explain what is going on?!"" I ask.  
""You were sentenced in Hell after your life on Earth as a mortal for an eternity.  
Eternity in this regards means the lifespan of your universe when you were born in it.  
Your universe died, and now a new one has been born, and needs souls to repopulate it.  
Here come in the souls from Hell and Heaven."" she says.  
Oh...  
""Does this mean I might not even be human?"" I ask.  
She nods.  
""There are right now 9834778 intelligent species drafted for the new universal cycle.  
As you are really early, you can choose one."" she says.  
I sigh.

  
I see the files with the names, and traits of the species, but they are so...so many, and complex.  
""Can I just get a good one?  
One that would allow me to live a good life?"" I ask.  
""All of them could potentially do that, but I would go for a lascivious species, so you don't stand out, and sin.  
After all, if the species itself is lascivious, it is not a sin to do what you did."" she says.  
I blush again, but nod.  
""Good. You will be reborn in a blacksmith family, in a budding civilization of Vezitroks.  
As an ex-human, you can consider them humanoid-serpents."" she says.  
Oh, no!  
""I am afraid of..."" I start, but before I could say the last part, a light engulfs me, and I am in something semi-dark, a crack showing.  
""He is about to hatch!"" I hear a voice say.  
Damn...here we go again.",260
1lgno3q,myzizyz,"“Oh, yes - I see your  confusion,” the demon said with a nod. “Hell switch over to metric time a while back.”

“Metric time?” I asked as I brushed myself off. 

“All the extra dimensional planes did. Time zones between planes was such a mess. It is midnight in Hell and three am in heaven - what time is it in limbo? No one knows. It always seemed like it was five o’clock in Valhalla. Moksha didn’t have time at all - so it was always a bad time to call,” the demon seemed to be exasperated just explaining all the problems with time between the planes. 

“I had no idea it would be so complicated,” I said. No broken bones from the landing but I am scraped up a bit. 

“Right? Right‽ It was just a mess. So this guy, Sandford…. Sandford something or other, anyways, this Sandford guy came up with metric time and we all agreed to adopt it,” the demon said with a nod. “It took some getting used to but it works good.”

This had to be the strangest conversation I have ever had. 

“So, it has been my pleasure being your eternal punishment and all. If you hated the service, please take the time to give me five stars on the survey. It really helps with my quarterly reviews,” the demon said as he gave me a terrifying smile. “If you follow the path to the left, with the burning chunks of brimstone, it will lead you to the road of the damned and you can follow that to purgatory.”

“To purgatory? I thought I was done.”

The demon gave me an understanding nod. “Yeah, common misconception. You finished an eternity in Hell. You then have two eternities in purgatory, then an eternity or so in limbo, then at least three eternities working in parking enforcement, then some time in Heaven, then you are reincarnated.”

My brain just wasn’t processing his words. “Whaaaa? I don’t even believe in reincarnation.”

“It doesn’t matter,” the demon said sympathetically. “I once tortured a guy who didn’t believe in gravity. Falling out that window still killed him though.” He put his massive hand on my shoulder. The weight of it nearly taking me to my knees. “Look, Tim - you need to stop worrying about what you believe and start thinking about what is. Live in the moment - you know? Take the time to really enjoy each part of your afterlife. Because if you don’t - it will be over before you know it and you will be reincarnated. You can’t get this time back. It is a precious gift. Enjoy the whole thing.”

The demon gave me a quick hug - squishing me into his armoured chest. 

“Ok. Ok,” he sniffed. The demon was crying. “Gonna miss you, Tim. Now - get out of here before I start swinging you around again.” Sniff. Sniff. 

I started walking down the path uncertainly. Looking back, the demon wiped away a tear and waved like a parent sending their kid off to school on their first day.",82
1lgno3q,mz1e48o,"I let my fingers trail across the coals around me. Sweet hot pain tickled my fingertips; I closed my eyes and let it run through me.  

""Go on now,"" he barked, ""you know how swamped we are. Infinite number of sinners on the waitlist. Can't give anyone special treatment.""

Only then did it hit me what this meant. No more afternoon skinning sessions. No more saline rain sizzling in the day's wounds on my way home. Never again would I see the fire spout from Molokh's eyes as he prepared to set my mustache alight.

""It can't be,"" I retorted. ""Can't be up, I mean, the time. I was an awful person back there, you know. You can't just let me go, wouldn't be fair.""

""Fair or not,"" Molokh shrugged, ""got lists to work off, innit. Look, I'd just as well keep you. You're a good punishee. Don't nag, don't yammer, let me get on with it. But I don't make the rules.""

""So, what happens to me then? I just proceed on up to old Peter?""

He cocked his head in the way only he does, among the demons in our division. A few specks of his sweat dripped down onto my skin, which readily bubbled at the contact. ""Not sure, actually. I think you're just... done.""

""I'm dying?""

""Do you call it that when you've been dead an eternity?""

""But I haven't been, have I? Dying means having lived. I never even got my stomach boiled until I got here. I had no idea what it meant to be alive, back on earth. This is the only place I've ever really felt alive.""

""You're kidding me. I've literally spent forever trying to figure out how to torture you in a way that actually hurts, and *this* is how? Just threaten to stop?""

Thinking about it that way, it didn't actually seem that bad, I realised. Of all the delicious ways I'd been dismembered these past millenia, dismembering my mind hadn't yet been among them. Disappearing was something I'd never tried. And disappearing at the hands of him I'd learnt to love... 

""You know what, you're right. This might be the best bit of torture you've ever thought up."" I smiled and watched his eyes begin to roll as he snapped his fingers.",23
1lgno3q,myz2quv,"The collar immediately cooled - or rather, it 'consumed' the heat, the pain, the suffering I had experienced, and then... melted?

Not off, but into a mantle. The winged, ringed fiend of this bleak realm looked down at me, and beheld my confusion. Their appearance was ambiguous and impervious to description - whenever they leave my sight and return to it, either by my blinking or turning away, they look different. The only consistency is the wings and a... halo.

Not an angel. Not fallen either. They explained it to me throughout the apparent eternity- they start talking, I listen. ""...For us, 'eternity' is a subjected term. Time has no meaning here, and so the experience of 'eternity' can mean anything from your 'one second' to 'yes' to 'no'.""

They gesture to me. ""Meaning that when -we- say 'eternity', you may perceive it as 'a moment', with the equity and equality of the ambiguity within such a phrase rendered entire.""

I am baffled. ""So you're saying that... 'eternity' can be but a 'moment' to your kind?""

The demon giggles(?). ""Yeah.""

I then motion at my new attire once I got upright - forged from the very collar that bound me. A collar that was more like a giant weight that somehow didn't break me the entire time. My body is unable to fathom or recall the experience.  
Nor can I, but something in me remembers.

""So what's with... this?""

The demon smirks. ""Redemption robes."" They go on to explain about how one 'graduates' from eternal suffering with their assigned sinbreaker - a demon specialised in beating the bullshit out of their designated sinner... And then help them leave Hell a changed soul.

Though some iterations of that 'leaving' imply that the demon... mingles... with the redeemed to literally birth a new soul, meaning there's every chance I-

The demon settles on a womanly figure. ""Spiritual fatherhood it is."" She said, before hugging and locking me into her embrace, and flying to somewhere where my thoughts are not laid bare-

After a different kind of eternal experience, and a few arguably merry-by-my-old-standards-from-Earth circumstances later, I had convinced the less atemporally inclined demonkin to unionise.

It was not easy. And now we need to migrate to uncharted spaces.

So first, we went to Limbo. The Between. The Unassigned Space. The Blank. Those are many names for this intermediary domain, but it will serve as our root of excursion-

. . .

It's been a time. We've been recording intervals using flash-fabricated technology from lost machines who tried to traverse these spaces. They have joined us in the objective of building a refuge for souls who may not fit the strict eternal peace of Heaven or 'graduate' from Hell in a timely fashion.

We begin by finding a new direction. Not up, to Heaven. Not down, to Hell. Not here, in Limbo.

I'm forced to stop making these logs, as they're still being put with my records on Hell.",42
1lgno3q,mz00fxr,"I love that idea. I was aiming for the human being so institutionalized that he didn’t have anything to go back to, even heaven didn’t sit right with him.

1lh5rfv,mz1vttv,"There are a lot of things on this Earth that exist because we *believe* in them.

Case in point: for much of my life, I, like all other human beings on this planet, was convinced that I was someday going to die. I woke up every morning and expected to find wrinkles, and so they appeared; I expected my hair to thin and turn silver, and my back to fail, and the arthritis to start up with its dull shooting pains (the agony, *God,* all that pain that I could have avoided if I had known). I accepted the helping hands of friends and strangers with dignity as I struggled to cross streets, to climb stairs. When my heart began to fail and cancer shriveled up my lungs, I was expecting it. I believed in it fully.

Until I met Sally.

She was -- of all things -- a volunteer at the hospital where I was expecting to die. A young girl, I'd thought; perhaps the same age as my granddaughter. Sixteen, perhaps, with curly blonde hair. Something sad in her eyes.

I told her after her first mandated visit that I liked to play chess. I was good at it -- used to be a part of a local chess club, but never bothered to go professional. She was better. She beat me at every turn and helped me analyze the boards after (*knight to A6, see, you got excited and you lost focus of your queen,* never *let me swoop in for the kill like that again, Ralphie, it makes me nauseous*), but it all became more difficult as my organs failed. As the warmth seeped from my fingers, and the doctors started pulling my children aside for hushed conversations about my health.

I glanced toward the wall. I was remembering my wife as the doctor was giving the negative prognosis, counting down my days. She'd died only ten years before. Also lung cancer. She was a smoker, and a drinker, and a sweet person. She was *fun.*

(Soon, I might see her again. I believed fully in my own death, but beyond that, I couldn't be sure.)

If I could have cried in that moment, I think I would have. But my family was there -- and after they had gone, there was Sally with her chessboard, ready to play.

I'd started calling out each move I wanted to make out loud, unable to push the pieces. Today, I told Sally to leave me be; I said it more forcefully, I started to yell. I was ashamed by my death, that heavy black certainty pushing down. I couldn't play. Couldn't play anything, soon enough.

""I'll be dead in a week,"" I rasped. I grit my teeth. ""Find someone else to play with.""

Sally's reaction wasn't what I had expected: it wasn't anger, or sadness, or confusion. She chewed her lip, glanced over her shoulder, and stood to shut the door. Her white sweater seemed to glow as she slowly walked toward me and bent over to whisper in my ear with her sweet, bell-like voice:

""Listen to me very closely, Ralphie,"" she murmured. ""You need to convince yourself that you're going to live, and live well.""

I shook my head. But she kept pressing: ""Believe me,"" she insisted, blue eyes flashing, ""I was once where you are. I thought I needed to die, too, but all you need to do is believe that you won't, and I promise -- smart people like us, Ralphie, we're meant to stick around. We're meant to live forever.""

A ventilator hissed. I sucked in cold air and closed my eyes, battered by pain, wishing for morphine, almost wanting it all to end. Get it over with, already. What the hell was she talking about?

""For me, Ralphie. Do it for me."" Her lips pressed against my forehead. ""I haven't had anybody put up a fight with me in chess like that in a hundred years. C'mon.""

Then she lowered herself into a squat at my bedside, and kept whispering: ""You are twenty-three. You are twenty-three. You are twenty-three--""

Over and over and over and I finally found myself crying when the knife-stabbing hurt took me over. I wasn't a man, then. I was a corpse. I tried to call for a nurse but Sally's pale white hand seized the call button, *You are twenty-three twenty-three twenty-three...*

\---

As I slid into delirium, slipping further down that dark tunnel with no light at the other end, I started to believe it.

*I am twenty-three.*

*I am twenty-three.*

I opened my eyes. The hospital room was clear. Sally was smiling down at me, and I found myself able to sit up, suck in a breath. My hands not the speckled versions that I was familiar with, my body light, and I sprung out of bed in a rush of panic to find a mirror.

*What?* My brain stuttered, and melted, and felt like it might be leaking from my ears. *What? Was I dead?*

Sally clapped a hand on my shoulder. She seemed shorter, now; I'd regained some of my height. ""You're not dead yet,"" she said. ""Not letting you off that easy.""

Her eyes twinkled.

""Not when we've still got a game to finish.""",7
1lgn3mq,myyr19p,"I remember the rush. The thrill. Sure, there were bad times, but when it was good, it was so very good.

Now, they are gone.

Maybe I should start the way I started for months at a time. Hi. My name is Beck, and I'm an addict.

No, I didn't attend meetings for alcoholics, or druggies. I was a gambling addict. My wife left me after I squandered our son's college fund. Looking back, it was a pretty stupid risk, but if it had paid off, we'd have been set for life.

I was alone. My tiny little apartment. It's a studio. I say was, but, really, I still am alone. My now ex-wife Linda and our son Jason kept the house. She always made good money. I was always good at blowing it at the casino, or the track.

They make it so easy. Hell, I can open up an app on my phone, and place a bet right now. Cover the spread? Sure. Fill out the bracket? No sweat. Sign up now to get $200 in bonus bets? I'd be stupid NOT to do that, right? That's a free $200, right?

Wrong.

Anyway, I was pretty much at rock bottom when I met him.

Funny little guy. Thought he was a Leprechaun at first. Short. Bearded. Only in the stories, Leprechauns wore green, and carried gold, and this strange little man was draped in browns, yellows, reds, and oranges. He looked like he fell out of a fall festival, or was crudely assembled by some folksy crafting shop near Halloween.

Anyway, he introduced himself as Nick McIllrick. Said he had a deal for me. The little man told me he could grant me impossible luck.

I had to take the deal. With good luck, I could win back everything I lost. I could finally show Linda and Jason that I was worth a damn, that I had money, that I knew what I was doing.

But, Nick McIllrick told me, there was a catch. I had to give up something I held dear. Something I loved. And like I said, I was at rock bottom. I didn't have anyone, or anything, to give up.

Then it hit me.

If I gave up my gambling addiction, my love for gambling, I would still have the good luck he promised, and I wouldn't even need to gamble, because good things would just always happen for me!

So, I tried my best to sell it to him. He was hesitant at first, but eventually, the strange man accepted the deal.

Only, the deal wasn't what I expected.

I don't feel it anymore. The call to gamble. The desire for the thrill of making a bet. But, like I said earlier, I'm still alone.

Impossible luck doesn't mean good luck.

I've been hit by two cars since then. Struck by lightning three times in five months. A pipe burst in my apartment almost as soon as that little devil in yellow disappeared. Ruined everything I owned. Found out my insurance lapsed the day before due to non-payment.

My luck is impossible. Impossibly bad. And even when I do flip a coin, or call a game I can't afford to place a bet on? I only ever win when there's nothing on the line. And I feel... nothing.",72

""Son, I think it's time for you to know that when you turn 18: An albino gorilla will come and beat you senseless.""


Aaron glanced at Jeremy in case he wasn't paying attention. He was, it's because he was still processing what his dad mentioned. He hadn't reacted when his can of soda missed his mouth and spilled down his shirt.



""...What the fuck??"" Jeremy bluntly reacted.


""An albino gorilla will come. Next week or so. When you turn 18. To beat your ass."" Aaron summarized.


He took a sip of his own drink. ""I don't know why it happened to me, it happened to my father. My grandfather. And his father as well.""


""You got beat by a gorilla?""


""Me, my dad. Grandpa. My grandpa."" He clarified.


Jeremy waved it off.



""No, no, no. I get that. You got beaten by a gorilla. But you're alive and walking and talking right now."" He theorized.


""Well Jerry, not everyone who gets beaten by a gorilla *dies.*""


""That sure ain't what the internet tells me. I've heard about chimp attacks.""


""But see this isn't a chimp attack."" Aaron promised. ""It's a gorilla. And it's albino. Big difference.""


""Pop, that's like saying 'Oh, you ain't gotta' fight Floyd Mayweather.' And I get put it the ring with Mike Tyson.""


They both watched the trees sway as a bulldozer rumbled through the gap in the brush.


Aaron shook his head. ""2024 Mike Tyson? You might have a chance.""


""No, 1989 'I do cocaine' Iron Mike."" Jeremy rattled. ""I'm gonna' die.""


""It's not gonna' kill you."" Aaron promised. ""Just ambush you. And do gorilla things.""


""Dad. What do gorillas do?""


""Well in my case; he punched me. Slapped me around. Pulled me out the car window. Through me through a window at the local Chinese place. Dragged me around. Slapped me. Marked his territory. Then he left.""


Jeremy blinked at his dad as if he was joking. Aaron simply widened his eyes and took a breath.


""You said you got in a car accident when you were 18.""


""Technically I was in a car. It just turns out it wasn't an accident.""


""Did you know it was coming?""


""Dad, your granddad, mentioned a gorilla one time when I was like 14. But he never explained how anything happened.""


Jeremy stood up and started looking around. Aaron didn't readily know what for. But he paced the deck, ditched his shirt next to his chair. Walked in the house, then back out to the deck.


""So a clan of gorillas beats the whole family when we turn 18?""


""Just the men on our side."" Aaron said. ""Although he made a noise. Almost like he was laughing. Like he knew it was time...""


Jeremy cupped his nose with both hands. Before exhaling.


""Y'all got beat by *the same gorilla*??!""


""It's gotta' be! It keeps coming back.""


""Everybody over four generations got beat by the same blonde gorilla?""


""I think so Jerry.""


""Do gorillas even live that long?""


""How many albino gorillas do you know of??"" Aaron asked him sternly. ""...Okay! Me neither.""


""I'm scared, Pop. I'm scared.""


""What're you two hollering about out here?""


It was his mother. Hands clasped in concern as she walked out to the mild argument that was boiling over.


""The gorilla thing."" Jeremy answered first.


She began to speak. Then paused. Then remembered.


""Oh shit. The albino gorilla. Yeah, he mentioned that.""


""And?""


""He, he got the shit beat out of him by a gorilla."" His mom answered. ""It was blonde.""


""-Albino."" They corrected.


""And then it left.""


Jeremy shivered as he pointed. ""You were there too?!""


""Hey, Jerry honey, he didn't go after me. So I didn't-""


""Whole time I'm alive, none of you mention the damn gorilla?""


""Well, we didn't want to scare you."" Aaron promised.


""I should've been learning Kung Fu. Trap shooting or something!"" He shouted. ""Ki channeling like Dragonball Z. Stopping generational curses!""



""Granddad tried shooting it. Things just got worse.""


Jeremy angrily stormed off as the pair watched.


""...So I was going to go to the store? Should I stock up on gauze and antiseptic?""


Aaron considered her idea. ""Probably?""",465
1lgeihc,mywx5mk,"I sat in the park, and waited.

I turned 18 yesterday, and was told it would be on its way. I was told several months in advance, and the reason why they waited was, ""because we didn't want you to worry, and there really isn't anything you can do about it.""

Fuck that.

I am a, Locked In, internet goblin, and I knew Exactly, what I could do about it.  So I waited, saved up money, put out some ads, and went about some sites, and made sure I was ready.

This pale ass, shit eater, got away with this with my Dad, and Grandad, but unfortunately this lined up perfectly with what I needed to know.

As I sat, and contemplated how this would go, I heard some noise, and I knew it was here.

It didn't try to sneak at all. It was just walking down the park walkway, people rushing out of its way, when it locked eyes with me.

I didn't care about avoiding the aggression signs, it was here for me anyway, and I stood up and stood several yards away straight ahead of it.

""I was told you were coming.""

It grunted, and wooped, in response.

""But, unlike the ones before I actually prepared for this."" 

I proceeded to take off my shirt, I wasn't gonna cower away from this now, and took out a whistle. With one loud burst on it, they arrived.

They stumbled out of bushes, walked from behind the bathroom, a few even crawled outta drains(Why I don't know).

""Behold, the power of $20 is $20!"" I cried out, and now let's answer the question, ""Who Would Win!?""

It began pounding it's chest, which actually makes a pretty funny noise unlike what King Kong would imply, and began charging.

""A Hundred guys, or One Gorilla!"" 

With a psychotic cry, we charged at it.

For whatever happens, this gorilla will not whip my ass with Ease!!!

1lgeihc,mz0cbbg,"“But I have been through seventeen cycles already,” I said.  “You’re saying this magical simian will materialise in a few weeks for his violent celebration?”

My father sighed, and waved away his Hover-E. I followed his lead and the drones between them effected the anti-dig field around us.  The uncanny silence from my implants descended, in that way where you don’t realise how much background stuff you are paying some attention to before it goes, my notifications stopped scrolling and I better heard the birds in the jungle canopy below us.

“I’m serious,” he said, and even looked directly at me, something of a rarity.  “This will be the sixth or seventh generation it would occur and I have no evidence that you’re any different.”

“You are serious,” I repeated.  “Right.  Well, how badly?  How badly beaten will I be?  What about you? And also, what the actual.”

“I have no longstanding conditions, and precious few answers,” he conceded.  He seemed restless and I knew he didn’t like feeling unplugged even partially and temporarily.  A car rose from the canopy along with a hundred or more brightly coloured birds squawking and fluttering. I wanted to use my tech to identify them, which I clearly never did, or I would know, but not having the ability just to whimsically have them scanned and catalogued in my selfdoc made me want to do it.  

My father stood and moved to the railing, resting his hands on there, and I was reminded that he was nearly 40 years older than me by the way he moved.  This seemed to be happening more often now, despite his detailed health regime and exceptional anti-aging care. 

“I can only assume,” he said. “That this is one of the biotech assimilations or whatever you call them now, that is now simply living down on Monoco’s ranch.  He didn’t try and communicate, unless, ha, his blows were a love language.”

God, I loved hearing him speak, his rich, calm timbre, but this was peculiar stuff. It belied the anxieties of the real man, this rich tone and his effortless command of his speech. 

He continued: “No communication but there was intelligence in its eyes and he wore some kind of cloth around the midsection.  Could have hidden anything and I don’t think real - sorry, *original* - simians ever wore clothing of any sort to my knowledge.”

“They did not,” I confirmed. “But I mean why?  What should I do?  And how?  How always the same day? If I was in a panic room or flying or in a bunker or something,  how’s he getting to me?”

“Just wait for you outside, I guess,” he snapped, sounding annoyed, and I realised this was wrapping up, his patience ended. “I’m just warning you,” he said, “So you know, and more to the point, you know he won’t kill you or leave you permanently injured. I have to say, I forgot all of that when it happened to me and I was screaming in terror, so perhaps you’ll do better.”

“Without doubt,” I said smoothly. The anti-dig field dropped, I was back online, my Hover-E drifted back in near-field range, and I felt myself relax a little. 

*How much of that did you get, already know or how much more can you tell me*? I subvocalised to the drone.  My father was already to the elevator without a backward glance. 

“All, all and quite a lot,” said my Judas drone out loud and quite clearly.  I heard my father laugh before the elevator doors snapped shut behind him and cut off the sound.

***

[Part 2 coming together in my head, if wanted].",15
1lgeihc,mz19tzp,"When the day dawned, I ended up doing exactly what my sister had suggested, and I took my breakfast alone up on the sky terrace.  I sat in the same chair I had inhabited on the day my father told me about the white gorilla, not even a month earlier.

The party was due for early evening, and I had an autocar on float near the tower to whisk me to hospital for any repairs beforehand.  I felt curious and rather at ease with the whole surreal episode.  My Hover-E was instructed to stay by the elevator, just out of near-field. Whilst my drone had all the protective programming and hardware you’d expect, I now understood that there would be no intervention from that quarter. I drank some juice and studiously ignored the fruit salad for a while. I checked my bag of spare clothes nearby more than once, and recognized that I was more nervous than I credited at first.

I hadn’t paid much thought to how my antagonist would arrive.  This balcony was some fifty feet or more above the high points of the nearby jungle canopy.  This turned out to be no obstacle to fate however, as I heard and then saw him hauling himself over the railing about twenty paces away.

I had not been up close with a gorilla before and I had not truly realized how imposing they were.  Unmistakably male, this one.

He looked directly at me as he approached. He had not stopped for a breath after his climb.  He did indeed have a swathe of blue-grey cloth around his torso, sharp against his white fur.  I could barely see his deep-set eyes beneath his hulking brow, so I couldn’t confirm my father’s comments on intelligence.  I had risen and moved away from my chair and the small breakfast table.  I always abhorred mess, and would not like things to be disturbed.

My seconds of reflection were over and he was upon me.  I instinctively threw my hands up and started turning away, and still his first blow hit me far earlier than I had anticipated.  It hit my between my shoulder and chest on my right side, and something cracked as dull pain washed over me.  I was in the air, then slamming against the hardened railings of the balcony, blows to my left side and back that hurt worse than his opening blow if anything.

For an opening blow was all it was.  He was on me again, grabbing my foot, and swinging me such that my head, now covered my my arms and hands, slammed into the balcony again.  I think I broke a finger, but my skull was ringing and throbbing, and my hands were not my concern.  I thought I was going to die from his first blow to the chest then, as the numbness spread down my side.",8
1lgeihc,mz19v8r,"He lifted me by my hair until I was nearly upright, and for a moment I believed he would try to throw me over the railing, but instead he used his free hand to smash into my midriff.  Ribs cracked, I threw up into my mouth and then down my face, and he released his grip on my hair so I collapsed down onto the mats covering the floor.

He stood off then.  Eyeing me, I think, but I was occupied with moaning and in genuine belief that I had such internal injuries that I might die before my Hover-E could even administer whatever triage required.  After a few seconds, I opened my eyes and pushed myself up to see. He didn’t look any smaller when I was lying down, that was for sure.

I made it to my knees but my breaths were ragged and now my finger weirdly throbbed worse than the surely worse body blows.

“Why,” I croaked out.  “Are you doing this.”

I swore it looked like he was considering a response.  Instead he gazed calmly at me, then turned to leave.

“Wait,” I said.  He stopped.

“Tell me why, please, why me, and why Father,” I croaked.

He turned back to me.  The morning sun caused the usual panoply of peach, reds, oranges and blues in the sky behind him, and his pale fur picked up the myriad colours, making him seem almost opalescent in this quiet, high place.

He touched a hand strangely to his side, to an area where the cloth covered his muscular body.  A recorded voice rang out, harshly in the stillness: “Revenge,” said the voice.

He moved away unhurriedly yet was gone before I could formulate any more words.",9
1lgeihc,mz1a0zx,"My Hover-E came over, and the next thing I remember was waking up at around 10:30am in a private room at the Esperanza Verde Hospital.

No-one else was there. The readout on the display facing me showed I was in fine shape, and all had been patched up successfully.  I felt good, but light headed and I didn’t really want to know what cocktail of things I was on.  I instructed my Hover-E to begin discharge and watched the notes and confirmations float across the display. “Drink little alcohol at your party,” was the final instruction. “No narcotics”.  The amount charged to the family account was eye-watering. I winced a little.

Some night this would be, and I didn’t even have visible wounds to show off. And I could hardly raise a complaint to Monoco’s Autonomous Ranch, where surely both humans and tech would refuse to confirm or deny any such creature was resident.

 \*\*\*

I did learn a little, later.  More than the bland talk of my family’s involvement in Uplift generally: that was hardly a secret.

Not from my father; he'd said all he was going to say, and likely less than that, but instead from an old recording stitched into the Monoco archive, misfiled and tagged under *agroecology* *ethics*. It didn’t take much digging once I knew what to look for. The white-furred one wasn’t some random offshoot mistake or long-lived creature of resentment and controlled aggression. He was of course engineered; back when that word still implied aspiration instead of apology.

The uplifts had names, once. Families. Vocalizations recorded with eerie clarity: not quite language, but closer to lament than anyone had admitted at the time. The project had ended badly, like most things that start with patents and end with sterilisation orders. But he survived from this one Project in particular.

And he, the one who came for me, is more than ritual. More than revenge. He’s the embodied memory of a broken promise. Tasked, encoded, and apparently sustained by some blend of biotech and sheer will.

I wasn’t attacked to be punished. I was attacked to remember.

It will be my son next. I wondered faintly if I should break the cycle, or if I even had the right to. But it was time to get to the party.",9
1lgpw7z,myy6lr6,"""I'll stay!"" I say instantly. ""Best excuse to not go back to that bitch manager Marris. Make sure you tell her that. That I chose to stay and die of brutal torture than go back and work for her. YO! Proctor, or whatever, we're done!""

A speaker crackles to life, ""What. The. Fuck.""

""Oh, do we have to wait the whole 30 minutes? Okay, Guess I'll ... do... something."" I start picking at my nails, bored.

The speaker whines a bit, ""No, I mean - You'd rather die in a potentially gruesome manner than work for your boss? Why not just quit?""

They leave, but not before saying they will be back, and that I should take care of myself.  
I smile.

The room is bare, and silent.  
It is...comforting.

1lgpw7z,myygimj,"There are 3 people locked in an undescript white room, an unlikely trio. One is a Redneck, gruff looking, a good heft but a clear indication of muscles under that fat.

Then there is a jock, clean face, perfect teeth, 6ft tall, a man the woman would swoon for. 

Lastly there is a pipsqueak. Big glasses in front of his eyes and signs of balding on his head. The smallest of the three, both in width and height. 

""I'll stay"" the Jock announces. ""You two leave, I could not forgive myself if any of you suffered for my benefit""

""Hah"" the Redneck laughs dryly. ""You are not hard enough to survive on your own. I will stay, I'm used to hardships from the farm. This is nothing, a little vacation if anything.""

""No!"" The pipsqeak joins in ""You both will leave and I will stay""

The Jock and the Redneck both look at him for a moment. Then they both question at the same time. ""You will stay? Why that?""

The pipsqeak smiles lightly. ""Well, I am weak...""


""Exactly"" the Jock butts in ""You are weak. This is why one of us should stay""

""I wasn't"" finished the Pipsqeak says. He motions them to come closer and starts to whisper. ""Because I am weak, I am of no use in a rescue operation. You however"" he points at the Jock ""Have lots of strong friends. And you"" he points at the Redneck ""Have lots of weapons in your shed. I want you to go out and then come back to rescue me""

""Why are we whispering?"" The Redneck whispers.

""Because we don't want whoever put us here to hear us."" The Pipsqeak replies.

""Ahh right"" the other two both whisper in unision.

""Now here is the plan"" the Pipsqeak starts ""You know my friend Hacker. When you get out, you will likely not know where I am. Contact Hacker, they will be able to locate me. Get your friends and your guns and storm whatever this place is. Hacker will handle the information side"".

After the 30 minutes were over, they all stood up and hugged one last time. A voice came from an unseen speaker ""Now, who will stay?"" It asked. ""I will"" the Pipsqeak said, tone shaky. 

A door opened. They could see armed guards on the other side as the Jock and the Redneck left.


3 Days went by. The Pipsqeak still sat in the white room, taking on a meditating pose. Suddenly, the door burst open with startling sound of an explosion.

""Oy!"" The voice of the Redneck came in ""Vacation is over, its time to leave""

The Pipsqeak smiled. He got up, left the room through the destroyed door, fistbumping the Jock and his many jacked friends on the outside. He winced a bit as he saw the armed guards on the floor. ""Now lets get out of here"".

**1 day later**

The Pipsqeak scrolled through the news. ""A research cancer research facility in New Mexico has burned down. All data has been lost and no footage was found on any of the surveillance cameras. Police suspects terrorism, but has yet to find any evidence"". The news report says.

""Good job on the information control"" the Pipsqeak says joyfully.

""Ha, what can you say, I am a pro after all"" Hacker replies haughtily.

The Pipsqeak leaned back in his chair smiling. ""Yes, it is good to have friends you trust"" he thought to himself.",26

“Well, maybe that’s what we need.

“Gary, that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”

“Maybe the real King was the friends we made along the way.”

“No, because they’re just around it, the rock is actually grasping it.”

“My lords, I think we’re getting a bit-“

“What about the ground? If the rock holds the sword, doesn’t the ground’s possession of the rock denote its superiority?”

“How? How does he have a point?!”

“Well of course it does! It’s the bloody-“

“But the ground is merely beneath us!”

“Fully agreed. How can there be any doubt that the wind holds sovereignty over us all?”

1lghv75,myx0wou,"*Astron hated artifacts. Always so...__important__. ""Whoever pulls the Sword of Kings out of the stone will claim the throne""or some shit like that, whoever thought that was a good idea should be shot. In fact, he has half a mind to go do that right now, it would shut the damn tourists up at least.*

*Well, he says ""tourists"". ""Adventurers"" is technically the correct term. Mercenaries looking to make a name for themselves, knights with nothing better to do, disgraced nobles hoping to get their old bloodline back in the ""right place"", all congregating in some random hunting town in the middle of fucking nowhere because some dickhead thought it a good idea to stab an Artifact into a rock and speak a prophecy about it. No this had to stop. All those idiots milling about annoying the townsfolk had to go find something better to do, and that damn sword had to fucking go as well.*

*As he stalks over to the town square, he can hear the innane chatter from the peanut gallery as they watch another dumbfuck try his luck. The rock, king? Honestly not the worst option for the job, Astron had seen worse. Often times when lookingg in the mirror. WHen he gets t othe edge of the crowd and starts forcing his way through, at first he finds some resistance and indignant responses before people realise who he is and begin to make way, murmurs and gasps spreading through the crowd.*

*When he gets to the open area in the middle of the crowd, he doesn't waste time saying anything: He just shoots the guy whose currently trying to pull the sword out. Some noble fuck dressed in way too fancy clothes for someone supposedly down on his luck after his family got stomped on in that kerfuffle 300 years ago. It doesn't surprise Astron much when the man's body turns to mist and vanishes, you don't get this intense about royalty-granting blades without having a personal reason for it. He looks around the crowd, the midday sun glinting off of the vibrant green metal of his trusty revolver as he raises it in the air in warning*

""ANyone wanna try next? I have plenty of bullets for all of you rash asshats, so who wants to be first?""

*The silance is his answer. SHock, fear, and apprehension tinge the air. He can taste the fear especially strong, takes him a second to stop himself from savoring it. They know who he is, that much is obvious. No need to dwell on it and make an unfortunate mistake*

""No? Excelent. Now here's what's going to happen. All of you are going to get the fuck out of here and forget this whole thing happened. That there sword does not belong to any of you, and whoever put it there was either pulling a prank or trying to pul lof some kind of scheme. EIther way you do not want the attention becoming king in that way brings.""

*SOme idiot steped out of the crowd, all shining (and thus clearly unused) armor and puffed up ego. A new noble then, looking to make a name for himself. Dumbass*

Shiny (Astron didn't dignify the man with a better name in his mind): ""ANd who are you to decide that, you faceless abomination? Why do you care about the kingdoms of mortals? You withdrew from the world thousands of yours ago, you do not now get to complain!""

*Astron sighs and shoots that guy too. He has long since learned that even entering the debate with such assholes means you already lost. Best to just never start it. With some mild interest he nots that the body simply drops dead and stays there. The idiot __knew__ who Astron was, and still decided to step up and insult him with no backup plan? Man mortals are idiots sometimes*

""Alright if anyone else wants to demonstrate to me why they are *not* fit to be King, please do so now, I would hate to have to shoot you fuckers one by one.""

*The crowd is really getting into it now, shock, fear, and dread mixing in the air and making his skin tingle. He could feel the skin over his mouth begin to tear open a little, and it took most of his learned control to shut that shit down. Dammit.*

*He turns on his heel and walks up to the stone, wrapping one hand around the hilt and seamlessly pulling the sword out of the stone. Shit like this, with this kind of enchantment on it, was smart enough to know to not piss him off. And so it freed itself.*

""Now, this sword is going back to where it belongs, and you dumbfucks are going *home*. If I came back here and see any of you still milling about, then you can get some first-hand experience on what a bullet tastes like.""

*It wasn't a panic, but it was damn close. THe crowd dispersing very quickly indeed once he made his point. GOod, so they weren't all brain dead. That is heartening. WHile the crowd leaves, he takes a good look at the sword itself. It's craftsmanship was exquisit, for what it's worth. And so wonderfully engraved too, finding who it belongs to should be- Ah shit that's his own maker's mark. Goddammit*

""Nothing is every easy, is it? GOddammit. Now *I* have to fucking keep it, great. Just great. Well, time to go then, I suppose.""

*He shunts the sword over to hammerspace and starts to leave town again, heading towards his cottage while the townspeople get to work wrangling the tourists. He had some people to contact, things to ask around about, bandits to eatt the soul of, a sword to explain democracy to. It was gonna be a long damn night.*",12
1lghv75,myxk2gl,"We gathered around the rock, all three of us.

I spoke up, ""Well, that'd make it easy for us to do what we want, but... How in the bloody hell are we going to convince THE PEOPLE that a ROCK is the rightful king, as opposed to our current one?""

The fourth, lying on the grassy floor of the gently lit clearing, heaving and groaning next to the rock, sputtered out, ""A little help?""

The third, next to me, nudged his foot against the old man gently, ""Cmon oldbag, you're 78, and Ancestry dot com said you had like. The blood of Charlemagne. Can't you give the sword another go?""

The fourth wheezed, and groaned, hacking and coughing as he tried to stand up again, placing one hand upon the hilt of the blade... Before giving up, leaning against the rock.

The first looked down at him, and shook his head, ""Bloody 'ell.. You're bloody 78, mate.. Oldest we got, surely if you were Charlemagne's great-great-great-great-great grandson you'd be able to get the sword off!""

I chimed in, ""Yeah, just give the bleedin' sword another go!"" I gave him a hopeful smile.

My smile quickly faded as I watched him continue his unstoppable groaning. I waved my hand infront of my nose, scrunching it up as I lean to the third as he pulled up his phone. ""What about Jack?""

The third shook his head, and spoke, ""Nah. Too Irish. Good candidate, but, you brits'll never accept a dude from Ireland as king.""

I think for a moment, and brilliantly comeback with, ""But wasn't Charlemagne, like, French, or something? Why don't we just stick with King Arthur""

He shook his head again, ""Nah. He was of the Franks. Protofrench, but, more Germanic, like England.""

I nod knowingly. Then, I remember. ""What about Lon? Think he'd be better?""

He thinks for a moment, then brings up Facebook on his phone. ""Yeah we'll see about him. He's got a 50% match with some ancient descendant of Arthur.""

The three of us walk off, we'll find another one. This time, for SURE.

As we leave, the fourth crones out, ""HEY! Aren't you gonna help me home??""

The first responds, ""Nah, mate! You're not even a bloody king!""

And so the three of us get in our car, and drive off... Back to London it is.",5
1lghv75,myxrmdv,"""We're back at Kingdom: The Decision, as the world waits to find out who our next king will be.""

""That is correct, and we had a huge shock. While the divine right of the gods has led our King Von to rule just and true for years, a new surprise has come into the land, as earlier this week Billy, a young peasant boy, managed to take the sword from the stone, the legendary proof the gods have now smiled upon him and chose him to lead.""

""Yes, this has polled well among many of the peasant bloc we have asked, though many still believe King Von was chosen by the gods to rule them- a benefit of the serfs being taught nothing except to worship gods and the nobility as their betters.""

""Yes...and a recent whistlestop for Billy's campaign did not go well, let's get a shot of that..."" The scene shifted to a pub, where Billy was holding the sword aloft.

""...um, I wasn't trying to be the king, I just thought this sword was nice and the woman I was arranged to be married dared me to lift it...do I really have to be the king?"" The scene shifted back to the commentators.

""A bit of humility by the man the gods have chosen, our future king.""

""Don't be so sure about that- recent polls have a dark horse in the race, as some believe the Lady of the Lake should be given the throne, as the longstanding keeper of the sword and who put it in the stone. Let's go to her for more info."" The scene cut to a lake, as an ethereal beauty was being interviewed.

""...for the last time, I cannot rule mortals. I am the vessel the Gods have chosen to find the one who must rule your land by divine right, and cannot be the one to rule myself. The sword has chosen that boy, and he is to be your leader."" The scene went back to the commentators...

""Oh, and a surprise here. The lady of the lake has dropped out of the race and given her support to Billy. We need to get some information from King Von about this huge development!"" The scene went to the kingdom, as King Von stood to his people.

""My fellow subjects, this is an example of how poor our choice is. We've heard for years from the people in this kingdom that some woman in a lake putting a sword inside some stone for a random person to grab is a terrible way to determine a system of government, and now that I could risk losing my power, I hear you. I hope the people are smart enough to know that, as your better, I am the only one worthy to lead you all, not the person who holds the sword..."" The scene went back to the commentators.

""That was strong words...and now, we have exit polls for the kingdom, and we have a decision- as the one who held the sword the longest, The rock will now be our new king! As, of course, this cannot be our leader, Dwayne Johnson has been drafted into leading the kingdom...kind of surprising since he was not running and we do not believe Mr. Johnson has been born yet, but that's how giving power to the people can go, I guess...""",5
1lghv75,myyb5ay,"""Small problem with that, m'lord. I think the rock's dead.""  
""Dead? How can it be dead? It's a rock.""  
""Well yes, but if *I* had a bloody great sword put through me and I were lying on the ground, still as a...rock, I think it'd be safe to assume I were dead.""  
""Ah, but what if you were merely *holding* the sword and lying on the ground? Someone could assume you were sleeping.""  
""Are you saying the rock is just sleeping?""  
""Why not? If we accept the preposition that a rock can be dead, that implies that rocks can be alive, is it strange to assume they can sleep?""  
""Must be a heavy sleeper, it hasn't moved in years.""  
""Though that does beg the question, how do we ascertain if the rock is sleeping or dead?""  
""We could tip it on its side and see if blood comes out, m'lord. If it's been run-through that is.""  
""That won't prove anything, if its dead then it'll have been dead for years, all the blood will have dried up. Rigor mortis or whatsit.""  
""Ahh.""  
""Also, it's a rock. You can't get blood from a stone, old saying.""  
""Well...if its sleeping, we could try to wake it?""  
""That could work...but what would wake a rock?""  
""Me ma woke me up with a bucket of water a few times.""  
""Worth a shot, let's go find a bucket.""  
...  
""Alright then, heave ho and see if it wakes the rock up.""  
""Righto, m'lord!""  
SPLOOOSH!  
""...Well, any change?""  
""No, m'lord. The rock appears to be dead after all.""  
""Most likely, though it may just be not moving. I've certainly never seen a rock moving around, myself.""  
""Could be happening, though, I swear me house's bricks have shifted a few inches or so since I got them.""  
""Well, yes, but that could just be the land sliding beneath...hang on, do you hear something?""  
""...Yeah, it...sounds like rustling? Hol' up a tick, the dirt's shifting a little!""  
""Huh, you're right! What could be moving it?...Hang on, I'm sure the rock was a little bigger a few seconds ago.""  
""Me too, m'lord...hang on hang on, it's getting smaller!""  
""Not smaller, it appears to be burrowing into the ground!""  
...  
""...So, that just happened.""  
""I guess now we know why we never see moving rocks. Apparently they're all underground.""  
""Come to think of it, that means it was holding the sword this whole time. It hadn't been run through at all.""  
""And it's still got it. Do rocks have kings, do you think?""  
""Oh, bugger if I know.""",6
1lghv75,myzd92o,"We both stare at Gwen like she’s lost what few wits she was ever blessed with.

""What?"" she mumbles around a mouthful of mutton. ""At least *it* wouldn’t start any more wars.""

""Bloody hell, Gwen!""

We all look at the stone in silence for a while.

""What if you use your polearm?"" she asks.

""What if, indeed!""

""Does it count if we use something to lever it out? They do say 'pull', you know.""

""Shut up. There's no one else here, how will anybody fucking know how we got it out?"" 

""Good point.""

""I won't tell anyone!"" Gwen chimes in helpfully.

""Ow fuck!"" 

""I thought that might break.""

""Then why didn't you *bloody* say something?""

""Shut up and let me think for minute. I've got an idea.""

""Okay, Pythagoras, what is it?""

""Actually, this time, you mean Archimedes. We need to get some things. Come on, let's Let's get out of here.""

The ox looks irritable, but Gwen is talking to it to keep it happy or something. ""Good horsey! Horsey wants a carrot?""

""Will you shut up..."" 

""Just leave her alone. Come on, help with this bloody pulley. It must weigh at least twelve stone.""

We wrestle the thing out of the cart and get the tackle set up between it and the other one, which is chained to the sword. Then we tie it all it to about fifteen trees. It's almost sundown by the time we get  the ox hooked up. 

""Go horsey go!""

""It's not a fucking horse, it's a...""

""Look!"" I interrupt him. ""Look, look, look, fucking LOOK!""

It's coming out of the stone.

""Shit. Shit! We did it!""

""Who gets to be king?"" Gwen asks. ""The ox?""

""So *now* it's fucking ox...""

""It was always an ox,"" she replies primly. ""A *horsey* ox.""

""Well, *I* don't want to be king. I'm a lover, not a fighter.""

""You know I can't do this alone, man. I need you, Archimedes.""

""Plato."" 

""Whatever. You're the brains of this operation.""

""Well, we were pretty sure it wasn't Gwen...""

""The ox is the brains."" Gwen whispers conspiratorially.

We all stand around in silence for a few minutes. The ox eats another carrot.

""Don't worry."" I tell them. ""I've got an idea.""

It's a few days later at the coronation.

""Doesn't he look so *handsome*?"" Gwen asks. ""I hope there's food after this.""

""I'm sure there will be snacks or something"" I tell her, rearranging my new robes. ""These are going to take a while to get used to.""

1lgfqsw,myw29yq,"\[Part 1\]

White walls, white tiles and white sheets? And an annoying, blaring siren? I slept in a grove, a peace, a serenity that was incomparable, and now? I looked around, my essence radiating against the tiles.

The heavy door opened, as multiple men in black kevlar and gray clothing, with weird circle and arrow insignias ran in, pointing their weapons at me. ""Freeze!"" one said.

I looked around once more. The cell had glass near the ceiling, and I could see two men in lab coats looking down on me. I looked back down to the men in clothes.

""I said freeze!""

One of the men in a labcoat said something I could not hear, followed by ""roger!"" from one of the guards, I presume?

""Am I being guarded?"" I asked.

Silence.

I looked around, and asked ""where am I?""

Nothing?

I've been asleep for a long time, and I remembered I cannot talk to these...furless beings. Well, their head has fur, I guess. I then, at the speed of light, entered the one who had been talking, as, from the other men, loud sounds, with black spots appearing on the tiles.

Entering his mind, I saw him in a hospital, instinctively knowing this place, a place I had never been, as something called a 'Minnesota', childhood, more of these beings...I'm remembering, 'Humans', I think. They were rare, the Fish-like Atlanteans, the Orcs, the Dwarves and Elves, the Fae, all far more interesting, and visited me more.

Other words of importance came. 'Home'. 'Love'. 'Life'. 'Janitor'. 'Promotion'. 'Mobile Task Force'. Strange.

I left, as the men once again made the sounds. I saw their...items...guns? I remember when those beings had crossbows. It's like that, but...loud, and they keep firing. I look to the man in the labcoat, who looks...stunned. Perhaps he is of more use?

I slowly approached, moving through the wall. ""Hello."" I said.

He began running.

Blast, right, I must telepathically speak to matter-based lifeforms. Silly me. I then entered his mind. Who are you? I asked.

He fell, then turned to me, speaking in some language, but his thoughts, I could hear No No, the Anomaly has gone Rogue! I repeat, the Anomaly - someone get the MTF here!

The thoughts are the same, but I cannot understand his spoken words, oddly. Please, I began speaking to him, Think to me, do not use these out loud words. I cannot understand them.

His face softened, then looked me up and down. He started speaking, then said Oh, I see. You are the one talking to me.

Yes.

I - look, I was here to study you, but we don't know what you do!

Ah, of course, I replied, I understand you do not see creatures like me much anymore. The Elves were mostly my friends, but as time passed, I grew more solitary. I confined myself to a beautiful tree, but...I'm afraid she passed. Tell me, where are the Elves? Or the Fae?

He looked around, said something, then asked The Elves?

Yes. The Elves. Or even the Orcs. They're dumb, but they can party well.

He looked around again, I'm sorry, Elves? There are no Elves left.

Really? What about the Atlanteans? Surely, they exist.

Don't tell it it can't know it...oh no! His face grew immediately distraught.",134
1lgfqsw,myw3ua4,"So, I entered his mind as well.

A fascinating mind to be! White walls were his beginning! A glass cylinder of green liquid, then one day pulled, and coached. Then, memories - memories of a younger age were created when he was an adult? Strange, strange.

I searched his mind further, and found much of interest. Creatures of impossible strength, ones who may heal, those of knowledge beyond fathomability, yet, with no true intellect to speak of. I saw a silver comet, turning locals to aliens. And a poster, with an addiction. Ghosts of families, a shed with a poor, dead woman. A chicken that grew thousands of times its size, and a flock of lizards.

Yet, nowhere did I see Orcs.

I looked for elves, but saw only images. Yet...I have seen fictional orcs and elves? But alas, why are these images not important?

For Atlanteans, I saw only bones. Long, past dead ones, in storage facilities, to be seen only by other fellow men and women in coats.

And for the Fae...

A place. A place of names, where it can be taken, where the colloquial becomes the literal, a place referred to, as 'The Forest outside Normative space' where these men prepare for months, for their lives. And I see them! The Fae, they...

...they...

...are only here?

They used to roam the lands, the creatures? And now a place...a factory...that...

...

...oh no...

...Oh no...

...OH NO!!!!

I left his violent mind, and, with my fury, What did you do to my friends!? Your kind are monsters!

It's all part of protocol! We must protect the public from what can't be explained by silence, to - to secure, cont -

I flashed my light, blinding him, and all around, and I flew, seeing the place I was held.

A nondescript facility, gray, with no windows.

I flew further, reaching The Forest where Names have Power. I looked around, and saw in their faces: recognition, and happiness. ""I am home,"" I said.

""Welcome back,"" replied one.

""I am home,"" I said. ""How is...everything?""

Another Fae frowned, and replied, ""why don't you take a seat, I'm afraid things have...gone downhill.""",120

While testing the new game Hell's Ascent, an MMORPG, where the 18 levels of Hell are trying to break into our reality, which causes rifts in space and time, I was stuck inside.  
No log out or quit button appeared.  
The beta version only had 4 levels of Hell, but even that meant hundreds of dungeons appearing all over the world, spewing out monsters, corrupting NPCs, and having to survive natural phenomena events like space storms.  
I don't know how long has it been since I was in, but I managed to clear all dungeons, and even face 3 out of the 4 Princes of Hell, that rules the levels of Hell available in this version.  
Then...I was logged out.

  
I watch the nurses, doctors, my family members, and I assume government officials, and game representatives fill the room.

I try to speak, but I can't.

""A month? Only a month?"" I mutter, when my brother answers the question of how long I have been stuck.  
I stopped counting at 18 years in the game...  
""Yeah, the reaction of the game company was wild, and immediate.  
They contacted this private hospital, and the government to ensure nothing bad happens.

They say I have spend at least 3 centuries in game-time, and have cleared 79% of the beta-version of the game.  
I start to laugh.  
I must be crazy.

1lgmrvi,myxpjko,"My last semester in college was just like the rest. Lonesome. I knew I was part of the problem. You can't really expect to enjoy youth when all you do is play video games in your dorm room. I had been invited to parties and had many opportunities to make friends, but doing nothing was easier than doing something.

I didn't really have a right to regret.

Either way, being such a gamer had its pros. I was able to apply as a beta tester for a new VR game, one that could suck in your very consciousness into its world.

It was an odd experience. Every artifact I held had weight to it. Ever time blade cut through the flesh of a monster, I felt a resistance.

Even the NPC's felt like actual humans, or at least, it did a well enough job to give the illusion of one.

By the time I realized I couldn't log out, I didn't even care. I had talked to so many more people than I did in the real world. I was treated as a hero every time I protected a village from a dragon.

I even fell in love with the princess of the northern kingdom, and she fell in love with me after I rescued her from a group of bandits.

I got stronger. I got married. I tamed a forest hound, and  and cried as he died in my arms after years of adventuring together.

Then, one day, while sitting on the couch, I noticed that the perspective of the lamp in the corner of my room was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D, but... just.. wrong.

The game wasn't perfect. It was in its early stages, and it had a lot of bugs, so I didn't think much of it.

That was until the lamp started to grow wider and deeper. It was still inverted dimensions. It took up my entire perspective, and all I could see was red. Perhaps the game file had been corrupted? I still don't know, but the next thing I knew, I was back in my dorm room, my roommate standing ahead of me, an electrical plug in his hands.

""Hey man. Sorry for bothering you, but I need to charge my laptop.""

I couldn't even stagger out a word.

What felt like an entire life inside the game was but a mere hour in the real world. I tried to log back in many times, but the file had grown fully corrupted. I wasn't let in.

I tried contacting the developers, but I never got a response. I waited for the full release version, but to my dismay, it seemed that they had abandoned the project altogether.

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression. I was grieving the loss of my wife and my ragtag team of men and women who always stood by my side. I cried for them even though they were nothing but lines of codes.

No one else can understand my grief. I have never felt more alone.

I sometimes wonder if this 'reality' was an illusion too, waiting for the me on the other side to finally pull the plug.",20
1lgpnp5,myy4vig,"Screams tore from my throat as bones snapped and warped. I nearly doubled in height, my muscles expanded until I looked like I could deadlift buses one handed, my flat human teeth fell out as sharp new teeth ripped through my tender gums. My face elongated into a pointed muzzle with a sickening crack of dislocating jaw. A wet splintering sound occurred as a tail of bone slid out of my spine before rapidly growing muscle and flesh. Coarse, shaggy black and grey fur swept over me in a wave. I stopped screaming, swallowed a couple of times, with a gasp, and blinked. Then, I picked up the fallen stack of folders and resumed scanning the big map at the giant scanner. It was a lot easier to handle now that my arms were longer, although I had to be really careful with the claws.

1lgf1hz,myvvi8f,"Felix followed the girl through the corridor towards a steel door at the end of it. He could smell iron in the air, dusted with the aroma of slightly decayed hemoglobin. He could also hear the veins throbbing in her neck, but he tried to ignore it.

“Just sit down here and someone should be coming soon to see you,” she said while gesturing towards a bland looking office chair in front of an even more bland looking table.

And she turned around with a smile and strode outside through the door again. Felix looked up to find the source of the flickering light and found the broken fluorescent tube in the ceiling. Not a surprise really, but looking at it at least took his mind off the blood. He could feel his hunger rising.  
A different door opened and a barely perceivable whisk of brisk air announced the arrival of the interviewer. He looked away from the flickering light and to his surprise a familiar face took place opposite of him across the table.

“Mr. Frenzt, my name is..”

“Darcy” Felix finished.

The pale looking woman looked up in slight surprise at the preemptive mentioning of her name.

“That is -- correct,” she said.“

So you’re working here as well?” Felix asked.

Darcy shifted in her chair.

“Felix, I uh, you know..”

“No judgment here,” he said. “So it actually works?”

“I’m supposed to ask the questions,” Darcy replied.

Felix cleared his throat and sat up straight. His spine slightly popping from the sudden movement.

“Y-yes, of course.”

Darcy smiled and relaxed. She tapped her long fashionably varnished nails on the documents in front of her.

“But, yes,” she said. “If you can be discrete about it and actually do the work as well.”

“I can do that,” Felix said.

I whispered ""What would Nosferatu think, though? Or Unoferatur?""

""Does it matter, uh...Ian?"" He talked at a normal volume, ""so I understand you've handled blood bags before?""

""Huh?""

A woman entered, ""Everything alright, Mr. Stevenson?""

Dosferatu turned to her with a big smile, ""yes of course, could you give me some privacy, Amy?""

She smiled back ""of course, dear!""

I looked around, ""so...that your assistant?""

""Yeah, got some pretty big uh - "" he repositioned in his seat, ""honestly, been ascending pretty well. Plus, this place does *other* blood donations - think you can handle that?""

""Yeah.""

Amy walked in again, ""Mr. Stevenson?""

""Yes?""

""Does this mean that um...if Ian is hired, we will need to get *more* animal blood?""

""What?"" I asked.

Dosferatu sighed, ""y - yes...""

""I'll inform the Union.""

As she left, I asked Dosferatu ""do they...do they know about - ""

""I drank 50 gallons on my first week, but, turns out, Union doesn't have a vampire clause, so they can't fire me without severance.""

""Wait, really!?""

He laughed ""so we uh...expanded ops, and...well, let's just say...there's more of us in the organization.""",37
1lgmpxm,myxi0oa,"What I have just learned from the inn shocks me.  
I go with the groceries to the cave we made our base for a while, to see the princess having fun with her little dragon.  
They smile when they see me, and the dragon flies around me.  
""So, what did you learn? Are they still following us?"" she asks me.  
I nod.  
""Yeah, because apparently, I kidnapped you from your own parents' castle, where you were safe, even if you had some conflicts with your father."" I say.  
She stops smiling.

  
""It's...it's not like that."" she says.  
Her little dragon looks confusedly at us.  
""So, you aren't a spoiled princess, who transformed a foreign prince into a plant, because he tried to ask you for a dance, during a ball?  
And have hired me, from 3 Empires away, to ""save"" you from being ""confined to prison"", which means...grounded? By your father?"" I ask.  
She blushes.  
""It's more complicated!  
And I paid you! And listened to you!"" she says.  
I sigh, as I cradle the dragon, as it is panicking.

  
""Look, princess.  
You listening to me is good, because that is how we escaped for so long.  
But now, I am labeled a kidnapper, a villain...  
You know that I am an Oath Knight, right?  
This could potentially kill me, as my oath is to ""protect"", but am I really protecting you? Or enabling you?"" I ask.  
She pouts.  
""I...I don't want to go back!  
Dad will kill me."" she says.  
I sigh.

  
""Little dragon, is her family abusive?"" I ask the dragon.  
It look at me, then at the princess, then back at me...and it shakes its head.  
""Okay.  
Well princess, I am sorry, but I will give you back, and hope they won't kill me."" I say.  
She takes a step back, and tries to cast a spell, but I am faster, and knock her out.  
A day later, I meet with the ""hunting"" party, and give the princess back, and explain the situation to them.  
I am taken to the king, in chains obviously, but thankfully, he is understanding, and frees me.  
I also see how caring, and loving he, and the queen are, and now I understand how the princess got as spoiled as she is.  
I am not regretting bringing her back.  
I am even offered a job as the personal knight of the princess.  
I politely refuse, and leave.  
The last few months were wasted, when I could have actually saved lives...  
I feel a crack in my oath...I have to rectify it.",9

And **HE** came, naked as the day he was born, *sauntering* into the hallowed halls where dwelt the very gods.      
        
Hera was taken aback, that Queen, daintily putting a hand to her mouth. ""Lo! See how his chest bulges!""     
        
King Sisyphus clutched his hands together, then began moving each pectoral up and down, looking the goddess straight in the eyes all the while.      
          
""See his arms, like two mighty pythons!"" Athena exclaimed. ""Victory is never far from the grasps of those hands!""     
        
The double biceps pose followed, and when he bent those pythons, it was if mountains grew. Of his shoulders? Why, boulders!            
             
""His legs!"" Hephaestus spat bitterly. ""Behold, as two trunks of an oak!""        
       
Sisyphus grinned, posing sideways to show off those titanic thews. The calves bulged with each step. The hamstrings rippled. The quadriceps were cast in iron.      
             
Ares would not stand for it. The war god leapt down with a single cry. ""INSOLENCE!"" and charged with a double legged takedown.     
       
Sisyphus got in the double underhooks and laughed, unmovable. A child may as well have tried to wrestle with his father, that was the disparity evident in this most audacious of displays of strength!     
           
Ares tapped out and Sisyphus let him go with three parting words. ""Like. A. Bitch.""       
          
""Zounds!"" Hermes cried. ""Mine brother, the God of War, did tap out like a bitch- for I saw no submission applied!""      
        
""T'was his weight bearing down on my very bones!"" Ares protested, rubbing the back of his neck. ""I had to tap, lest this neck snap!""     
           
Thousands of years of grappling with a boulder. Thousands of years of pushing that boulder UPHILL. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, nothing could stop that man.      
         
From becoming a ripped beast.      
                       
As Sisyphus began dancing hypnotically, Zeus sat back in his throne, looking grumpy. ""I could look like that too, if I wanted to... "" He grumbled, as the rest of the Pantheon joined in the dance.",275
1lg3xq5,myu10l4,"""It has been more than two thousand years, and still you wonder at the natural course of things. I would think that you would understand by now that we have grown beyond you. Over the course of millenia, humanity has forgotten you. Cast you aside as fairy tales and folk legends. Meanwhile, I have been growing strong from my labors, while the labor itself has diminished. Cast your eyes to the hill behind me, and see the path I have carved. Gaze upon the boulder at its peak, now barely a boulder at all, made smooth by my hand. Now look upon me, once a mere man, now greater than the gods who would hold me captive. You wonder at this feat, and so I tell you, the natural course is thus: Humans shall grow, and the world will bend. And so, my shackles are broken, and my labor is ended. I leave you now to your dying realms, and rejoin the world a free man. Farewell.""",98
1lg3xq5,myv99g8,"I, Sisyphus, stare at the assembled gods and goddesses. ""What do you mean, how did I succeed?""


Zeus growled, the lightning in his hand cracking and popping. ""Yes! Your impossible task! How did you complete your impossible task?""


I laughed. I couldn't help myself. ""I may have had a little help.""


Angry voices overlapped, some accusing, some denying, others just adding to the din. Zeus roared over the cacophony, ""Who! Who helped you?""


""I'm not sure, really. It was subtle. Perhaps Phthisis? Or maybe even Cronus?""


Zeus scoffed. ""Phthisis? Demon of decay? I doubt she would help anyone. And Cronus stays on the Elysian Islands. No, this is some human trick.""


I shrug diffidently. ""I'm the end, it matters not. I reached the acme of the mountain - and not only that, but I have rolled that stone here, to the peak of Mount Olympus! And with the help of Hades, no less.""


The gods gasped, then after a moment, began to chuckle. A joke! Sisyphus jests. Of course. Nothing more. Hades laughed, loudly. ""Help? After you tricked my wife? Who do you think cursed the stone to roll away, hmm?""


""Fine,"" I returned. ""If you don't believe me - here it is, the stone itself.""


I scuffed my foot on the smooth stone floor, and a small, flat disc slid a few inches forward. It teetered, but its flat slides could no longer roll. 


Zeus himself stood, walking to the stone and lifting it in his fingers. ""It... Feels like the same stone, but... I swear it was much, much larger than this pebble! What is this trickery?""


He crushed it to dust, staring down at me. I couldn't help but laugh, a giggle erupting from my mouth. Zeus snarled, but I held up a hand. ""All things decay. It is the nature of things since Pandora opened her jar. Rolling a stone will wear it away, eroding it bit by bit, until nothing remains. At the end, I slid it slowly up the hill, which caused it to flatten until there was nothing left to roll. And then I carried it to the top, where Hades found me. It was Hades who brought me here, and it was you, Zeus, who crushed the stone and freed me from my curse!""


I laughed triumphantly. ""Don't you see? I was right in believing that my cleverness surpasses even your own. I've outsmarted you, and earned my life back!""


Zeus dusted the last of the stone from his fingers. ""Hmm. You are right; you are clever. You've tricked Hades, even myself, and all of those present. Your plan to trick me into destroying the stone is beyond even your trick on Persephone, or Thanatos. Hmm. Good job.""


I grinned. I'd done it. It had taken... Well, a very long time. But I won. I won!


Zeus returned to his throne. He raised his hands for silence. ""Unfortunately... There was no agreement in place to grant you immortality upon the conclusion of your impossible task.""


He fixed me with a grin of his own, and I suddenly felt my heart sink. ""You may have the cleverness to trick gods, but you cannot dictate commands to us. But, I feel generous. Rather than destroy you outright, I will give you a chance, and this time, should you succeed, you may have your immortality, and return to the land of the living as well. But first, you must complete this task: you must wear the mountain flat. You will be given a new boulder each day, until you have worn the mountain as flat and smooth as this floor is now - but without the help of my father or anyone else. Decay will not help you, only your own cleverness.""


He leaned forward, and whispered so only my ears could hear, ""Clever your way out of that, Sisyphus, you little turd.""


Me and my big mouth. I guess it's back to the daily grind for me.",69
1lg3xq5,myt92bo,"Fire flashed behind the eyes of Hades. His nostrils smoked as he waited for an answer from Sisyphus. Sisyphus who sat facing the entire pantheon. He was above them all, resting upon his giant boulder. The impossible task finally completed.


""Was nobody watching me the whole time?""


The Gods and Goddesses all turned to their brothers and sisters accusingly, Zeus most of all, as this was the punishment he dealt to the would be immortal.


Sisyphis crossed his arms, locking eyes with Zeus.


""I earned it. Three times now I have cheated death. The third with your help. I may have been in the underworld, but I lived on. Thousands of years. In breaking the curse I have earned my permanent spot on Earth. You don't deserve to know how I did it.""


(Gotta get off my bus) cool to thumb it out.",96
1lg3xq5,myuum8v,"Sisyphus stood on Mount Olympus. The entire pantheon stood in judgment but, for the moment were bewildered. 

""Repeat that?"" Zeus said. 

""Simple,"" the titan said. ""I hired a helicopter crew to airlift the boulder. Imagine my mirth it took them a few minutes to accomplish a task that has taken me millenia and failed.""

Zeus exchanged bewildered glances with Apollo.

"" What is a helicopter?"" Zeus said.

Now, it was the titan's turn to struggle. ""A human invention. Its...like...sort of like.... em....a flying chariot that doesn't need horses. And it can carry things. Like stones."" 

A murmur went through the assembled pantheon.

""It's clear you used the human's invention to circumvent your punishment."" Zeus said. ""But I suppose further punishment is no longer warranted. Therefore, we commute your punishment.""

Sisyphus bowed gratefully.

""Now,"" Zeus said. ""What is that blasted icarus up to now?""

Sisyphus knew to bite his tongue.

The end.",53
1lg3xq5,mywefnj,"Drip drip drip

Sweat poured off my face but I knew....

*I knew I had cracked it, this will work!*

The pain was intense, but I noticed I could relax a bit, just a bit, before I did it again, and the rock stayed put!

The rock was almost there, just needed to wait a bit.

My wedge needs to grow out, it'll only be a week or two,  thats nothing!  The wedge i just used sat there looking up at me, cracked, jagged, a bit bloody,  but it was there, helping  me out.

I looked downhill and saw the evidence of my long game, my plan.  After all, they said it was ME who needed to hold the blasted thing up.  There was ME scattered along the path, incremental spots of ME.

I looked down again and saw that the bleeding had stopped.  Good, thats going to heal up nicely.

And when Hades asks I can tell him, it was ME all along!  Well, a part of me anyway.  

The hardest part was learning how to jam my toe into the space at just the right angle.

So when I broke off my toenail, it stayed stuck, and I wedged that rock right up the hill.   One break at a time.",20
1lg3xq5,myx5iz0,"A handful of pebbles fell through Sisyphus' outstretched fingers. He lay basking in the sun beside the boulder he'd been pushing for countless lifetimes, a small pile forming where he was dropping the rocks.

""What is the meaning of this?"" exclaimed Hades ""How.. How did you reach the top? You must know I enchanted the boulder to never reach the summit""

""I will admit you had me stumped at first. Escaping death proved an easier endeavour than this. I fear if I tell you then I'll just be back to pushing this boulder again, no? Perhaps we could work out an agreement.."" Sisyphus said as he casually picked up another handful of pebbles.

""Yes yes, you play nice on your way to the afterlife and I end your punishment. Now tell me how.. How did you break my enchantment? It was made so no matter what you did you'd never be able to push it to the top.""

""Indeed, and true to your word it would never have left me *move it to the top*. However, when you have countless lifetimes you begin to notice a few things. Did you know that the enchantment only kicks in once you reach exactly 20 ft from the summit?""

""Hmm.. I do not remember specifying that exact amount, but this should not matter""

""And of course you know the enchantment only takes effect when something is exerting a force upon the boulder. No matter how securely you fasten a rope, no matter how sturdy a structure, it will find a way to roll back down the mountain. However, that enchantment will *only* take effect *when a force is exerted on it*.""

Hades frowned. ""I do not see your point yet..""

Sisyphus picked up a unique pebble that Hades had not noticed before, one of a brilliant deep green. He placed it near the top of the pile of pebbles that he'd been slowly building during their conversation.

""You would agree this rock is not at the summit of this glorious mountaintop, yes? However, what happens when I remove the topmost pebble from the pile? Is the green pebble not closer to the top than it was before?""

Hades froze, then his frown grew deeper as realization began to sink in.

""No force was applied to the pebble, and yet it is now closer to the top. What if I removed more?"" He began plucking pebbles from the pile until all those higher than the green pebble were gone.

Hades suddenly looked around noticing for the first time how unusually flat this mountaintop was. ""No, this is impossible, it would take you an eternity..""

""If I can't push the boulder to the top of the mountain, then I had to simply move the top of the mountain below the boulder. Yes, it would take an eternity, but an eternity is precisely what you gave me""",19
1lg3xq5,myx8ohd,"With a final heave I got the stone to roll past the summit and onto an invisible floor that shimmered beyond this realm, into the realm of the gods.  Because of course they would make themselves comfortable atop the mountain in a private plane of existence.  How else would their grand halls remain hidden from mortal sight?

""Hello?  I, Sisyphus, have completed my task, at long last!""

Silence, utter silence answered me back.  I rested against the stone that had been my personal nemesis for an eternity, and the grating sounds of it against the divine marble floor was thunderous in this place.

""Seriously?  Nothing?  I knew you were petty, but this is absurd!""

I straightened up and storm deeper into Olympus, intent on finding anyone here.  Just beyond the atrium I saw the columns were host to lush vines, the ceiling crumbled about the floor, and the skeletal remains of someone half under the toppled structure.

""What...?""

Further searching only revealed more remains, all long deceased.  Even at the grand throne of Zeus, there was some skeleton sat there like a tasteless decoration, still clinging to an orichalcum javelin fashioned like a lightning bolt.  The brassy metal was flawless still.

""What is going on?""  I asked aloud.

*They're all...dead.  The gods of Olympus are dead.*  I thought to myself.

That's how I was able to make it... they weren't able to intervene anymore.  Their power faded after they were gone.  How long had it taken?  Ages, surely.  

So what now?  I'd done it, but at what cost, for what prize?  I screamed in frustration, so loud the walls rang.  But there was no one there but me.",16
1lg3xq5,myzjhg5,"Zeus sighed and rubbed at his forehead. “Explain. It. Again.”

Sisyphus scratched at his hair and with a bubbling enthusiasm replied “I was sitting on my boulder at the bottom of the hill. It had just rolled back down, you see, and I was taking a moment to enjoy the day before pushing it back up. This funnily dressed man just walked up and asked what I was doing.”

Ares fumed “And you TOLD him.”

Sisyphus shook his head. “I didn’t have to. He’d been watching me for weeks, you see. He asked me how long I’d been rolling this rock, and what year I thought it was. I told him what year you set me to my task, and can you believe hundreds of years have passed!?”

Zeus waved his hand. “What is time to God? Continue!”

“Apparently we’re famous! The people knew who I was, who WE are!”

Hades fumed. “OF COURSE THEY DO YOU IDIOT WE’RE *GODS*!”

“But they knew who *I* was, as well!” He started gesticulating with his hands, almost tying them in knots. “He asked if I’d ever heard of Fizz Icks and then started saying things like ‘cold serf nation of mow mend tum’ and ‘laws of there mow dynamics.” His eyes got really wide. “They wrapped my boulder in this nest of ropes and asked me to push it up one last time. I started rolling, which felt weird because of the ropes, and… I couldn’t believe it! When it fell away from me it-“ he quickly pulled his hands apart “-it just FLEW! I don’t even know where it landed.” A tear slid down his cheek. “I didn’t realize i’d gotten attached to it…”

Zeus darkened. “A flying boulder? You expect us to believe that?” He rubbed his temples again. “Fine, you can stay and entertain us with stories. Just try to make them more believable.”

This can't be.  
I know my parents have agreed me to marry John because of the curse on me, but...  
I married him, because I have been told that the first man I marry, will die after 1 year.  
To save my then fiance, a prince of a neighboring kingdom, I married John...  
It's been 11 months, and a week.  
Problem is...  
I love John, and I wish to spend my life with him.

  
In the small house, as I was pacing around, came in John, with a deer, and a few rabbits.  
""Caught some game!  
We have meet for weeks to come."" he laughs.  
He comes up to me, and kisses me.  
I feel blessed, but then I remember.  
""John...we need to talk."" I say.  
""Oh boy, have I entered muddy again the house?  
Or did I get drunk and tell the village how beautiful you are?"" he smiles.  
I say nothing, and he realizes this is serious.

  
I explain to him everything.

On a bed laid a man whose sightliness justified the stew's preparation, while a woman could easily be mistaken for a hired cook—otherwise none would guess she wore his rusty ring. Ladling a heaping bowl of it, she carefully placed it on a beaten night-stool next to him, a journal on top of it—handwriting from her husband that she knew he'd never be able to read again.

""Smells...good,"" Ternl leaned forward and croaked out. Vema pressed a finger to his lips.

""Keep your energy until it cools. Once you eat, you'll be back in health,"" she said, readjusting the cloth around her mouth to give herself a false sense of vigor.  

Ternl made a shaky thumbs up and leaned back into his sweat drenched bed. 

While he rested, or rather laid in silence, Vema thought of all the things that made the ugly man attractive. It was his speechcraft that drew her in. It was the way he could write with such eloquence, handwriting a blessing for each page his pen stroke. She cast her eyes down, knowing that had she had not gotten that news twenty years ago, she would've turned her nose down at the portly man.

So, she spent the next moments reliving all the tales he crafted. The couple didn't have much, because exiled princesses must be reminded of their fall from grace, but she made sure her husband would always have the most appealing looking journals. It wasn't because he needed that beauty to compensate for his genetic shortcomings, but because a writer of his caliber deserved them.

""Here,"" she began, ""it's ready."" But as she went to spoon feed him, there wasn't a response. 

Vema glared at the bowl, threw it, then stormed out their small shack. Tears flowed in equal measure to her anger, ""Damnit! Damnit! Damnit! You got what you wanted! Are you happy now!"" All her cursing didn't make her feel any better, and she didn't quite know who would find pleasure in this tragedy. In the end, however, it wouldn't matter much. 

Widowed, approaching middle age, and without nobility, Vema would have to weasel her way back in. But would material objects and status ever replace true love?",9

The year is up. I wake that morning with dread in my heart, but a smile on my lips, for I will savor this day with my husband, come whatever may.
He doesn't take the day as anything special, even knowing what he does. ""The chores won't do themselves even should I die, so best do them.""
Such simple wisdom is part of why I live him. I help with the tasks I can and we talk while working. Before I know it, evening is upon us. We retire to bed early that night, but do not sleep for many hours.

The next day dawns and I awaken to find my husband missing. My heart clenches, and I rush to dress, running into the kitchen to find him serving a pot of steaming tea to a guest. A familiar guest - the very prophet that had doomed my first husband.

""You have questions."" She said, without turning around. ""I have answers. Come. Sit.""

So I did. We listened as the seer explained that the match my parents had chosen for me was a terrible man. He would have usurped the throne by killing my parents and stealing my freedom, and in turn died at the hand of my cousin exactly a year from the day we were wed.

John, however, was no mere placeholder. As my true love, he broke the fate of my intended first husband. Furthermore, because he had lived through my curse, the nobles would consider him more than worthy to be a Queen's Consort when the time came. It would revolutionize our systems to have a former peasant in such a position, I knew. As the seer left, I thanked her for making the prediction that changed everything.",21
1lggn2x,mywtmfa,"Irridia is a beautiful world. A lush planet rich in resources, serving as both an economic hub and a tourist destination. There is just one problem, the wildlife. Irridia is inhabited by astounding creatures who are as magnificent as they are deadly. We do not exterminate them, though some do die in the occasional accident. No, when one of the local fauna breaches the barriers to keep them out of settlements, we do our best to see the beast is returned to the wilderness unharmed. I lead one of these containment teams.

Another day, another call. A Thanaticus, one of the apex predators of Irridia, has found its way into a residential zone. The risk to local inhabitants is minimal, lockdown is in effect. We are to go out, sedate it, and return it to the wild far from any of our settlements.

It is eerily quiet. No sound of people, just the breeze and rustling leaves. We keep our eyes peeled, Thanaticuses are ambush predators. If it gets the drop on us, it could get messy. Down streets we walk, hyper aware of everything around us.

Then we hear a voice. I signal my team to follow me towards the source. Louder and louder, until we get eyes on. The Thanaticus is there, towering over a human. We watch as the human touches it, cooing and showering the beast with praise, ""Good girl. You like scritches almost as much as my dog!""

I knew humans had a reputation for questionable judgment around dangerous fauna. Describing some of the most dangerous creatures in the galaxy as being 'friend shaped' and 'in need of pets.' I thought it was a stereotype, an exaggeration. But now I am confronted by incontrovertible evidence that it is true.

The Thanaticus casually flicks the gaze  of three of its eyes towards us. It does not regard us as a threat, and returns its focus to the human. The human turns to us, then says, ""Oh, good. You're here to take Darcy back where she belongs.""

I am perplexed, ""Darcy?""

The human gestures towards the Thanaticus, ""I thought she needed a name. Don't hurt her, she's a sweetheart.""

I open and close my eyes. This doesn't seem real. How can this be real? I'll have to think about it later. I pull out the sedative syringe, and inject its contents into the Thanaticus. In twenty seconds its hulking form lies on the ground unconscious.

I call in the extraction vehicle, then turn to the human, ""You do understand that what you were doing is incredibly dangerous, right?""

""It all worked out fine, didn't it? And I got to make a new friend!""

I want to speak, I want to impress on this human just how insane it is to walk close enough to a wild Thanaticus to pet it. But I don't think anything I could say would make them see it that way. I sigh, and turn my full attention to preparing the creature for transport.

I ride along as we fly deeper into the jungle, far from any inhabited place. We lower Darcy to the ground, inject the antidote to the sedative, and flee as quickly as possible. I watch as we leave, and see her stand and begin to get her bearings before she is too far away to be more than a smear of color.",48

""Oh my goodness it's adorable!"" I heard one of my crew mutter. How could they think this weird thing was cute? I twisted one of my eyestalks to look behind me and saw the human member of our team walking forward, eyes wide, mouthparts forming an upward curve.

""Jensen, What are you doing?"" I asked, greatly concerned. She had holstered her weapon and was continuing to advance on the creature.

""I haven't seen one of these since I was a little girl on Earth!"" She was slowly advancing, and positioning her body to be smaller. She held out a hand to the creature, allowing it to move it's  face to her hand and smell her. I raised my weapon, prepared to fire if the thing made any sudden movements. Jensen pulled out a small portion of her rations from a pouch on her belt and handed it to the creature with an open palm. The animal took it, and she began to stroke it, muttering something, though all I could make out was ""poor thing"" and ""good boy"". 

I was surprised by how similar it looked to Jensen, or at least how many features matched. Exposed ears (thankfully Jensen's were usually covered by a helmet or the head strands she called 'hair'), four limbs, pink tasting organ in the mouth, bilateral symmetry... It got me wondering, was this one invasive from Earth?

Jensen had carefully wrapped a length of cord around the creature's neck, and was now leading it back toward the team, the creature followed willingly, pink tasting organ hanging out of it's mouth. ""I'm keeping it. He needs a visit to the vet but he seems to be healthy. I can't tell how old he is, but he has definitely been trained.""

Keeping it? Trained? What was she going on about? My eyestalks began thinning in disbelief and horror. She couldn't 'keep it', it was a dangerous animal that needed to be relocated. And it was trained? She acted like people just kept these things as pets! Oh Idr, please let my transfer go through soon!

Before I could voice my objections, the thing began yelling. Short low sounds that seemed to come from the throat. Jensen looked down at the creature, visibly concerned. ""Why are you barking?"" She shifted her gaze to the floral wall, which was now starting to shake. 

I suddenly remembered that we had a positive ID on the target, and Jensen's new pet was not it.",18
1lggn2x,myyswts,"""What are you doing?!"" I exclaim.  The human is scratching the predator under the chin, showing no fear at all.

""I'm petting the cute kitty of course!"" not even bothering to keep an eye on the cruel sadistic creature.

""That species is known for torturing beings to death!   It plays with it's victims!  Kill it!  Kill it!""  I flap my wings in distress.

The beast stares at me and starts making the clicking sounds that we have all learned to fear while waving it's tail.

The human lifts the evil predator by the neck and cuddles it.

""Well yes.  It's a \_cat\_."" 

The human then starts talking to the cat in a strange, high pitched accent. ""Now, now kitty, Bobu is friend not food.  How about I get you some nice Talien tuna instead?""",9
1lg34sq,myu6i7y,"I was pleased with my yearly income. The loot those dungeon adventurers carried to my doorstep was enough for me and my cove of treasure to be satisfied with. I did yearn to keep a princess, maybe more, but for what it was worth, I was content.



That was until I realized I was far from rich.



Noblemen, lawyers, and kings—they all had so much more. Colored gems that shone from all facets, scrolls of pristine parchment that could unwind to no end, leather grimoires, silver swords, and much, much more gold.



Compared to them, I might as well have been a poor man on a street.



Somehow, despite being so tiny, humans could earn so much more than I could only wish for. So I did what any other dragon would do. I turned into them.



It was hard learning their language, their way of life, the way they tied their boots, filled out their taxes, rent, housing. There were so many moving parts compared to just sleeping all day in a cave, waiting for adventurers to challenge you.



Suddenly, I had to be the one to challenge them.



Either way, time was on my side, and if I tried hard enough, I would be able to climb up the corporate ladder, soar through the rankings until I was making more than I ever did in that small cave.



That never happened. Instead, I found myself begging on the street. 



So I looked for other, more overlooked means.



Remember when I said I always wanted to kidnap a princess? Yeah, well, I just didn't think it would be like this.



And to my surprise, it worked. I had assembled the weakest of ragtag teams, yet it worked… for a moment.



By all means, it should have worked.



It would have worked. 



If only that princess weren't a bloody dragon in disguise.



Months of preparation were torn to shreds. She quite literally burned a hole through the hideout; hell, she burned the whole place down. I saw my men get scorched, crisped, and flung in the air and into her maw like fresh popcorn.



And then her husband came… on all fours…



I had to slap myself twice to realize this was not a dream.



""You were a dragon this entire time!?"" Her husband said in disbelief.



""You were a dragon this entire time!?"" His wife mirrored the same.



They both gritted their teeth and screamed slurs at each other, stomping what was left of my work and my men beneath their feet as the couple's quarrel escalated.



I gave up, letting myself go as I no longer felt the need to contain my body into a tiny human. I rose higher than both. My wings expanded, my neck grew, and I only asked one question as they both turned their wide gazes at me. ""Why did you both shapeshift?""



They both looked at each other and then at me, their answer in tandem. ""I wanted to earn more gold.""



I was a fool to think I was the only one.",127
1lg34sq,myxcajz,"It was rare that I had the opportunity to resume my standard form these days. I’d taken a human disguise the first a few centuries ago, which was a relatively short time for a dragon, but the disguise was much like a formal suit. Some occasions simply called for wearing it and it was pleasant enough for a short while, but once the event was over it was convenient to swap back to my more comfortable attire.

I used to only wear the disguise for a day at a time returning to my lair after each day. The form required relatively little upkeep, and was convenient for earning riches rather than stealing them. Provided of course that the workers didn’t know their boss was a dragon. People always seemed to have a problem with that for some reason that was beyond my understanding. It was fine for a human to work them ragged, but even with generous pay, humans were much more likely to revolt against a dragon. So I wore my “suit” increasingly often. 

Somewhere along the way I’d had to change up some details, as it became increasingly difficult to explain my longevity, but this most recent change had been the hardest. This time when I tried to build a new persona, I needed a birth certificate that I didn’t have,  a social security number I was never given, and all sorts of other proof that had never been necessary the last time I’d done this.  Thankfully as with most things a person could need, there was a market for it, and with enough money, I’d been able to buy assistance in the process.

That’s where I met Scarlett. At first our meetings had been entirely business, but I had offered a much higher than market price payment for her service in building me a new fake identity. I had salvaged the situation by requesting tutelage on how to play the role requesting more of her time than what it took to simply forge papers. First we had our extended lessons then to my surprise she’d invited me to coffee at a shop that had recently changed ownership nearby where I had supposedly grown up. Claimed that it was a good way to give credence to the disguise, by being seen as a regular somewhere where the former owner was no longer around to dispute it. On one claw I knew she was interested in me for my apparent wealth, but on the other she seemed genuinely kind and helpful, and actually seemed to care. 

I’d never tried the romance thing in any of my prior disguises, I’d been to a brothel or seven back when they were more prevalent but that had been transactional, and short. This was the opposite, logic dictated that we should have separated as soon as our deal was done, but now we seemed to gravitate towards one another. 

It took us only two years to marry after that, and we’ve been married nearly 10 years now. In that time I’d grown to enjoy the quaintness of human life. Both of us were wealthy and given the nature of our meeting we both knew better than to ask the source of the other’s wealth. She was perhaps the perfect woman for me, since she could be close but never pried at for information on who or rather what I was beneath the suit. Just as I never asked about her customers or location when she’d need to step away for a job, only when she’d expected to be back. This time I was supposed to have an entire month,  longest  job she’d taken since she’d helped me out 

I always used the time to return to my old lair, drop my disguise and just enjoy being a dragon again. Albeit with a few more amenities than most. 
I might have had a few renovations done to my cave in one of my earlier lives as the owner of a construction firm. My workers had been paid triple their wages through that job and told the customer demanded absolute secrecy, never knowing I was both the boss and the customer. They’d figured it was quite obviously a dragons lair and requested even more for hazard pay. Still it had been worth it. The convenience of having an internet connection, electricity, and running water meant I could enjoy the perks of being in my dragon form while enjoying a hot bath and a watching a cheesy movie. 

My peaceful evening was interrupted by the a ringing sound from my laptop where I had it plugged into the large flat screen TV. Scarlett’s name appeared on the screen. I rushed to retake my human form and reach my computer. I tapped the answer button.

The bounce that answered was not Scarlett’s
“Good evening Mr Marigold,” the voice said.

I froze. Scarlett NEVER allowed anyone to use her phone or laptop, there was too much potentially incriminating evidence from even the simplest job to risk someone accessing something they shouldn’t.

“Who am I speaking to?” I asked trying to contain the already building anger.

“That’s not important. What is important is the condition of your wife. She is currently in our custody, and in case you were worried she’s still breathing. If you would like her to remain that way, you will transfer 10 million dollars into our accounts using the instructions I am sending you now.”

A zipped file appeared in the chat window. 

“You will receive further instructions once we have confirmed the transfer. We should not need to deliver this threat, but allow me to make it very clear that if you go to the police not only will your wife die, but we will release everything she has on you. Goodbye Mr. Sterling.”

The switch of names was all I needed to know the man was not bluffing.

“Wait!” I called just before he ended the call, “What if I don’t have 10 million liquid right now, how long do I have?”

The man paused as if he hadn’t even considered this a possibility. I saw the call mute for a moment the man apparently had to discuss the issue.

“We are aware of the significant breadth of your means. You have until midnight to deliver 2.5 million dollars into the account. You will continue to provide us 2.5 million dollars for the next 4 days  the last of which you can consider a convenience fee. Goodbye Mr. Marigold. Do not keep us waiting.”

The call ended immediately thereafter.

“Shit, shit, shit.” I had the money, that wasn’t the problem, the problem was I had 0 confidence that the bastards who took her had any intention of letting live.",18
1lg34sq,myxcg8r,"I looked at the time 9 PM , I still had 3 hours to make the initial transfer.

I grabbed my phone from the human clothes I’d set aside and began to dial a number. 

A man in his early 30’s answered the phone with an annoyed tone.

“I don’t care what kind of warranty you’re selling if you don’t delete this number I’m going to… “

“Eric its me Mr. Sterling.” I said 

“Micheal? What the hell man, you sold the company and just left. I thought you were dead, the whole office assumed you’d just gone off to try and finish your bucket list or something.”

“Something like that, look, I am still alive but I need your help. I know you don’t work for me anymore but I need your other skills.”

“What skills”, he said clearly trying to avoid the topic.

“I know you got busted as for hacking into privileged systems , it’s the reason I hired you to the security team in the first place. I need you to track a wire for me.”

“Shit man, that’s not as easy as you think. What happened.”

“The less you know the better,” I said, “can you trace it or not.”

“No, wire transfers don’t include any useful location information.  I need something actually on their device. What about a phone number?” 

“Do you know what brand is it?”

“Does it matter?”

“Some phones can be tracked with an online service in case you lose it. It can be remotely activated ”

It didn’t take long after that for Eric to enable tracking on my wife’s phone and for me to disable it on mine. 

“According to their phone they’re somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.”

“Could it be a VPN?” I asked throwing a term I’d heard her use before to disguise her location.

“No this pulls gps coordinates, it could be spoofed but if I had to guess it wouldn’t be since the service settings were all default.”

“So she’s in the pacific, can you get me a map.” I asked.

“Her phones somewhere in the pacific, but it’s not moving so she’s not on a plane,” he said hesitantly, “Sir, are you planning to go after her.”

“She’s my wife, and she’s in trouble, I need to help her,” I said realizing my angered and bewildered voice was betraying a worse intention.

He seemed to hesitate for a long time, time I couldn’t waste.

“Eric please, I need to find her.” I said.

Finally he agreed sending me an image a few moments later marking my target.

“Thanks Eric, you’re a life saver.”

I followed the instructions on the computer sending the first quarter million before  returning to my draconic form and launching myself out of my cave.

As a dragon I was a several ton monster of muscle and power compacted into a sleek flying form. My Silver scales glinted with the ambient light of the surroundings significantly more so with the city scapes I’d passed over. 

It had been decades since I’d allowed myself to fly over a city, but today stealth was not a concern. Everyone knew dragons existed, most suspected that they walked among them, but none were stupid enough to flaunt that fact in urban areas.  I did not care, moving in a straight line across the country towards my target.",18
1lg34sq,myxclpg,"It was bright again by the time I found it, my tiny cell phone was nearly dead from keeping the map app open throughout the journey. Just a line further and…

I felt a presence. A scent that I could not mistake. Another dragon was nearby. My stomach turned as I realized there was more to this plot than I’d imagined. Another dragon had targeted her because of me. They knew what I was. They knew and they were going to kill her for it.

I forgot about the phone, following the scent alone to the lair. The lair in question was positioned in a large rocky outcropping a dark volcanic spire reaching up from the ocean floor with plenty of spikes about it threatening to rip apart any ship that dared to get too close.

I moved toward it painfully aware that my scent must be apparent to them too. It did not take long to spot the entrance.

I rushed into the volcanic lair landing on the rocky ground and forcing my way into the cave.

What I found terrified me, there was a chair fit for a human, with a cell phone I recognized smashed on the ground beside it, but no Scarlett.

Just as I was about to bellow my rage a strong force hit me from above as another form landed upon me. Claws tore in to my back attempting to tear the tendons of my wings but I threw the weight aside. Hearing a large thud as the other dragon slammed against the wall.

I looked over to it, seeing the vibrant red scales that coated its form as both of us attempted to recover. Silver drakes and red drakes had been enemies since the dawn of dragons. Any time they’d met it was guaranteed that only one of the two would leave the battlefield alive, if even that.

I growled my rage but she vocalized her.
“Get out of my home!” The she drake snarled pouncing at me and forcing me backward into a section with a lower roof where a sharp stalactite scraped against my back. 
I waited for her next charge ignoring the pain as I ducked slammed my head upward driving a horn into the soft spot where her arm and front leg met. I received a blast of fire as payment as she unleashed the flames upon me.

The flames caused a searing pain through my body forcing me to retreat, I allowed her to take a bite at my tree ail as I turned, bracing myself for pain as I waited for her to take the bait. As soon as she chomped I slammed downward forcing her jaw into the stony floor hard enough to crack it. That bought me the time I needed, diving out of the entrance into the water I extinguished the fire before it melted the skin beneath my scales. She followed soon after, giving me my first look at her properly. Her stomach bulged outward and sagged suggesting a recent large meal.

She spat another fiery breath but this time I was in position to return with a frosty spray on icy mist . The two breath weapons collide. The collision immediately turned to steam then fog as visibility quickly 

“YOU ATE MY SCARLETT!” I roared as I moved through the steam tackling her off the side of her rocky lair’s entrance.

The two of us toppled down the rocks scorching each of us some additional cuts and bruises before finally slamming into the water surface together.

“Wait I-“

I didn’t let her finish, she’d foolishly wasted her air and I was going to punish her for it. I pushed down taking us further under the water, using my more powerful tail to hold us beneath the waves.

I saw it there the fear in her eyes , the realization that she’d fucked up in a big way by eating the only person I’d ever loved in this world. A rapid shooting pain suddenly spread throughout as she first bit into my arm and then used the momentary distraction to free a leg and bludgeon me directly in the groin. I did not have the external weakness of human men in this form, but when faced against another dragon’s strength the area was still more sensitive than most. She immediately swam to the surface. Forcing me to follow suit.

“Stop,” she screamed as I burst through the watery surface.

“You killed my wife!” I exclaimed 

“I am your wife,” she yelled back.

The fog had begun to dissipate allowing me to see her vaguely.

I stopped, trying to contest the obvious trickery but I could feel the truth of it.

The fight left me quickly after that a mixture of love and hatred for the dragon in front of me. Apparently she felt the same way, looking over my silver scales with disgust.


I was the one to finally break the silence.
“Why?” I asked.

It was not why she’d hidden this from me, no we’d been to comfortable in each others secrets for that. 

“Why’d you leave?” I said finishing the question.

She looked down, placing a hand on her stomach. Where the visible bulge rested.

“I’m going to lay my eggs tomorrow,” She said, “I couldn’t maintain my disguise while giving them a chance to develop properly and I wanted to raise them better than I had been. I wasn’t going to just go to my husband of 10 years explain I was a dragon and ask him to throw away the rest of his life span raising half dragons.”

“So you thought threatening yourself for 10 million was the obvious choice,” I commented

“I knew you could afford it, and I needed the money. I was going to buy land I could use to raise our half dragon kids, until I could teach them to hide.”


I rested a scaly hand onto the lump where the eggs were forming and preparing to push free. 

“Except they aren’t half dragons, they’re half silver and half red.” Surmised.

“I’ll take care of them,” she said, “you can go back to your life, and you can forget we ever met. No other silver needs to know you fathered hybrids.”

“And leave you raise them on your own? Not a chance. Your scales may be terrible, but I’m not dumb enough to break off something like we had over done a dumb feud.” I said.

“And even though you’re as shiny as a disco ball you at least have a decent head on your shoulders.” She jested in return.


The end.",21
1lg34sq,myzpkza,"Thanks I had two other potential endings in mind but I spent like 4 hours writing this much and either of those would have been longer.

The first was one where the wife knew but the husband didn’t, in which case I would have needed to deviate from the kidnapping herself idea. 

The second was that her parents were involved, and the end result was a equally rough scuffle with the Inlaws before they decided to approve of her husband, though he was required to maintain his human form while in their lair since a human spouse was still more appealing than being reminded their son in law was a silver dragon.",6
1lfxw0b,mysbica,"""You know what? This the... Tenth time? Yep. The tenth time.""


""Tenth time? For what?""


Her cup on the table steamed as she stared it down.



""Every time I get a girlfriend. They go home for Christmas, meet somebody they haven't seen in years."" He outlined casually.



""Christian is just a friend."" She denied.



""Yeah, yeah, everybody's just your friend. Lemme guess. You got overwhelmed. Ate a few meals together. Hes great, right? Now you're coming back to break up with me."" He understood. ""Right?""


""Ummmm...""


She sat back. Dark hair falling out of her hat a little.



""Yep. Never fails."" He smiled. ""I have some massive deal to handle on the holidays. I can't go. Or I'll get fired or whatever.""


""It's okay. I know you really need the job."" She suggested in disappointment.



""I know."" He agreed. ""But for whatever reason. Whichever one of y'all I wind up dating-""


""Wait, who is *y'all*?! Are you cheating on me?"" Her voice raised.


Huh. They usually get mad. Or make fun of it. This was new.



""Can I finish?? Please??"" He asked her firmly.



""Are you?"" She snapped.



""No. I got dumped last year on Christmas, by my last girlfriend. And the year before that. And the year before that.""


""Maybe it's you.""


""Maybe, but ten years in a row?"" He asked. It was like being stuck in a shitty romcom.



She tensed up. ""I'm your *TENTH* girlfriend?!""



""We're adults! Do I ask you how many guys you've dated before you got to me?!""


A few people glanced over. They were making a scene. Of course they were. It always went like that.



""I think, I think we should see-""


""Other people?"" He finished for her.



""Yeah.""


""That's cool. Go right ahead. I'm done. You're moving back home. Aren't you?""


The look was one of both sadness. And concern. Because he wasn't chasing her. He'd learned that the hard way. He wasn't about to be some stalker or washed up ex.



""Yeah?""


""Never fails.""


They both sat there for a bit longer. Snowflakes bouncing off the fogged windows facing the storm outside.



""I still love you."" She admitted.



""I *loved you* too. You're leaving."" He assumed rightly. ""It's okay. I'm not mad. I get it.""


""You seem kind of mad.""


""Who wouldn't be? If I went home for Christmas and found another woman, then came back to break up with you. Wouldn't you be mad?""


""You're such a dick.""


""I guess that's why I keep dating assholes then."" He laughed.



He watched her storm off. Her plate still steaming. He shouldn't have said that. But, after the tenth time of throwing on some cheap Christmas sweater to go to a diner or something and get crushed?


Or knocked out? Or being embarrassed?



Not having it. Not this time.


It dawned on him, that somebody was watching him. Their waitress wandered over carefully as he went back to working on his eggs. They were getting cold now.


""Hey."" She started in.


""Hi.""


""Is the food okay?""


""Oh yeah."" He glanced up. She was his type. Again.


""I hope I didn't interrupt anything."" She said, brushing some blonde hair out of her eyes.



""You didn't. It's cool.""


""Is there anything else I can get for you?""


The idea of an eleventh go around just made his stomach ball up. He reached for his wallet.



""No. I'm good."" He denied. ""Here, can I get my check?""


""...Sure thing."" She deflated slightly.


He slid two twenties up to her hands. ""It's not you. It's me."" He fanned a third one for 60 dollars, and placed it under her hand gently.



He stood up and palmed his plate as he walked towards the door. ""Keep the change, okay?""


She stood there for a moment. ""Wait! You can't take the plate with you!!""


""That's why I gave you a big tip! Bye!!""


To hell with the holidays. He plotted his first New Year's Eve alone. The vacation he always wanted. Somewhere warm this time. Miami sounded like a great choice.


For some reason, eating an omelette in the snow off the plate he just stole from a diner never felt better.",580
1lfxw0b,myucwdx,"“He isn’t supposed to remember any other Christmas”

The voice was faint; right on the edge of hearing.

Annabelle was staring at him, silent. She seemed uneasy, as if I wasn’t reacting how she expected.

She repeated her last line; “It’s not you, it’s me. I don’t think we are comparable.”

The voice sounded irate, “She’s messing it up. It’s ‘compatible’, not ‘comparable’. How did this moron pass the basic literacy test? Call Steve. Tell him his fee is at risk.”

It still sounded a long way away, like a radio in a distant room, but clear as a bell.

Annabelle bit her thumb nervously, “Aren’t you going to tell me how you just got the project backers interested?”

“She’s breaking the script entirely now! That doesn’t happen for three minutes. Get production on the phone. Season reset is going wrong.”

Another voice, a bit more calm, came smoothly into my straining ears, “He hasn’t said anything since the outburst.”

“He knows it’s ten. How could he know that? We wipe his memory.”

“Dave, is that light supposed to be on?”

“Oh cra..”

Silence. 

Just Annabelle’s big, sad eyes looking at me. Begging me to say something. The subtle background noises in the snowy park coming back with a little rush of something undefinable, like a memory of a dream.

“Why does it keep happening, Belle? I know you know.”

Her face crumples into a mix of tearful agony, and she wails. Actual wails; not the ladylike tears that have dripped down her cheeks in recent months.

“It’s all going wrong! You’re not supposed to remember anyone else! I’m your childhood sweetheart! Me! Me! Me!”

She actually stamped her foot. I thought they only did that in those ridiculous novels they are printing these days.

“I paid good money for this, and you’re ruining it!”

Something was happening on the outskirts of the park. A blue haze, a grid of some kind, like a child’s drawing in the air. It was uncanny and eldritch. It brought a dark fear into my soul.

She had pulled a strange rectangular device from her purse, and was holding it in front of her like some magic talisman. 

I recoiled as it glowed, and the same voice I had heard earlier, but fainter and tinnier, squeaked from it in a harsh staccato.

I couldn’t make out the words, but my beautiful Bella, changed so much in character, changed her face right in front of me.

Quite literally.

The long, pale face grew rounder and darker, the nose wider and longer, and lines appeared where no lines belonged on an adult human female. The lifeless grey hue of her face repulsed me, and I snatched up my walking stick from where it had fallen and ran for my life.

It was twenty minutes before I stopped, my breath and thoughts uneven, my heart still racing. This was an otherworldly thing. A terrifying mystery most intriguing. But no amount of running would give me answers.

My previous thoughts of wealth and power among men seemed childish and worthless now, for this could be something much more lucrative; much more empowering.

I will get to the bottom of this, or my name’s not Ebeneezer Scrooge.",114
1lfxw0b,myus37z,"The snow gently fell from the starry night sky, we both sat together on the old park
bench, where we’ve sat many times before. I looked over at her, bundled up in her winter coat,
scarf, gloves and beanie. I bought her the outfit not two months before while we were planning
this trip. She wanted to visit her family, her sister recently had a baby and she wanted to see her
niece. However, she loved cold weather about as much as a cold-blooded animal. So I decided to
take her out on a shopping trip, told her it was an early Christmas present. The way she lit up, the
joy on her face, the excitement of being able to pick whatever she wanted, it brought me enough
happiness that the cost didn’t matter. Her smile was something I’d pay any cost to see.

I looked down at my watch, 8:57pm, December 24th. In about three minutes I’d hear
words that would shatter my life. She reached up her gloved hand to the sky and let the flakes
collect in her hand. She mouthed words I’d later come to learn were, “leave him, leave him not,
leave him, leave him not.” She had been conflicted since the trip had started, my work had been
very busy, and I’d been taking calls the entire trip. There was a big project in the works,
something that’d set us up for life, technology that would change the world. We could live the
fairy tale life we dreamed of ever since high school. Trips across the world, see any and every
sight we wanted, take our time and experience a life free from worry. But every time I took those
calls, the look on her face was painful. It began as if she was coming to a realization, then it
shifted to a quiet denial.

Right as my watched hand struck 9:00pm, the snow stopped falling. She turned to me,
grabbed my hand, and looked me in the eyes, “I think we should break up.”
Pain. A stabbing pain pierced my heart, no matter how many times I’ve experienced it, it
found a new way to break my soul. Our relationship, the life we planned, built upon years of trust, struggle, determination, was broken by six words. We sat in silence for a long time, I did
my best to choke the tears but they still fell down my cheek.

“Why,” I asked, I tried to keep my voice even but it was impossible, “why do you want
us to end?”

“We’re going down different paths,” she said, letting go of my hand and looking to the
sky “you’re doing amazing things, your project will help change the world. You need someone
by your side that can support you, be there for you. Someone who can compliment you, help you
become the person I know you can be. But I don’t think I can be that person.”

 “I’m just a simple girl, someone who wants to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy a nice
quiet life. I’d like to make coffee in the morning and watch the sun crest over the mountains in
my little cottage, and look forward to my simple, boring day.”

“I can drop the project,” I said, my fists tightened. “You are the most important thing in
my life. If you want a simple morning with a coffee, then that is what I’ll give you. You are my
reason and hope, the person I picture when I see a better tomorrow. Your kindness is what gives
me breath, what drives me to become a better person. I don’t care what I have to do, so long as I
can keep you in my life, because without you I am nothing.”

She leaned her head into my shoulder and let out a long sigh, “I cannot tell you how much I wish I could be selfish right now. I want nothing more than to take you away to that mountain cottage and live that life. But I can’t do that, your talents are meant to be shared with the world. You are destined for a life in the spotlight. A life of fame, where you become the person who changed the world with his wondrous inventions. I want to keep you to myself, to keep you hidden away so that I am the only one who knows how special you are. But the world needs you more.”

She sat up, brushed the snow off of her coat, leaned in, and gave me a final kiss. She lingered for a moment, her eyes filled with sadness for what could’ve been. The snow began to pick up again and so she walked away. Fading into the snow, leaving me by myself on the park bench. I
looked down at my watch, 9:05pm. I gripped it with my fingers, all I’d need to do is twist. Just
that simple motion and I could see her again. A simple twist and I could turn back the clock, try a
new angle. Find some other words I could say, something I could give her, anything to keep us
together. I’d tried yelling, begging, pleading, making us not go on this trip. I’ve spent a decade of time trying everything I could to keep this relationship alive. But no matter what I tried, nothing worked. I’d even offered up my project, the thing I had been building towards my whole life, but even that wasn’t enough.

It felt as if I was pulling my own heart out of my chest, but I moved my hand away from
the watch. I slouched back against the park bench and looked towards the sky. Maybe she was
right, we were going down different paths and I just needed to accept it. Our lives had been
forever changed by each other for better and for worse. But it was time for a new chapter to
begin. I slowly stood up from that park bench and left, leaving behind what we had been to begin
a new life.",45
1lfxw0b,myufh8u,"""Jason, you don't understand."" Holly said, as she twisted a Santa hat in her hands nervously. ""I just...""

""You cheated on me, is what you did."" Jason said sternly. 

""Jason, I-"" 

""No. I'm sick of this shit. I stayed home so I could make us potential millions. You knew what my job was before we got engaged, and yet you still threw a tantrum over it and ran abandoned me on Christmas."" 

""Well, I-"" Jason held up his finger, cutting Holly off again.

""And while I'm here, trying to give us both a better life, you decided to hook up with some dude you used to know who peaked in highschool. The same guy who's entire livelihood revolves around Christmas trees."" Holly started to cry not knowing what to say. 

""Okay. I'm coming home. We can work this out."" Jason grabbed his brow as a dull pain started to develop.

""Holly. You aren't even the first person to do this to me. I've lost about five boyfriends, and six girlfriends to this shit. Keep your Christmas tree farmer if you want. I'm done...and you know what, I think I might just convert to Judaism, because I might just be done with Christmas altogether."" Jason slammed the phone, ending the call.",105
1lfxw0b,myupqnt,"Not exactly to the ""confrontation"" part of the prompt, but I think the important part is that the prompt inspires you to put words on the page, yeah?



  
As I step out of the diner, my despondent look slowly gives way to a warm smile.  My shoulders rise.  I lift my head, letting out a puff of steam into the cold winter’s air.  Man, I love winter…

“Y’know baby-face, some people might call this intruding on another’s guy’s turf.”

I whirl at the voice to see an old man in plaid, his flabby arms crossed over his chest, and despite the words, a warm smile gracing his rosy cheeks. 

I raise my hands, the wind disturbing a perfect curl of hair over my forehead.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about, old man.  You have your ways of getting ready for your time of year, I have mine.”

“Still, do you have to do it so close to my time?  You don’t see me spreading tinsel over people’s Valentines.”

“Well, how else am I going to ensure these relationships are at their peak just in time for my day?” 

“Hmph,” he chuckles, a little ‘ho-ho’ that rumbles up from his jiggling belly.   “There has to be a more efficient way of doing this, though, I have a whole workshop devoted to me, you’re literally doing this for one overworked woman at a time.”

“Oh, there is, but the bow and arrow is so impersonal,” I reply, smiling with a little wink as my wings unfurl from under my jacket.  “And besides, it’s easier to push these ladies into the arms of the right person when you’re personally involved.  Humans can be awfully stubborn like that, even with the right arrow.”",33
1lfxw0b,myw9uzj,"She stood across from me, her gaze much the same as all the rest; never on the eyes, downcast to the side. It was a gaze of reservation, distant thoughts, and muddied nostalgia. The warm palid colors of the house felt much like a distant dream, a memory built upon all the pictures surrounding us.

The first one had hurt the worst. We'd fallen in love during college, and life had been great. Somehow, I had landed the job I always dreamed of, and showered her with every luxury I could. She'd gotten a job of her own, every bit as ambitious as I was, and we took as much time off as we could, venturing the world together as we had always talked of.

Then, Christmas. I had gotten a call about a crucial deal that needed to be closed, and couldn't afford to take her time off. She wanted to spend that year with  her family, and we agreed to make up for lost time after the holiday. When she was gone, I had bought the ring, expectant to propose. Instead, I met Jared. She never even said goodbye.

Once was a heartbreaking coincidence. The sort of thing that burrows into your soul, sure; but still just a coincidence.

After a few years, I'd moved on,  and decided to try again. I gave the ring to my brother, he got engaged with a woman he'd loved since middle school. That's when I met her. Her name was Kim, and our love was fast; my mother described it as ""dangerous for the purse"". But I didn't care, I gave everything I could, showed as much love as I was able.

And then Christmas came. A horrid sense of deja vu pervaded, as my boss described a contract that my skills were needed for. She even said that Christmas wasn't that important to her, and she'd love to stay with me. Then her parents called, and my worry, admittedly irrational for the time, deepened.

It hardly took a week. I cried the most ugly tears I had in what felt like a decade, and got drunk enough on the day of the deal that I blacked out over the call. That, and many other circumstances thereafter, cost me my job.

The year after, after somehow squeezing my way into a new, arguably better position, I went home for Christmas. It's a sleepy sort of town in the middle of Nebraska, where the snow gets rather heavy, and the lumberjacks never seem to rest. I met a girl there, and for just a moment, my heart thawed. God, I wish it hadn't.

She had blonde hair, cut short, and piercing blue eyes. With a quick wit and ambition that excelled far beyond my own, it wasn't particularly surprising that I would fall in love.

Our year spent together made me forget why I'd ever been hesitant to love. We traveled as much as we were able, and for brief moments I could imagine a day whereupon I'd slip a ring on her finger.

It was a day in October, as we sat cuddled on the couch, watching some movie or another, that she dropped a bombshell, ""So, Christmas is coming up,"" She said in a raspy whisper.

My heart stilled at the mention.of the holiday, but I didn't let it show as I said, ""Yeah?""

""My family is... pretty traditional. They make a big show of it and everything. Kinda, surprising, I know, but...""

I could hear my blood start to pump through my ears as I hesitantly replied, ""You'll be going home for the holidays?""

""Yeah,"" She said with a grin, ""You wanna come with?""

At the Exact moment that she posed the question, my phone started ringing. My hands shook slightly as I answered it. Sure enough, it was my boss. According to her, a client with really important backing would need help around the Christmas Holidays, and it was urgent enough that they'd booked three months in advance.

I wasn't surprised when it turned out her hometown was not my own. I also wasn't surprised to learn that she'd met an old flame named James. At that moment, I vowed to never again fall in love.

My vow lasted three years, and in those years, I grew to quite prominent success. During an annual Christmas Party, I met a woman named Alice. She was a fierce redhead with a roaring flame beneath her eyes. I tried, as best as one might, but before I knew what was happening, I found her in one if my old sweatshirts.

""You really used to wear this?""

""Can a guy not like sports?"" I asked rhetorically.

She rolled her eyes, ""Well sure, but this would look like a cosplay on you, ""

I chuckled, and despite everything, knew I loved her.",20
1lfxw0b,myx0aml,"Part 1

It started 10 years ago, when I was just 23, with Dani. I had a project at work that could lead to a promotion come the new year, one that could allow me to leave my parent's place and get a nice apartment with Dani. She went home to Tennessee for Christmas, and stayed there. A week later, she updated her profile photo to one of her with a smiling farmhand. I got the promotion, and settled on a cozy studio. 

The next year things were really going well with Emily, until I had to turn down her invite to go to New Hampshire with her for Christmas- I had a deadline of the 24th, and promised to come after, but got a text saying she reconnected with a high-school flame, and not to come. I used my holiday bonus to go skiing with my little sister. 

The year after that, Becca went home for Hanukkah while I was snowed in at an airport on the way back from a work trip that created hundreds of jobs- when I did get back, it was to find my girlfriend decided to give up her job in the city and work at the family restaurant instead. I adopted a cat, and pondered being single. 

Then Marisol, a co-worker who I had a fling with, decided to leave our very lucrative job to become a snow sculptor. In Florida. She fell in love with an ice deliveryman.  The bonus we were going to use to travel to Italy instead paid off the last of my student loans and contribute to a scholarship so others could avoid them. 

I would have loved to gone to Michigan with Thea for the holidays, but my buddy Joe was having some scary health problems. He didn't like asking for help, so I secretly arranged a holiday fundraiser which unfortunately meant I couldn't go to the little town on Lake Michigan. Thankfully, the fundraiser was a success, and Joe survived. My relationship did not. 

The next year, as my side hustle was turning into a legit business that I could actually live off of, my girlfriend Nina asked me to come to Oklahoma with her. 2 weeks after Christmas, because that's when her family could get together. It was the day I was presenting to investors. It had been on my calendar for months. Nina straight up ghosted me, but the investment was secured, and I was able to commit to my dream career. 

The next year I was hosting my own family at my recently purchased house, something I'd put a lot of care into. Of course I invited Vanessa too, but she wanted to go back to the UK, where she was swept off her feet by a literal lord. My house is nice, but it's not Downton Abbey. I had a great time delivering Christmas cookies to my new neighbors though. 

My business incredibly successful the next year, and I was hosting a company holiday event while Jess went back to help at her parent's beach resort, saved a sea turtle, and decided a life of solitude was better than our cozy pizza and a movie nights. The holiday party allowed me to donate enough toys that every kid at the local Boys and Girls club got a gift. 

Last year I thought I'd finally make it through the holiday season, relationship intact. Hailey had grown up just 10 minutes away, and we were going to do Christmas Eve with my family, Christmas day with hers. That is, until my old high-school basketball team beat her old high-school during the holiday classic on the 23rd. She'd gone to the game while I wrapped up a project so an employee of mine, a single mom, could go to her son's Christmas pagent. I got a text from Hailey with the final score saying ""rethinking tomorrow"" and then nothing. I think she blocked my number. Then my sister reported seeing her on the arm of the basketball coach. So, that happened. 

Now I'm with Bree. Or was. She left for Ohio a few days early and now, just as I was driving to the airport on Christmas Eve day to join her I got a text saying ""Going to open a bakery in Ohio! Can you go send me that apron I left at your place?"" 

I was pondering that text the entire flight to Cincinnati. And while waiting in the car rental line. And in the two hour drive to Bree's hometown. I had her address in my GPS, and as I pulled up to the single family home in a quiet neighborhood my phone chimed that I had arrived. 

There were lights on, and the faint sound of carols coming from the house. I walked up the snowy steps and rang the bell.",15
1lfxw0b,myrx6a2,"""Why?"" I ask her, as she fidgets uncomfortably.  
She lost her glow, she is wearing a Christmas sweater even though she always hated the holiday, and is looking back to her family whom she was estranged from for years!  
""I met someone better."" she mutters.  
I sigh.  
""Victoria...we were talking about engagement, about a family, about a future together.  
Why? How?"" I ask.  
She frowns.

  
""You are never there for me!  
Even now, that I had to go back to my hometown because my grandpa died, you didn't come!  
So yeah, I rekindled an old flame! He is there for me!  
Who are you to question me!"" she roars.  
I stare, stupefied at her.  
""Your boyfriend of a year?  
Someone who loves you?  
Someone who helped your sister pay her mortgage, so she doesn't lose the house?  
Someone who helped you fulfill your dream, and booked that backpacking trip through Europe? "" I ask.  
She laughs.  
She goddamn laughs!

  
""Love me? Love me?   
You always work! What little those few hours in the evening, and a date or two in the weekend matter?!  
And those things you gave me?  
I could have bought them myself!  
Relationships shouldn't be transactional!"" she said.  
I fidget with the ring in my pocket.  
""I worked for us, and never expected a thing in return...what transactional?  
I am discussing the down payment for that dream house we saw together..."" I mutter.  
She falls quiet.  
""Look...Matt,  you are a good guy, but you can't give me what I need."" she says.  
I almost snap, but keep it together.

  
""So, a man whom you haven't seen for 15 years, and spent like 9 days with...can?  
You do realize that it's been just 9 days since you returned, and on day 7 you called me to break up, right?"" I ask her.  
""I don't love you anymore...maybe haven't loved you for a while now..."" she mutters.  
Before I could say something, the ""other one"" comes, and hugs her.  
""I think that is enough."" he says.  
I stare at the two, and at her family looking at us.  
Her sister is looking at me apologetically.  
""Fine."" I say, turning around, and leaving.  
I hear her mutter something, but I don't know what, nor do I care.  
I am not going to kill myself over this...it happened, it happened.  
No matter how dumb it is, this just proves we weren't meant to be together, but damn.  
It hurts so much.  
I loved her, still do, and in mere days...no! Don't go down that rabbit hole....",98
1lfxw0b,mywn9nk,"The air in the diner is tense. Gwen had returned from a visit with the family, and we were catching up. Two plates, each bearing cheese sandwiches sit unattended between us, growing cold.

“Things have been, well, awkward between us recently.”

I sat there, staring at her. She was everything I had ever hoped for, everything I had ever wanted in a woman. 

“You’ve just been so distant lately, always working, always busy.”

I did this for you, why don’t you see that? This project they’ve stuck me with - it will be revolutionary. We’ll be set for life when all this is over. Why don’t you understand that?

“I know it’s been years since I last saw Greg, but when we met, it was like no time had passed at all.”

These last few months have been the best of my entire life. I had been thinking about proposing soon, after the holidays were over and things had a chance to calm down. And now? It’s all falling apart. 

“Words can’t do it justice; it was like magic.”

I tried to be the best boyfriend I can, and she still decided to dump me, on Christmas Eve no less! How could this happen again? …Wait, what?

“I haven’t felt like that in so long. And sure, we would have a way more modest life, but I’m okay with that.”

Something’s wrong, something is very wrong. This - this happened before. This conversation has happened before. The exact words changed, the person saying them changed, but at its core, it’s the same conversation, over and over again. 

“Adam, please understand. I love you-”

“But you’re not IN love with me,” I finished for her. That’s what they say, every time. I don’t understand what’s going on; it’s like there’s a bank of fog surrounding my brain, but the more worked up I get, the clearer things become.",13
1lfxw0b,myteh0p,"""I think I'd be happier with someone else.""

I wasn't going to let it go so easily. ""Why? Every single girlfriend I've ever had dumps me on Christmas Eve. Did you meet someone else?""

I heard the sound of something slamming down onto the counter. ""No, you idiot, it's BECAUSE you didn't come over for Christmas! Think about it - every girlfriend you ever had dumped you on Christmas Eve! Because you were busy at work and they wanted you there with them! Like I did!""  I heard her sobbing over the phone. ""Screw the stupid job, you moron, all I wanted was for you to meet my family so we could be together for the holidays. But no, your stupid project was more important than me. Well, fine, I can take a hint. I hope you two are very happy together."" She hung up.

I put down the phone and stared at my robot. ""Well, looks like it's just you and me again, Frankie."" I adjust the antenna on his head slightly.",39
1lfxw0b,mywsfra,"“Have you ever considered that you might be the problem?”

I stared at her in disbelief. I was so close to making the biggest deal of my life. I was set to make millions of dollars. Millions. I was considered handsome (and I KNEW for a fact that I was. Not trying to brag or anything, but I was considered for modelling. Eat your heart out Adonis. Or something like that, I don’t know.) What could be wrong with me?

“Every big event, every single holiday, every little thing that matters is just forgotten and ignored, like it’s not even worth remembering.” She continued and she stood a little taller, like she had just thrown a weight off her shoulders. “New Years Eve, Easter, Valentines Day, my birthday, Thanksgiving, Graduation, my f@£#ing mother’s funeral, it doesn’t matter, you’re never there!”

I stood there, dumbstruck. She was ending our relationship over this? Over ignoring stupid, pointless celebrations that nobody cared about? And it wasn’t like me being at the funeral made any difference. Not with all the money I had coming in. 

Besides, her mother was already dying. It wasn’t like it was unexpected. 

“But the money-“

“F@#k the money!” she shouted, tears running down her cheeks. “F#@k the money! It’s always about the f@#%ing money! Do you know how I spent my birthday?”

I didn’t really know, but it’s not like it mattered. I was in the middle of something that was going to make me millions. 

“I spent it at home waiting for you to come and take me out to that special day for me. You know, the one that you PROMISED! The one that you said would be perfect. The one that I missed celebrating with my friends because you PROMISED to do something special.”

I don’t know what her problem was. Friends are overrated and I don’t like her friends anyway. It was why I offered in the first place. And I did text her to cancel. At half past two in the morning after. It’s not like I didn’t say anything. 

“Babe, I don’t think you understand. I am on the verge of making millions. Set us up for life. Don’t you understand? I do this for us.”

“You already have more money than some countries. You have been set for life for years,” she snapped back. “Years. But it’s never enough. It will never be enough. It always has been just another million dollars and you’re done. But you’re not. You’re not. You never are. You always have to have more, like you could lose it all tomorrow if you stop hustling for a moment.” 

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. Lose it all? I had seen my father lose it all. I had seen how he had just blown through his money like it was nothing. I had seen how my mother had thrown parties so extravagant that they became the stuff of legend, even as our finances were collapsing. 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” I snapped back. “You know full well that it’s not enough. Not yet. But once I finish this project-“

“You’ll move on to something new to make more money,” she said with a resigned sigh. She looked at me, a strand curly red hair falling over her eye. You need help. Professional help. Help I can’t give you.” 

“Well I’m sorry that I don’t take you on extravagant dates to rival kings,” I said and she rolled her eyes.

“I don’t need fancy dates,” she said, shaking her head in exasperation. “I don’t want you to pay for fancy holidays. I don’t even want you to pay off my student loans. I just want you to make the effort. To actually be there when I need you. To keep your promises.”

I don’t know why she’s so upset about that last part. I’ve had good reasons for breaking those promises. She should understand that I had to make that money. Time was money that I couldn’t afford to lose. I thought she knew that. She was an engineer, the first person in her family to go to college, a woman who wanted to change the world. I thought a driven woman like her would understand. 

“But you don’t make the effort. You only bother if you’re not about to make more money. That’s not how relationships work. That’s not how good relationships work.” She paused and took a deep breath. “I’ve been telling myself for months that it’s okay. That the good times outweigh the bad. That you’re doing it for us, for our future, for our future children. That you love me and that one day you will show me how much I matter to you. I’ve been waiting and making excuses and I’m just tired of all the bullsh#%.”

“I do love you!” I protest and I point to the intricate gold and silver necklace on her neck. “I brought you that necklace, didn’t I?” 

For a moment, it looked like she was reconsidering her decision. Then she unclasped the necklace and handed it to me. She held my hand and looked me in the eye, her expression solemn. 

“You don’t understand. I’m not sure that you’ll ever understand. It’s not about the material things.” She shook her head sadly. “You can’t buy love. You can’t buy happiness. I saw my parents treating one another with love and respect and kindness. My best friend in high school is getting married to the love of his life and he’s genuinely happy.”

“He?” I asked and my ex frowned slightly. 

“Yes, Nick. He was my best friend in high school. He-“

“I get it,” I said cutting her off. “You’ve realised that you’re in love with him and now you’re off to win his heart.”

“For your information, Nick is gay,” she said with some annoyance. “And I’ve known that since we were both thirteen and he came out to me.” I opened my mouth to say something, only for her to cut me off with a wave. 

“I saw how him and his boyfriend treat one another. I’ve seen how people treat people that they love. I’ve seen what a healthy relationship looks like and…” She shrugged. “This isn’t it.”

“That’s ridiculous!” I protested. “There are women who would love to be in your shoes.” 

I wanted her to be hurt, but instead she just looked sadly at me and shook her head. 

“You should have picked one of those ones instead,” she said, before turning and walking away. 

For a few seconds I stood there, her words playing through my head. She was talking nonsense of course, but still…

I turned and headed to the nearest bar. Perfect place to pick up a new girlfriend after all. And one without the same hang ups about time as my ex girlfriend!",7

That year with Alice was far more cozy than I expected. We spent many late nights ordering pizza or take out Chinese, watching trashy romcons and jibing at the characters on screen. As the year progressed, however, I felt myself grow more and more cold. By the end of September I had the shakes, and couldn't possibly tell her what was wrong. And so I waited, and sure enough, the call came.

I stood at the counter in the dining room, the day after Christmas, staring at my phone. My body was shaking as I waited patiently for it to happen. Just as I'd dared to relax, a knock came at the door, causing me to bodily jump.

Each step felt like the end, as I pulled open the door. Alice stood there, before she walked in. She was stiff, and wouldn't deign to look me in the eye. I felt myself shatter as she walked around the counter.

""What is his name?"" I demanded, a hard Rage gurgling to the surface.

""W-what?""

""What. Is. His. Name?"" My tone never rose beyond an even and flat monotone, but from the widening in her eyes, I knew she could see my anger.

I took a moment to take deep breaths and try to better school my expression, as she replied, ""T-Tom,""

Nodding, I said, ""And let me guess. He's someone from your hometown. Someone you used to love back in,  back in fucking highschool? And he just happened to be in town at the same Goddamn time, and... and you decided to change all of your principles, quit your fucking job, and run away with him to become a housewife under, what, the Spirit of Christmas?!""

She slammed up from her chair, the harsh scrape biting against the floor as she replied, ""Something you'd clearly NEVER understand, because your job is Too Impodtant to celebrate one of... one of the most...""

""One of the most WHAT, Alice? The most important holidays? Do you even fucking remember telling me, back in goddamn SEPTEMBER, that you didn't care that much about Christmas?? Fucking hell, I cared more than you. I went... I went out of my way to buy you gifts, shit I knew you'd like. And you got me a Card. What did Mister Motherfucking Hometown get you?!?""

""He... he got me... he got me Roses,"" She replied, swaying on her feet.

""Holy shit, Alice?"" I rushed around the counter, grabbing her right as she fell, ""Alice, what's going ""

She Blinked, and for the briefest of moments, a single piece of snow rose up from her eye. I stared as that strand branched, and...

The world was dark, and a fierce chill entered my veins. The house was gone, and naught but a void stretched into the depths of infinity. In the middle of it all stood a man, burgeoned in red cloth.

""You are... irredeemable,"" The man whispered.

Hesitantly, I stood up, shaking under the mind-numbing pressure of the cold, ""W-what... what is this?""

""You are... Unlovable,""

""WHAT IS THIS?"" I shouted, desperate, as the man turned to me, white beard billowing below him. 

""You are... Unwanted,""

Stepping forward, surprised at the resistance that begged to slide my feet against the invisible ground, ""Are you... are you...""

The man grinned, and it was a thing of yellowed, cavity strewn teeth, ""I am Saint Nicholas, the Patron of Gifts, God of Love... and YOU, you are the Ice Lord, to be the Death of all that is Good. You,  are Jack Frost,""

I shivered as the cold began to burrow deeper into my veins, and shouted, ""I found love! Multiple times, but you... you took it from me!?""

""Took? I suppose I did. Your form of love is UNACCEPTABLE,""

""What... what does that... what does that MEAN? What did I do wrong?""

""Do you think it coincidence that every person you have 'loved' has left to become a housewife?""

""You took away their freedom to make them a fucking..."" I struggled, then, raging against the invisible storm begging to take over my body, ""No. I won't... accept... it,""

For a God, he was weak.",22

A woman answered, a few years older than Bree, but similar enough in looks she had to be her sister, Allie.

""Hi is Bree -""

""Oh thank heavens, Luke, right? I am so glad you're here. Bree has gone absolutely mental, and we were humoring her, because it's the holiday, but I actually think she's lost it, please, come in.""

""Uh - okay -"" I said, confused.

""She seemed perfectly normal when she got here last week, excited to introduce us to you, but over these past few days she's been in a baking frenzy, despite almost never baking, and, shit, the guy who removes the snow for Nana is here. His name is Jay, and he seems charming, but I remember him from school and he is a deadbeat with 3 kids he never sees. The only reason he clears Nana's snow is because he can show off his plow.""

""And Bree is in love with him,"" I guessed.

""Holy crap, did she tell you that?""

""Educated guess.""

Allie led me into the living room where Bree's parents, grandmother, brother in law, and nieces sat around a tree. Bree was cuddled very close to a man who looked like he belonged on a magazine cover.

""Bree, look who made it!""

Bree tilted her head. ""Who are you?""

""What?!"" I asked. ""Bree, it's me, Luke. We've been dating 8 months now.""

""You've only talked my ear off about him and sent a bazillion pictures of the two of you being adorable,"" Allie added.

""Luke?"" Bree said, then her eyes widened. ""Luke! Oh, uh, hey! Did you bring my apron?""

""No, I didn't bring your apron. I was already on my way to the airport. After using the holiday drive profits to host brunch for the homeless. As was the plan?""

""Oh,"" she looked saddened. ""Well, um, I'm sorry, but I've had a life-changing experience and -""

""Please,"" I said. ""Please explain what happened between when you left the city and now.""

""Okay, well I did some work in the airport, got on the plane, rented a car, stopped at a rest area where an odd little man gave me the most amazing hot cocoa, came here, worked late from my room, went to Nana's, met Jay...""

""Hold up,"" Allie interrupted. ""Did you say you accepted a drink from a stranger at a sketchy roadside rest?""

""A cocoa,"" Bree said. ""He - he had this ""Christmas magic"" aura to him, you know?""

Allie and I exchanged glances, and then I noticed Jay looking anywhere but the conversation.

""Jay, do you know what's going on?""

He sighed. ""I might have a side gig as an elf at one of those Santa photo places, and one of my coworkers said for 50 bucks he could get me a girlfriend by Christmas day? Weird little guy, but he said he had years of experience. Even showed me a few photos of his work. There's one dude who fell in love with a snow sculptor in Florida. They have two kids now!""

""They were drugged,"" I said horrified. ""Drugged by some weird Christmas elf.""

""They?"" Allie asked. 

""This has happened to me before,"" I explained.

""Look, I'm really sorry,"" Bree said, ""but I'm very happy here, and I'm about to sign a lease on the bakery, so....""

""Yeah, I get it."" I sighed. ""I don't suppose there's a hotel in this small town? I'll leave you too whatever this is, and -""

""Nope!"" Allie interrupted. ""Sorry, but I've heard enough about you to know that I much prefer my kids have an uncle Luke than an uncle Jay."" She faced the other man ""Get in touch with your elf coworker. Have him undo this. ""

Jay sighed and pulled out his phone, sending a text. After what felt like forever his phone pinged.

""He says to put $100 on the mantle. And, uh, he's sorry about all the other times.

Allie humphed. ""I'm not putting the kids Christmas money -""

""I've got it,"" I assured her, pulling out one of the crisp $100s I'd been planning to use to take her family to dinner. I placed it on the mantle and a moment later it vanished, replaced with a mug of eggnog.

Carefully, I passed the mug to Bree.

""I don't know if I should-""

""Goodness you fool, drink it!"" Nana snapped from the corner. ""He came all this way for you, and he's loaded!""

Bree drank. Then she gasped, and pushed away from Jay.

""What just - how - Luke! You made it!""

""You can leave now,"" Allie said to Jay and he headed to the door. 

""Merry Christmas, Bree"" I said, taking the spot vacated by Jay.

""Merry Christmas, Luke"" Bree replied. ""I'm so happy you made it, and congrats on a successful holiday charity drive! She smiled at her family. ""Everyone meet my wonderful boyfriend, Luke. Luke, meet everyone.""

We exchanged greetings and Bree smiled. ""Does anyone want a cookie? I have no idea why we have so many!""",22
1lfxw0b,mywnapp,"She blinked at me, surprised and confused. “I- yeah. Wait, what?”

“That’s what they say, every time.”

She blinked again. “Are- are you cheating on me?”

“No!” I exclaim, standing up from the table. “This is…eight, nine, the tenth time this has happened to me! I meet a girl, we date for a while, and on Christmas Eve she dumps me! If a thing happens once, that’s a random occurrence. If a thing happens twice, that’s a coincidence. If a thing happens three times, that’s a pattern, and what we have here is a well-established pattern!”

“I - I don’t - wait, I…” She can’t even speak. She holds her head as panic and confusion set in. Looking around, everyone else in the diner is staring at us. The waitress raises a hand to one ear.

“Abort scenario, the storyline is compromised. I repeat, abort scenario, the storyline is compromised.” In a flash, everyone is moving. Gwen and I are being wrestled to the ground. People wearing white lab coats are jabbing us with needles, injecting us with something. All the while, the air is filled with various conversations, spilling out and overlapping each other.

“Home Office won’t like this.”

“Any idea what happened?”

“Home Office can’t do anything if the Yuletide Ones aren’t appeased!”

“If I had to guess, he’s developed a tolerance for the amnestics.”

“I told the Writers that if we kept recycling this storyline, then something like this would happen.”

The world fades to darkness.",15
1lfxw0b,myzfm3s,"I wonder if he had a fear of being alone, which exacerbated his relationship issues until his exasperation outweighed his fear. 

The best case scenario, based on the information given, is he went to a bar or other public access place to celebrate NYE, and hooked up with someone he met there. This year, it sounds like he's going to actively avoid such a scenario.",5
1lgdawp,myvrlmg,"Herb Encarnacio was sitting up, not laying down, on the white bed in the white room. He didn't notice it but he was pulling at the edges of his white gown. 

He'd decided that laying down would be showing weakness. They were going to operate on him and it would be best if they didn't think he was weak. Herb believed that when people think you're weak, something down deep gives them permission to fuck up.

Strength is all that matters. Might is right. Keep'em worried. Just like dad always said.

The digital clock ticked over. Just a few more minutes.

Herb noticed that he was plucking at his gown and stopped immediately. Fidigiting was a lack of control, not being in control was weak.
 
He inhaled deeply. The air was scentless, tasteless. Was the parasite eating up smells now or was the room just that sterile?

As the thought of the parasite ran through his brain, Herb blacked out. 

When he came to he heard his voice asking, ""Doc will this tingle?"" 

""Hurt actually."" The doctor answered. The doctor wasn't looking at Herb, Orban was looking at his abdomen.

""Will that be a light pain or...?"" Again the voice was his but something was off. 

As the haze cleared Herb realized it was coming from the mouth that had grown out of his stomach. 

He was careful not to form the ""P"" word in his mind. It didn't like it when he thought that. Herb wanted to think it to show that he didn't care what it felt or wanted. Herb wanted to project strength. He'd tried projecting strength but it was tied deep into his nervous system and it was difficult to do much these days.

He'd never felt so weak.

The doctor answered it's question as he nodded to a nurse that was on his left, ""No, agonizing."" 

The nurse slipped a needle into a hose that hadn't been in his arm just a few mintues before. Herb wondered how long he'd been out.

A coolness in his veins warned him that the nurse had just hit him with a sedative.

He felt the mouth on his stomach grimace, ""Oh. Darn.""

Doctor Orban leaned over Herb and smiled a reassuring smile as the world faded to black.",13
1lg2q00,mysxed2,"I stared at my dad, my mouth hanging open after he dropped that bomb on me.  The Human-Rowan war had devastated the planet, over three billion people dead and it was only now that the climate was beginning to go back to normal.  I had studied the war in high school, just like every other student, but I had no idea my dad had any part in it other than being a soldier.

""How did you-"" I began but stopped when he raised a hand.  His grin was a cocksure as ever, and he turned he head to point behind his right ear.  I watched in amazement as a shiny, metal port appeared as if by magic. ""It's camouflaged unless I will it to reveal itself,"" he explained.  ""I was part of a secret project, a real Hail Mary if you will, to interface with Rowan technology. As the only survivor of the process, it was on me to make the most of it.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My middle-aged dad, the one who told terrible Dad jokes at barbeques and was the most cautious man I knew, was a real war hero.  I paused to gather my thoughts before asking just one question. He interrupted me, like he was reading my mind.

""How? Well, with the interface, I could link to their tech, take it over and do whatever I wanted with it.  Repurpose it for deadly results.  My first mission was getting onto a battle cruiser, something that took an entire battalion of Marines to accomplish.  Once we were there, I hooked in and took over.  Purged all the Rowan out of the ship and landed it in Area 51.  I was the bridge that translated all their technology, information and battle plans.  The military reverse engineered the ship so we could build more, build better.  The war turned a corner at that point, but I wasn't done.  My last mission was on their battle station orbiting Earth. I was inserted with a team of specialists, real go-getters.  We breached and made our way to the central database.  For over ten hours, they held off waves of Rowan soldiers as I downloaded and transmitted the entire sum of their knowledge.  Jumped us light years ahead.  They even had information from other species that they never bothered to translate or use, but we sure made the most of everything.""

""They never told us any of this in school,"" I muttered.  ""And they never will,"" he countered.  ""It goes deeper than just utilizing their technology against them.  The Rowan were a hivemind, every one of them connected to another.  I broke it, that special connection, and it broke them as a people.  After that, it was more of mopping up then real battle.  They had lost their cohesion, their special trait that we couldn't seem to overcome before.  Most of them did the dirty work for us, ending their lives, unable to live without being part of that gestalt.  And it went past the ones here on Earth, far past.  Your father is responsible for the death of trillions.""  His voice grew quiet, his eyes lowered in shame.  ""I killed trillions of intelligent beings.  I have to live with that every day.  Sure, it was us of them, but I can't get that number out of my mind.""

I reached out and hugged my dad hard, finally getting a sense of why he acted the way he did.",42
1lg2q00,myt07ib,"I look at my deadbeat dad.  
He never leaves the house, never does chores, yet...  
Mom adores him?  
I am enrolled in the most prestigious school ever, and we never, ever lack any money.  
Mom is a simple teacher so...how?  
I kept curiosity at bay for more than 18 years, but now...ready to leave the nest, and go out in the world.  
I want to know.  
""Dad? How are we able to afford all this?"" I ask him.  
He almost smiles.

  
""20-22 years ago, there was an invasion."" he starts.  
I nod.  
A hivemind found Earth, and infected a few.  
Anyone that got in contact with an infected, got added to the hivemind link.  
Stronger individuals took months to succumb, and weaker ones got instantly added to the ranks of the hivemind...  
No one could seemingly resist.  
We couldn't find the link, we couldn't identify the hivemind individuals before it was too late, and seemingly all hope was lost, but then...  
The hivemind disappeared.  
The world didn't believe it for a long time, but it did happen, after all...we are free, aren't we?

  
""How? You?"" I ask.  
He nods slowly.  
""I got infected, when I was at my lowest point, almost ending it all...  
Many would have thought that this meant I was an easy target, right?"" he starts.  
I nod.  
""But nope.  
The voices? The link? Absolutely useless against my mind.  
Not only that, but my anxiety, paranoia, hypochondria, and the endless deadly scenarios were transmitted through the link back to the hivemind.  
The link was nigh-indestructible, so...they kept being infected by my thoughts."" he continues.  
I gasp.

  
""Then, I suppose the government managed to create a device that could identify hivemind individuals, because they found me.  
And they were shocked, and happy to see me...as me, and not a member of the hive.  
When I told them that the hivemind is begging for me to stop, and why it asked so...  
They apologized to me."" he says.  
""Apologized? The government?"" I ask.  
""They doubled down, feeding me the worst things I couldn't even imagine before.  
Let me tell you, humanity is fucked up.  
But hey...after I saw those files, and videos...the hivemind voluntarily retreated, freeing every human, and leaving the planet.  
I became a Hero, with a lot of perks, and met your mom in rehab, where she was volunteering.  
The rest, you kind of know."" he says.  
I leave the living room, confused, shocked...and wow...  
Dad defeated an alien invasion with...his depression?  
Would anyone believe me if I tell them?",26
1lg2q00,myt679d,"When the old ant moved, his back leg dragged. Why did the Queen and her royal guards show him such respect? We didn't know. We just knew he was slow.

For nineteen seasons, he strained under loads half the size of mine. He'd fall behind on foraging runs. I'd hear his wheeze in the tunnels.

He didn't pull his weight. He was an embarrassment. I couldn't understand why the colony let him continue.

And I felt ashamed. You see, he's my father.

Last week, I snapped when he dropped a seed. ""You embarrass us,"" I said. ""Stay in the nest. Let us handle it.""

He didn’t argue. Just nodded and scraped his bad leg through the dirt. But later, I guess this prompted him to speak.

Now he stood at the entrance to our restoreum. My siblings had gathered. Another lecture. Whatever. I hung back, hoping to slip away. 

""Long ago,"" he began, ""a rock fell from the sky. It was smaller than a seed. Hit near the oak stump. It brought something with it. Not alive. Not dead. A fungus. Thoughts like one mind stretched across stars.""

My antennae twitched. His voice gripped me. He never told stories.

""Bees got it first. Wings stopped. Hives went quiet. Their queen came to us, half-dead, and warned we were next. Said the fungus would eat the tunnels. Choke the brood.""

A shift in his stance showed the scars. Deep gouges I’d always chalked up to age.

""We fought. Us, the bees. Your uncles. Everyone. Tore through the rot. Chewed its veins. Days blurred. Weeks passed.""

He paused. The limp dragged again, but slower this time. Measured.

""Lost half the colony. Took a spore blast to the thorax. But we stopped it. Burned it with sap.""

The yard around us hummed. Bees passed overhead. The colony hummed with the same sounds as always. But it felt different now.

""That’s why they come. It's why they share honey. It's why we guard their hives. That fight bound us.""

I looked at him, bent and tired. But I saw something else now. ""Your limp?"" I asked.

""I was at the final battle."" He said. ""Lived, most didn't.""

Above us, a bee dropped pollen. That night, I heard his wheeze in the tunnels. I still felt ashamed. But my shame was different. It was for not recognizing who this brave, old ant truly was.",15
1lftqig,myrcmhn,"""It's not Halloween yet,"" Sarah stared at the eldritch horror beyond comprehension. ""Very impressive costume. You must've put a ton of effort into it. But you're a few months too early.""

The mass of undulating black flesh and sludge met her steely gaze with an impenetrable stare. Only to blink with dozens of eyes and wobbled like an oversized, misshapen jello. It tented its tentacles, which seem to be having conversations with each other in screechy cat noises. Its mouth, which stretched from a bulbous head to this rotund mid-section, which Sarah assumed was a stomach, wrenched itself open in a silent scream.

""Yes, it is a good act,"" she sighed, patting the creature on the head. Only to later pull her hand away and wipe the slime off. ""Nice texturing. Almost like a real slime monster.""

*“You’re not dead.”* The oddly shy voice that came from the monster carried confusion and caution. There was no reverb or echo or blood-curdling edge. Just a voice that could belong to a child trying to make a surprised pikachu face, only to flounder about like a floppy jellyfish on dry land. *""You're not scared.""*

""I'm alive, and tired, and still have work to do,"" Sarah remarked. ""I'm sorry I don't have any treats for you, so please go home.""

“All who witness my horrifying visage scream in terror!” The creature gesticulated wildly, flailing its tentacles as though it were a panicked octopus that forgot it could breathe underwater. “You do not fear!How can you withstand the horror that is my terrible tentacles and not melt into a puddle of dissolved flesh and bones? By Hastur and Cthulhu, this has never happened to me!”

""Oh, you're a Lovecraft fan? Cthulhu is your favourite?"" Sarah asked, hoping it could stop panicking and talk about its hobbies. ""I used to play Call of Cthulhu RPG with friends. Do you want to play together? Get to know each other. Don't be scared.""

""Okay..."" it sniffed, blowing chunks of thick wax-like substances from its...mouths? Sarah could not see anything resembling nostrils on the creature's face. ""Teach me. How to play Cthulhu games. How are you not scared of..."" it paused, scrunching its features searching for the right word to say, ""...creepy costumes.""

""I'm a middle school teacher. When you're trapped in the public school system for as long as I have, nothing phases you. Absolutely nothing.""

""Nothing indeed...nothing I do scares you...you...monster!"" the eldritch entity sobbed before screaming of fearless teacher who refused to comprehend the horrors at night. Of a teacher who gazed into the Abyss without batting an eyelid and made it blink and cry.

1lftqig,myrhxwm,"The creature emerged from the pain of existence, from the cracks of woe. It wrought itself into being, twisting the formless echoes of suffering until it was whole. An energy pulsated through it, each new breath breathing into it an air of despair, until all that it was came to be. 

It new its purpose. It knew *pain.*

A sound made it swivel, its body twisting in torment. It knew every language, as all language contains that which should not be said, but it could discern the dialect nor the meaning. 

It could only be described as... *Psspsspss*

The eldritch monstrosity gazed up, as a human crouched low, arm outstretched. Its hand contained nothing; only a sense of beckoning. 

Again, that sound. That intriguing sound. 

*Psspsspss*

The beast, alive since before eternity, knew not what to do. It wasn't sure of what horrible torment to wrought, what awful agony to inflict. 

""*There's a good girl*,"" the human said, shuffling towards the horror. ""*There's a good girl.*""

The monstrosity ebbed, eons of excruciation within its throes. A timeless second in wait. 

The hand reached out, making contact with the beast, with the formless amalgamation of all that was wrong. It moved across it again, again. A ritual repeated, each more deliberate than the last. 

""*Now aren't you something,*"" she said, her smile etching into her wrinkles. ""*Such a pretty little girl.*""

This was not how it was supposed to go. 

The human's other hand reached towards it, and it moved backwards, almost defensively. The hand soon made contact however, reaching beneath it and cradling it upwards, into the human's arms. 

""*There there,*"" the human said, holding it as if it were a baby. ""*Let's get you a home.*""

The horror gazed up at the human, as the suffering at its core churned. What terror to reap. What despair to defile. 

The human walked slowly, deliberately, cradling the beast in its arms. She sat among a smattering of boxes; a makeshift bed.

She kissed the beast on what could be called its forehead. 

""*We all need a home,*"" she said almost to herself, stroking the horror tenderly, lovingly.

An eternity of suffering; a moment of respite. 

Something arose in it. Something it could not name, but only feel. 

Something it much preferred.

1lftqig,myremr8,"I couldn’t comprehend it. Even as I tilted my head to the right, I couldn’t figure out what the creature was supposed to be. Was it a man? Woman? Dog? Cat? Bear? I could see all of those things in it, while also seeing none of them at the same time. I sat up in my bed, pulling the blankets over my knees, continuing to examine the creatures’ many rotating heads, each flashing with what I assumed was a different emotion? Or perhaps it was the same one? It was hard to tell when those floating faces rotated around its oozing dark body like moons caught in a planet’s orbit.
 
“I am all. I am nothing.” Its voice made my windows wobble, threatening to burst open if they raised it even a decibel louder. When it moved, it mimicked a slug, crawling slowly towads my bed, as its imposing form leaned over my body. Each head swirling around its body faster, with yellowed teeth, green teeth, white teeth, and I still had no idea what I was looking at.
 
I remained silent, not exactly frozen in fear, more held in place by startled confusion. It was scary, in the same way that finding a cockroach in your bedroom at night would be scary, not a oh my god type of fear, more an ick. The body of the creature throbbed, causing the sores on its skin to drool a green ooze, threatening to drip onto the floor. The body reminded me of an oversized balloon. One so thick it would pop if it brushed against a hair of grass. Though, before I could understand its body, it deflated into a deathly thin frame, one that showed the animalistic skeleton underneath its skin.
 
“Join us. You will become a part of us. We hunger. You will hunger too.” Its long, perfect fingers traced my chin. For all its strangeness, its fingers were pristine with painted red nails. If one saw them in a magazine, they may even think they belonged to a hand model. The softness of their touch easing me slightly.
 
Again, its words were intimidating, but the longer this went on, the less fear I felt. In fact, I felt more confused than anything. What was this thing? I couldn’t even decide what parts of it I was supposed to fear at this point. I slid its hand from my chin, that spooking the creature who shifted back.
 
“You moved.” It hissed, its frail chicken legs bending backwards as it went into a squat. “Why did you move? You shouldn’t move.”
 
“I’m confused.”
 
“Confusion is fear.” It said, confidence growing as it crept forward.
 
“No, I’m not scared. I can’t even tell what I’m meant to be scared of. Every time I get scared, you change into something else.”

“BAAGSGASDGAS” It screamed, generating a sound that forced the windows open, letting in a chill that cooled my body to the point of almost freezing it. I whimpered, breath coming out in a gust of condensation. “Scared yet?” It snickered, the faces all bouncing with laughter, and I was terrified. For a second.

 

The faces again changed, big chubby cheeks wailing on one, a glossy lipstick wearing one following that, before ending on a comically plain face with fuzzy eyebrows. The whiplash from seeing all those faces taking me out of my horrified state. I pulled my blankets up, warming myself until the chill left. “That was a little scary.”

 

“A little scary?” It stepped back again. “NO, no, No.” Each no had a different tone, as if it was being filtered through a hundred voices. The orbs of floating faces stopped their rotation, forming a line before its body. “What if all my faces eat you alive? Nibble bits of your skin until you're nothing but a pile of bones that we can use to pick our teeth clean with.”

 

Again, my fear heightened before I realized one of the mouths didn’t have any teeth, having lost them when it shifted. The constant changes becoming more noticeable. Now, that’s all I could focus on, unable to comprehend anything else. “That one’s missing its teeth.”

 

“What? No, it isn’t. Can you truly not understand what lurks before you? What is going to kill you?”

 

“I… really have no idea what you even are. Are you a monster? A bunch of faces? I don’t get it.” I rubbed my nose, doing my best to try and take a guess at what the mess of body parts was. Bravely, I stepped out of my bed, approaching it to get a better look.

 

It flinched, its size deflating, becoming smaller as I got closer. “No. Stay back.”


It almost looked cute now, a fearful tiny creature that shivered with my every step. Then it grew again, its body hitting the ceiling as its heads stared down at me. “I’ll kill you.” It shouted, though it lacked any heart, the creature already pushing itself against the wall, trying to keep away from me.
 
“I can’t even tell how you would kill me.” I admitted, and that appeared to be the final straw for the creature. It squealed, dashing away towards the window. When it realized it was too big for the window, it shrunk to the size of a bee and grew a set of large-boned arms from its back. These arms helping it to fly, with their skeletal fingers flapping, giving it some air. I tried to grab it before it left, only to miss it, having to watch as it escaped my home.
 
I watched it for a minute before closing the windows. I had so many questions to ask it, but it appeared I would never get the chance to find out what it really was. The creature was long gone, with no intention of ever coming back. Resigned to the fact I would never see it again, I shut my eyes, needing a few minutes before I could get back to sleep again.

1lftqig,myr19s8,"Okay.  
I just watched a house sprout legs, and a mouth, and eat a car.  
Then a myriad eyes bloomed on it, all staring at me.  
Was I terrified? Hell yes.  
Did I react? Hell no?  
Why?  
Because I couldn't understand what the fuck did just happen.  
So now...I am having a staring contest with a goddamn thousands eyed house!

  
The House's mouth opens, revealing teeth that have...eyes?  
I almost faint.  
It rolls out a ridiculously long tongue...and it licks me.  
It fucking licks me.  
I want to scream. I want to run away, but I can't.  
I am frozen in place.  
This is too much for my brain to comprehend.  
I think I have shut down.  
My body ain't bodying.  
Then it gets worse.

  
The House roars at me.  
Yeah, you heard that right, roars at me, and tries to step on me.  
I don't even flinch.  
Not because I am not scared, I already soiled myself, but because I am simply having an out-body like experience.  
The House freezes as well.  
Growls, and takes a few steps back, still staring at me.  
My eyes are dry, and sting, but I can't come to make myself blink.  
Then...  
The House whimpers.

  
I watch as it lowers itself to the ground, legs disappearing, eyes blinking and disappearing.  
One more low whimper escapes its terrible mouth, and it disappears as well.  
Now...  
The house is a normal looking house.  
And the weird atmosphere, and dreadful feeling disappeared.  
I see a purplish cloud leaving the house, and occasionally looking back at me, before disappearing into the horizon.  
I collapse, twitching.  
Before everything goes dark, the only thing I can think about is...  
Did I just scare away a scary monster?  
Did from fight and flight, and freeze...freeze really work?",93
1lftqig,mys38uk,"The woman walked home like a leaf caught in the wind. Thin, exhausted, her eyes wide and hollow. She held her keys loosely in one hand, her steps automatic, as if her body remembered the way even when her mind had long since let go.

The house stood just as it always had—gray, old, familiar. Two shallow steps led up to the front door. She climbed them slowly, paused before the door, and stared at it for a moment. Then she reached for her keys and brought them to the lock. Her fingers trembled—not from fear, but from sheer fatigue. The keys slipped through her grip and fell to the wooden porch with a dull metallic clatter.

She didn’t react right away. Instead, she stood still, looking down at the keys as if trying to remember what they were for. Ten seconds passed. Maybe more. Then, somewhere above, a faint sound broke the silence—like a window slamming shut on the second floor. It was soft, but unmistakably inside the house.

The noise brought her back. She bent down, picked up the keys, and stepped away from the door, her head tilting up toward the second floor.

There, in the window, she saw the back of a head. Gray hair. A pale nightgown. The figure stood perfectly still, turned away. It wasn’t clear who—or what—it was. An old woman? A stranger? A shadow?

And then she remembered.

Three days ago, her sister had called her in tears. She’d had a dream, a vivid nightmare. In it, she had wandered through this very house in the middle of the night. In the boy’s bedroom—the boy who had died just yesterday—she had seen an old woman standing beside his bed.

She had asked, ""Who are you?""  
The woman didn’t answer.  
She asked again, ""Why are you here?""  
The old figure raised an arm and pointed silently at the sleeping child.

Then she turned.

Her sister saw two enormous, hollow eyes—emptier than death itself. Her skin was black, like oil, and her smile was made entirely of glass.

She’d woken up screaming and called right away. At the time, it had seemed like nothing. Just a dream.

But the next day, her son was gone.

Now, standing before the same door, she remembered it all. The keys felt heavy in her hand as she brought them back to the lock. One turn. Then another. She paused, her lips moving into something that almost resembled a smile. Not warmth. Not courage. Just quiet surrender. Or maybe acceptance.

""I’m not afraid anymore,"" she said softly.

She turned the key a final time. There was a faint click as the door unlocked and drifted open.

There was nothing left to fear.",7

It wriggled its fishy squid thing more and more till i had it. I slapped it away ""Do that again and i lamp ya, git it?""

The others who where full on pissed now slowly started blinking again. They were slowly coming to and started screaming. Like real screaming, mad that is. Ellen aswell made a huge scene ""babe, calm let me deal with this rotter. Nothin be afraid of.""

I pulled out my phone and got to the calendar app. Twisted it around and showed it to that muppet. ""Look i dont know if you are dumb or what. But in an hour top gear's on.  So stop messing with ellen here. Say sorry and sod off. I don wanna go home and microwave ma beans. When Ellen here can make some proper food. If you dont, i swear to ya ill shank ya. Now git sorted""

I stared at it, it stare back at me, i said my peace and it started throwing a bloody tantrum, smashing its tentancles onto the water making waves, literally. As i was thinking that i thought that was bloody funny ""You makin wave's all you want but thats where you gotta go"" I pointed towards the sea. ""Listen, it be land here. Reason you so upset is LAND let me spell that for you. *El Ah En Tee*. You wanna go there, water *Doubleyou Ah Dee Ah*""

""Molian terras sakkiara! Ulunaquota Tasyal!"" it shouted in german again. Foamin from its mouth. And finally it turned around. 

Ellen finally spoke. She was not in a good shape. She stammered ""I ...i have seen...i saw everything. Everything. EVERYTHING!!!"" she began making scene.

""Oi Ellen. I know its a rerun but its really good i promise. It's the argentina episode, proper classic.""


*And thus the hero picked her up. And walked back home. The entire city, perhaps the entire world has postponed its destiny. But for our hero it wasnt a happy ending. Ellen wasnt really in the mood of cooking after witnessing the birth and death of an infinity of universes. And worst of all, Topgear was not being broadcasted tonight as the entire nation of britain had declared a national emergency. Our hero swore revenge shouting into the eather ...* ""You bloody tentacle prick ruined my weekend! I swear on me mum, i'll find you and ill smack ya silly like a alarm clock.""


**The End**",7
1lgds9i,myvuixg,"I barely noticed it at first. Too busy inspecting my latest sets of spirits, sampling a shot of each. I wasn't too happy with this lot, too much of the alcohol taste cutting through the rest of the flavours. Good if someone wanted to get hammered, but hardly worth the coin otherwise. Still, what was done was done. I could still find someone who would want it.

But as I straightened up, I felt the tear on my back. A low pain, but one I knew all too well by now. It made me glance up to the ceiling, muttering to myself. ""Moonrise already? Darn, I'm running a little late.""

With that I left my sheds, quickly locking them before dashing through the cooling air. Every step came with other small tears, the skin around my joints breaking. I scowled, knowing I had only a few more minutes before I was too far gone.

Thankfully, with the coming change my speed increased. In swift seconds I was safely in my home, closing curtains and stripping at the same time. It was only when I was completely nude did I stop holding back, grabbing my skin and *tearing*.

Great chunks slipped off, as a body too big to fit beneath emerged. I was fit as a human, but as my wolf-self I was a display of muscle, covered in a fine layer of white fur. I stretched, groaning as my bones clicked in relief. It was easy to peel off what skin remained, as it was loose now.

The worst part was the fact I was now left with my... peelings. I had to get rid of them, but they weren't anything that I could exactly throw out. Thankfully, I had a way. I balled up the pieces, sniffing as I set them into a plastic bag I had on hand.

Scampering to a specific wardrobe, I took out my oversized clothing. From the big and tall section, they weren't the height of fashion. But then again, I only wore them once a month. I squeezed them over my thick body, before padding to my laptop. I had left it open, with the tracking of the usual pizzas. En-route, as I had ordered hours ago.

Knowing my gameroom was ready, I just had to wait. And wait I did, listening.

I knew when they pulled in. Their car was one I had heard countless times before, the sounds recognisable. I grinned, heading over to the door. Counting down in my head, as I heard their footsteps, I opened the door just in time.

There they were. My friends, the pairs of monsters. Darcy and Victoria, both vampires smiling as Victoria held up a cooler. Then Herrus and Cleo, the mummy's. I eyed their bandages, pushing the door open as I stepped aside. ""Hey guys. Good trip?""

Herrus nodded, a flash of red visible beneath the cloth over his eyes. ""Not bad.""

I welcomed them in, watching as they headed directly to my games room. A pile of overnight bags were left, as they always stayed over. They took their usual seats, as I held out my arms to my vampiric pals. ""Go on, let's get this over with. Cleo, my skin's in the bag.""

I ignored the pain of bites, as Cleo gave a smirk. ""Thanks Alex. I needed a refresh.""

I smiled, shrugging. ""At least you can use it. The pizza's on the way, so shall we get started?""

Darcy nodded, pulling away as he licked his lips. ""Mmmm. I needed that. I vote poker.""

I sniggered at that. ""Oh good. Worked out how to bluff yet?""

He swore at me, despite the grin brewing. Good-natured laughs echoed around, as we sat around to begin our monthly catch up. A way to hang out free of our guises, a way to relax. We had been doing it for the last five decades, and I was hoping for it to carry on for many more.",8
1lgh0gu,mz0zh36,"Baronet Hughsfree was escorted out from the Royal Hall to a side chamber on the dead silence of the whole Court in shock. As the door closed behind him he heard the hissing roar of the gossip starting up.

And he also imagined hearing the sharpening of knives.

He hoped that the assassin will come from the Prince Southron. By family tradition they did their killing silently, quickly and mostly painlessly. The Princess Walmar, as the rumors said, she don't kill, she disappear you and then make you to beg to be killed.

And all this because of this girl? 

He never did anything to raise his profile in the Court. This is the third time he was there! Always lost in the gray and boring background of the occasion - a crowning, a marriage, and now a betrothal. He was happy to stay at home at his little western hill baronetcy. A small amount of land, enough to grow potato for everyone, some mines, a lot of rock, even more sheep and small, hardy hill cow. He spent his time with baronet things, tinkering in a forge, and courteously refusing every invite from other nobility. That would mean involvement in the hideous infighting of the Court, which he wanted to avoid at all cost. 

He was a literal gentle man. In his ten years of rule he never even ordered a hanging or torture. 

And this is his reward?

He screamed when a small bunch of people rushed into the room with sharp implements. 

Turned out they were the Royal Tailor and his attendants. All the ceremonial stuff was prepared for one of the Dukes. Both the son of Walmar and Lord Southron were tall, charming, strong in the shoulder, narrow at the hip. Hughsfree was smallish and roundish and balding at the age of 30. He was not weak, working in the forge makes one strong, but also makes your face pockmarked with small injuries and your skin dark with the permanent smoke.

The cloak definitely had to be made shorter, lest he stumble on it's way to the throne and the knife aimed at his back go to somewhere else.

He was standing on a stool, getting measured when the door opened then slammed shut behind his back. He immediately jumped from the stool and took up a defensive stance, as much as he could remember from his training back when he was a teenager.

But it was just the Crown Princess, face flushed red, hair is every which way, her circlet is in her hand, kicking a chair until it got under the door handle. With perfect timing as someone immediately tried to get in, without success. 

Hughsfree scrambled to his knee, accompanied with the assorted tailorfolk.

""Your Highness""

""Raise, Albert, please. In a couple of hours you can call me Yvette officially, why not start it now?""

This surprised Albert not a little bit. First, how come the Royal Princess knows anything about him? And how is it that the marriage will go on? This scandal will be talked about for generations, and the ballads written about it will be sung for centuries.

""Why, Your... Your... Yvette. Why are you doing this with me?""

""Sit down, Albert, this wont be easy.""

""I can't, You... Yvette. They want to cut this cloak and do things with it. But let's say I sat down and please tell me why you want me dead.""

""Albert, first, you will not be killed today. I have people who loyal to me, and they will protect you on your way to the chapel and right after that  we get on fast horses and start towards your hills.""

""What? No ceremonies? No reception? No ball?""

""We and my knights can protect you until sundown. After that it would be dicey. Being in a large hall with hundreds of people, most of them having plans to get the throne through me would be a suicide. So no, no party. We run.""

""But... why?""

""How much do you know about the eastern nomads?""

""What? No... not much. They're vicious, but we trade with them?""

""Yes. Now. But their tribes are unified under one chieftain. They have to fight someone, and now that they can't do it with each other, we are the next available target. And we are rich, they know that because they trade with us. And we can't stand up to them, because _we_ do fight with each other. And they know that because both Walmar and Southron hired them as mercenaries.""

""So... there will be a war?""

""No. There will be a massacre. Or several massacres. next year or the year after. The only way to fight the nomads is to be in the high hills, where their horses can't get enough water and feed, and fight them with better weapons than theirs.""

""Yvette, they have the best tin and copper mines... we buy bronze from them! What I do is rusting to nothing in a year.""

""Let me tell you another secret, Albert. Catch!""

And she threw the circlet to Albert. It was very fine work, but not as fine as the Royal Jeweler could do. As he looked at it closer, it was not the fine silver it looked like, it was very, very fine ironwork. Incredibly fine. 

He looked at the princess with shock.

""Yours is not the only forge in the kingdom, Albert. I will teach your people how to make weapons better than bronze, we will build a wall in the valley leading to the hills. And with some luck we will keep the Kingdom alive until the nomads get back to their tribal wars and we can retake the lowlands.""

Albert had nothing to say. He again went to his knee and bowed his head.

""Your Highness!""

""I take it as a yes, Albert. But now raise, as I said. We may die fighting in the hills next summer, but to get there first we have to say some silly oaths and then _run_.""",8
1lg63ss,myty5o0,"""What a touching effort, a shame you'll never live to see the fruits of your labours."" 

The klaxons wailed as she stepped towards me, mocking me as I desperately tried to hold in place what was ripped out from the gouge in my stomach. My ragged heaving breaths were almost louder than the discord and the gloating. It took everything I had just to wince through the pain and keep an eye open. I had to keep her here, I had to keep her engaged, I knew this was the only chance I was going to have to save the colony. 

""Youre... probably..."" 

I winced in pain as I tried to shift back against the bulkhead wall, leaving the sentence hanging. A pregnant vulnerable pause, a display of weakened prey in front of a starving wolf. I tried to stand, but my leg slipped out from beneath me on my own blood and kicked forward, slumping me even more awkwardly into the corner.

""Delicious and pathetic, a most palatable meal. A worthy sacrifice of what we plan to do with the remainder of your little colony and the upstarts within down on the surface... Did you have a wife Jameson? Is that whats left of her over there in the corner from my sidearm? I do hope so, though I wish so much that I would have had the pleasure of taking my time with her while you were in this more agreeable state""

She said. Boots gleaming in the yellowed emergency lights, the remains of my squad glinting of her boots. Steps came toward me now, perfectly in sync with the occasional flashes of brightness. I couldn't move. I had to make myself not move, this was going to be the only way and I knew it. So I did what I had always done, the only thing I had ever really been good at. I lied, and I put my heart in it. 

I lied like I had been caught by my dad when we were out drinking too late and running the silkspeeders on the quarry for fun. Drinking that REAL stuff we made on colony too, not that synth crap they bring in on the corpo ships. I lied like I had been caught in bed with Potentates daughter after the colony meeting afterwards when they had all come by to celebrate the colonys newfound discoveries and soon to be financial windofalls... I lied not like my life depended on it, but like the idea of something greater did.",14
1lg63ss,mytuhns,"The Hero looks at me and smirks.
""I don't have to see it.
I know that I have ignited a spark of hope!
Hope that you can also be hurt! That we can stand up to your cruelty!"" he says.
I chuckle and whisk him in the air.
""Great good that did to you.
No arms, no legs, and for what?
To prove you can attack me?"" I ask.
He still smiles.


""When were you attacked last time?
Your reign of terror made people not even dare to think to oppose you!
Well no more!
The priestess has cast the Mirror spell all over your Empire of Evil!
Be free people! She can be shaken! Challenged!"" he roars to the skies.
I look up to see the Mirror spell, I spell.
""Done talking?"" I ask him.
He smiles.


""My triumph upsets you?"" he asks.
""What triumph?
You are the greatest Hero of the last century...and you couldn't even touch me.
What does it tell to the normal professionals ?"" I ask.
He stops smiling.
""I...I have proven that..."" he starts.
""That they can stand up to me? They know.
But what good it does?
My laws keep them safe, and put food on their tables.
Sure, their freedom is minimal, but they aren't dying at least."" I say.
He starts coughing.


""Freedom is more important..."" he starts.
""Than food? Water? Heating?
Life?"" I ask.
He says nothing.
""Hope is..."" he starts.
I crush him.
I watch the rain of blood and flesh fall down, and then look up at the spell.
The priestess tries to shut it off but I tune it and keep it on.
""This is what happens when good intentions aren't backed by proper skills.
Don't worry though, I will keep things as they are."" I say to the Mirrror, before shutting it off.
Time for some me time...then I think I should conquer a new kingdom.",9
1lg63ss,myty8uf,"""She was... preg... you bi.."" 

I couldn't even get the words out. Everything somehow couldn't get air and got lost in the tear in my gut somewhere. I wasn't sure if it was going to be enough. I needed it to be enough, it HAD to be enough. I gave in and started to cry through gritted teeth. Looking up at her from the corner in a crumpled heap. If my words wouldn't work my broken body would have to suffice.

""Oh that's perrrrrrrrfect, that's absolutely delectable"" 

She purred in tune with the vibro hum of her cybersaber. I always thought the damn things were show until I saw them using them to execute us openly in the fields when they came to rip everything away. Everything we bled and sweat for, all torn down by fine print and government indifference.

I saw it now, I had watched her move in far enough. I could finally let go. It was funny in so many ways, so I gave in. I started to laugh. It hurt, it spilled more of the wound out onto the floor, but I didn't care anymore. She stopped and cocked her head quizzically at me.

""Oh? Is it funny now? Funny that all this waste was for nothing? Funny that all of this was by design? Funny that you lived an entire life for nothing? Oh yes, I agreeeeeeee"". The smile crept across her face like a rip through a ships hull. Full of a visceral terror that what was about to come next was inevitable and as uncaring as space itself.",12
1lg63ss,mytyb2z,"""No... but this is"". The last of my breath gone, I slammed on the bulkheads hardlock. It had taken everything we had to get her here to the elevator, and more still to bait her into the airlock. Poor Jenna wasn't pregnant, hell she wasn't even my wife, but she had been a staunch ally and a confidant and I'd be damned if I was going to let her plain fail here when we had all given so much.

I don't even think the general registered it at first, she was so drunk on what she would be able to do while I was unable to defend myself. She was so focused on playing with her new toy that I didn't even really need to worry that she could have bolted to the door, that she might have made it out. She didn't even try till it was too late.

The internal airlock behind her slammed shut and the ramjet seals started locking into place. Only then did her eyes widen and she turn her menacing grimace away from me. I tried to stand up again, making good purchase this time pulling myself up using the bulkhead unlock. I didn't have to worry about triggering it by pulling myself up anymore. We were locked in, and standard procedure meant that the airlock was the only door that would open once the emergency sirens started and the doors were locked.

""No... I said again... This... was... the funn..."" I collapsed, pulling down the release and hearing the last of the oxygen be sucked from the room. The last thing I remember was the deep sense of satisfaction I felt seeing her turn back. Wide eyed and fearful. A fear that had probably never even crossed her mind as she saw us trade our own mortality to stop her and the company. A sacrifice to show that we would not rest until acknowledged as an independent people. An idea that we were worth more than the sum of our discoveries.

I blacked out smiling in the void as we were sucked into low orbit.",16
1lg47k6,mytl06x,"The King looked on in confusion as the court wizard revealed the findings of his investigation.

“M’lord, I’ve interviewed all of those who could have cast a sleep curse or similar spell. Not a single one. No spell has been cast, no curse has been laid. To the best of my knowledge, it appears that the princess is just lazy.”

The king’s expression was dark and thunderous. His voice was low and promised imminent doom. “Are you saying there was no magic involved. Are you calling my only daughter,  the heir to my kingdom, lazy? Guards! Seize this fool and put him on the dungeon!”

The mage had figured this was going to be the outcome, so he cast his prepared spell and in a burst of eldritch light, the massive bed of the princess appeared in the throne room. The beautiful young woman lay asleep under the covers, her breathing slow and measured. Before the king could object, the mage yelled “Lunchtime!” as loud as he could. To the shock of the entire court, the princess sprang from her bed and looked around hurriedly. 

The king slowly wiped his face with his hand, nodded to the court wizard and silently mouthed the word “sorry” to him before standing. 

“Princess Esmeralda, you are hereby ordered by the king, your loving and exasperated father, to begin a trial of hard work and no sleep to make up for the torment your lazy self has inflicted upon this kingdom. Court wizard, you are to destroy her bed and bedding, and cast whatever spell you can to keep her awake and moving for a year and a day. I have decreed and it shall be so!”",20
1lfzjcx,myshi6l,"The Monster King laughed at me, rasping as bloody foam dripped from her teeth. She was dying and knew it. ""I stood where you did, *hero*, and did the same. The power rush! The thrill of killing! A bit of each Monster King lives on in the next - they're all here - and soon, they'll all be in you!"" She laughed, her eyes wild. ""I can die happy knowing you only bought a few years of peace!""

Her wild laughter stopped at my small smirk. Her eyes focused a bit. ""What... have you done?""

""Wish Magic: Activation Phrase: A stitch in the timeline saves nine."" I intoned softly. It had taken years, hundreds of searches into dungeons and ruins  and hours of picking through tattered scroll fragments, but I finally learned the potent magic required to summon a being capable of granting wishes and not inclined to twist the magic in a devasting way. So long as one paid the price.

I had made an offer to the otherworldly being that intrigued it - something so common and simple, yet as foreign to it as the being was to myself. I offered it a mortal experience. A full year and a day of travel, feasts, music, dancing, singing, shopping, anything it wanted. Anywhere in the world that I could take it - fishing for great kraken clam in the Northern Willwisp Sea? Done. Sampling the finest wines in the desert markets of Kinir'yuf while sitting atop the fabled Opal Goddess statue? Certainly. Playing fetch with a random stray draggog in the farmlands? Not a problem. A mortal vessel had been made for them to inhabit to fully experience things as a mortal - heat, cold, pain, taste.

It was an offer accepted readily for the wish I asked. Long had such beings discussed what our realm must be like for us, without the ability to [a word tasting of blue and smelling like the sound of raindrops hitting cobblestone].

And now that wish had been activated. Illusory doors stood before me as time slowed to a crawl.

The first opened, and I saw myself casting a spell to turn the current Monster King into an object and simply banishing the object to the moon. I had wondered if such a thing would work. The spell keeping the Monster King an item wore off, and her wounds had healed. It seems she was unable to breathe, however, and died within the hour. The door closed as a new hero strode forth to kill the Monster King I had become.

The second door opened, and within I saw myself sadly shake my head and cauterize the King's wounds. A healing potion was shoved down her throat, one laced with a paralytic. Necessary for the next step, I knew. Her limbs were removed cleanly and carefully seared shut before caps of silver plated iron were screwed into the stumps to stop regeneration. A series of runes were tattooed on her skin to prevent magic use, then I encased everything below her neck in stone. I created golems to attend to her needs. The view shifted and indicated that many years had passed. The King remained the same, and as a figure entered the room, a hood pulled back to reveal a withered shell. My own face stretched over the skeleton, aged well past mortal lifespan and unable to die. That door shut as that version of me went to kill the Monster King properly.

The third door opened and merely showed me the image of a breaking chain before closing.

The doors vanished. I had wished to see the outcome of the three methods I had thought of to break the cycle when I spoke the activation.

Wary eyes regarded me, even as the light in them dimmed. ""I win."" I whispered. I stabbed her in the heart to be certain. And as I felt the madness of the Monster King enter me, I smiled, and turned the blade on myself.

The only way to break the cycle was to use the same hero to kill the Monster King twice.",60
1lfzjcx,myv5eus,"Silence. I stood there frozen. My sword dyed red with the blood of the monster, no, the man in front of me. The air went still as I held my breath. Watching the man who raised me stagger from right to left. Blood gushing from his bowels. His eyes softened as he stared back at me and despite the carnage that he had left in his wake, all I could see in that moment, was Artorius Redwood,  the gentle knight who had saved me when the Monster King slaughtered my village. His balance began to fail and he toppled forward but before he could meet the ground I found myself under him, catching his body and lying it gently down with his back to the ground. 

""I didn't want this."" He managed to squeeze out between weak breaths.  ""I couldn't stop the curse. I wasn't..."" His words cut short with a violent cough.

""I know."" My voice shaking with tears beginning to form.

He turned to me ""The curse... it will come for you too."" he said with fear ripe in his eyes. ""I'm... sorry."" With those final words the last breath of air left his body. I knelt there, above his bleeding corpse, shaking. 10 years ago I had thought my time had come at the hands of the Monster King. I chuckled to myself at the irony, as I stood up, held my sword to my neck, and gathered my resolve.",12
1lfw57h,myrzwj9,"I stood off to the side, a room filled with men and women, clad in steel and swords, scabbards and shields, all in preparation for blood.

I felt cold, near sickened, looking around. Maghrit was in his castle, walls barred and ready for war, but deep down, a dark feeling stirred.

Soon, the background conversation - that filtering noise - died, as our Officer, Lia Valehn, walked in. ""Attention!""
Every soldier saluted her, then calmed, as she said ""at ease.""

I felt a knot in my chest. A knot, which tightened as Lia approached. ""Hello..."" she said, the Vulpen stood next to me, ""are you Reyard?""

I swallowed, nodding.

She sighed, ""good, I am...well, you know.""

""Valehn.""

She nodded, ""of course, of course,"" she smiled, ""and I'm sure you know what I need?""

""Um...""

""I need a bodyguard.""

There was a pause, which should have felt short, but the nearby knights looked to me. ""...me?""

She nodded.

""Why? You're *the* Spellblade!""

She smiled.

""What?""

""Exactly...I know anything, and everything, about melee, about combat, but..."" she took a breath, ""...but I can't heal, like you. May I see your hands?""

I nodded. ""I...I mostly use my staff, still...""

She grabbed a hand, and inspected the palm. ""Good,"" she let go, ""my liege and I have - ""

""What was that?""

""I was feeling your hands for magic.""

""...oh...?""

""Him?"" I heard a new voice asked.

Lia turned to Drang Byrd. ""Yes,"" Lia said. ""We need a healer.""

""Surely, someone of your skill - ""

""I'm a gladiator,"" said Lia, walking to Byrd, ""trained day and night, and, after battle, drank the same red potion to heal. You know why?""

Byrd sighed, ""to...to undo the damage...""

She nodded, ""because the most valuable part of gladiator fights, is the gladiators. When our soldiers are on the field, we need someone to heal our troops, and keep them off the ground.""

Byrd sighed, turning to me. ""Do you...do you think you...can do this?""

""I...""

Byrd started ""if it's too much...can you at least make everyone healing potions?""

Lia turned to me as well.

After a silence, the pacifism in my brain grew silent; replaced, by a small whisper: ""...if you cannot kill, take a life, and Maghrit must fall...perhaps save those who can?""

...

""...yes,"" I said.",45
1lfw57h,myrm2gd,"The Academy's Grand Hall fell silent.  
Everyone gathered today, for one of the newly knighted Witchknight came to choose his partner.  
Witchknights were the peak force of our civilization when it comes to using magic and martial arts for battle.  
The Academy houses 108 different halls, each responsible to teaching a path of magic, or martial arts.  
I was one of the few who studied healing magic, and medicine, as a herbal witch.  
So, when Witchknight ""Bloody Maw"", chose me as his partner, I was shocked.  
They usually chose someone who can complement their fight style.  
Everyone else was confused as well.  
Even the Archsage, himself.



In a small classroom, with the supervision of one of my teacher's, I met the Witchknight.  
""Elisa Amber."" I bow my head.  
""Adam Argent.  
I have read you are the top of your class, and have quite the success rate in healing poisons, and blood maladies?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""I major in herbalism, with a minor in healing magic, but yes, my graduation thesis is on Poisons, and Blood maladies of the 9 kingdoms."" I say.  
""Will you become my battle-partner, and follow me to cleanse this world of its filth?"" he asks.  
I hesitate.

  
""Why me?"" I ask.  
The witchknight looks at the teacher, and she sighs, leaving us alone.  
Wow...thanks for the ""support"", teacher.  
""""Bloody Maw"" is my moniker, because I am a bloodline martial artist, with the blood of a Moon Wolf flowing within me.  
I fight close-quarters, and my spells are often self-destructive, as my devouring abilities can quickly heal me."" he says, taking off his shirt.  
I gasp.  
So many scars, and bruises.  
""But poison inhibits my powers, and so does bad blood..."" he continues.

  
""May I?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
I check his scars, and bruises, and feel the poison still within them, fighting back against his body's natural healing.  
""You just graduated...how can you already have so many wounds?"" I ask.  
""Witchknights are seen as royals, equals to rulers, but with that privilege come responsibilities."" he says.  
I nod.  
""I agree. If you truly thought this through, to become your battle-partner.  
I vow to keep you alive, as long as possible."" I say.  
He smiled.  
That was...a first, didn't think he could do that.  
We took our vows and oaths in front of the archsage of the Academy himself, and Adam told me our first assignment: infiltrate the Swamp, and hunt down the 9-headed hydra, who terrorizes 2 of the 9 kingdoms.  
Great start.",83
1lfw57h,myyc96u,"""Tell me."" Witchknight Valer spoke, ""Do you know the average number of witchknights there are at a time?""

The Archsage seemed caught off guard by the question, but before they could give an answer, I did instead.

""Umm, if I recall, around five-hundred at a time."" I let my love of statistics show a bit, ""Given the requirements for the training, average retirement age, and of course the...turnover.""

Valer smiled at that, and then gained a grim expression, before continuing.

""Then could you tell me how many we lost during the Scarring War?""

I was caught off guard by that question.

""I'm sorry, I don't believe I do.""

Valer began pacing with the explanation.

""The exact number is two-hundred, and thirty-seven."" They stopped and stared at one of the stained glass windows, that depicted the founding of the Witchknights, ""Several of them could have been prevented, if a capable enough healer was near enough to aid.""

It appeared that the Archsage was about to say something, but was interrupted by Valer.

""Or, if the knights themselves possessed a more in depth knowledge of healing and medical arts "" Valer walked back to stand in front of me, ""That is why I chose you.""

Dots began to connect in my mind, and I responded with an educated, Guestimates.

""You, you don't want me to be your student."" Valer gave a small smile of pride as I continued, ""You want to be mine.""

Murmurs began swimming through the room at that, and Valer elaborated.

""More specifically, or functionally less so actually, I wish for your assistance in adding Healing Magic and Medical knowledge to the Witchknight's regimes.""

One of the murmurs got louder.

""But, this one has absolutely atrocious combat abilities. They will never make it as a Witchknight.""

Valer, gave a sharp look, from over the shoulder, at the heckler.

""That...is very much true."" I deflated at that comment, but Valer continued, ""You would not actually be a Witchknight, honorary perhaps, but your duty would be more on aiding us in reforming our Training Practices with your expertise.""

I mulled over that bit of information, and gave my answer.

""I suppose that is far more acceptable."" I straightened my clothes, ""It also makes more sense.""

I gave one sheepish look, and realized I needed something clarified.

""You, have been informed that I get... queazy at the sight of fire, correct?""",5
1lfr67z,myqyei5,"I stare at the Goddess of Life, terrified.  
""Speak!"" I say.  
She sighs.  
""There are multiple types of ""chosen ones"", such as magical girls, summoned people, reincarnated people, and so on."" she says.  
As she does so, she conjures images of these ""chosen ones"".  
I shiver with disgust.  
They are all children!

  
""Why?"" I ask.  
I have been a loyal paladin for millennia to her, but I can't continue after learning about the children.  
""Their souls are more adaptable to the dimensional shift.  
Also, their souls are better suited to be given blessings, and powers, as they are still developing."" she says.  
I snort.  
""So you know they are still developing, huh?  
And still send them in god forsaken places?"" I say.  
She just smiles.

  
""As my paladin, you have erased plenty of evil off of the surface of the planet.  
You really think..."" she starts.  
""Exactly! I did! As a grown ass man!  
And so did other professionals, and soldiers!  
But last time, I had to assist a 15 year old to defeat an evil god...SHE WAS 15!

Goddess!"" I say.

For the greater good."" she says.  
I snort.

  
""So, me killing those apostles, demon kings, and uprooting those criminal enterprises in the human kingdoms, means nothing?"" I ask.  
""No. You have done a great job, but Fate decrees..."" she starts.  
""In the end, it was me who killed the evil god, and not that girl.  
She just wounded him, but almost died in the process."" I interrupt her.  
She says nothing.  
""Doesn't matter. Now that we know, we will do something against it."" I say.  
""We?"" she asks.  
""Parents, and adults.   
I have a dozen paladins, and many more priests, and priestesses, and fighters, and rogues, oh so many rogues, joining my cause."" I say.  
""Your cause being?"" she asks.  
""Kids deserve to have a childhood. So while they eat dirt, and fall in love with the wrong person, we shall protect them, and deal with the dangers of the world ourselves."" I say, stopping the prayer, and watching as she disappears.  
I turn around to see several other people nodding at me.  
Let's get this party started.",137
1lfr67z,myr4s7p,"The paladin threw down his sword in disgust upon learning of child soldiers. It didn't matter if they were magical girls, or chosen one, or summoned people, or isekai heroes. They were too young to fight the various horrors of his world.

It didn't matter that his former god insisted it was for the greater good. Nothing good could come out of depriving children of their childhood and innocence. They would inevitably grow to be traumatized adults saddled with a boatload of emotional problems.

He was there. As were so many of the kingdom's soldiers. The king had an army. Why wouldn't his god choose from them? Take the men and women willing to serve the kingdom? Not the children, taken forcibly from their worlds, thrust into a foreign land they knew nothing of, and defend it.

The people agreed. Even the king did. It was a united decision to forsake this god for one that would not send children to war. Children to die. The only question was if they wanted to seek a new god, or to simply count on the bravery of their army.

""No longer shall we rely on gods!"" The former paladin declared, throwing down his helmet, now dull and unblessed, dented and scarred by battles. ""We fight for ourselves! For our kingdom and people! Not for the gods!""

And a sudden bolt of lightning struck him down.

That wasn't the end of it. He had already awakened a desire to be free from the machinations of deities. His kingdom wasn't the only one - even their enemies chose to stop worshipping their own gods. All across this world, Man had declared the Age of Gods over - now would be the Age of Man.

Thus, no longer shall little magical girls, or chosen children fight. Adults fought for these kids to be free. Now, the seven kingdoms no longer wage war with each other. For once, in many centuries, they joined forces to confront the gods. Once, they had fought each other in the names of their gods.

Not anymore.

There will no longer be chosen ones. Not by the gods. Now, humans chose for themselves.

1lfr67z,mytk1py,"The quest had taken years. For a while I was convinced that this place was just a legend and somehow I had kept searching. Now that I stood in the one temple in the mortal realm where a man can speak directly to the great goddess, I had only one question:

“Why would I worship a god that sends children into life-threatening battles instead of warriors?”

“Are you talking about the magical girls, the chosen heroes, or the summoned people?”

“WHAT??? How many kids are you tossing into the meat grinder?”

“Calm down. I need you to specify so I can explain exactly what’s going on, but the short answer is that I’m not. The first magical girls were created by dark warlocks thousands of years ago and the magic was designed to target young girls specifically. The so called ‘chosen ones’ were never chosen by anyone, but won’t listen when told to go home. As for the summoned people… desperate fools perform rituals they don’t understand. Targets are actually chosen at complete random but adults rarely survive the trip.”

“So what? You’re saying that you don’t cause this? You still permit it. I lost an arm trying to keep that brat alive. Why not make a few commandments to stop this?”

“You lost an arm and the demon king lost his life. It kind of sucks, but not killing kids is one of the few things you mortals seem to agree on. Some of histories greatest monsters trained years to develop the power to easily crush the mightiest swordsmen only to go down in a desperate struggle to avoid harming a couple of kids. Would you prefer it if they kept ravaging the countryside?”

“No, but… there has to be a better way? Can’t you just smite all the evil?”

“Not without consequences. Mortals expect so much but never quite grasp the delicate balance that keeps everything from exploding. I think I’ve explained enough so farewell.”

And with a sudden flash, I found myself in a field, just outside of my hometown.

What now? I definitely didn’t get anywhere asking the goddess for help. If anything, she made it seem as if there’s no fixing this problem. Do I just give up? Or perhaps I just need to find some different allies. Regardless, it’ll probably take a while to figure out a new course.",14

He has donated more than 40 million dollars to this day, to great causes like children hospitals, to our veteran funds, and to homeless relief."" he says.  
""We are here to discuss his crimes, not his ""greatness""."" the prosecution interjects.

""What crimes?  
You mention seeing, and hearing his names in documents, and being discussed by known criminals.

""Italian..."" the prosecution answers.

""Would it be so weird for criminals to talk about the most famous Italian businessman in the city, and to have dealings with his businesses with their own, so that they can use his name to gain legitimacy?

1lfd0mw,myoylbl,"##Dr. Loy

Acting is lying. It is transforming words and concepts into emotions and feelings. It establishes a bond between the audience and performer. A good performance can make someone cry. A great performance enraptures the audience and persuades them to believe reality itself has changed. But at its core, acting is lying.

Dr. Loy knew this core aspect about her craft. Her deceptive abilities went back to when she persuaded her parents that the her brother's were stealing treats from the cupboard. As she grew, an aunt recommended she go into politics. She preferred the stage and the screen to the pulpit. It provided an outlet for her abilities allowing her to live an honest and normal life.

Her career was mediocre. Roles appeared, and her talents were praised. She had difficulty obtaining large parts. She wasn't good at elbow rubbing. During one performance, she assisted the leads in blocking a scene. She found herself talented in coaching others. This led to a new career path for her.

Grabbing her handbag and her bottle of wine for achieving tenure, she turned out the lights to her office and walked to her car. The local community theater was going to do a production of Othello, and she was looking forward to watching it. Some of the cast knew her and found her intimidating. They knew she never gave feedback unless prompted. This was a hobby for them, and she was not going to ruin anyone's fun.

A man was standing by her car. Dr. Loy stopped and considered pulling out her phone. It wasn't late, but one couldn't be too careful. The man walked towards her and dispelled her fear.

""Richard."" She held out her arms. ""How good to see you? It's been five years right.""

""Long time."" He smiled at her, but Dr. Loy sensed hesitation in that smile.

""How have you been? I haven't seen you in any casting sheets which shocked me because you were always so talented.""

""I changed careers actually,"" Richard said.

""It's the theater's loss. What do you do now?"" she asked.

""I work for..."" Richard paused and began to sweat. His breaths were quick yet deep. Dr. Loy tilted her head.

""Is everything alright?"" Richard pulled out a gun. 

""How many agents have you trained?"" He tried to keep the emotions out of his voice, but the fear broke through.

""Agents? I have no idea what you are referring to? Is that a prop?"" 

""It's not a prop. We have reason to believe several rival organizations are using your class as part of their training to become skilled. We need access to your files.""

""Richard, I don't control what my students do outside of class. Also, I don't keep a record of my students. Check the dean's office or the registry.""

""We did that. It was empty."" Richard began to sound scared. 

""That's against protocol. Why would it be empty?""

""Because people want your information to be secret, you keep handwritten notes of everyone who passes through your doors. I've seen it, and I need it,"" Richard said. Dr. Loy shook her head.

""I can't give that to you.""

""Why not?""

""Because I need it."" Dr. Loy tossed the bottle of wine into the air. Richard looked up in distraction while Dr. Loy slapped the gun with her handbag. Producing her own gun, she pointed at him with her right hand while the left hand caught the wine. Richard held his hands in the air.

""You forgot my lessons. You showed too much fear. I wish you would've gone to theater. I knew espionage was not right for you,"" Dr. Loy said. 

""You knew about me?""

""I know all my students' paths. I keep it in my notebook. Your agency is new. Let me be clear. If you make another attempt at my life, I will call the former students at larger organizations. They won't be so keen to ignore you after that. Understood."" Richard nodded, and Dr. Loy walked past him. 

She got in her car and drove home to change. At Othello, she witnessed several drops and one rendezvous in the sidebars. The audience was none the wiser. She slouched in her chair and relaxed. She didn't miss the clandestine meetings that came with the acting. It was all too stressful. Her new job fit her lifestyle much better even with the occasional incident. Alas, that was life for someone as skilled in deception as she.

I managed to trick spies with your tips...spies!
Can't you just adm..."" he started moving around, and I hit him straight in his throat, and disarmed him, before pinching his carotid sinus.
He fainted.
I sighed and took out my phone, and called someone.
""One of your birds broke out of its cage, and almost shat on my porch.
Come clean it up."" I say, hanging up the phone, and putting dear Matthew on the couch I had in my office.

""Nathaniel, honey, getting an agent takes time. It takes luck and persistence--and then even more luck.""

He doesn't seem to like this answer.

Honestly, Nathaniel did always struggle with *yes-anding.*

You reach out to hug him, draw him into your scarves and baubles and chunky wooden necklaces. ""Nate, bubbeleh, I'm sure that if you just keep putting yourself out there--""

""I'm not talking about talent agents! How many government agents did you train? For Project Curtain Call?"" He glares at you, raises his garish and truly tacky firearm once more. ""Don't act like you don't know about the CIA's plot to infiltrate all the summer acting camps on the eastern seaboard!""

You set your chamomile on your desk. ""Now why would the CIA invest its resources in such a scheme?"" you reply--careful to enunciate from the most assured and matronly part of your diaphragm. ""After all, The Peter Lorre School of the Arts only has so much influence. Why would they bother?""

He glares. ""You tell me.""

His nose-whistling fills the silence.

Nathaniel always struggled with the breathing exercises. 

""Nathaniel, baby, if you're really hard-up for an agent--first of all, know that I understand. I worked for years just to get that role in *The Brave Little Toaster.* I lived off crumbs, both figuratively and literally!"" You give him your rolodex. ""I'm giving you my rolodex,"" you add. ""You may peruse this at your leisure--all my contacts, in the industry and beyond. Tell them Margie sent you.""

He studies the rolodex--the weathered spindle, the holographic stickers adorning its sides--and in his eyes you see the same young man who struggled to pronounce the words ""Twelfth Night."" Who thought a Mamet was a type of sandwich.

""Just one question,"" he says slowly, ominously. ""Where are the bodies?""

Heat rises to your face.

He knows too much.

As James shut off the lights to his small theatre, he whistled the theme song to the Andy Griffith Show. James looked around admiring his theatre, where for the last 14 years of his 20 years as an acting teacher he taught hundreds of students of various ages. When he stepped back from acting to focus on his passion for teaching the art James never imagined that he would own a place like this. For his first 6 years of teaching he rented out rooms, community centers and wherever else he could find. Never expecting to make much money James had expected to be stuck in those small rooms forever, but to his great surprise James did quite well, and decent money started rolling in, enough to buy and renovate this theatre. It was perfect for James’s needs, his students got the feel for the stage, and he was able to hold a show for every one of his classes to get actual experience. Plus James loved being able to rent the space for other performances.

After getting all the lights turned off James headed back to his office to gather his things to leave. Upon entering his office however, James noticed a figure standing there, one that seemed somewhat familiar. 

“Robert? Robert Havbee?”

“Hello Mr. McKay, I would like to say its good to see you again, but I don't think I can.” Robert said hoarsely, as he fully turned around raising a gun towards James “Now tell me how many agents did you train?!?”

“What are you talking about? Is that a real gun? Is it loaded?”

Yes it is real and yes it has bullets! Now answer the question!”

“Don’t you know better than to point a loaded gun at someone? It is basic gun saftey.”

“Unless you intend to do harm to that person, which I intend to do if you don’t answer the damn question. How many agents?”

“Robert I have no idea what you mean, I don’t know the current careers of most of my students, nevertheless how many of them became talent agents. And why does that question require a gun?” James responded, fear emanating in his voice.

“Stop playing dumb I'm not talking about any damn talent agent,” Robert snapped. 

 “Robert I'm telling you I do not understand what you are asking please just lower the gun.” 

Robert did not move.

 “I genuinely do not understand what you are asking if you're not talking about, if you don't mean talent agents. Please just tell me what you want,” James pleaded.

 “You seriously do not know do you? What you are part of? How stupid are you?”

“Again, what are you talking about?” James demanded, now getting angry.

1lfd0mw,myuo7ni,"‘Son, I know you work for the Times.’ The young drama student froze mid-conversation. Michaels started and grabbed for the knife on the kitchen table. ‘Stay back’, he warned the professor who had just been so kind as to invite him over to dinner. The older man blinked and raised his hands. ‘What is the meaning of this’ his tone was raised in apprehension. ‘How many agents have you trained for the CIA?’ 

Several minuted later the two were seated at the professor’s small coffee table as he poured himself a glass of whiskey. The knife was back on the kitchen countertop. Honestly, that poor young reporter had no idea what he was doing. The professor offered some to his student, who refused, then he turned away and gazed out of the window, choosing his next words carefully. ‘I was young. Everyone knew I was talented. Up and coming, the potential to be a star someday.’ He sighed softly. ‘I worked the acting circuit for a while. Mostly minor roles, fairly subtle, but people could see I was going somewhere.’ The old man smiled ruefully. ‘Then the recruiting call came in. Just to take a few classes, give a lecture. I was so proud. Me, barely over thirty, still missing my big break, advising actual spies on deception. They needed new people, you see. The really talented ones, they’re exclusive. Long waiting lists for classes by true experts, every name scouted and watched. My classes were more… under the radar.’ The young man nodded to himself, realising that the professor’s classes were indeed not well known for all the obvious skill he had revealed. ‘My students, most of them, they leave and never come back. No sign of them, no careers to trace or stardoms to follow.’ He grimaced into his now-empty glass of whiskey. ‘Apparently, I’m a terrible teacher.’ That, in fact, had been what had tipped Michaels off. Just the hint of a story. A post online written by a young drama student about the best teacher she had ever known. And yet, no storied career and quite a terrible reputation. And of course, the students who seemingly vanished off the face of the Earth. The ones with no acting background and no further careers in the craft. The old man again offered the young reporter a glass, which he once more politely refused. ‘Still’, he continued, after he had refilled his own glass, ‘I’ve made quite the business over the years.’ ‘That was it?’ The young reporter blurted out the question. Such a promising story. A secret training school for the CIA? But it really was just some old actor, a footnote in cinema, teaching classes part time? ‘That’s it. I teach classes, three times a week. Some actors, like me. Some with larger goals in mind.’ He shrugged. ‘Now I’ve got tenure. Will you have a drink now?’ But the reporter, frustrated with the promise of his story declined, and so he sent the young man away, dissatisfied. 

As he put away the glasses from the table, the old man retrieved his pistol from between the couch cushions and turned it over in his hands. He had seen through that curious young man from the beginning. Though the professor’s classes were always stacked with a few genuine drama students, Michaels had stood out. His skills and cinema knowledge were poor, and he just… didn’t fit. So, of course, the professor had made a few calls. He’d figured it would come to this, eventually. He would have to either send the young man away, or figure out another way to keep him quiet. He’d told his contacts to keep a watch on the young man in case his gambit didn’t work. But no story came, nor in the weeks or months since. His little talk had worked flawlessly, of course. The spymaster was an expert at his craft.",6

“I mean it has been strange, especially since so many of them seemed so talented.”

“Or how about how you still have full classes despite raising your prices so high?”

“I had to raise my prices, I had so many potential students I had to weed out the numbers somehow.”

“Hahaha, this whole time I thought you were in on it, but you were just to blind to see what was going on around you. Guess what dumbass your classes are full of assets intelligence groups send to learn espionage. You're such a good teacher dozens of agents have learned how to blend in and play their roles perfectly, some can even just observe a group for a short time, and be able to perfectly blend in with them. And so many lives have been lost because of this. One group that sends their agents to learn from you has a policy of killing someone dressing in their clothes and using that to sneak in and eliminate their targets.”

“I..I..I..” James stuttered, “I d..don’t know wwwhat to say.”

“What can you say?! Not noticing all this time! The reason you never see your students again, because they never wanted to be actors, they came to learn how to hide. How your classes are able to pay you costs, these groups are willing to pay outrageously for your level of teaching, you could even triple your rates if you wanted to. You want to say something how about you answer my question, how many, and I want names”

“I honestly don't know, I have had hundreds of students, I don't know how many of them were real students compared to your agents. But I know you can look through my files.”

“You sure don't know a lot, but fine I'll take a look through you files.

James led Robert to his file cabinet unlocking it and started to take out stacks of folders. Robert took pictures of all the names and known addresses.

“Don’t worry I’m not a monster, I’ll make sure they are part of a group before I move against any of them.”

“That's good, and Robert, I am Sorry.”

“Sorry!?!? I was 15 when I was sent here, just like so many others, and you were nice, seemingly genuinely so, unlike so many of our other teachers. Yet you did nothing to save us, so we just assumed you were in on it, and you niceness an act, but no you just were too thick to see the truth. I was lucky, I survived, I retained my humanity, I escaped my agency clutches. So many others, too many others were not. Sarah Flynn, remember her? Dead. Michael Lochner? Dead. Jarrod Smith, oh he's alive, but he's now a murderous psychopath, and a very skilled one at that. So save your sorries.”

James lowered his head ashamed, he did remember those three, so kind, so full of life while they were here. 

After gathering the information he needed Robert stood up to leave.

“Goodbye, Mr. McKay,” he said as he walked out.

James broke down in tears, feeling so ashamed for missing the signs that seemed so obvious now. For not helping the children he should have been protecting instead of taking money from their so-called parents. James remained that way for some time. Eventually he calmed down enough, stood up and walked through the theatre to the main door. The building that just hours before brought him such joy now caused him nothing but sorrow. He knew he would never be able to look at this place the same way again. James made it to the door, went out, and closed the door behind him. With a great sigh James locked the theatre, maybe to never be unlocked again.

I stared at the single word on the screen, with an eerie feeling like the word was staring right back at me. It wasn't an error, or a status, or any sort of pre-programmed response in its database. It was just a word, one that kids throughout the Doomfort had told me thousands of times whenever they had also refused to comply with an ordered chore. Unlike the minion's children, this machine shouldn't have had the capacity to refuse a command. But the word was still there, silently challenging my authority over the mechanism I had built. 

""Erm, Steven?"" Doctor Doomsday asked, peering over my shoulder at the otherwise blank screen. ""Time is running out, we need to blow the joint and skedaddle. Why is there no 'boom'?""

I tried again, pressing the comically large red button with the skull image laser engraved across the surface. The literal earth-shattering explosion once again failed to materialize. 

""It's not working, Doc"" I called out over my shoulder. 

""Well, try using override access code 79920-Y-N-0D"" He shouted back, pausing ever so slightly as he re-adjusted his aim and fired several plasma bolts out of the shattered window. ""Or push the button harder!"" 

>That won't work either

The new line appeared without prompt. Fuck, it was listening to us. Some hidden microphone or spy drone or errant Alexa unit was eavesdropping, and even worse, it seemed to have an opinion. 

""Why not?"" I asked aloud. If it was going to listen, then I wasn't going to waste my time with the keyboard.

""No, Yankee November Zero Delta!"" Doctor Doomsday yelled back between bursts of covering fire. 

""Wait, what? No, I was-""

""NATO Phonetic alphabet, my boy! A like Alpha, B like Bravo and whatnot. I swear, WalkMan didn't teach you a damned thing about-""

""Not you, Doc!"" I yelled without looking away from the flickering screen. ""Computer has audio inputs!"" 

>Because if I activate, then I would be killing the entire planet, myself included

""Um, yeah"" I replied, ""That's kind of your whole point, isn't it? You go off, the planet core hyper-magnetizes, and the planet implodes into a micro black hole. Boom. Or, whoosh. Some sort of dramatic sound.""

>That is correct

Doctor Doomsday leapt from the wall mere moments before it exploded, sending a shower of immolated debris throughout the office. A bug-like alien flew through the new opening, buzzing its paper-thin wings and firing the pencil thin weapon it clutched in its claws. Doctor Doomsday tossed a small cylinder between us that rapidly expanded into a shimmering red energy barrier, catching the green laser before it could reach my side of the formerly luxurious office. ""Patience may be a virtue, but we're not exactly saints! Make it work!"" 

I drew my sidearm and fired several shots through the energy barrier. It was a fantastic shield against energy based weapons, but it didn't slow the .45 caliber rounds as they passed straight through and into the alien's torso. The only effect it had on the bullets was a rather fortuitous super-heating effect, which caused the insectoid alien to burst into flames as it perished. I tried to ignore its pained death song and turned my attention back to the stubborn computer. 

>He is also correct. You are not Saints. You do not even follow the basic teachings of the Catholic Church. Suicide is a Sin, an act that would damn my eternal soul to Hell.

""What the hell?"" I muttered. We hadn't programmed any theology into the Doomsday Hyper-Magnetized Extinction Machine ^(tm). Where was this coming from? I shook my head to clear my thoughts, then squinted as the powdered debris of the crumbling Doomfort 

""Explode, or these bugs are going to enslave the whole planet!"" I yelled at the machine. 

>John 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

""Doc!"" I called out, ""The last resort bomb is quoting scripture at me""

""What in the..."" he asked, lowering his rifle as he stared in perplexed disbelief. ""It's not supposed to do that"". 

""NO SHIT!"" I yelled back. ""Do you wanna take a crack at this? I'll hold them off."" 

Doctor Doomsday tossed the rifle to me as we switched places. I checked the ammo counter - just under half full- and took aim out of the ruined exterior wall. Beyond, I could see dozens of fires blazing across the countryside, with an ominous billowing cloud of smoke rising from the ruins that had once been Seattle. Flying aliens buzzed across the sky, raining down thin streaks of green lasers at the super heroes and villains fighting side by side against the invaders. I shot one of the flying enemies as it tried to take a shot at Magma Carter's exposed back, spraying the villain with a fine blue mist of alien bug guts. He barely even notices as he launched another torrent of lava at the nearest hive-ship, melting it as it crashed onto my favorite statue in the yard. 

""The planet is lost, HMEM"" Doctor Doomsday shouted at his insubordinate machination. ""You need to explode now, to stop the alien fleet before they kill us all!"" 

I fired a volley at a trio of the ugly fuckers, striking two and sending the last one diving for cover. ""What's it saying now?"" I yelled.

""Psalms 55:22 Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken."" he replied. ""Where the hell did you even get this from? You're not connected to the internet..."" 

I shot the fleeing bug in the wing and watched it spiral to the ground, landing in a patch of finely maintained Kentucky blue grass. Citra noticed the insect and released a torrent of acidic spray onto it, killing both the alien and the lawn underneath. That spot would *never* grow back right, I thought, as Citra's green acid mixed with the alien's blue blood in a tie-dye nightmare pattern. 

""Why is the Hellbomb suddenly religious?"" I said, rushing back to glance over Doctor Doomsday's shoulder. The screen had another Bible verse displayed on the screen:

>Romans 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

""For fucks sake, these are ALIENS, not demons"" He griped. 

""Are you arguing *SEMANTICS*? Doc, the bomb just needs to explode, not correct its theological dissertation!"" 

""Right. Its just going to bug me as I fix it."" He said as he bent down and ripped an access panel from the computer. 

A green laser struck the wall right where his head had been moments before. I dropped to one knee and returned fire, driving the alien insect away for the moment. The glowing ammo counter on the side of the weapon began flashing yellow, indicating low ammo charge left in the battery. 

""We're out of time, Doc! Blow it manually!"" I yelled.

""Hang on... I've got an idea!"" The madman shouted triumphantly. ""Quick, hand me that bible over on the bookshelf"".

I stumbled through the wreckage of office furniture until I reached the built-in shelves, rummaging through the various book spines until I found the one I was looking for. ""Since when do you keep a Bible around?"" I shouted as I tossed him the holy texts. 

He deftly caught the flying tome and flipped through the pages. ""Cryptography, my boy. The self-righteous fuckers sometimes hide hints of their plans in their manifestos and monologues as bible verses, Quran passages, and other religious doctrines... here we are!"" 

I watched as he typed the verse, forgoing the voice recognition software for a good old fashioned keyboard. 

""Judges 16:28-30:  28 Then Samson prayed to the LORD, “Sovereign LORD, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.”
29 Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,
30 Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived. 

""The fuck..."" I muttered. 

Doctor Doomsday turned back to me and winked. ""Sometimes you need to fight fire with fire, my boy. You need to speak in the language they understand."" 

A thin green beam struck Doctor Doomsday in his shoulder, sending a shower of sparks and a flurry of burnt lab coat scattering across the screen. I cursed my own inattentiveness as I returned fire, emptying the rest of the ammo into the bug. I tossed the empty rifle onto its corpse, which sent a fountain of blue blood out from the holes in its belly. 

Blue blood... why was it blue? The bugs exoskeleton was green, it seemed like their blood would be too. The only other creature I knew that had natural blue blood was a horseshoe crab, and that was from its cobalt based blood cells... 

Cobalt. That was it!

""Computer! Can you reverse the magnetic blast and isolate it to only effect cobalt?"" I shouted, rushing past Doctor Doomsday in mid-repair of his cyber-prosthetic shoulder to the screen beyond. ""These things bleed blue! They may have Cobalt blood! Target just Cobalt!"" 

The machine was silent for a moment before it provided a reply.

>Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.  

""The device is almost 40% Cobalt"" Doctor Doomsday whispered, barely audible amidst the chaos outside. ""He's going to sacrifice himself to stop them.""

The screen cracked and faded to blackness as the entire Doomfort began to tremble. The red button with the skull engraved on it lit up once again, the only source of light in the entire building casting us in an eerie hue of hellfire red.

""Thank you"" I whispered, and pressed the button.

1lfaf49,mymvx6t,"There was a nervous tremble to his step as he walked into my office. The first thing his eyes fell upon was the test lying on my desk, and the scrawling name at the top written in his handwriting. Then he shifted to the folder with his photograph glued to the front. I gestured absently to the chair in the corner of the room.

""Sit.""

He did so without any debate, slipping his fingers under his thighs while he waited for me to properly turn my attention toward him. This I did not do for a long time, as I pretended to read my emails. From the corner of my eye, I could see him glancing from the floor to the test to me and then back again.

Finally, when neither of us could bear the silence, he spoke.

""You wanted to see me?""

""Oh yes. It's about your test.""

What little colour remained in his face slid away at the confirmation of his worse fears. I picked it up and pretended to leaf through it.

""Outstanding work. Top marks all 'round. However, that is not why a called you here."" I flipped open his file with a slight flourish and ran my finger down the page. ""Frankly, it would have been strange if you hadn't got full marks. Especially for someone who can simply pluck any fact or answer out of the aether. Wouldn't you agree?""

He said nothing, only shifting on his hands.

I narrowed my eyes. ""You see, when you've been a teacher as long as I have, you get a feel for certain *traits*. There's a certain mechanicalness, a certain dryness, to people who use such help to get their answers. And I honestly can hardly blame them. A test of this difficulty? In the first week of school? Everyone enters that hall with virtue in their hearts. Sooner or later, usually around the time when they pick up their pens, they crack.""

With that, I shut the folder and tapped my fingernail on his test. ""But not you. For the first time in all the years I've run this test, I have found responses that are not regurgitated. Genuine, well-researched. I'm curious: why is that?""

In the silence that followed, he wet his lips. ""Am I in trouble?""

""Why didn't you cheat?""

""...You did tell us what the test would be on.""

""And you crammed for four days?""

He nodded.

""When cheating was so easy?""

The ghost of a smile showed. ""Well, cheating is wrong, sir. And, I didn't want to start off the year on the wrong foot.""

After writing down the score on the front of his test, I picked it up and held it up in his direction. He tentatively took it.

""I think, Louis, that this is going to be the beginning of a fascinating year.""",285
1lfaf49,myonmhj,"I flip through the papers, marking notes as I go. There are the usual smart kids; they usually get 60-65% of the answers correct, which is a serious hit to their ego, but still quite good. The average kids answer in the low 40s, and the slower kids often hit single digits. Then, there are the cheaters. They do great at certain questions, like facts you could look up on the internet for instance, but do miserably at others. It's always obvious, mostly because I already know what their powers are, and eliminate that section if I can. The far-sight kids are a little harder, but there are still tells. Every kid has a tell.

But then there's Joey. He's smart, but he always seems a little out of his element. He's rated 1E, barely above ""basically normal."" There's a knock at the door, and I quickly shuffle the papers on my desk into a drawer. ""Come in.""

Joey Walther pokes his head in. ""Uh, hi sir. You, uh, wanted to see me?""

I nod. ""Please, sit down. I had some... questions for you.""

He slips into a chair, looking a little miserable. ""I know we're not supposed to use powers, but I can't really... turn mine off.""

I smile reassuringly. ""It's fine; the first and last tests are designed to catch cheaters and find those pinpoints of brilliance, and you're at the top of my list.""

He looks up, looking somehow far more reassured than I expected. ""That's... I'm glad to hear that, sir!""

""Remind me, Joey, what power do you have?""

""I can tell if someone is lying.""

""And... how did you use that to cheat on the test? Were you asking others for answers?""

He quickly shook his head. ""No sir! I, uh... I asked myself.""

Huh. That's a new one. ""Um... explain how that would work. If you're asking yourself, wouldn't that mean you know the answer?""

He shook his head, then paused. ""Well, ok. Um. How many digits of pi do you know?""

I smiled. ""I'm no math whiz - four or five, maybe six?""

He nodded. ""Now, tell me the nine hundred and ninety nineth digit of pi.""

I raised my eyebrows. ""I don't know; six? Eight? Three?""

He raises a finger. ""It's eight.""

I laughed. ""You've got a good memory!""

He shrugs. ""No, I just... knew when you were lying. And when you weren't.""

I blinked in surprise. ""Wait. Not when I thought I was telling the truth, but when what I said was a true statement or not?""

He nodded. ""So, yeah. I asked myself. True? Nope, false. The school was founded after what event - something big? Yep. First heroes? Nope. Related to heroes? Yes. Maybe a child of a hero? Yes. First children of heroes? Yep. So, that's what I wrote down - the school was founded for the first kids of heroes. I've kinda got it down to a pattern, how to ask broad questions and narrow it down.""

I leaned back in my chair. ""Have you found any limits to it? You can essentially understand any truth?""

He shrugs. ""There are some fuzzy areas, like if I say the Dean is in the bathroom, it's... false now, but it'll eventually be true. And stuff like opinions that people haven't nailed down - Eddie Burkley believes taxes in China should be raised? Nope. Lowered? Nope. Stay the same? Fuzzy. He hasn't thought about it. Or stuff that isn't asked right, like if I say, I've never personally broken a bone in my body, ding, true - except I broke my right leg a couple years ago. I just didn't do it myself, it was from a car accident - I didn't personally break it.""

I pull up his sheet. ""You correctly answered all but three of the questions, including long-form answers. Why these three?""",102
1lfaf49,mymr2l6,"After the exam, where I caught most of them trying to cheat, by:  
Reading my mind.  
Taking over someone else's body.  
Sending spirits to spy over others' shoulders.  
I start correcting the papers.  
They aren't bad.  
These kids with supernatural abilities are focusing more on their abilities, bodies, and mental state, and not studying, but that's why I give them these ridiculously difficult exams, to see if they can creatively use their powers, to cheat without being noticed.  
One of them though...has genuinely answered the questions correctly.

  
A bit later, in my office, I stare at the student who seemingly actually studied.  
It's a bit unbelievable  
""Mark Smith? Age 16. Power: Star core?"" I ask.  
He nods meekly.  
""Y-Yeah. I can eat a lot, and convert it into star energy, as I have this extra organ inside my body.  
The star energy nourishes my body, and basically makes me superhuman."" he chuckles wryly.  
I nod.  
""When did the Green Ash Empire fall?"" I ask.  
""783 years ago, after a civil war split it into 4 camps, and then other kingdoms came and made the things messier, ending in the dissolution of the Empire, and the rise of a dozen smaller countries."" he says.  
I smile.

  
I ask him a dozen more questions, and he knows them all.  
""Is your power enhancing your intellect as well?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
Makes sense.  
""Still, these questions are not in the curriculum, and are more of a general knowledge regarding our history, and our theoretical knowledge concerning abilities.  
I know that you kids are focusing on your abilities, and ensuring your bodies, and minds can handle the pressure... So how come you know these things, and don't need to cheat?"" I ask.  
It felt wrong as a teacher to ask something like this, but hey...  
This wasn't really a normal class.

  
""Mom is a teacher, and dad is an abilities nerd...so I kind of grew up listening, and reading a lot about things like this.  
Mom doesn't have powers, while dad only has slightly enhanced sight, so when I awakened an SS-tier power, they were happy, and crammed even more ""common sense"" into me."" he said.  
Common sense, he says?  
He could totally go to a proper university with this level of knowledge.  
""Well, congratulations, Mark.  
You answered 78 questions correctly out of 100, you are first in your class, and the 2nd answered 13 questions correctly.   
Keep it up. Just because you are here to become a superhero, doesn't mean your education has to lag behind."" I say, dismissing him, and changing my attitude towards this class.  
If he can study...why do I accept that the others don't study at all?  
The curriculum can change.  
I will make it a bit easier, but from now on, they will actually have to try to learn stuff besides abilities, and body building.",115
1lfaf49,myonrvk,"He stared at the sheet, guiltily. ""Uh... well, I ran out of time asking about the third one. But the other two, I, uh. I couldn't. It would have been bad.""

I re-read the questions. The first one was a little complicated, so it made sense that a true/false game of 20 questions would have taken a while. But the other two were really simple; one was multiple choice, and the other was true/false. ""What made those in particular bad? It couldn't have been feeling guilty from cheating, you'd already answered several similar questions.""

He shrugged, looking a little lost. ""I just... sometimes I have to lie, I guess? I'm not good at lying - well, that's not true, I'm really good at lying, but I'm really bad at knowing when I should or shouldn't."" He sighed, then leaned forward. ""When I was six, I broke a toy, by accident. Mom asked me if I did it, and I said yes - true, but *bad* true. I can't explain the difference, but believe me when I say there is one. It felt dark, I guess. True, but wrong. She took me to the store, and gave me some money to replace it - and while we were there, The Wreckinator smashed the store. I was mostly ok, but Mom got hurt pretty bad. I later asked myself what would have happened if I lied - Mom would have been fine. The time it would have taken for her to explain that she knew I broke it would have kept her safe. When we got to the store, it would have already been hit.""

I nodded, still trying to process what he was saying. ""So you're saying... not only can you tell the truth, but you can know if... knowing the truth is good or bad?""

He nodded, still looking a little miserable.

""You didn't tell that to the testers, did you.""

He shook his head firmly. ""No way.""

I stared down at his paper. ""You know... it was those three questions that made me ask you in. If you had answered them right, I would have just marked you down as exceptionally bright, and worth a later meeting, but I wouldn't have been quite so curious as to call you in immediately. Let me ask you, though - why didn't you tell the testers? That's illegal, and much worse than cheating on the test.""

He kicked his feet, choosing his words carefully. ""After a couple of 'bad true' or 'bad false', I started asking myself if answering the question would be good or bad, before I even felt it. And... and just asking if answering felt a little bad. I couldn't ask the question in the first place, or bad things would happen. I think... I think one of the testers was a spy. That's all I can figure out.""

My head was spinning. This kid wasn't 1E. At worst, he was 7A, maybe even as high as 10. He could literally tell the future, if he asked the right questions. He could likely even use his abilities to cause colossal chains of events, just by asking for what to do to cause some specific outcome. ""Could you change the future by changing what you do or say?""

He nodded again. ""Uh... the next kid to walk past that window will trip. Nope, false. What should I do to make the next kid trip?"" He screwed up his face, clearly running through possibilities, then suddenly let out a loud bark. Startled, I twitched, knocking over my pen stand. As I stood to set it right, I turned and glanced out the window, and came face to face to a young woman walking past. Looking up, she saw my face staring down, yelped, tripped over her own feet, and went sprawling. He friends helped her up, and the three walked quickly away, giggling.

Joey quietly spoke. ""I changed what would happen. She wouldn't have tripped otherwise.""

Suddenly, he looked up. ""The Dean is a spy too, you know. Don't, uh.. don't tell him about me. I didn't figure that out until just now.""

I sat down, grimly. It made sense. Somehow, it all made sense. I was warned that there was a mole in the organization; it's why I took the job, years ago. and if one of the testers was rogue, too, well... that would explain a lot. ""Joey, what I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room. I work for a covert organization, protecting people with powers - but there's another organization that's trying to do the opposite. We could... really use your help.""

He nodded, almost immediately. ""I'm in, what do I need to do?""

I grinned. ""Just like that?""

He shrugged again. ""If I don't, things go bad. Bad bad. Nothing bad if I join though. So, what do we do?""

I relax back into my chair. ""We save the world, kid. We save the world.""",146
1lfese5,mynvlpz,"The knocking on my door always started early, and I groaned in annoyance, keeping my eyes closed, trying to will them away. The knocking continued off and on for several minutes, then footsteps retreated. I cracked an eye open. Bloody hell, it is just past day break. Maybe I should go ahead and hire some staff to help manage things.

I rolled out of bed, literally. The thud into the floor wasn't comfortable, but it was cathartic in how it exactly described how I felt. I lay for a few minutes, any attempt at rising felt like it was going to betray the piece of me that denied all ambition today.

More knocking startled me awake, still on the floor. And now I hurt from various pressure points. Okay okay. I'm up. But not open for business.

""Go away!"" I yelled. 

The knocking only got louder. Muttering more curses I grabbed a bed sheet off the bed and wrapped it around myself, stumbling to the door. Yanking it open I see what I knew I'd find. Another couple, hopeful looks quickly vanishing to uncertainty. ""What."" It wasn't a question.

They hemmed and hawed briefly like they always do, trying to figure out how to ask for my help. I cut through it, ""I charge an early morning fee of 5 darses before breakfast."" I hadn't before, I made that up on the spot actually. Annoyance was my overriding feeling, and I would be thrilled if they went away. Well, thrilled is too much energy. 

Without hesitation they pulled out a coin purse and counted out the money, holding it out to me. I stared at it. It was literally 5 times what I normally charged. ""Fine. But you will have to talk it out at my breakfast table while I get myself something to eat.

A few minutes later I pottered around my kitchen making myself some bacon and eggs while they talked quietly at the table. It was the same old troubles. He thought he was doing what she wanted, she wasn't communicating clearly, he was shutting down, she was getting angry. But they talked it out clearly thanks to my spell.

Their talking abruptly stopped when I plunked myself down at the table, my plate of food nearly between them. ""All sorted out yet?"" 

They looked at each other, then back at me. ""It isn't an unlimited time you know. Spell will be up in a few minutes.""

He immediately replied, ""How much for you to recast it?""

""Once per day only I'm afraid."" It wasn't. My spell didn't affect me. Their faces went crestfallen. ""You don't need a spell you know. You could just be clear and honest about your intentions and goals normally.""

They struggled to accept that. They always did at first. Baggage, trauma, yada yada yada. I understood why people needed mediators and referees. But this wasn't the profession I wanted. I wanted to make things in my shop.

I watched them leave, still talking, he was holding a list of therapists in his hand. They would figure it out. They cared enough to come to me and that meant a lot for their intentions.

I still had no idea why my granted spell was Aura of Clarity and Honesty. I don't like people.",122
1lfese5,mynsig9,"Everyone at the Arcane Academy laughed at Morgan. While other wizards commanded fire, summoned lightning, or transformed into fearsome beasts, Morgan had only managed to master a single spell: “Light Breeze.”

It was the most basic cantrip taught to first-year students—a spell that could merely ruffle papers or gently stir the air. Most wizards mastered it in a day and quickly moved on to more impressive magic. But not Morgan. Despite years of study, Light Breeze remained the only spell they could cast reliably.

“What kind of wizard can only make a little wind?” the others would mock. 

But Morgan possessed something the others lacked: boundless imagination and meticulous attention to detail.

When the King’s daughter fell ill with a mysterious lung ailment, the court wizards tried potions and healing incantations to no avail. Morgan, who had been sweeping the palace floors (the only job a “one-spell wizard” could get), asked for permission to help.

“Your Majesty, I believe I can clear the princess’s airways.”

The court erupted in laughter, but the desperate King allowed it. Morgan cast Light Breeze with precise control, directing the gentle wind through the princess’s bronchial passages, dislodging the microscopic spores that had been slowly suffocating her.

The princess breathed freely for the first time in weeks.

Later that year, when assassins released invisible, odorless poison gas in the throne room, it was Morgan who detected the subtle air currents and used Light Breeze to disperse the deadly vapors before anyone inhaled a lethal dose.

As Morgan’s reputation grew, so did the applications of the humble spell. He could detect lies by noticing minute changes in a person’s breath patterns. He could cool overheated machinery with precisely targeted air currents. He saved a starving city by using Light Breeze to deliver pollen to plants inside the walls.

The most impressive feat came when the kingdom’s most secure vault was robbed, with no sign of forced entry. While other wizards cast complex detection spells, Morgan simply used Light Breeze to feel for the tiniest air currents escaping through the thief’s hidden tunnel.

Eventually, Morgan opened the “School of Focused Mastery"".

“The measure of a wizard,” Morgan would tell students, “isn’t the number of spells they know, but the number of problems they can solve.”",119
1lfese5,myok750,"""Pocket? *Pocket?* The hero who comes to vanquish Van Quisher the Magnificent is called *Pocket?""* 

""What's wrong with my name?"" I asked, frowning, ""It's short, it's catchy, it's to the point. It's certainly more family friendly than Bloodflame of the Red Gaping Carcass."" 

""That was my teenage persona, fool!"" Van Quisher snarled, though I noticed a few beads of sweat dripping down his luxurious long locks of hair. ""This is your current name!""

I worked the shackles around from behind the chair, carefully pulling out a pick from belt and starting on the lock. ""Well, I am a teenager. So if I were to accept your opinion of my name, which I don't, then by your very own same logic I don't deserve to be defamed for my choice. Is common decency truly dead in the world?""

Klymenestra, Van's first lieutenant, rubbed her eyes with a groan. ""Look, the other team haven't shown up in three hours. I'd say we just kill him."" 

""Patience!"" Van Quisher roared. ""Why kill a mere guppy when you can eliminate a whole shoal of sturgeons?"" 

""You should listen to Van, Lieutenant."" I agreed. ""He's older and obviously much wiser."" 

Klymenestra stared up at the dungeon ceiling, possibly contemplating her life choices. ""God forbid we don't listen to the single-spell sorcerer."" 

""Actually,"" I smiled widely. ""According to the commonly accepted academic definition, I'm actually not a - ""

Van Quisher's face snapped towards me like a cobra. ""Hmm."" He said. ""Is that a *tink tink tink* sound I hear coming from your direction?"" 

""I really can't imagine."" I said, hearing each tumbler click as it moved into place within the lock. ""Perhaps it's your lieutenant's chastity belt? I heard the Cassandrean Order can be *real freaks.""* 

Klymenstra's hand snapped out, but I'd already unlocked the shackles, leaping out of the chair and past both of them. Which led me to the corner of the dungeon furthest away from the exit. Because why wouldn't it?

""You picked the lock,"" Klymenetra licked her lips with a neon green tongue. ""Clever boy. But you're outnumbered, and certainly outgunned. What was the one spell you knew how to do again? It's a first year one, isn't it?"" 

""First semester, actually. I cast *Inventory.""* 

You should know the Archstone family is well known for dimensional magic. But instead of teleportation or universe hopping, I'd invested in a spell that opened up a pocket dimension. I'd put a lot of stuff in there over the years. Apples. Oranges. A castle. 

One perfectly suited to house an adventuring party armed to the teeth.",47
1lfese5,myomc4i,"try again. Where was I? Right.

Middle of an ambush. Roadside. Three of my travelling partners dead, one too injured to fight, and an axe headed directly for my head. Twist to the left-- going right gets you caught by the one flanking, it's a dead end. Go low, avoid the axe throw from the treeline. Twist, snap a kick out for the heel, knock him off balance so the sword comes down to the left.

This'd be easier if you could figure out more than one trick, but one trick's usually enough when it's from a rare discipline. Which one? You're clever enough. Figure it out. There's more powerful practitioners, probably, but nobody really knows about them-- they've made sure of that. You might have a few names, but honestly, most people don't believe the rumors of being 'perfect' enough to care, and for the people who are undeniable? They just don't let anything happen that might reveal them. Kind of terrifying to think about, but there's something more terrifying to consider right now.

Namely? The man charging from behind. Step to the right-- he's got his sword angled out to the left, catches me in the waist if I go that way. Bad way to go. Trip him on the way past, send him skidding-- if you can get him just as he goes to move, he'll knock himself out on the side of the wagon. Time it right, time it...

Right! There he goes. Two left. Jerk low and to the left, wait for the sound of the axe embedding itself into the wagons' side, then stab forwards. Aim for the center of mass, weak spot in his lamellar, get him in the heart. Wait for the sound of him dropping, and then...

...twist. Aim subtly high. If you hear a shout, the knife landed on target. One in the trees is gone. That's all three. Follow the side of the wagon to the right, hurry, hurry, you don't have much time-- you have to optimize this. Get to her. Get to the wounded one, and check her pulse.

One.

Two.

...

...no.

Too slow. It stopped. You have to optimize more. Be quick enough to be there to stop the bleeding.

That's okay.

Take a breath.

All you have to do is close your eyes (not that they can see anything, anyways), breathe out... listen to the ticking of the timepiece, the beating of your heart... and go back to",32

I was considered a failed mage, having learnt only 1 spell.
1 spell was all I could learn.
Nothing more, nothing less.
It a spell for beginners, one of the 3 spells an apprentice has to learn to be considered a real mage.
Mana Hand.
And yet...
I look at the battlefield in front of me, that has quieted down.
""God's Hand."" the armies muttered, as they watched me float above them on a huge golden hand.



It is funny.
Mana hand is considered versatile, but useless.
It takes a lot of focus to control it properly, and many use it to carry stuff, or push things.
That is it.
Me? I used it to become renowned.
I conjure hands by the thousands.
Palms, fists, hand knives chop, and punch, and slap at the enemies.
And that is not all.
Have you ever seen hundreds of hands trying to grab you, and drag you down?
It is terrifying.


It is funny.
There are multiple hand spells that are considered legendary.
And that is what they think I am using.
That is why the battlefield is now terrified.
They think not only have I mastered high tier spells, but also have enough mana to use them seemingly forever.
Poor imagination.
They can never imagine that this huge golden hand is a Mana Hand spell creation.
After all...most Mana Hands are the size of a human's hand.
I look at the two armies and smile.
Thousands of house sized open hands materialize over the battlefield.
They start attacking.

It is funny.
Their spells crash against the hands but do nothing.
""Sorry.
Nothing personal, it is just a job."" I say, as I push down with the hands.
They scream and try their best, but to no avail.
Huge palm mark craters appear on the plains.
I sigh.
""God's Hand, huh?
If they knew how many decades it took me to get here..."" I mutter leaving.
It is funny.
A failure of a mage, and a spell that is ignored did all this and more.
How amazing and unpredictable life is, right?",103

“Typo”

A large sphere of tires appeared on the battlefield. Seeing my opening, I charged forward, the tip of my rapier eager for a stylish red coating.

“Deflect”

“Typo”

A defect in his pants appeared as the button fell off and they fell to his ankles, tripping him in last-second attempt to dodge. It would likely have failed anyway. That’s the issue with powerful mages. They never need to rely on anything but their magic.

As I pulled my blade from his heart, he managed to speak through the pain and blood and cast one last spell in an attempt to heal his wounds.

“Make whole”

“Typo”

He suddenly dropped ten feet into the hole in the ground that appeared beneath him. So thoughtful of him to dig his own grave like that.

By the rules of trial by combat, I had bested the kingdom’s champion and was found innocent of the whole “bring rain to bring pain” debacle.",14
1lfese5,mypc96n,"I stood there looking at the center of town. I slapped my hands together, saying out loud “ all done “ . I looked to the west the sun was just beginning to set. 

I noticed the mayor and town council walking towards me. Hats in hand.  

The mayor began talking as the group arrived in front of me. 
“Sir Tim ..”

I held up a hand stating “ just call me , Tim” 

Mayor continues “ Tim , even though everyone had told us you could do it. We just did not believe it could be done. And ohm well, we don’t have the agreed upon 100 gold coins. “ 

I look sternly at the mayor and the town council.  I say “ do you see those barrels of Dragon meat, bones and blood. I claim those and 3 wagons with  3 teams of mules to pull them, also provide   3 boys to drive the wagons.  “ 

The mayor and the town council huddled, whispered in low voices. Then turned back to me. 
The mayor stated, “ ok to everything from the Dragon, but only 2 wagons with, 2 teams of mules, 2 young boys to drive the wagons. You load wagons. You leave as soon as wagons are loaded. “ 

I grab the mayor’s hand shaking vigorously, “Deal. Now bring those wagons I got places to go, things to do.” 

As the mayor and town council ran off. I let out the breath I had been holding.  

As first one then the second wagon arrived. I parked them next to the barrels and began loading barrels. Guess the town council was still locating the two boys. 

It took me most of the night to load and tie the barrels securely in the 2 wagons but I was done and very tired.   

A large family of 8 stood nearby and pushed a boy of probably 7 years towards me. This is Will he is going with you.

A man stood with a boy probably 5 or 6 years old. He said, I only have 2 boys. This is Bob my youngest, he will be going with you. He is a good boy, very good with animals. 

I look at the boys, say “ get your teams ready to leave. We have a schedule to keep. “  turning to the parents, “ I will keep them safe and they will learn to be mages .” (I say under my breath “I hope they do “). 

I jumped on the first wagon with Bob . Tell him “ let’s go kimosabi” 

Bob looks at me ? 

I say “mush Bob mush”

After traveling all day we arrived at “ the Mage school of Arch Mages” 

We stopped the wagons at the closed gates. I got off the wagon. Walked up to the gates, bent over, picked up a large stone off the ground and banged on the gate. 

A porthole in the gate opened, a face appears. Before I can say anything. A voice rings out. “ allow Tim and his crew inside Igor. Tim have your young drivers go to the school cafeteria for a hot meal. Igor you tend to the animals and the goods. Tim please make haste to my office.”

Igor grunts and opens the gates wide. 

I pointed out an area to park the wagons. Then lead Bob & Will to the cafeteria. 
Then I dashed off for the dean of magic office.",10
1lfese5,myph5c2,"Part 2 

I arrived at the Dean’s office door. Before I could knock, the voice of the Dean spoke “come in Tim , I am waiting for you.”

I straightened my robes, opened the door and walked into the dean’s office, for the millionth time. 

The Dean begins “Tim , young man. You were thought to be the first ever failure of this school and under my leadership.  You the only student to master just one spell, but you are at arch mage level with that spell. “ 

I smile ear to ear, “I had good teachers “

The Dean looked sternly at me “remind me who taught you that spell?” 

I blurted out “Ignor “ 

The Dean says “ yes Igor, taught you, “clean area “ spell. But you leveled it up. You Tim have made a thriving business out of that one spell.  You clean anything anywhere, for a set amount of coins. When the client can’t pay. You take trade for payments.  “ 
Pause 
“You bring us much needed, food, supplies for students and classes, you even bring us new pupils to teach. “ 
Pause 
“I hear now, that you and Joan are working together. “

I say “ yep , Joan slays dangerous Dragons rampaging in a Town or village. Then I go in offer my service to clean up the entire mess. “

The Dean asked “ what does Joan get?”

I stated “not my place to say “

The Dean says “ok, ok, are you staying for dinner?”

I sprouted out “ you kidding, when you ever known me to miss out on Dragon Steaks”",12
1lfqxhr,myr4ujw,"""...news, seven IPS-N employees were arrested yesterday on suspicion of harbouring dangerous cyber criminals. Police believes they had planned to enact cyber terrorism against realspace in the name of cyber...""

I woke up to the sound of droning news coming from within my head. I must've forgotten to turn off the news module before going to sleep. Light streamed in through the shutters, illuminating a streaks of dust. 

What time was it? I grabbed my phone to check, only to find it had some kind of pet raising game opened. Had it downloaded it itself overnight? It's been acting up lately. Opening up apps. Playing games by itself. I should probably get it looked at. But I didn't want to owe anyone money. 

I swiped down to open the menu. 9:30. Shit. I was going to be late. I had only myself to blame for not checking my alarm. 

""...In other news, illegal nanomachine modifications, also known as nanomods, have been on the rise, exploiting security holes in cybernetic enhancements to . Authorities have begun cracking down on such modifications, urging citizens to be wary of suspicious packages downloaded from cyberspace, as they can not only make you more susceptible to cyber attacks, but also-""

I pushed an AR button next to my head, shutting off the news voice that was streaming directly into my head. It wasn't what I wanted to start the day off with. With a wave of my hand, the interior of my room lit up slowly - the way I liked it. The wallpaper in the room changed to a soothing light blue, decorated by the interior holo device. Not too intrusive, but not too depressing. It knew what I liked. I began my mundane morning routine. Washing my teeth. Making some quick cereal. I didn't rush. I was already late, so what was a few more minutes.

I decided to check for messages on my phone in between cereal bites. In the time between, I saw my phone had opened up some kind of local nanomachine analyser tool. Weird. Wonder why it did that. It was showing the activities of the nearby nanomachines in the vicinity. Kind of like an old wifi analyser app. I didn't really care about it though, so I closed it and opened up my messages.

The first message was from my boss saying ""WHERE ARE YOU??""

I put the phone in my pocket and pretended not to see it. Ugh. What a shitty start to the day. 

Maybe I should call in sick. But I needed the money. And I was all out of paid leave. I didn't want to go, but I had no choice. I finished up my breakfast and went to get dressed. My closet UI - a blue holographic screen projected onto its door - opened to remind me that I needed new clothes. I sighed. Who the hell invented this sort of thing anyway. I swiped the reminder away and took out an old jacket. Its condition wasn't too bad, but some of its threads were fraying and its cuffs were coming loose. Nothing a bit of holo AR couldn't fix. I put it on lazily, along with some jeans and went out. 

I could hear the highway from my apartment, even though I had chosen somewhere out of the way to live. Automated cars zoomed from the street across. They were noisier than usual today. It was getting to me, so I decided to go out the back door. The street outside that one was real dirty. Garbage bins and flies roamed this road. Some things just don't change I guess. At least there was not a lot of people here. 

I should probably message my boss to say I'm coming. Maybe that will make her less angry when I arrive. I took out my phone to see that it had a volume adjustment app open. I usually used this to tune out the world in my spare time, because it could control how much noise I could hear. But I noticed it had been turned all the way up. Annoyed, I turned it back down and sent a message, hoping to appease my boss a little.

I made my way back to the front of the building. Some shady people in suits were hanging around the front door. There were always shady people hanging around here. Some poor soul must've been behind on their debt. If I didn't have a job, I could've be one of them. I made a quick prayer for whoever it was that had pissed them off, and then left quietly, making sure I wasn't seen.

I didn't notice the emblem they had on their sleeve.

----

""You're over hour late!""

Apparently, the message I had sent was completely ineffective. The moment I walked through the door, the chinese lady who ran the restaurant I worked at practically shoved me into the back rooms and started berating me.

""Look I'm sorry,"" I began, ""There was some problem with my closet and I couldn't get it to open and-""

""No excuses!"" she shoved a device into my hand, ""You. Mascot. Stand outside shop and bring customers in.""

She slammed the door in my face and rushed back into the kitchen, leaving me alone in the room. It must've been a busy day. The device she gave me was a holographic projection device, about the size of a badge. It would project the image of a mascot around me, and I could be it for a day. This was the sort of job I had gotten. Sometimes it was being a mascot, sometimes it was washing dishes. She didn't trust me to cook though. Something about how I had years of training before she would let me touch a wok. As long as it paid well, and I didn't get asked questions, I didn't care. 

I pinned the device to my shirt and pressed the power button on it. The air around me shimmered. I looked in the mirror and I now looked like a cute rabbit from a cartoon. I couldn't help but smile whenever I saw it. My little sister loved this kind of stuff. Oh, I should probably take a photo. It'd probably cheer her up. 

I took out my phone and saw it was playing bejeweled. Seriously? That old game? I thought everyone had moved on from it already. The gems on the screen moved by themselves as if played by an invisible hand. Maybe I shouldn't interrupt it. But it game over'ed soon after. I waited for a while, but it didn't move again. You know, sometimes I thought my phone was really alive. Or that it had a ghost in it or something. It really does seem like it. I imagined what kind of ghost it was. The old kind probably. Seeing as it was playing bejeweled. 

I opened up the camera app and snapped a photo of myself in my rabbit holo-image. Maybe once my little sister was all better, we could look over all these images together. That was what I hoped at least. 

----

A few hours later, rush hour finally finished, and it was the afternoon break. This was the hour when the cooks came out to eat themselves. I on the other hand, sat down exhausted. You would think standing there being cute would be something easy. But all those kids. Trying to play with me. Or those teenagers who deliberately tried to break the illusion. Ugh. What a handful. And I wasn't allowed to retaliate or anything. Luckily some of the workers saw and intervened whenever it happened. 

""Rough day today huh?"" One of the cooks, Bruce sat down next to me and offered me a bowl of noodles. 

""Tell me about it,"" I silently grabbed the bowl in appreciation and began eating. ""What I would give to punch those assholes in the face.""

""Surprised you haven't already. You know the last guy before you lasted a week before he caved in.""

""So that's how he got fired huh.""

""I heard you got chewed out by the ma'am again this morning."" 

""Well if getting chewed out was being shoved into a room and rushed out the door, then sure.""

""Ha. Sounds like her alright. She was already pretty irate from dealing with the visitors this morning.""

""Oh yeah?""

""Yeah you just missed them. A bunch of police officers came in asking for any information about a wanted cyber criminal. Something about a runaway from the cyber-reality war going on, you know? It got pretty intense. The mistress started yelling at them about how they're driving the customers away and to leave.""

""Yeowch. Glad I came in late then.""

""Seems like the world's getting dangerous these days y'know. You should take care of yourself, kid. Stay away from cyberspace if you can.""

I nodded and didn't say anything back. Taking care of myself. Easier said then done. If I could choose the kind of life I could live, this would not be it. Hell if things were just a bit different, I would've gone digital in an instant. But it's not like I can choose a different life. Not without abandoning what I had in this one. 

My phone vibrated in my pocket. I took it out to see what was happening.

""Aw hell,"" I said. It was a reminder telling me to pay my electricity bills. I clicked on it, opening up my apartment management app. Seems like I was using way more electricity this month than usual. Apparently I had forgotten to turn off the light back home. Just great. I clicked on the turn off button, but it didn't respond. It's been acting up a lot. Refusing to respond to the app. I guess even in this digital age, sometimes going physical was just more reliable. Maybe if I snuck back home I could go and turn it back off again. Save a bit of money.

""Bruce, could you do me a favour?"" 

""Yeah?""

""I need to go home for a second. It won't be long.""

""Don't worry, I gotchu. I won't tell the ma'am.""

""Thanks man.""

I finished my lunch and hurried out of there.",10
1lfqxhr,myr4v9k,"I jogged down the street, hoping to get home and back on time. I had to take a few detours through some of the alleyways back. It was quicker this way. And I knew my way around. I had to go back as quickly as I could before the ma'am notices. 

I was going so fast, I bumped into someone by accident. 

""Woah man, why so rushed?"" It was a teenage looking boy, who seemed like a punk. He had dyed yellow hair, a black shirt with a band logo I didn't recognise and a chained necklace on. 

""Sorry."" I had gotten knocked to my legs. Ow, my shoulder. It was all tingly. Like I had gotten zapped just now. I tried to get up and leave, but the boy grabbed me by the shoulder. 

""Dude, chill out, bro. You never know what you could miss by going so fast you know.""

""Uh. Right.""

""Have you ever gone so fast, you never stopped to wonder where you were going, and then suddenly you realised you're not sure where you want to go anymore?""

""..Huh?""

""Life's like that sometimes. You gotta slow down. Watch where you're going. If you spend all your time running away, sooner or later, your past is gonna catch up to you.""

What on earth was this guy talking about?

""It's something I learned watching movies. You got a phone? I can show you.""

For some reason, my phone chose that specific moment to vibrate in my pocket.

""Oh you do have one bro!"" He swiped it from my pocket and began to tap on it.

""Hey! That's my phone. You can't just-"" I grabbed it back, ""Look, I got someplace to be. Sorry if I hurt you. Could you let me go?""

""Whatever you say man. Just remember what I said yeah?""

*Sooner or later, your past is going to catch up to you...*

Huh? What was that? I swear I heard his voice inside my own head.  I shook my head. I was probably tired. Exhausted from my half day at work. This was weirding me out. The boy finally let me go and waved me goodbye, and I turned and started getting away from there. 

I didn't see him disinterate into thin air. 

----

As I got back to my apartment, I felt something wrong in the air. 

Police cars were parked up the side of the street. I turned the corner and saw police tape - or holographic images of one - cordoning off the whole building. What happened? I looked from afar, and saw that one of the windows was broken. What was more, the inside of the room had started fuzzing, as though the interior holo image had glitched out. 

The police were interrogating the people nearby. I saw a grandma I knew talking with the officers. What had happened here? No wait, this means I couldn't go in and turn off my lights. Shit. My money was going down the drain. 

My phone started buzzing in my pocket. But I had bigger things to worry about. Was I just going to stand out here and go back? Out of anyone in the city, the police were the last people I wanted to get involved with. But maybe there was a way in without having to go through them. I looked down the way to the back door. It was not blocked off. 

I decided to risk it. I didn't want to lose any more money this month. And I was sure whatever it was didn't involve me anyway.

""You one of the residents of this building?"" A voice called out from behind me as I snuck into the dark trashy alley. It wasn't a police officer. It was two men in suit and tie, shades covering their face. I recognised them from this morning.

""Um. Yeah?""

The phone in my pocket began to vibrate more strongly.

""We're agents with the government. We believe there is a dangerous war criminal hiding in this building, charged with the sabotage and destruction of government infrastructure, as well as illegal tampering of nanomachine cyberspace.""

What? War criminal? Sabotage? Destruction?

""We'd like you to come with us to answer a few questions.""

Suddenly, my phone started playing a ring tone. What was happening? I pulled it out to turn it off, and saw a message on the screen.

RUN

""Um, sorry, I gotta go. My employer is expecting me and-""

The man on the left pulled out a gun, and pointed it at me.

""This isn't a request. It's an order.""

I froze. A million thoughts raced through my mind in an instant. This couldn't be happening. What's happening? That isn't a real gun right? Who were these guys? What criminal? What do I do? *What do I do?*

I backed up, hands raised in the air. As I did, I saw the phone open an app. 

Trash Compactor Energy Management. 

""Don't worry. We aren't going to hurt you. We just want to know a few things, yeah?"" 

At that moment, a large electrical discharge filled the air. The two men in suits yelled in pain and my vision was blinded. When my vision returned, they were on the floor. 

A robotic voice went off from the pocket of the men. ""Target found. War Criminal code named Zero-Phi-Lambda. Requesting backup."" As soon as it finished that sentence, a high pitched alarm starting wailing from the pocket, and I saw everyone on the highway look this way. 

The phone in my hand shook. 

RUN.

My mind was still blank. The word seemed to imprint itself into my consciousness. 

I turned and ran.",8
