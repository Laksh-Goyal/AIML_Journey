1lx0sij,n2ij42j,"I watch, as my wife sleeps, with our newborn daughter on her chest.  
My...our 3rd child, a child born out of love, and light.  
She's blessed by Light Magic, and thus...the curse I was afflicted with was broken.  
The seals undone, and my memory back, I now know who I really am.  
I am no Mage, nor just a simple man, but Darkness Incarnate, here to sink this world into my domain, making it one of the many worlds devoured by me, and my army.  
Problem is...I want none of that.  
I found love, I have my family, I changed.

  
""H-honey?"" my wife mutters, as she weakly opens her eyes.  
""Yes, Alicia? How are you? Do I have to call the physicians? Clerics? Midwives?"" I ask.  
She laughs slowly.  
""W-water...would be...enough."" she mutters.  
I hurriedly give her a glass of water.  
Our little girl starts crying.  
I take her from her mother's chest, and cradled her in my arms, gently rocking her, trying to make her fall asleep.  
""All is right."" I smile at her.  
Alicia puts the glass of water down, and falls asleep.

  
A few days later, the mother and newborn are still in a different area of the mansion.  
My eldest son, and daughter are anxiously waiting for my approval.  
""Let us see them dad!"" Adam says.  
He is 15, and a rank-4 aura knight, towering even above me.  
My first daughter, Mia, stares at me.  
""You got stronger...and your magic is now, darker."" she says.  
She's a spiritualist, already contracted to 3 low-elemental spirits.  
""Seeing little Lisa be born, made me realize how fragile life is, and I broke through with the concept of Death."" I say, which is not entirely a lie.  
They stare at me.

  
""You know dad, we want to help.  
You build all this for mom, and us, but we are old enough now.  
You can start relying on us."" Adam says.  
I freeze.  
""Mhm. Other children help around the house as soon as they can walk, and understand instructions.  
We are 15, and 13 respectively father, we can help, you don't need to bear everything yourself."" Mia says.  
I tear up, thank them, and allow them to visit their mother, and sibling, but not before washing properly up, and having one of our servants put a cleanse spell on them.  
I go outside, and sigh, watching servants smile, taking care of the estate.  
""How could I ever hurt them? How could I destroy this world?"" I mutter, sighing.  
I won't do it, I will cherish this life, but there is a problem.  
With my awakening, my army is coming.  
And they...they always hunger, and some of them are almost as strong as I am.  
But it doesn't matter, for them, for my family, my flesh and blood, I will do whatever it takes to keep this world one of light, and not darkness.",44
1lx0sij,n2is0gm,"It was all part of the plan. Go in without memories of the homeworld, blend in as one of them as a sleeper agent, build the star-vacuum, regain the memories and activate it. Simple, quick, easy.

So why is it that I now hesitate? The plan had gone without a hitch until this point. As an amnesiac, I followed the only memory I had: Make the star-vacuum. Of course, I had no idea of what I was doing at that time; My memories only returned upon powering up the machine.

All around me stood the humans I had encountered during my infiltration. The young herbalist who had found me collapsed in the woods (according to plan) and took me to the village. The priest who assumed my ‘visions’ of the service were a message from God. The car mechanic and carpenter, who provided me with the parts I needed. The cafe owner, with a tray of coffee in hand , ever ready to serve. Even the village drunk was there, ready to provide whatever weird wisdom he randomly liked to spout. All of them had no idea what the device was supposed to do.

Without my memories, I had called them friend, no, family. Knowing what I do now, I called them… what? Tools? Slaves?

My finger hovered over the button. Just a single press, and my homeworld will be saved. With the power of the Sun, my kind would last another million years at least. So easy. So… hang on. What was that other button doing there? It wasn’t part of the sun-vacuum blueprints.

——

*The machine whirled and glowed to life. It began vibrating gently, then harder and harder. Eventually it started shaking so hard screws and bolts started popping out. Finally with a splutter and a puff of smoke, the entire device crumbled into a pile of twisted cables and metal.*

——

“Ay, don’t worry ‘bout it. We’ll build another, eh?”

“It’s all part of God’s plan, my child.”

“When ‘da birdies shit on you, you… take a piss! On a trashcan. Yeah!”

I thanked the others for their words of comfort and stepped back from the now-defunct machine.

“It’s fine, guys. No, seriously. Now that I think about it, it was never going to work anyway. Now, let’s get started on that hyper-windmill we were talking about.”

I patted the mayor in the back and I made my way down the observatory, my family all around me.",14
1lx0sij,n2ij67i,"She was the mother of all things... the creator of the known and the unknown.  
But she was more than that. She was Alpha and Omega.  
Omnipotence brought her no joy, so she placed a curse upon her own memory.  
She had fashioned countless wonders; through love, she gained family and forged bonds of friendship.  
Death was her ally, granting the living rest and the gift of rebirth.  
But nothing lasts forever, and in time, even curses lose their hold.  
A star blazed bright against the endless dark. As memory returned, so too did her purpose.  
It was time for the sun to set, the dream to fade, and for her existence to sink into the abyss.",9
1lwvgcx,n2hlpid,"You learn a lot in 3,000 years of granting wishes.
Like how “forever” always ends in tears, and “true love” just means someone’s going to get murdered by Act III.
Humans are adorable that way. Soft little gods in meat suits, drunk on possibility.
They find a bottle, uncork it, and think they’ve found the backdoor to heaven.

That’s where I come in.

Call me whatever you want. Djinn, demon, bastard in a bottle. I’ve heard worse.
My job’s simple: three wishes. No refunds.
You make the ask, I make it real.

Exactly real.

You wish for money? You drown in gold.
You wish to be king? Enjoy the guillotine.
You wish for someone to love you forever? They will. Corpse rot and all.

And me? I collect stories. Souvenirs.
Faces twisted in that final moment of “oh no.”
It used to be fun. Like jazz.
But lately, it’s felt off. Like I’ve heard every song in every key.
Even the screams have lost their flavor.

Then he showed up.

⸻

He didn’t knock. They never do.
One second I’m napping in the sweet dark velvet of oblivion, the next I’m spat out into some asshole’s living room like stage fog at a magic show.

Except this one didn’t gawk. Didn’t cower.
He just sipped his coffee.

“I thought you’d be taller,” he said.

I straightened my cuffs and adjusted the smoke trailing off me.
“And I thought you’d be dead. Funny world.”

He smiled like someone who brought a cheat code to a knife fight.
His hair was messy in that intentional way, and his hoodie said
I Read the Terms of Service
which frankly, unnerved me more than I’d admit.

“Three wishes,” I said, circling him. “Make them count.”

He tapped his mug.
“Right. I’ve done my homework. I know the phrasing matters.”

“Oh, good. You’re one of those.” I sighed.
“Let me guess. ‘I wish for a million wishes’?”

“Nope.”

He set his mug down with the kind of care you’d give a loaded gun.

“I wish,” he said, “to speak any truth and have it believed.”

I blinked.
That was new.

Not feared. Not rich. Not immortal.
Just… believed.

The magic slithered out of me like a silver tongue and wrapped around his head.
He shuddered. A flicker. And smiled wider.

“Excellent,” he said.
“Wish two. I wish to never be compelled, coerced, or magically influenced in any way. Total sovereignty of mind, soul, and body.”

That… that one hurt.

I felt a tether snap.
One of my little backdoor clauses fried like a fuse.
He could lie to me now. Or resist me. Or… gods help us… trick me.

Something deep in the bottle trembled.

I forced a grin.
“Careful, sweetheart. You’re playing chess with the devil and you’ve only seen the opening moves.”

He just leaned in. Calm. Curious.

“Wish three,” he said.
And he said it like a knife.

“I wish to switch places with you.”

⸻

Everything went wrong.

The room exploded in blue-gold fire. The ceiling screamed.
My form unraveled like ribbon in a storm.

I tried to laugh.
Tried to twist it. Twist him.
But the words wouldn’t come.

He stood there, watching me fall, as the smoke poured into him.

And I..
I hit the floor.

Hard.

Flesh. Bone. Air.

My body heaved.
My lungs… my actual lungs… screamed for breath.

I looked up.
He was floating now. Gilded smoke curled around his feet.
The bottle spun lazily in his hand.

He looked at me with sympathy.
Real, infuriating sympathy.

“You get it now?” he asked.

“No.” I coughed. “No, no no no, you can’t”

“Can’t what?”
He grinned. My grin, but crueler.
“You said it yourself. Three wishes. No refunds.”

“I didn’t agree. That’s not..”

He raised the bottle.
“What’s wrong? Can’t you wish it all back?”

I opened my mouth. “I wish..”

“Denied.”

The word hit like a brick to the chest.

He said it with glee.
With finality.
And the bottle glowed like it had heard its favorite song.

“You don’t get it,” I gasped. “You can’t. The laws. This isn’t how it works.”

“Yeah. That’s what you used to say.”

He crouched beside me and tapped my now very human chest.

“This body? It gets old. Gets cancer. Feels love. Loss.
All that sweet crap you’ve been mocking for centuries.
Good luck with that.”

“You’ll regret this,” I said.

He shrugged. “Maybe.
But at least I’ll be interesting.”

And with that, he stepped into the bottle.
My bottle.
And vanished.

⸻

It’s been…
I don’t know how long.

Time moves forward now.
I age. I sleep. I piss.
I dream.

Sometimes I hear him in there.
My bottle.
Granting wishes. Laughing that same laugh.

Only now, he plays by different rules.

I tried to find him once. Summon him. Corner him.
Beg him.

“I wish,” I said, clutching the bottle with both hands, “to switch back.”

His voice echoed out.
Soft and cruel and giddy.

“Wish denied.”

⸻

That’s the thing about irony.
You never really appreciate it until it’s yours.

So here I am.
Skin and rot and bones.

I used to write tragedies with flair. With flourish.
Now?

Now I live one.

But don’t pity me.
Just remember me.

Because someday, somewhere, someone will find that bottle.
And they’ll make three wishes.
And he’ll say yes.
Until the day he doesn’t.

And then you’ll hear it.
The sound of power breaking.
Of rules snapping.
Of history repeating.

“Wish denied.”

And I in my grave…
I’ll smile.

One.
Last.
Time.",197
1lwvgcx,n2hkjsi,"""What do you mean ""wish denied""?"" the current Master of mine asks.  
""It means not only that I can't, and won't fulfill this wish, but it also wasted one of the 3 wishes slots you had, Master."" I say.  
He snorts.  
""Your duty as MY genie is to fulfill MY wishes.  
I haven't gone against the rule for making people love me, reviving the dead, or wishing for more wishes!"" he says.  
I sigh.  
""Your wish was more than reprehensible."" I say.  
He rolls his eyes.

  
""I just wished for everyone to listen to me."" he says.  
I nod.  
""Which means forced obedience, and basically breaks the first rule of making people love you."" I say.  
He smiles.  
""See? That's where you are wrong.  
I don't want them to love me...I want them to listen to me."" he says.  
I sigh.  
""Still infringes on their free-will, and thus is against the rules."" I say.  
He laughs.



""Fine, if you are that much of a stickler for the rules, and a coward, I will go for my 2nd wish.  
I wish that I can make all my thoughts become real, if I want to."" he says.  
I sigh.  
Millennia of being a genie, and I had never denied a wish completely, just had to tell them to change it, for it is against the rule.  
And look, here I am denying my 2nd wish, in the span of an hour.  
""Wish...denied."" I say.  
He groans.  
""Why? Why is this one wrong?! I know that genies sometimes made other people genies! Or mages!"" he says.  
I nod.



""If I turn someone into a genie, they are also subjected to the rules, thus it is allowed, as it doesn't endanger anyone.  
Same with giving abilities, or knowledge, or magic to people, as they would be restricted by the rules of magic, by talent, by lack of resources.  
But your wish...your wish is basically reality manipulation, which would infringe on...well, all the rules of wishing!"" I say, tired.  
He sighs.  
""Find, what a waste of time, and a letdown of an experience.  
My last wish: I wish for me to be Lady Luck's favorite son!"" he says.  
Actually, that is at the limit of what I could offer him, but frankly...  
""Wish denied."" I say, disappearing from his place, back into my lamp, as the lamp travels through space and time once more.  
I could have granted that last wish, but no, if I am to do this, I will do it right, and he...he didn't deserve such a good wish.",55
1lwvgcx,n2j11lm,"""I am thee genie of the bottle. Three wishes I may grant upon thee. What dost though wish?"" The spectral apparition emanating from the golden lamp said. 

""Here is my first wish."" The human said. He wore a finely tailored business suit, his skin free of any blemishes and his hair perfectly coiffed. He gave an air of confident calmness, one who is sure of himself and his situation. 

He deposited a one-inch thick binder in front of the genie labelled ""First wish.""

""What is this?"" The genie said. 

""My first wish."" The human said. He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a business card. ""Richard E Rich. Barrister and solicitor. Dewey, Gougem & Howe."" 

""Oh no."" The genie said. ""You're a lawyer."" 

""Not just *a* lawyer."" Richard said authoritatively. ""*The* lawyer who has engaged your services. *The* lawyer with the best case record in the country. You have offered to fulfill three wishes. We have a binding contract you must execute."" 

The genie sighed and thumbed through the binder. The wish was finely detailed in legalese, filled with clauses to prevent any trickery on his part. And this was just the first wish. On the desk were two other binders just as thick. Despite being ageless spiritual entity, the genie shut the binder after reading two pages. 

""No."" The genie said. ""Wish denied."" 

Richard's eyes widened and his body tensed. ""Explain yourself."" 

Richard's wasn't the only one experienced in exploiting loopholes. ""These wishes you wish to perform are unreasonably restrictive. You cannot seriously expect me to read every clause in these mammoth binders."" The genie said. 

""But I don't want my wishes to backfire. You are a trickster."" The lawyer said. 

""It is my nature."" The genie said. ""And these wishes unreasonably constrain me and in fact contradict my personhood. These wishes were drafted in poor faith. Therefore we do not have a valid contract."" The genie said, crossing his arms. 

""But you're not a person!"" The lawyer was getting agitated. ""You're just a spectre, not entitled to constitutional protections!""

""I should like to see you make the argument in court."" The genie said. ""I'd imagine a case like this would take several years, going all the way to your supreme court. And who will pay you for your time? Your firm would find this unacceptable."" 

The lawyer fumed silently. 

""Now, either make 3 proper wishes or I will go and refuse your further summons."" The genie said. 

The lawyer grumbled. ""Fine. You win.""  He cleared his throat. ""I wish the wishes you grant me shall not backfire or affect me negatively in any way."" 

The genie's spectral eyes rolled. ""We've just had this argument. Unacceptable. Farewell."" 

The genie vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving the lawyer alone. He rubbed the lamp and nothing happened. 

He hadn't won, but he hadn't lost either. That was as good as a win.",16
1lwypks,n2i31om,"I came to my senses, gasping for air.  
""Relax, you are safe."" a gentle voice says.  
Turning my head, I see a young woman sitting on a chair, knitting, as she smiles at me.  
""W-where am I?"" I ask, my voice hoarse.  
She puts down the needles, and gives me a glass of water.  
It is Heaven sent.  
""You are in the middle of nowhere, as most kingdoms call it, but it's actually the Ashen Mountains range's territory."" she says.  
I pale, as I remember everything.

  
""I got lost...running from bandits, for more than 10 days I ran, my horse...my poor Bella!"" I sob.  
She sighs.  
""Life is not easier, and the stories have yet to change it seems."" she says.  
I didn't really understand her meaning.  
I look at her, she looks like a noble.  
Clear skin, good hair, looking young...  
""Why are you here? Like I didn't see a single village or town for days on end even before the bandits attacked me."" I ask.  
""Oh, I am exiled here, as a witch, hmmm, been here for 50? 60 years already?"" she tilts her head.  
I freeze.



""You look younger that my daughter."" I say, shocked.  
She giggles.  
""Thank you."" she says.  
I don't know if I said it as a compliment, or just out of shock.  
A witch...will she?  
""I won't try curses, or spells on you. But I will have you eat my porridge slowly, to get your stomach used to food once more."" she says, as if reading my mind.  
""And no, I am not reading your mind, you are just young, and easy to read."" she smiles.  
I...I am 48 years old, though.

  
A few days later, after she nursed me back to a relatively good state, I started helping her.  
Cutting logs, and hunting in the nearby forest.  
At dinner, I had to ask her.  
""Why have you been exiled here?"" I ask.  
""Oh that? Said no to a king, he got angry and took me with his guards back anyway. So, I may or may have not ended his entire family line with a spell, when he tried to get rough. That though, scared the other nobles, and rulers when they heard about it, and sent some paladins to escort me out here."" she says.  
I pale.  
""I am sorry..."" I say.  
""Not your fault, it wasn't you who tried to do that. Also, they would have killed me if they weren't afraid, of my dying curse. But enough of that, let's finish dinner, and then I will teach you how to navigate through the wasteland, so you can get home to your daughter."" she smiled.  
I nodded, and fell silent.  
Such a kind, and calm woman...exiled here for so many years, all alone.  
What a tragic fate, and yet she didn't get bitter, but still remains kind.",52
1lwypks,n2ilbk0,"When she woke, she lay still. Her body ached from endlessly wandering. She had been lost for so long, stumbling through endless wilderness, with barely enough food or water to stay alive. She thought she might die out there, alone.

But now she was inside a shelter, her wounds tended, the air warm and still.

Slowly, she examined herself, then gingerly sat up. She looked around the small, rickety hut. Strange trinkets hung from every beam and cluttered every surface—scraps of thread, bits of bone, rocks and leaves, fashioned into charms.

She breathed in. And out.

Pulling back the tattered flap at the entrance, she stepped outside. The land was twisted and slanted, rocks jutting skyward as though something long ago had struck the earth and cracked its stony heart. Beyond the sparse trees stood a broken obelisk—no work of human hands, but shaped by time’s relentless calamity.

By the leaning pillar stood the witch.

The Witch of Nowhere. Banished fifty years ago to live alone, weeks if not months from civilization.

Working moisture into her dry mouth, the girl took a step forward. She pulled her ruined shawl closer as the wind whistled through the jagged stones. Her heart thudded as she drew nearer, dead leaves crunching beneath her feet. A well of feeling rose in her chest, almost too much to bear.

The witch turned, her eyes bright with tears.

The girl smiled, words and sobs tumbling out all at once.

“I missed you, Grandmother.”",15
1lwypks,n2iqdd1,"“Such a kind, and calm woman” Buddy she killed an entire family line, which implies the children or other innocent souls in it. Surely she had a somewhat less collateral-damage causing curse.

Amazing story, I loved reading it and that she’s not a perfect character.",6
1lwypks,n2is8fl,"Thanks!  
  
Ended\*, it's implying castration or inability to reproduce, not killing.

Ending of a family line = when the last offspring of that bloodline doesn't have or can't have children.

Sure, this means she cursed the kids of the king as well, to be unable to procreate, but it's not about killing.

Though, I agree, theoretically, it's unlikely that truly all of the king's relatives were messed up like he is.",9
1lwka7w,n2fdwz0,"Desina cooed over what she saw, thin glasses perched on the end of her nose. A hand absentmindedly brushed a few errant hairs from her face, as she squinted down. Before her, resting on a pure white cushion was a wilted flower crown. Stems had turned dry and brittle, petals worn and lacking vibrancy.

Touching it gently, she felt the long still pathways of power running through it. The channels through which magic made mere items into powerful weapons. Most thought of artifacts as permanent. Bury one for a thousand years, and it will work just as well as when it was made.

Yet Desina knew better. It was a rare artifact that was as potent after so long. Without it being specifically built into the item to draw in mana from the ambient environment, most fell dud after a few years. It was a simple fact that magic needed magic, powered by those who used it.

This was one such case. She stroked it, before glancing up at the nervous looking fellow before her. Minotaurs she knew were usually brash and bold, yet this one was as meek as a mouse. But she simply smiled, gesturing to it. ""Well, as luck would have it you did indeed find a Crown of Seasons. However, you are wrong in your guess that it is a Crown of Autumn. This is actually a long faded Crown of Spring. You can't use it because the enchantments have degraded.""

She raised her free hand up, forming a simple illusion. One showing near countless runes and artificial leylines, wrapping around to form the shape of the crown. Parts looked delibrately fuzzy, others cracked and broken. ""See? Ot spent too long without being used. I'm sorry, but it's practically useless now.""

The minotaur glanced at it, before bowing his head. ""I see, Rune Mistress. If it is useless, then might I donate it to yourself, for I will have no other use for it.""

Desina couldn't stop a grin from spreading across her face. ""Oh, well I would be delighted to take it!""

The minotaur nodded, stepping away from her. ""Then take it, and I hope it serves you well.""

She touched it one final time, almost reverently. ""I will treasure it, and preserve the little shine it has left, that others may learn from it.""

She barely noticed him leave, focusing in sprucing it up a little. The pathways were ruined, but she could clear up the fuzziness. It would do well for the visitors she got, trying  to craft their own items of power.

She paid no mind to how he left, and his mannerisms. People were weird in her mind. Objects were comforting. They did what they were meant to, or were broken.

The minotaur bowed his head as he exited the building she kept, more of a warehouse than a home. ""My thanks for allowing me to pass.""

And unbeknownst to Desina, the building listened. The broken artifacts were useless alone, but each made up for the others defects. Its protections expanded once more, living and aware.

And along the path outside, new flowers began to sprout.",314
1lwka7w,n2fmdwr,"There was once a time where the sheer radiance from the Oracle of Stroud would have burned away any dust that settled upon it. Thousands upon thousands had sought it out over the centuries, scalding their fingertips until bones poked through in greedy attempts to absorb the great truths that swirled within it. Untouchable, infinite, secrets and power and fortune spewing forth in each beam if only one could get close enough to hold it.

Here I am now, all these years later, cradling the thing that drove so many to madness. Brothers betraying brothers, mothers offering their young, kingdoms crusading oh so relentless all in pursuit of this. This, which is just another thing for me to hold in my hands as I dust it with a rag. This thing, which glows no brighter than the lone ash at the end of a fire. It is exactly what drove me to collecting, the awe-inducing perspective that time brings, the way all suns one day shall cease to shine.

I consider myself less an archivist of items and more so a caretaker. When a great warrior grows old they need tending as they lay in their beds. I've met many a great man whose spirits wilted along with their bodies, as if their aging negated the splendors of their past. But those men are still the giants they were when they rode tall on their steeds and flattened the dirt along their warpaths. And these objects, though the magic remaining is negligible now, their history and might shall never fade so long as someone remains to preserve it.

This role of caretaker is a lonely road which one could not take if they did not find fulfillment in the company of such legacy. I do that which no one else cares to do. People want power, youth, momentum, action. This is a life of slowness and of facing decay, a life that can only be led by someone who understands that even those rendered futile deserve the same care that the mighty do.

Decades ago, when first I began my collection, there would be frequent visitors. When they saw me, an old man myself, their mouths all but watered at the thought of how easily they could strike me down and steal away with endless powers. All it took to disarm them was to hold the door open and beckon them in freely. Their greedy hands would scour object after object, waiting for their skin to hum with newly harnessed power. It took only moments before the hunger turned to frustration. Some left defeated and sullen, some left with curses upon their lips that claimed me to be a great fraud.

I would simply laugh. For I made no advertisement of myself, I took no coin in exchange for access, seeded no words of lore to spread through the land. The legacy of these artifacts spoke for themselves, I merely would open the door and invite anyone who wished inside to see what remained.

It was as I cradled the Oracle of Stroud that I first heard the knocking, the first knocking in no less than three years.

I placed it back on the plush blue cushion it called a home and made my way, slowly as I do these days, to the doors of my halls with my dusting rag still in hand. To my pleasant surprise, the visitor at the door did not break into a flurry of knocks over frustration over being in waiting for as long as it took an old man like me to make my way over.

""You're here!"" a young man, handsome yet dirt-laden from what must've been several days journey greeted me excitedly as I pulled up the large wooden door of my halls. ""I've, well, we've, ridden for six days and six nights to reach you!""

""We?"" I asked, perplexed as I saw only this man before me.

""Forgive me, sir, my manners sometimes forget themselves on long rides. I am Loras of Stoneshollow and a student under the tutelage of Grand Master Havermash,"" Loras placed a hand over his heart and bowed as he spoke to me.

""Well, young Loras of Stoneshollow, I am pleased to meet you. I am -""

""Hector! The Holder of Relics! The Keeper of Calamities! The Patron of Ancient Powers! Hero of the Histories!"" Loras cut me off, ambling off titles that I had been unaware of earning until now. His face reddened in embarrassment as he realized he had spoken over me. ""How rude of me, I mean no harm, I am merely overjoyed to have arrived and finally be standing before you.""",98
1lwka7w,n2frcwm,"The Librarian smiled down at one of their many, many adopted children, bending down to see the object on the table in front of them ""what have you brought me today my darling?"" They said in a soft voice, very close to a whisper as they adjusted their glasses.

The young adventurer grinned up at them, shoving a hand through thick red hair to push it away from his face, revealing a scar down one side ""Mother I found this crown, it looks fae made, so I brought it home with me in hopes it will help you find your name again!""

The ancient silver dragon smiled, huffing a pleased puff of frost ""what a considerate child you are my Johan, I shall treasure this even if it does not help me, as I treasure all the things my children bring me"" they cooed at him, picking up the crumbling fae crown delicately between two claws to place on an empty pedestal at the end of one of their many vast bookshelves.

Johan's face fell slightly. ""Wrong court?"" he asked the great dragon. Getting a nod in return, he slammed his fist into his thigh. ""Dammit! I swear we will find that bastard and make him pay for the things he has done to you, Mother!""

""Oh child, I don't need my true name anymore, all of you children calling me Mother is more than enough for me"" They shrunk down into their chosen humanoid shape of a half elf, shuffling forward to give their now taller son a hug.",47
1lwka7w,n2fmrsi,"""Fret not, dear boy,"" he immediately relaxed and a bright smile returned to his face. ""You must be the one to forgive me, for until now I had thought myself to be simply 'Hector'. It appears word of mouth has spun fanciful tales of my person.""

""Fanciful!"" Loras said with a laugh. ""More like well earned! What you do here, all that you host, it is nothing short of a marvel! That's why we've come all this way. Forgive me again, I'm doing a poor job with my introductions. You cannot see from where you stand, but my classmates are with me and setting up camp your in adjacent field. We all made the journey after Master Havermash told us the legends of your halls.""

""Ah, I see,"" the enthusiasm of the boy was charming. So many young men had eyes sharpened and narrow from the lust for strength, for legacy, and for power. To see him before me, eyes wide to the world and all its offerings, made it all the more difficult to deliver the truth of my halls to him. ""I'm sure your Grand Master told you of the splendors within.""

""He did! Oh and he said there were far more than he could ever know the extent of.""

""It is true, my halls are expansive and filled in most every corner with artifacts. What I fear he did not tell you, or perhaps what he himself does not know, is that my halls are a place of sleepiness and powers long fallen to dormancy. I have never turned a visitor away, and to host you and your peers is a pleasure, but so many who come in leave disappointed.""

""Disappointed?"" Loras was nothing short of shocked to hear that others had felt this way. ""How could that be possible? With all the wonders inside?""

""People come for many reasons,"" I explained. ""But whatever they say, there is a truth underlying it all: they come to harness something beyond themselves. Is it power? Wisdom? Riches? All who enter have in their hearts a desire to take something away with them. So, young Loras, I must ask: what have you come to take?""

""I have come not to take, but rather to observe,"" Loras said quickly and almost defensively. I already was learning him to be an anxious boy, eager to be seen as pleasant and compelled towards being good. ""Well, I suppose them I'm here to take knowledge.""

""Is there something specific you've heard I have in my halls that would give that to you?"" I asked. ""For while I have a great many objects that once would have filled you with enough knowledge to have drive you to madness, they all have long lost the ability to do so.""

""I see, I see!"" Loras laughed and appeared relieved at my words. ""You think we seek something fantastical! No, sir, no! We merely seek to witness history firsthand. We are here for you as much as we are for the artifacts. How fascinating to see them after hearing so many tales, to be in the presence of something that people once spilled blood over in their rabid desperation to attain them. No, sir, we simply wish to tour. We are students of history, and you are the one who knows that history most intimately.""

Many a time I had been sung sweet songs, hymns that promised no harm to me or my halls. And many a time I had been left beaten on my own floors, watching helplessly as scoundrels and thieves filled rucksacks with the innate. But Loras, his eyes did not seem capable of such duplicity. I had heard that the world was changing, but my life and the lives of my objects were so much defined by a world that lusts selfishly and uncontrollably. On my rare excursions to the village, on the nights when sometimes the company of artifacts could not replace the company of conversation over a fireside ale, I had recently begun hearing of a new kind of youth.",82
1lwka7w,n2g1ftt,"Later, after Johan had rejoined his friends outside the labyrinth The Librarian lived in, they were all taking the fact that they hadn't actually found something useful quite seriously. 

""The wrong court? How many bloody courts of fae are there??"" Kagurl, an ork barbarian, rumbled in confused rage ""we will dismantle all of them to find The Keeper of Artifacts name!"" He swore, stamping one of his feet.

""There are the seasonal courts, the two main courts, and the court of... flow..ers..."" the party mage, dressed in robes so large her face was barely visible, trailed off thoughtfully ""the court of flowers supposedly didn't exist until a few hundred years ago"" she hummed, stroking her staff as she thought ""when did The Great One lose their name again, Johan?""

""Mother does not remember, you know this Jasmine, to them, they have never had a name, and no memories before it was stolen except the nightmares"" Johan scowled at Jasmine, crossing his arms over his chest as he did, almost causing the horse he was leading to stumble. 

""All the more reason to consider this new fae court! We should head  to the portal hub right away, this is the best lead we have had in months!"" The druid Zephrelia cried enthusiastically, her long ears wiggling with her excitement as she twirled, letting her long tunic flare around her. ""What a wonderful gift for The Protector of Children, Guardian of us All!""",46
1lwka7w,n2fms95,"""I've met women with more gall to them than that bloody nephew of mine,"" one of the less enjoyable patrons spat one night. ""He has no desire to take up the sword and dares call those who do barbaric. He says a blade is a weapon for war and that words are a tool for peace. Can you believe that? I told my brother I will cry no tears for that son of his when a blade cuts right through his words and leaves him bleeding out in the dirt.""

Perhaps this Loras is the sort of youth that they spoke of in the village.  I'll concede that the thought felt egotistical, but his sincerity seemed to match mine. Mine, however, had been hard won after years of disappointment and toiling behind a sword taught me the futility of bloodshed, he seemed to have been simply born with his.

""Aye, then lad,"" I held the door open further. ""Fetch your classmates. And be warned, when you ask an old man to start talking you better be ready to listen for a good long while.""",82
1lwka7w,n2g4lxv,"Loras had insisted he return to his classmates and have them all clean the journey from their skin prior to entering my halls. Though I knew that dust and dirt were the only things as inevitable as death, I knew it would fall on deaf ears to tell him such. Perhaps it was simply that my old age had made me less precious around the idea of decorum.

“Please, explore freely and come to me with any questions. So long as you are tender in your touchings, you may pick up and examine anything you wish. Do keep an eye out though, the few things that must not be touched are clearly marked.”

Loras had returned with a pack of six equally eager classmates. They stood before me the way baby birds stood looking up at a mother who has just returned with a beakful of worms. So hungry and the kind of youthfulness that made them immune to self consciousness about their excited desire. 

“Sir, if I may,” a small young woman raised her hand. “Your offer of trust to allow us to so freely roam your halls is an honor. And I’m sure I speak for us all when I say exploration is something I fully intend to do. But, as I’m sure Loras mentioned, we have come not only for the artifacts but for you as well. Might you first show us a few of the objects that you most cherish?”

“Yes!” Another young man spoke up. “While the tales of these artifacts so often do precede themselves, the intimate knowings of their custodians are riches only you could provide.”

How precocious a bunch these young students were. I could not help but find them as fascinating as they found me. To see before me one let alone two female scholars was a wonder. And the boy who had just spoken, donning too-large pants cinched at the waist with a makeshift belt and riding boots that surely pinched his feet in their smallness, how the world must have changed if a boy as poor as he could be a student. 

“Well,” I couldn’t help the smile forming beneath the heavy grey beard that grew across my face. “If you insist, we can start that way instead.”

Most people who visited wanted to know immediately what would make them into the richest of men or the mightiest of conquerors. The baseline wants of us mortals were so often primal in their simplicity. These students seemed the perfect bunch who would find the artifacts that most fascinated me as marvelous as I did. And so I led them to one of the furthermost walls of my collection, listening intently to their whispered curiosity and gasps of recognition as we passed by row after row.

“Indulge an old man in his curiosity. Do any of you know what this is?” I lifted up one of the oldest pieces of my collection. A small jagged stone, jet black and pocked with holes over the entirety of its surface. 

They bunched their eyebrows in concentration and passed whispers back and forth. Suddenly, the young woman who had first requested the tour, Serafina, nearly jumped through the ceiling with excitement.

“Sir, sir!” she said with an accentuating hop. “Though I have never seen it, I believe I have read about it. Is that moonstone?”

""Were I your Grand Master, I would give you exemplary marks. Yes, that is correct.”

It took everything to withhold the chuckle that rose within me as her classmates' faces fell in dismay at not being the one to answer me. Serafina made no attempt to hide the smug satisfaction of being paid a compliment by me. Though these students were living proof that the nature of young people was evolving, it was also clear that the competitiveness of youth was not reserved solely for training grounds.",61
1lwka7w,n2g4rc4,"“Moonstone is one of the few objects in my halls that could still be considered valuable enough to be truly worth stealing,” I continued. “Not for the powers it holds, for it holds nothing beyond its physical properties. Rather, it is what can be done with moonstone when one has gathered enough of it to turn it into something useful.”

“The Celestial War of Nations,” Loras spoke at the same time his hand shot up. “The powers of the skies were harnessed and placed in the hands of the greatest warriors. Fallen deposits of moonstone were discovered by a blacksmith in the village of Yanos. He was captivated by the depths of blackness the stone contained and wished to see if he could forge a blade from it.”

“And he did!” added the boy with the too-large pants. “The King of Solaria happened to have his envoy riding through the village shortly after. They chose to make camp and a drunken knight saw the blade of the blacksmith’s hilt as they both drank in the tavern. None of the knights had seen such a thing and asked to wield it. When they realized the deadliness of its cut, the way even the weakest of babes could slice through chainmail like it was butter, they turned the village into the king’s personal production force.”

“It is true,” I nodded in approval. Their Grand Master was a thorough teacher. “The King of Solaria demanded that the deposit of moonstone be harvested dry and for every knight possible to be fitted with moonstone swords. Edmond the Agitator, they called that king. And it was a name well earned, for he sent his knights to both nations adjoining his to conquer them in his name. It was a merciless felling, the legacies of those kings are long lost to the annals of history.”

“Could anyone stop them?” the other female scholar asked. “What weapon could defeat them?”

“Moonstone,” I answered. “Moonstone was the only thing that could match moonstone.”

""All known deposits of moonstone are believed to have fallen due to a singular lunar event,” Sarafina added. “The great astronomers believe it fell to Earth when an asteroid hit the moon thousands of years ago and chipped pieces away. In other words, Yanos may have been where it was first discovered, but other deposits had fallen at the same time it had.”

“And where else had it fallen?” I asked. The students all began calling out the correct answers of ‘Greater Mantis’ and ‘Giant’s Bridge’. 

“Word of mouth spread that Edmond the Agitator had a great weapon so powerful it cut even the steeliest of great swords in half when it met them in battle,” I continued as they hungrily drank in my words. “Kings in the nations that had not yet fallen had criers sent throughout every town. Unfathomable riches, knighthood, a royal bride, anything a person could wish for would be in their hands if they discovered a moonstone deposit.

“As you all know, ‘Greater Mantis’ and ‘Giant’s Bridge’ were the two towns in their respective nations where more moonstone was discovered. Their kings ordered every miner and blacksmith in their realms to work day and night to forge the weaponry needed to meet Edmond’s ferocious knights. Their productions were so swift that, upon arrival, Edmond’s knights had never received word that more moonstone had been discovered.”

“My grandfather always spoke of Edmond the Agitator’s knights to chastise my cousins and I for arrogance in childhood,” another student spoke up. “They had grown so accustomed to easy victory that they had become lazy. No more did knights engage in practice bouts while in camp, for the maneuvering and tactical approaches of traditional battle no longer applied to them and their impossible might.”",54
1lwka7w,n2g4t5d,"“‘Well, well, well, your moon blade has finally struck another,’” Loras spoke in a voice clearly meant to emulate an older man. His classmates all laughed heartily at his joke. Confusion must have shown on my face for Loras looked at me and explained. “It is a turn of phrase our Grand Master favors. We all have been prone to arrogance in debate at one time or another. When someone finally makes a statement that goes head to head with one of ours, that is what he says.”

“A shame your Grand Master did not make the journey, he seems to be a man of equally great wisdom and humor,” I said before continuing my history lesson. “As you all seem to know, Edmond’s knights had grown so accustomed to the ease of moonstone strength that the knights of other nations were able to fell them with relative ease. In fact, in fear of meeting moon blades, all other nations had decreed that soldiers in their armies double their maneuvering practice in an attempt to put up some sort of fight. That discipline paired with moon stone ended Edmond’s rampage as quickly as it had begun.”

“Is it true?” the other young woman asked again. “That moon blades rest far out of our reach under the sea?”

“Yes, it is true,” I confirm. “The Celestial War of Nations grew tiresome in its bloodiness. Knights were equally matched in their prowess with the moonblades and battles often ended in exhaustion-induced stalemates. The only advantage was against the weaponless, dark times fell across all of the lands as raiding parties tore through villages. As hungry as the surviving kings were, even they grew weary as the only blood to be spilled was of mothers and babes.”

“The Armless Assemblage,” said Loras. “Organized by the Wizard of No Nation. The kings all agreed to ride to the Valley of Rivers to meet. No weapons, no armies.”

“It is indeed a great irony of human history that one of the greatest peaces was forged in the fires of the bloodiest of times,” I continued. “Five kings met with the Wizard of No Nation as the mediator, and five kings returned home with orders for their armories to gather all moon blades and deliver them to the Valley of Rivers where the Wizard of No Nations vowed to dispose of them.”

“Did he use his magic to transport them to see?” a student asked.

“I heard he had a dragon that he rode up as they carried all of the blades in his talons,” another added.

“History does on occasion grow bleary in its recollections. The Wizard of No Nations said only that the blades would belong to the sea. It is lost to time how he did this. Or if he did it at all. Perhaps they are in the Valley of Rivers to this day.”",71
1lwr7ge,n2ghpt1,"“So I heard this dude *wanted* us to send a Cataclysm Class Nuke?” Jackson asked, using his rifle as he swept through the rubble.

“Yep!” Ahmed said, as he pushed some other rubble over, revealing a passage.  “Course we just sent an old Cracker class instead.”

Jackson laughed.  “I didn’t realize we still had those in service.  Amazing it still worked.”

“Well Ezeloap’s Fortress covered a lot of land and we didn’t want to risk him actually handling the Harvest Class.”

“Fair enough.  I mean, can we call it Magic anymore?  It’s just Earth based creatures can’t interact with it, for whatever reason.”

“I’m not going to get involved in the 800 year debate over whether it can be considered Magic, Psionics, or whatever you want to call it,” Ahmed said.

“Found some more.” Jackson said, as he went down and picked up some tiny rabbit like creatures.  “They’re so fluffy.”

“Remember, Ezeloap could be any of those.”

“Whatever.”",50
1lwr7ge,n2h6pxq,"The Evil Wizard laughed at his henchmen’s concern “No mortal can match my power! Let them send this ‘nuke’ of theirs!” 

""B-b-but, your Evilness, this weapon is said to be the most powerful weapon the mortals have at their disposal,"" the puny henchman stuttered for a moment, flinching slightly from The Evil Wizard.

The Evil Wizard raised his hands slowly to the sky, fingers splayed. Flames belched forth from one hand, lightning erupted from the other. The air itself seemed to run away from The Evil Wizard's power. With a foul, evil cackle, The Evil Wizard looked towards the sky. 

""Behold, lowly servant! They send their steel wind riders to oppose me! And I shall strike it from the sky!"" A large bolt of pure lightning burst forth from The Evil Wizard's outstretched hands, streaking forth like the wrath of a displeased god. There was a distant explosion, the flying craft  seemingly engulfed in a fireball. 

""Truly, you are the most powerful wizard in all the world, your Foulness. Indeed, the only one still remaining in these lands,"" the puny henchman cowered in fear, praying that the wizard didn't turn a spell on him.

***************************************

Meanwhile, above the skies of the Northern Kingdoms, a fighter streaked across the sky. At the FOB Spectre, in the tower, two men stood, waiting for the radio to crackle to life. 

""Berserker to Control, come back. Tower's still there. We can launch whenever. Sidenote, he tried to attack me, but the chaff stopped the bolt,"" the pilot of the craft spoke into his microphone.

""Control to Berserker, solid copy. Bring it to ground, we're sending it."" Captain Jones spoke into the radio, smirking happily. His associate slowly turned a key, a wide grin on his lips. Alarms began to blare across the base. 

In a distant part of the FOB Spectre, a pair of semicircular panels opened to reveal a deep, dark shaft. Inside stood the stark white construct that they hoped would end The Evil Wizard. It began to rumble ominously, smoke and flame belching out of the bottom for a split second. Suddenly, it shot forth from the shaft, flames still erupting out of the bottom, carrying it swiftly into the sky. 

At the very apex of its travel, the flames sputtered out, and the missile began to fall. The Evil Wizard cared little for the strange new weapon; indeed, he believed his power to be supreme, and thus raised only a paltry defense, just above the top of his tower. He watched with amusement as the weapon arced back down to the earth, headed straight for his tower. The missile grew bigger, and bigger. Until, with a mighty ear-shattering explosion, it smashed headlong into the magical barrier. 

The barrier shattered instantly. The tower was obliterated almost instantly, the shockwave from the explosion sending debris outward. Suddenly, the fireball created by the weapon lifted into the sky, superheated air creating a vacuum that began to suck the debris into the epicenter. This did include The Evil Wizard's body, and that of the puny henchman.

While the henchman was utterly destroyed by the thermonuclear explosion, The Evil Wizard survived, magically augmented as he was. What he didn't survive was the radiation, ravaging his body almost immediately. His own protective magics began to falter as his body weakened. Hair began to fall out, he began to vomit uncontrollably, his flesh seeming to melt away. Within moments, The Evil Wizard was nothing more than a pile of bone, his protective magics failing him.

With no flesh, no connective tissue or muscle, it meant that The Evil Wizard could not gesticulate, no lungs meant that he could not breathe in order to chant. No magic could restore him now. The intense heat blackened the etched and runed bones, the DNA unraveling almost instantly. The Evil Wizard, now trapped inside a useless skeleton, could not cast a spell now. He had been truly, utterly defeated.",45
1lwr7ge,n2hf2nl,"""This is then,"" Walter Bergman held out the old crossbow passed down through generations of hunters who had fought and sealed the Evil Wizard time and time again. Only to toss it to one side and reveal a small remote with a red button. ""This is now. This is nuke.""

Far away, in the dark tower, the Evil Wizard laughed at the mirror projection of the newest Bergman to take up the hero's mantle. ""No mortal can match my power! Send this nuke thing if you dare!""

His henchmen protested. They begged him to flee. Regardless of what trickery or strange alliances with the supernatural these Bergman hunters did, they have always won. Better to live another day to plot more evil deeds. Yet, they also knew. Their master was always too proud to step aside.

As the wizard's laughter echoed through tower, so did the rapid footsteps of his henchmen. The wizard could come back from the dead, but they could not. They would not stick around to see the nuke hit. For they were not an ancient relic who was ignorant of modern technologies. They knew all too well the massive range of a nuke.

""Come back here, you fools!"" The Evil Wizard shouted. ""Watch me destroy this nuke with a fireball! Fire your nuke at me! What are you waiting for!""

""For your men to wisely evacuate,"" Walter replied calmly, observing through the mirror projection. ""They rightfully fear the power of this nuke. Unlike all my ancestors' attempts to seal you away. This shall end you for good. It is my wish that I be the last hunter. That my family can live in peace and choose their own paths.""

Once he was confident through his scrying that the henchmen had taken all the boats and left the island where the dark tower was, Walter pressed the button.

It was nothing like the glorious stories of partnerships with mysterious entities of the Sullen Woods. Of friendships with elves and dwarves, who had put their differences aside for just a week to defeat the Evil Wizard. There was no grand quest or adventures. No adventuring party or band of heroes.

Just him building, and now launching this nuke against the wizard.

It was mere seconds when the entire island erupted. Taking out the  wizard, the tower, and even the island itself.",17
1lwr7ge,n2ini3b,"""But my lord, they speak of it as a weapon that can level cities in an instant!"" The servant insisted, receiving only a roll of the eye from their master.
""The mortals can level cities all they wish, I have reshaped continents, I walk upon the ash of a thousand civilisations and they think something so simple as material based weapons can stand in my way? No, let them come my servant, with their aircraft and their nuclear weapons, they can bring their foulest of armaments but this fortress shall stand as it always has, unmarred by the arrogance of the lesser."" She allowed herself a malicious cackle, a tad undignified perhaps but what is power if not the ability to act as you wish, free of consequence?

""There's no indication of their surrender, authorisation has come down, launch."" Two keys turned in the panel of the nuclear submarine, and three missiles equipped with the most powerful nuclear warheads mankind could manufacture surged from the launch bay, the island could not be allowed to remain, the Mage's defiance of all world governments had come to this head, and oh boy the eco heads will be furious about the massive swathe of irradiated ocean, but orders were orders.

The Wizard-Lord perched on the bannister of her highest tower's balcony, watching the three spears of light heading towards her home, mage-sight showed they were indeed within only the limits of current mortal science, and she rolled her eyes before looking to her servant, extending the hand with her wineglass, which was refilled by the still shaky hand. 'but no matter, after this they will know better than to question my knowledge'

The missiles reached their detonation height, nuclear weapons being designed to explode in the air to deal the maximum damage, and three brilliant flashes of miniature suns burst forth and became one, the light washing over the island, leaving nothing to be seen when the light finally faded.. or so the submarine's commander had anticipated.

The light washed over the island, brilliantly dazzling as it bent around the eons-old warding schema, bright enough to blind, yet the inhabitants below suffered no such affliction as the energy flowed smoothly over their home without so much as changing the pleasant breeze that flowed through the expansive gardens of the courtyard. The Wizard-Lord sipped her wine with a content sigh, pointedly ignoring the sound of breaking glass as the servant behind her fainted in fear, the poor girl could be forgiven that slip.

As the light of Localised Nuclear Armageddon slowly faded away, sun shone upon ancient brick and mortar unmarred, the fortress which repelled all foes, the pirate's bane, the eternal bastion, home of the Wizard-Lord. And she allowed herself a smirk, ""perhaps now they are willing to see more reason?"" her cloak billowed as she slipped from the balcony, moving towards the fortress's great barrier, time for this diversion to come to an end.",9
1lwxb23,n2hu2z0,"Pouring the high-elf druid some tea, I smile.  
""I see. So I was known as ""Alice von Argent""."" I say.  
He thanks me for the tea, and nods.  
""Yes. Before being known as ""Mother"", you were a receptionist for the Adventurer's Guild, nicknamed ""mother"", as you were like a mother hen.  Protective, and crazy. You gave out free newbie gift bags, and personally scouted most wild monsters, and dungeons creating guides, so that fewer newbies die due to not having enough information. You beat up, and outright revoked their Adventurer licenses, of those who bullied the weak."" he chuckles.  
I smile.  
That does seem like me.

  
""How are you? How is your tribe? If I remember correctly, I did once help you plant a Mother Tree, and relocate your tribe to a new forest."" I ask.  
He nods.  
""You forgot many things, but the important parts are there."" he smiles.  
I nod.  
""We are good. We became one of the 12 guardian tribes of the Elven Empire since then, and our population is the biggest out of all the tribes, thanks to the elixir you have created."" he continues.  
Ah, the Mother's Blessing, an elixir that increases chances of a successful pregnancy, and strengthens the baby.  
""How can I help?"" I ask him.  
He shakes his head.

  
""I came here today, because I heard about your tour. Are you about to visit all the kingdoms, and Empires of the world, ready to help those in need?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""My fellow believers in kindness are everywhere, but there is unrest in recent times, and they need someone to give them hope."" I smile.  
""It's a ruse. There are a few Churches behind the unrest, and the ultimate goal is to end the ""Mother's Cult"".  
They will create a war, in which you, and your followers will inevitably die, as you will try to help, and maybe even end the conflicts. Then they will swoop in, save the day, and become the first choice of the people, when choosing faith."" he says.  
I smile.

  
""Does this come from my friend, or from the Pope of the Church of Forests?"" I ask.  
He chuckles.  
""Both."" he says.  
His Church is unaffected by me, and my help, because the elves will always believe in the Goddess of Nature, and follow the Church of Forests, before they believe in anyone else.  
""Thank you, for telling me this, but I already knew."" I say.  
""Figures. You always placed information high up on your priority list."" he says.  
""Like how you are about to ascend? Congratulations."" I say, and he pales.  
""I prepared a basket of goodies, for you and your family. I know of the dangers that are about to greet me, but they were always there, so nothing changes. I am happy to know I have a friend like you, and will make sure to spend extra time in your tribe."" I say.  
He laughs, and says he will get me drunk, like he did so many centuries ago.  
I watch him leave with a smile, and then go to prepare my bag for the journey.  
Walking around the world will take some time, but it is worth it, for like this, I can help more people.",8
1lwbpu8,n2dj5yy,"“Hello…. Hello…. Hello…. Hello…” The mimic repeated, dragging its wooden skull along the window of the tavern, further terrifying the humans who had barricaded themselves inside. After its epiphany, the mimic searched for a human town, hoping by chance it would find itself a quest there. Not wanting to scare the humans, it changed its treasure chest form, taking the shape of something it thought looked more human. Though, human was the last thing it looked, its disguise far worse than its regular appearance.
 
“SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING.” Bargus screamed. The burly bartender, who often bragged about how many men he could beat in a fight, cowered behind his counter, placing his hands over his ears, trying to block out the voice.
 
“Why don’t you do something about it? Didn’t you say you were the manliest man in town, or whatever nonsense you sprout while trying to get under my dress?” Jackie said, leaning against the edge of a table. Unlike most of the other customers who were panicking, Jackie remained calm, partly because she believed she was far too pretty to die first. When the door inevitably broke open, some other poor soul would get torn apart, and when that happened, she could escape, or even snag herself a dashing hero if one were to come and rescue them.
 
“I AM WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING MEN. That thing isn’t even close to being a man. It’s a wooden monster.”
 
“Hello.” The mimic said, its glowing red eyes peering through the window, highlighting its horrifying features. Everyone inside seeing the splintered wood it used to create a human skull and its long drooling tongue. Its tongue running along the window, leaving an acidic trail of goo behind. The goo sizzling against the glass before it popped, the sound startling the mimic who backed away as the window crumbled into smaller pieces. “Thank you.” It said, accepting that as an invitation to enter. It began its slow climb through the window, one leg hooking over it.
 
“Someone do something.” Jackie said, not as confident in her plan anymore. She kicked off her heels, preparing to run as soon as she saw the opportunity to escape. She also threw her heels towards where Bargus was hiding, hoping to trip the oaf over at some point to buy herself more time.
 
“Why don’t you try flirting with it?” Evelyn's muffled voice called out. The bard hiding in her lute’s wooden case, folding herself into a small tucked pose, trying to avoid getting eaten by whatever that creature was. Even as she hid, she was already thinking of lyrics for the tale she was going to sing about this someday.
 
“She’s in the lute box.” Jackie shouted, pointing to the box.
 

“What? Y-you. Why would you tell it that?” Evelyn squealed, a loud thumping coming from the box as she tried to unlock the hatch. Though, given how dark it was in the box, her attempts were futile. “Oh, no. I think I’m stuck…”
 
Before the mimic got into the tavern, a hand landed on its shoulder, a hand belonging to the 800-year-old village mage. “You know this tavern has a door, don’t you?” She smiled, causing the wrinkles on her face to rise. Mary went to open the door, only to feel a heavy weight pushing against it, keeping it in place. “Oh, never mind. The doors locked, carry on.” She said, acting as if she was a natural observer to this chaos, even if she intended to step in if it tried to kill someone.
 
“Is someone outside? HEY! HELP US OH DASHING HERO AND MY HEART AND SOUL ARE YOURS. OH, and my body too…” Jackie grinned. Heroes were loaded. If she could sucker one into marrying her, she wouldn’t have to lift a finger again. This could turn out perfectly for her. “Oh, please, hero. Rescue us.” She put on her most charming voice, hoping to woo them into rescuing her.
 
The mimic stared at Mary, shambling towards her, its wooden legs twisting, causing it to walk in an awkward motion, before it lurched forward, gripping Mary’s shoulder with a light touch. “Quest? Me, adventurer. Old lady have quest?”
 
“Old lady?” Mary laughed. “I’m a little insulted that a mimic can tell I’m old. Guess I can’t be too mad. I am 800. You want a quest?” She played with the silver frame of her glasses before coming up with something. She twisted her wrist and extended her palm, creating an ethereal image of a human. “Try to look more like that. Go stand over by that tree while you do it.”
 
“Ok.” As it shambled over to the tree, Mary grinned.
 
“What a polite monster.” She spun around, creating a flurry of wind, sending whatever was behind the door flying away from it. With the door unlocked, she entered, only to get shoved against the wall, finding Jackie’s heavily make-up decorated face inches away from hers.
 
“My hero.” She said, eyes already shut as she leaned in for a kiss, only for Mary to put her palm over Jackie’s lips.
 
“Um, Jackie? It’s me.” She said, pulling away her hand, staring at the red lipstick print on it.
 
Jackie’s eyes shot open, and she stepped back. “Mary? Oh, it’s only you.” She sighed, making sure Mary knew how disappointed she was.
 
“Did you try to flirt with Mary? I can’t wait to write a song about that. The foolish lover and the mysterious hero.” Evelyn laughed, halting her escape plans so she could tease Jackie.
 
“Oh, is that funny to you?” Jackie walked over to the box, placing her hands on the lid, sending a loud thud through the wood.
 
“W…what are you doing? I was only kidding… I promise.”
 


Jackie said nothing, before brutally shaking the wooden box, sending the small bard bouncing around inside of it. The box letting out a chorus of oofs and ow’s as Evelyn cried out.
 
“STOP SHAKING IT. IT’S REALLY SCARY. I CAN’T SEE ANYTHING. HELP ME MARY, JACKIE’S BULLYING ME.”
 
“Jackie, that’s enough.” Mary said, and Jackie reluctantly stopped. As soon as she released the box, Evelyn fell out of it, the bard’s face pale as she tried not to be sick. Evelyn hiccupped a few times before hugging the ground, using it to keep herself from getting dizzier.
 
“Fine. She started it.”
“I tried my best to hold the creature back, but then my stomach started to hurt. What bad timing, I would have used that damned wooden monster to repair my barstools.” Bargus said, only now pulling himself to his feet.
 
“I’m sure you would have. Anyhoo, I should check on our monster. Be well, everyone.” Mary headed for the tree, finding the mimic in a more humanoid body. Their skin was now a smooth hazel color, with a properly detailed face. Sure, some features weren’t perfect, such as their ears being a little low, or their face only having two nostrils instead of a nose, but it was closer than it had looked before. It even had some leafy green hair that was filled with small magical gemstones and rings.
 
“Quest done.” It said, holding out its hand, expectingly.
 
“Good job.” Mary said, fishing around in her pockets for a reward. She found a minor magical gem, one of the many gems she always kept on her. With little fanfare, she dropped it into the creature’s hand.
 
The mimic didn’t even look at the reward, shoving it straight into its mouth before nodding. “Thank you. Quest?” It asked, already ready to collect more items.
 
“Hm.” Mary didn’t exactly have another quest in mind, but she wanted to study this fascinating specimen further. Also, she needed to keep it away from the villagers, wanting to avoid anyone accidentally getting hurt. “Come with me. You can be my assistant.”
 
“Assistant is quest?” It asked.
 
“Many quests.”
 
“Many quests, many rewards. Ok, I assist.” It agreed, following Mary back to her home.

1lwbpu8,n2czd49,"Everyone thought the children were simply up to more of their foolishness when they said an adventurer had staggered out of the old, half-buried dungeon. Nothing came out of there these days except for an occasional candlesoul. Most of the families found more work for their children to shirk; idle youths tended to imagine the wildest of things.

But then the trinkets began showing up. The tailor's old wedding ring, still enchanted to gleam in the darkest depths. He would've beaten the cobbler's son bloody if he hadn't explained it was the adventurer's gift. The blacksmith's first shield, impregnable still after thirty years unmaintained, was the straw that led the village to organize. The cobbler's son was rounded up, his friends herded into the town square, and the blacksmith demanded to know just where they'd found his daughter's old shield. The truth, he demanded, with none of this nonsense about adventurers emerging from the long-closed doors.

And then the adventurer came. It wore the cobbler's finest work, shoes that shifted to always keep one's balance, and it needed them—it was hard to walk without legs. Its prehensile tongue wrapped around the blacksmith's mace, heavy as a falling star and still wrapped in his daughter's hand.

Its friends were under attack, and the adventurer would defend them.

1lwbpu8,n2d5cnq,"Glorbo had grown tired of adventurers sticking their hands in his mouth to find treasure and gear. Which he did have. All from chomping the hands of adventurers. Swords, shields, magical rings, he had them all.

All he needed was something to do with all that loot.

Like questing. Making money.

Being and adventurer.

It was several months ago that he was once robbed by some small mind flayer that declared itself an adventurer. It had the audacity to slip in its tentacles to scrounge for treasure in Glorbo's belly. If that slimy little shit could be one, why not Glorbo?

For the first time in its life, the mimic had a goal. No longer content to simply roaming around being assailed by adventurers, it would become one of them. It would journey behind this cave and see the world. Maybe there would be more loot outside. More people to bite. More treasures to hoard in its belly.

Merrily, Glorbo bounced out of the cave towards any signs of civilization. He recognized the Adventurer's Guild signage. Had the same symbol as the various adventurer badges he had seen. Ignoring the shocked townsfolk and onlookers, he made his way inside and demanded to speak to the receptionist.

""I'm here to register as an adventurer,"" Glorbo stated.

""Oh my god, a talking mimic!"" The woman at the reception table gasped. ""Guards, get rid of it before it eats us!""

""Wait, woman, shut your trap,"" Glorbo hissed. ""I'm registering as an adventurer. Not here to eat one. Excuse me, I'm an intelligent creature, not a mindlessly hungry one. And can you blame me? These adventurer types stick their hand and crawl into me digging for treasure.""

She signalled the Guild guards to step away and asked, ""Why do you want to sign up as one?""

""I like loot. Treasures,"" Glorbo yapped away. ""Don't you hand out rewards to adventurers when they complete quests and bounties? I want some of that too.""

""How unusual...""

""Hey, don't you have some [kid mind flayer](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1gjudqg/wp_mimics_can_talk_of_course_we_can_you_idiot/lvgtjlo/) as a registered adventurer?"" The mimic snorted. ""If that little shit can be one, I'm even more qualified. I'm an adult. I am geared for difficult quests,"" he pulled out a heavy broadsword from his belly and hefted it with his tongue. ""I know how to use this sword.""

""Very well, here's your application form,"" the woman slid a piece of paper across the desk to Glorbo. ""Fill in your details, and I'll process your application.""

""What? Forms?"" The mimic was incensed. ""Address? Base of operations? What are all these things?""

""Details we need to keep track of our adventurers,"" the receptionist replied. ""These details are compulsory for your application to pass.""

*""I can help,""* an annoyingly familiar voice came from behind.

""You...little shit,"" Glorbo spun around to snarl at the small mind flayer.

""*I am Lando, mind flayer adventurer. Not some little shit.""* The tiny creature pouted. ""*You seem to be in a pickle.""*

""I don't have an address. My cave isn't solely my house. So many other monsters live in there.""

""Join us then. You can fill in your address as ours. Your adventuring group is our adventuring group,"" Regis the rogue entered the guild along with his partner, James the wizard.

The same wizard who Glorbo remembered tried to throw fireballs at him.

""Wait...the three of you, are you here to pick on me again?""

""*No, we're here to submit a quest we just completed.""* Lando said. *""I don't mind adding a new party member, even if by accident.""*

Regis beamed. ""So, James, do you want to say something?""

""Yes, I object,"" the wizard frowned. ""Who is to say that mimic won't try to take our gear? He seems to dislike us from some previous encounter.""

""Lando and I are voting yes anyway, so the mimic is ours,"" Regis patted the mimic cheerily as if they were suddenly friends.

With the form completed, the receptionist produced an adventurer's badge and gave it to the mimic.

""So, where you wanna pin your badge?"" Regis asked. ""You don't have a shirt or anything to pin it.""

""*I say we tie a sash to the mimic and stick the badge there.*"" Lando proposed helpfully. ""*And then...we can take a new quest. With our new mimic member. I want that roving orc band quest so I can slurp their brains.""*

So, it was, Glorbo joined his first adventuring party and took his first quest to go slay some orcs. With some overly chatty, airheaded rogue, a grumpy wizard whose solution to almost everything ""FIREBALL"" and a tiny mind flayer who did the thinking.

1lwbpu8,n2f72xd,"The darkness of the dungeon was shattered as the door creaked open. Once again another adventurer had arrived. This one was different. He barely looked towards me, I practically coughed to get his attention. Sliding a gold piece from my interior a soft clang hit the ground. The adventurer turned, a young man with darkness in his eyes, he jumped back startled. He wasn't the usual sort, determined and greedy, the kind that were fat with food that made them delicious morsels over several days. He was gaunt with nary a weapon besides a small dagger clung by pale white hands. Usually the adventurers skins were darkened from the sun, but he had seldom seen the light.

The boy probed around the corner, eyeing me, suspicious as he noticed my most recent meal and halted. A fat delectable greedy man who tried to pry me open so quickly on sight I almost hadn't reacted. How quick they were to open the belly of the beast. And how quick I was to feast. The boy stared without movement, not at me masquerading as treasure near flawlessly, but at the mass beside me, or at least what was left of it. My last meal, I snatched his greedy arms first before devouring his chest. The remaining half of his body lay motionless, being saved for later. I preferred to savor the greedy men especially recently as fewer and fewer people came. Resigned to eating rats that came too close to burrow into my wooded sides. Perhaps because I was full at the moment this new adventurer kept my rapt attention as he stared at the mass tears forming in the boys face as he grasped the sides of his worn tunic. He stepped to approach before stopping and looking directly at me. ""Please,"" he cried softly into the torch lit room, ""I Just want to take him home."" He made a step forward, braver than the ones that brought him here. Curious I spat another gold piece close to my waiting maw. ""I don't want your treasures, I just want my father buried."" He said as he made another step a low growl began to emit from my interior warning him to stop. I may have been full but I would not be opposed to having more for later. The boy froze and took a look back at the scene of bones strewn across the room.  Many adventurers but also animals.  ""I'll offer you a trade."" He said as he looked around desperately in the room, noticing a small hole where rodents ran too and fro. He reached into the hole, wincing as I heard a bite and a yelp come from the boy he produced a large rat from the wall scrambling against his clenched fingers, now red with blood as the rat fought for his freedom. He approached me slowly as he lowered the rat thrashing about towards my opening maw, my tongue grabbed the rat and ripped it form his hands as the young boy grabbed the mound that was his father, tugging him towards the exit. I spat another gold coin onto the body of his father signaling that the trade was accepted, but the boy stopped tugging at his father and stared as I finished devouring the rat. ""You, were just hungry,"" he looked around the room, at the mess. ""I forgive you.""

I rattled forward towards the mass of the boy's father and helped push him towards the exit. ""This dungeon is scary and dusty, Would you like to come with me?"" The boy asked with trepidation as we entered the well lit torched hall.

I shook with excitement at the thought. The chance to leave this dungeon, where food was scarce. I had never thought to leave for I had no direction but now. 

""There's some mean people at the village, that I'm sure would make great meals. papa always said they weren't no better than animals."" As I helped this orphaned boy move the mass of my last meal I knew there would be many more to come and I clambered at the opportunity to be an adventurer like so many before me.",12
1lwv9n4,n2hizd3,"I start singing a Song of Strength.  
The healer just slammed his own ears, and started burning the goblins with his healing spell, and our necromancer just summoned a few skeletons, before ignoring the fight, marveling at the drawing on the wall.  
I sighed, but then smiled.  
My singing was so good, that the goblins were losing their strength when hearing my voice.  
The few skeletons were actually useful, and we managed to clear this goblin camp.  
It smelt bad, because the healer did burn them a bit.  
As I went for the loot, I stopped.  
""Alethea! Come back, you are going in the wrong direction!"" I say to the necromancer, whom for some reason started following a floating leaf.

  
After several detours, and having subdued several bandits with my Song of Love, we finally reached the town.  
As we entered the Guild, we were welcomed with whispers.  
We were famous.  
""The Trio."" they called us.  
I smiled proudly, and led the other two towards the receptionist.  
There we got the bounty of the bandits, and the reward for the goblin cleanse mission.  
Then I looked at my fellow adventurers.  
""Want to hear a song?"" I smile.  
""NO!"" they all scream.  
I chuckle.

  
""Don't worry, you don't have to pay."" I say.  
The adventurers even started taking out their weapons.  
How cute, if they can't pay with gold, they would offer their weapons.  
""No singing in the Guild. Policy."" the receptionist says coldly.  
I pout.  
""Understood."" I say, leaving.  
The healer, Matt, tries to offer his services to some of the wounded adventurers, but he is also chased away.  
This is why I love being an adventurer.  
We take care of each oth...  
Where is Alethea?



We search for our dear necromancer, and found her on the roof of our inn, trying to catch the smoke coming out of the chimney.  
""Come down! It's easier to catch mist, than smoke!"" I say to her.  
She nods, and jumps off of the roof.  
Thankfully, she's knows how to levitate.  
""Let's go inside. Eat, and drink, and sing!"" I say, as we go inside the inn, while Althea goes the other way, but we caught her this time.  
Inside, I start singing, and the other patrons start crying tears of joy.  
Matt, for some reason is healing someone he had an argument with, as the other man starts screaming in pain.  
Althea, on the other hand, is doing a hand-stand, counting...the roaches?  
Sigh.  
It is hard being the only one normal in our team, but they are good people, and know their stuff.",7
1lwcbef,n2d0kd6,"I sit in pitch black darkness, reading some books.  
Perks of having night vision, I guess.  
Then, 4 knocks on my door, before hurried steps are heard further, and further away from my room.  
I open it, and squint because of the faint light in the hallway.  
A tray of food sits on the floor, as usually, my dinner.  
""Thank you."" I mutter to no one in particular, before eating it right there.  
Then I go back inside, as some servant will take the tray away, but not before making sure I am in my room.  
Such is my life...as someone with darkness magic.

  
In our world, when you are born with magic, your eyes reflect the type.  
Fire users have eyes like pools of magma, or like bonfires blazing through the darkest nights.  
Wind users have swirling tornadoes, or hurricanes.  
Ice users have glacial expanses, with blizzards raging deep within.  
Me?  
I have been born with eyes like black holes...endless, hungering darkness.  
And ever since then, I was locked in this room.  
First, with a nanny, and then...all alone.  
Why?  
Because I am history's first recorded darkness magic wielder.

  
What could I do, that I terrified people so much?  
They don't even know, I think.  
The first act of magic I ever did, was when my nanny was sent away, and I wrapped the darkness around me, creating a sturdy cloak.  
Since then, I learnt to manipulate darkness, and use it to devour stuff.  
I can eat light with my darkness, and heat, but I don't know about other sources of energy.  
I also can travel through shadows, and darkness, and eavesdrop.  
I never left my room in the last 15 years, but I know everything.  
That's why I am still here.

  
My parents, Goddess above bless their heart, still worry about me.  
They haven't stopped, stealthily trying to find someone they can trust, to look at me.  
A mage or an alchemist or someone.  
They are scared for me...because my mana is really, really dark, and deep.  
They think I am fated for an ill outcome, and want to help me.  
It's a bit ironic.  
What can be worse than never seeing your parents in person, and having all servants and everyone run away in fear of you?  
Sigh...  
I wonder if mom's or dad's hug would feel the same way, as when darkness hugs me?  
I...I am getting tired of listening to them.  
I know I am not dangerous to anyone...so why? Why shouldn't I leave my room?",115
1lwcbef,n2dei3l,"Darkness is an interesting thing. It is ancient and powerful, but it's also rare. It's hard to control. In this world, most people have eyes that reflect their power. Most of them are elemental. Some are Ethereal, like divine light or the power to heal.

Mine? Oh, it's the very essence of darkness. Chaos itself. I can't say I don't have fun using it. Travelling around in the shadows and popping up in unexpected places is a way to make friends. But it could scare some when they pop out from underneath their beds. Or from their wardrobe. Most look at me with fear and disgust. They think I'm a freak. Honestly, I can't blame them. My eyes can be scarry.

""Hello! Nice to finally meet you!"" Says Alicia in a measured tone. I can tell she is uncomfortable with my presence. After all, she is an ice user, so her powers would do nothing to me. But she controls it better than most.

""Nice to meet you too! Also, apologies if I'm too close. It's hard to control the exit point. Please feel free to let me know if this is too much. My presence is sometimes overwhelming."" I said as I put on my glacier style sunglasses that were designed to block some of my powers. She visibly relaxed.

""Uhm... It's fine. They did warned me about this, but I wasn't expecting it to be this intense.""

""Oh yeah, that happens a lot. Amongst those who met me the first time, you were one of the best at handling it!"" I told her with a smile on my face. Hard to find people who can withstand the gravity I produce sometimes.combined with their primal fear of the unknown and dark. It's an impressive feat. ""You probably get this a lot, but your eyes are so radiant and beautiful. I'm almost jealous!"" I smile. She becomes 4 different colours of red in a spam of a second."" You know you also seem like you would be chill at parties!"" She looks at me for a second before she cracks a smile. Keep it up!""I'm a bit confused here! Your eyes are so cold they could freeze a mountain, but your smile seems to be so warm it would melt it right back!"" Now she went through the entire spectrum of the colour red in seconds. I need to stop before she blushes herself to death. Well, what can I say? Not many can resist the attraction of a blackhole. It even makes lame pick up lines effective.",39
1lwcbef,n2ed12u,"The eyes are the window to a person's soul. A reflection of who they are. A glimpse of the magic that lay within.

My father was the quintessential pyromancer. Red hair, red eyes, and a fiery, bombastic personality to match. Mother was a quiet, silver-haired maiden with grey eyes one would associate with cryomancers. After six siblings that took after our mother, Father had eagerly awaited for a child to inherit his fire.

He rejoiced upon seeing the small crop of red hair. But taken aback by the empty black eyes that stared at nowhere in particular.

My parents tried very hard to shelter me from the judging looks of our neighbours. All while praying that my eyes were a mere anomaly, and not a sign of the long-lost art of shadow magic. Not that they feared it. Their greatest concern was that there was nobody to teach me. That I could possibly spend my whole life not practicing the magic which lived and breathed and sustained our world.

So, they decided, when I was old enough to take care of myself and travel the world, they would let me go. Somewhere out there, someone else with eyes like black holes could possibly exist. Could teach me how to practice the magic that I was born to do.

One of the first places I went to was The Library of Caleida. This was where they catalogued the various schools of magic. Surely, there was someone who knew. Various mages came to speak to me. One of them, an old man with a gigantic, floppy hat gestured for me to follow him.

To a gallery which showcased the portraits of famous mages who once worked in the library. He pointed Vasilen the Vile. The last known shadowmancer. Born four hundred years ago. His eyes were black, but shiny. They reflected light, as eyes of most mages do. ""Most"" he said, because I was the first exception he'd witness. Mine appeared to him as a vast emptiness. A deep darkness without an end in sight.

There was no more the mages of the Library of Caleida could show me. So, they shared some rations and bid me good luck on my journey to discover myself. But not before pointing me to the Antiluvian Archives.

Where records of long banished gods were maintained.

Perhaps one had snuck their way through The Veil to briefly touch my soul. Or so that's what a few librarians thought. It was the only thing they could think of, as nearly impossible as that was. The Veil had kept out the gods for over a thousand years. Ever since the famous Archmage Merlin cast them out, so they may no longer demand worship and manipulate humans as playthings or pawns on a chessboard. His descendants have maintained The Veil ever since. Once in a blue moon, when the Veilguard aren't watching, it flickers. A wisp of divinity slips through.

And touches one single soul. All before it is forced to return.

Except the Antiluvians could not find any records of a god who granted their chosen ones with eyes as black as mine. Your god could be forbidden. Scrubbed from the records. They urged me to go home. To lead quiet life. That it's okay not to be able to learn the magic aligned to me.

But I can hear it in their voices. They didn't like this one bit. I was a strange, unknown to them. So, I stood my ground and refused to leave.

""...bring him to The Veil,"" an Antiluvian sighed. ""We'll see if his god wants to get in touch once more with the soul they have touched.""

So, there I stood before The Veil. Behind me, a powerful security force ready to fight whatever that may come.

**Hello human.** A flowing wisp of energy warped to form a smug visage.

""Who's that?"" A mage guard shouted.

**I am not talking to you.**

""What is my magic?"" I had to know. I had travelled all this way to learn what I was capable of. To know that I wouldn't have to spend my life not practicing magic while the rest of my family could.

*The power of the Void.* The voice suddenly dropped to a faint whisper. *Let me into you, and I will teach you everything that you need to know. And these other humans. They won't know. Because I will render their memories of today's events...null and void. Just say the word.""*

""Come in, my god.""

(Tw: self-harm is a part of this story)

———————————————————————————

Darkness is evil. Thats what every human has agreed upon ever since man invented fire. Blackness is dangerous. Light is salvation. Those who aren’t afraid of the dark are the ones you must fear. Those who aren’t afraid of the darkness are made of darkness. 

“Iris, put your contacts in. Now!”

I do as she says. I twist the caps off the lens case, and I pluck out the little piece of concave plastic and slip it into my right eye. I look up at the mirror, and I see the rift. An invisible divide between me and the girl I play. It’s not me. *She’s not me.* I live on this divide, in this rift. And I look at the woman in the mirror, with beautiful, shimmering eyes. Red and orange that almost seems to bubble and shift when you look at them too long. Eyes so full of passion, and love. But I know that love in her eyes isn’t for me. It’s for the girl I’m pretending to be. It’s for the girl with muted silver eyes—the girl with no magic. 

“Hurry up, you have school.” I slip the other contact in as she walks up behind me. She lays her hands on my shoulders and turns me away from the mirror. “How are you feeling?”

“Fine, Mom.” I smile like I would if I were the girl she wanted me to be. She smiles back so genuinely that I feel this pressure in my chest threatening to burst out of me. We are *not* the same. I’m not the girl. I’m pretending. I’m *lying.* But my mother? She believes the act. She wrote the script, she sculpted the character, and yet she believes the play is reality.

We walk to the car, and I climb into the passenger seat. I pull the seatbelt over my shoulder and buckle it. That mechanical *click* echoes familiarly in my mind. That gnawing pain starts to grow, and I dig my nails into my thigh to quell it. The pain is just barely enough to hold back the ocean of thoughts threatening to drown me. 

In the ten minute drive to school we don’t say a word. The radio plays songs that I know, but the girl doesn’t know. So I sit stone faced, because if Mom knew her daughter—her *real* daughter—resonated with the dark side of music, she would panic. Because that’s what drives my mother. Fear of the unknown. Fear of the dark. I’m not afraid of the dark like she is. But we do have one thing in common. We’re both afraid of me.

The moment the car stops I swing open the car door. I say goodbye like the girl would. “I love you mom, I’ll see you after school. Have a great day at work” I wave as she pulls away from the curb and rejoins the flow of traffic. I turn toward that massive brick building and walk inside. School is a blur. Class happen, and I know I learn things from those classes. Whenever I’m sitting in the chair I know that I understand what the teacher is saying. I’m scribbling down the words on the board and highlighting important parts of the book. I’m answering questions correctly and scoring high on the tests. But none of it is puncturing me. None of it embeds itself into the grooves of my brain. It all slides off like all this information is water and my brain is wax paper. And I can’t say I don’t know why, but I can say that it’s hard to let those little water droplets of wisdom soak into you when you’re distracted trying to hold back the ocean. 

I’m at the breaking point by third period. And I walk to the bathroom, holding it all in. The thing about magic is that you’re not supposed to hold it in. It’s like shoving more fuel into a gas tank that’s already full. It will overflow. And overflow is disastrous. If my mother didn’t use her magic to cook every day or start bonfires every weekend, at some point she would break, and an inferno would consume our entire house. I can’t use my magic. It’s a rule. The girl doesn’t have magic, after all, and I’m always playing as her.

But I sit in the stall furthest from the door and pull the latch shut. I unzip the middle pouch of my backpack and pull out a CD holder. I don’t own any CDs. I pull out the lighter and pocket knife. Mother doesn’t know I have either of these. I flip the pocket knife open and flick the lighter to life, and the fire beats up the blade. The ocean is deep. It’s heavy and I can’t hold it.

But I can escape it. I prop my foot up on the toilet seat and roll down my sock. I choose a spot, and for a moment I’m holding the back of my knife just above the surface of my skin, and I hear this voice. *Do it.*

And I do. It hurts. It *hurts.* I hate the pain so much. I don’t like it. It’s searing and constant and it feels like… something. It feels like something has changed. Like a window was opened and fresh air is in my lungs. The metal is still hot, but it’s not hot enough anymore to do damage. I pull the knife away and in its place is a white strip of skin. *Good. It’ll blister.*

I pack everything up, numb to the stinging and numb to everything. And then as I walk out of that bathroom stall, I look up, and I see the girl in the mirror again. The act. The lies. The fake caricature of a person. And just like that, the ocean is back again. The pain starts to bubble up in my throat and my eyes feel wet. I can hear a sob emanate from within me, and just like that I’m keeled over the sink, choking on feelings I don’t want to feel. *Stop it. Stop fucking crying.* **Stop fucking crying!** 

The electric whirring of the lights cuts away, and I feel a jolt in my chest. The mechanical humming of the fans begins to sink into silence. And then it’s dark. This isn’t my school. My school is never this silent, this still. It’s all wrong. It’s not my world. This is another world. The light is gone. *Oh no…* My eyes—not the girl’s eyes—adjust and I can see through the blackness in a way I know nobody else can. 

I can hear people from other rooms. Ever so faintly I can hear a voice; *“What’s happening?”* *”Why is it dark?”* I look out the bathroom window. It’s midday. It shouldn’t be this dark in here during midday with a window. But it is. The light is gone. And deep down I know I must be the cause of this. It finally happened. The overflow.",10
1lwcbef,n2gxgh0,"It wasn't enough.

I was the only magic user in my class growing up... not counting our teacher Ms. Bell. My powers haven't awakened yet either. Usually the powers awaken on the user's first birthday at the very earliest. Ms. Bell tried to calm her class down with her energy powers, her eyes like pulsating stars.

I come home from school wanting to die from all the comments about not getting my powers yet, or the fact my eyes look like soulless black holes. ""The latest anyone has gotten their abilities was age 18."" My dad had said. ""You still have 8 years at the most."" I try to keep that hopeful line down, but it's tough when they all make fun of me

It wasn't enough... that I was the only student in the room with supposed powers. The others weren't born magic users but still felt the need to make fun of me. Every time I was made fun of... I felt something. Hard to explain, but, 'something' was inside my body, pulsating with every rude remark thrown at me. Ms. Bell was the only one trying to defend me, as well as my parents. But... it wasn't enough.

My 18th birthday hits today. all my 'friends' are here, just to see if I break the record for latest ever getting their magic, by not getting it today. The laughs, the mocking, as I blow out my candles and nothing happens. Of course nothing happens, I never should've gotten my hopes up. All the enduring of the bullies hoping I get my powers, unfortunately...

My eyes burst with a purple glow. My body rises, and slowly everything around me corrupts. All my naysayers, bullies, and doubters, are caught in the corrupted energy and slowly start collapsing in on themselves as if in a black hole. Everyone who supported me was left unharmed.

The chaos stops as if nothing happened. The haters completely intact, save for a disturbed and confused expression on their faces. Everyone saw what happened, yet, physically, the environment and people around me were is if nothing occurred.

I learned to control my dark matter energy since then, and it's as natural as a fire or ice user. No one ever crosses me again, and I feel oddly disturbed by my powers' awakening that day. But now...

I'm always enough.",6

———————————————————————————

I run to the bathroom door and yank it open. My skin feels like it’s alive, like it’s doing something that I don’t want it to do. I have no control. I can’t stop this. How do I stop this? *You need to stop this!*

*I don’t know how!* I scream at myself. I fall back to the bathroom. I know at any moment everyone will leave their classrooms and try and figure out what did this. The mirror’s there. The girl is there again, but it’s not the girl I’m angry at. It’s me. I can see me behind the eyes. I can see those disgusting, black voids pretending to be eyes. I can feel the burns under my sock. And the more I think about every piece of myself the angrier I get. 

I hate everything. I hate my mom. I hate school. I hate these *stupid* eyes. I hate me. *I hate me.* My blood is boiling. Something needs to happen. Something needs to change. I can’t keep feeling it. It’ll kill me this time I swear it will. It will end me. My finger wrap themselves into a fist, and I feel like an animal as I throw punch after punch into my arm. Swing after swing. The pain explodes and subsides, only to explode again. Like waves crashing on a shore.

Everything hurts. It hurts so much. So badly. I’m leaning against the wall, sitting on the floor. The brick wall and tile floor are so cold. But it drags me back to reality. My arm is throbbing. But as I’m sitting there I realize that the humming is back. The lights are whirring again, the fans are on. I look outside, and a brilliant shaft of light illuminates all the dust swirling around in the air.

*Go back to class.* I give myself the order. I stand up to obey it, and I crane my head away from the mirrors as I walk past them. I can’t stand the sight of her. This deep sense of dread won’t leave me. I know it now, that the overflow truly is inevitable.

I walk back into the classroom and Mrs. Heyes glances over at me inquisitively. “Sorry, I was in the bathroom.” I say as I walk in and sit down at my desk. *Get through school. Thats all you need to do.*

I can already see the look on Mom’s face as I walk up to the car. As I slide into the seat, everything is deceptively normal. I shut the car door, and wordlessly she shifts the car into drive and pulls out. We drive down the street, and she takes in a breath. “What did you do?”

“Mom I swear I didn’t me-“

“You cannot use your magic, Iris! We don’t know what your powers are. You could have killed someone! How could you be so irresponsible?”

“I couldn’t stop it! This isn’t fucking working! You can’t slap some contacts over my eyes and say that I’m not just like every other magic user!“

“Well you managed fine until now so I don’t see how you could possible think that.”

“Only because…” The words almost came out. *Almost.* But I fall silent because I know that she won’t understand. She can’t understand because she’s never once known me. I’m not her daughter, the girl is. That script is the daughter she wanted. I’m just the actress. 

The minutes crawl by in silence. The moment we pull into the driveway I make a choice I’ve wanted to make for so long. *I quit.*

I walk out of the car and storm into the house. I stand at the kitchen table and pinch my eyes, feeling the contacts trapped between each pair of finger and thumb. I yank them out and throw them on the floor.

“Iris! What are you doing?” I hear Mom behind me as she slams the door. “Put those back in!”

“No!” I smash my fist into the table, and the pain shoots through knuckles. “That’s not me!” I scream. “I’m me! I’m fucking me!” Tears well up so fast that they’re dripping off my face before I’m even aware of the fact that I’m crying. “I hate you!” I screamed it so loudly that I thought my throat would shred. “You’re a control freak! You’re a bitch, and **I hate you!”** I point at her, and I see something black—pitch black—burst forth.

Something shatters, and a web of void is stuck to my finger like an appendage. It broke through the window behind my mom. Her eyes are wide, and she’s staring at the black spine that seems to consume all the light. Slowly her gaze shifts toward me. “What are you?”

My hand falls, and the spine shatters into dust dissolves into the air as though it was never there. My knees are weak, and I brace my arm against table and sink to the floor. I breathe in to talk and the air wheezes in my throat. “I’m me! I just wanna be me.” My voice cracks as I say it. “Why couldn’t you love me?”

She starts to cry, and her voice shakes as she says, “I do love you.”

“No, I mean *all* of me!” 

She falls silent. And I know in that moment that I’ve lost my mother. No. I didn’t lose her. I never had her. I stand up, and I walk away from her. I feel this sick sense of relief now. *This had to happen.* 

And now I’m scared. I’m scared because I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I don’t know what I’m capable of. For 15 years I’ve hidden from myself and now I‘ve lost myself in the darkness from which I was forbidden to explore. *No, it’s okay. For once it’s actually okay.* 

I’m not my mother. I’m not afraid of the dark.",13
1lwcbef,n2etuc6,"Ya, this could easily go to either extreme. He goes out and runs into a situation he is able to help with being seen as good despite the creepy powers, or it goes wrong cause he doesn't have practice and hurts people instead of helping.

1lwdbg4,n2ee3rf,"\[Moonlight Shadow\]

""I'm still alive...,"" Borin had lost the war, but he'd survived along with his companions. The Dark Lord seemed to lose interest in the heroic party as soon as he'd achieved his goal, and that would be his fatal mistake. They were too weak at the moment, and the Dark Lord too strong. But, they would try again. Even if it took another war, they wouldn't rest until they were dead or the world was free.

""I have succeeded!"" The Dark Lord's ghostly image appeared in the sky. Borin and his friends were attempting to stop him before nightfall, and they failed early enough that the sun hadn't set yet. He towered over the land, seemingly looking down on everyone he'd conquered. However, despite his menacing posture, the ethereal representation looked startled suddenly. He whirled around to address an unseen individual. ""What?"" he asked no one, then he disappeared from the sky. Borin felt hope, and he was sure the others felt it too.

""Do you think someone stopped him?"" Reilla, their healer, asked. She'd finally gotten around to curing Borin's wounds; he insisted she help the rest of the team first. Borin looked around, and noticed the rest were sleeping. Even, Luceo the thief, was completely unconscious. The wiry gnome was usually the first one to find his way out of trouble. However, he stuck with them the whole time, and arguably he was the reason they were still alive. It was the same reason that the Dark Lord had achieved his goal; but a hard choice had to be made and Luceo made it. It wasn't over until they were dead, and the cowardly thief managed to steal another chance for them. Borin shook his head.

""If we couldn't stop him, it'll take more than someone just catching him by surprise,"" he said. He hated to be honest, but she needed to hear it. Reilla was the newest, and most naive member of their group. Luceon made the decision to let the Dark Lord win, but he wouldn't have had to make that decision if Reilla wasn't so trusting. She needed to learn the hard truths of reality, and Borin would have to guide her. But, her healing skills were unmatched. He would be sure to harden her heart by the time they were ready to try again.

""I have succeeded!"" the Dark Lord appeared again. The sky was darker now, and his figure glowed brighter in a brilliant blue color. ""I have conquered the Earth and it's time to lay down some ground rules. Rule #1: I step down as ruler of the world and everything shall go back as before,"" he said. His voice sounded natural, and almost youthful; it was quite different from the deep, gravelly voice he'd used to insult them during battle. Something strange was happening, but he couldn't decide what it was. ""I just wanted to see if I could achieve this, and I did it,"" he chuckled. He literally laughed like a teenager as Borin and Reilla stared up at the sky. ""So, good luck and stuff. Bye!"" he gave the world an energetic wave and disappeared. Both of the conscious party members waited in patient silence for several minutes.

""Do you think...,"" Reilla was too afraid to put it into words, but Borin knew exactly what she was going to ask. He was wondering the same question as was likely everyone else on Earth.

""I don't think he would lie?"" Borin chuckled as he phrased the thought. The Dark Lord was evil and absolutely would lie if it gained him something. But, Borin could not begin to guess what lying about giving up would gain him. It could've been a ploy, but that didn't seem like the Dark Lord's style. He'd already won and had nothing left to gain. ""I guess we'll see...,"" he shrugged. There was nothing else to do about it but wait. Either the Dark Lord appeared again, or he wouldn't. No matter how it played out, Borin and his team would remain ready.

Elsewhere, a conversation between the Dark Lord and his unexpected guest takes place.

""What are you waiting for?"" Oren, the Dark Lord's best friend, asked. The two teens were standing in the Dark Lord's throne room.

""Hold on, I just told them I was stepping down. But, they don't know whether to believe me or not. Let them enjoy a few moments of doubt first,"" Aurelio shrugged. Oren rolled his eyes and sighed.

""That's what I'm asking. Why are you even bothering to tell them? They can't tell the difference. Just reset the server and let's go.""

""That's boring,"" Aurelio shook his head. ""I'm not much of a Dark Lord if I don't mess with them a little bit. Gotta shake up the ant colony now and then, you know?""

""But what's the point if you're going to reset them just to do it again?""

""That's kind of the point,"" Aurelio nodded. ""The Dark Lord suddenly says he's done. And, right when you start to wonder if maybe he really is gone, bam,"" he chuckled. ""The world and everyone you know just starts disintegrating all around you. Is it because of the Dark Lord? Probably, but they'll never be sure because there's nothing after that.""

""Easy, lad!""

The gritty shock of a blade nipping at my mail, his wrist so small and delicate in my fist - Ragvar comfort me, I would to snap it like a twig! - I meet the urchin's eyes and his expression hardens from blank resignation to rage at getting caught.  He tries to pull away, I wrench carefully, with a cry his knife splashes on the muddy street joining the piece of bread I had proffered.

""Why would you stab someone who seeks to help you?""  I know, but I ask anyway.

""Academy bitch,"" he spits.

We stare, he throws a haymaker with his free hand.  I catch that one too.  He's good and stuck now, I squat down so he can glare at me eye-to-eye.  I don't know what to say.

I did not dedicate my life to this, did not seek out the Resistance, accept the training of the Academy All-Present, flee a quarter of the way around the globe, return with forbidden knowledge - not for this.  I should be raining fireballs on the head of the Evil Overlord, as is tradition.  Prophecy.  

An Evil Overlord rises, good people remember that there are things worse than war, there is a struggle, evil defeated, freedom returns for a time until complacency takes root again.  One day the cycle will be broken and goodness continue forever.

*Kh-wmmmm, kh-wmmmm,* the witchfire engines drone on, driving the mills unceasing.  The boy sulks, which is easier than when one of them starts to cry.  I'm in no rush.  This kind of thing can't be rushed.

The simple answer for why they act like animals is that nobody has told them ""no.""  ""No, don't be a cutpurse, in the end you will not keep yourself from cutting throats.""  The simple answer is wrong.  They haven't been told ""no"" from anyone who could say ""yes"" and give the goodness in them the prosperity that goodness deserves.

Three years ago the Overlord promised things would go back to the way they were before his rise to power.  That he had proven to himself that he could achieve ""excellence,"" that once our world had tasted excellence things could only improve.

But the witchlight industry?  The mines and factories where he had enslaved three persons out of every ten?  We had freedom, but this time in the cycle we still had witchlight.  The worst thing is that for most people the freedom *is* better than anything before.  For some it is the most fortunate their family can remember.  There are rumors that the cycle has been broken, slowly turning into consensus.    
  
But for others, it may have been better to be the Overlords slaves.  And so we will fight on, somehow, without the prophecies.

This one doesn't have the Gift.  I ache to believe that he does, that I could offer him a place.

""The foreman... turned you out, did he not?""  I hazard.

1lwkfm2,n2ew5gq,"We called her the Varangian. Her kind were known for their brutality. They had, from time immemorial, practiced war. Their conquests in distant lands had become legend. However, it was their ferocity amongst themselves that had earned them their reputations. The Varangians could and would fight anyone, especially for the right price. Our Varangian was strong. She had killed three of her own kind for the coin we offered, and she never questioned our requests. Unstoppable and immutable, she guarded our city. Plunderers, conquerors, and fool-hardy adventurers fell before her in droves. Never did our people fear while she stood the watch. And stand she would, as long as the coin flowed.",9
1lwko6m,n2h5y2t,"We had made it no less than ten people from the front of the line when my wristwatch started to beep. After waiting an hour in the summer Florida heat for the new Superhero ride at Disneyworld, I was being summoned to action. Our youngest, June, had turned seven on Tuesday and my wife and I had taken a rare early weekend on Friday to drive up to Orlando for celebrations. We had taken her to Disneyworld two years ago for her fifth birthday and despite the trip being cut short, it was one of the brightest moments we've had in years. Due to my schedule the previous year, I wasn't able to celebrate her sixth birthday, but this year I had planned to change things around. After all, the years were short and precious. Diana and I only had so much time before the dreaded teenage years that precipitated leaving the proverbial nest. Our eldest, Vera, had left home for UC Berkeley three years earlier and never came home—and not because she had jobs or summer internships. Rather I suspected she was bumming around San Francisco with a bohemian troupe and misspending her youth. But how many daughters in the same situation would’ve done the same? At the end of her freshman year, she called and said she found her people, and would come back when she could—which so far was never.


June squinted up at me, her smile and eyes radiant in the sunlight. ""Daddy, do you have to go?"" she asked timidly. I thought for a moment and pressed a button on the side of my watch to silence the beeping. This wouldn't be taken from us; this wouldn't be taken from me. ""Not yet honey, I can stay for this ride."" I replied. Diana leaned into me and squeezed my hand. ""Are you sure?"" she asked with surprise. I turned my smile to her and squeezed back, ""yes, I am sure.""


Fifteen minutes later I was ascending into the stratosphere. Diana and June were going to enjoy the rest of the day at the park while I responded to the emergency page from London. I was no longer Caleb Stephens; I was now donning my superhero persona, The Paragon. I had been a superhero for nearly thirty years. I started when I was 18, and now I was now approaching 50. Diana was a superhero too, known as the Bluejay, but she had retired when we were pregnant with June. I wanted to retire as well, but it turns out the only well paying government job is in the League of Heroes and being a superhero was the only thing I knew. 


However, I had nearly retired a few years back. After Diana hung up her cape, it was difficult to continue superheroing without my partner. When you've been fighting supervillains and handling natural disasters for over 20 years with the same person, losing your partner is like losing a limb. The first sidekick I had after Diana was a twenty year old kid from Brooklyn who called himself Wolfman. He had the mind and spirit, but he was a lesser powered superhero and just didn't have the strength or powers for the level of villains I was fighting. After watching him nearly die the second time, I transferred Wolfman to an easier assignment. My next sidekick was a hard headed and talented young man known as Captain Owl. He was in his mid 20s with dark hair, thick brows, and angry eyes. What he possessed in power and ability that my first sidekick had lacked, he lacked in integrity and morality. 


When the supervillain Dr Enigma had kidnapped the President of the United States and his secret service staff to his hidden island, Captain Owl and I staged a rescue operation. We had rescued the President and secured his safety, but Dr Enigma was about to escape. Before Dr Enigma launched his getaway rocket, he had chained the secret service staff to cages and dropped them into an active volcano. With only seconds to act, I told Captain Owl to leave Dr Enigma and focus on saving the secret service agents, but he instead went after Dr Enigma. I saved the agents that I could, but there simply wasn't enough time for one superhero to save them, let alone one man. As a result, three agents died that day. Captain Owl caught up to Dr Enigma and pummeled him and his face into submission, but instead of bringing him to justice, he let his rage get the better of him and ripped out Dr Enigma's heart. It was an ugly, ugly situation. I can still remember the words that were exchanged that day. I told him that he didn't respect life and that I was removing him from the league. He told me that he hated me and I was a foolish old man who no longer saw the world as it was. He may have been right about that last part because every day those words seem more and more true. Regardless, the decision to get rid of him was an easy one, but nasty to execute. A super powered paparazzi had made it to the island unbeknownst to us and videotaped the ensuing fight. For the next few weeks, the internet and news channels played nonstop clips of two of the worlds most recognized superheroes punching the snot out of another above a volcano. It wasn't a pretty video. The media always blames you for the damages that follow and those you can't save, and the cultural zeitgeist of the last 20 years doesn't want to hold villains accountable. Journalists and internet streamers spewed non stop about Captain Owl brutally murdering Dr Enigma, but how much airtime did they give to the fallen secret service agents? If it wasn't for our mortgage and the loving support of Diana, I probably would've quit for good. I still struggle with the feeling that deep down, there was a pragmatism to Captain Owl's actions. Dr Enigma was a supervillain who had killed hundreds and had escaped from prison once. The truth is, Dr Enigma should've been properly brought to justice and Captain Owl did a terrible thing, but the world is better off with Dr Enigma gone.

1lw34x4,n2b6xsg,"I look at the drone hovering at my door, 2 pizzas hanging from it.  
They are still warm.  
I take them, and the drone starts leaving.  
I watch, shocked as it flies away, the pizzas heavy in my hand.  
How?  
Decades of travelling, of shouting, of putting ads, announcements, doing podcasts, learning how to handle the TV set and making news announcements...  
Radio silence.  
I was sure I was the last living person on Earth...so what is this?

  
I go inside, and eat the pizza.  
Shocked or not, pizza not frozen and then heated is delicious.  
Then, I start thinking.  
I don't know how the End happened.  
All I know is that I grew up as a kid, all alone, and have been alone ever since, well into my 30s.  
Won't say there isn't a possibility there were others, because obviously, I was born, but...  
In 30 years to not find anyone, anything...is weird.  
I also learnt how to fly a plane, so I visited other continents, so this should be a Truman show situation.  
So, let's find out.

  
I order pizza again, in 10 minutes the drone is here.  
This time though...I try to follow it.  
It flies a few streets away...then it went straight up, where I watched as a spaceship appeared out of nowhere, and  the drone went inside of it.  
What the hell?  
I started shouting at the spaceship, wondering if it is fully automated or not.  
Radio silence.  
I went on my phone, and ordered multiple things from the app.  
Food, clothes, medicine...drones after drones left from that ship, bringing me the stuff.  
I started laughing maniacally.

  
""Human! Bring me another human!"" I laughed crazily, writing it into the app.  
A selection appeared...  
I froze.  
Selecting the random female choice...I waited.  
10 minutes later, a drone, larger than before, brought down a woman, my age, red-haired with a suitcase, and dressed in a golden dress.  
""Husband."" she smiled, kissed me on the cheek and went inside, humming.  
I was shocked.  
What was going on?  
Is this some sort of game?  
Are there more humans up there? Where do I have so much money in my account?  
What...what is happening?  
""Honey...what do you want for dinner?"" the woman's voice awakens me from my reverie.  
I sigh, and go inside.  
Whatever this is, I will find it out, sooner or later, but now, I really want to talk to another human being.",204
1lw34x4,n2cqztp,"How long had it been since he had seen another living soul? Animals were nowhere to be found. Power was gone, and the world seemed still, silent. The sun rose but offered little warmth... not cold, but a strange emptiness. It felt like a dream that had no end. He had panicked, bargained, even lost his mind for a time, yet this strange reality had continued on, endless. He searched. He found nothing. Everyone was gone. What was this?

He wandered, surviving off whatever he could find, but eventually, the solitude began to wear at him. He longed to feel something familiar, something tangible. After the panic, rage, and sadness had passed, he was left with a hollow curiosity tinged with boredom.

When he finally made it home, he wandered through the empty rooms, his fingers brushing over old photographs. They made his chest ache, but he smiled softly at the memories. He sank onto the couch, only to feel something dig into him—a small object wedged between the cushions. His old phone. It was still working?

""Samsung doesn’t mess around with battery life,"" he muttered, unlocking it with his facial recognition.

It was just as he’d left it. No signal, many apps useless. He scrolled through his contacts, a small smile tugging at his lips as old names flashed by.

""I should’ve spoken to them more... reached out,"" he murmured.

He paused at a particular name. Her number. He stared at it for a long moment, his throat tightening.

""I wish I’d told her...""

Then a notification buzzed on the screen. ""Special offer at Yama Pizza—100% off for new customers.""

""Wait... how did that even get through?""

He clicked the link, curious. A menu opened, and he found a meat feast pizza that looked absolutely sublime.

He laughed softly. “Man, I would love a pizza right now.”",28
1lw34x4,n2cubvu,"I sat dazed with the sound of the bell ringing fading away in my mind. This must have been an illusion. The world finally got me. Still a faint doubt lingers. Shalll I go to the door?

With nothing to lose, or to be honest, nothing left to do anyway. I walk to the door and open it. To my surprise a big pizza box is laying on the ground. A heavenly smell emerges from the carton. I grap the box and walk back in my apartment. The box is warm!

Slowly I open it, unconciously starting to salivate. I tear into the pizza and devour it within minutes. Satiated I lay on my couch. What has caused this, what more can I order. A small glimmer of hope forms in my heart. Laying down and watching at the stars one sentence echoes through my mind. I am not alone! With this comforting thought I fall asleep.

“There you are!” she snapped. “About damn time! Where have you been hiding?”

“Uh... Sorry, I must’ve missed you. How much do I owe you... wait... who are you?”

She handed him the pizza with a scowl.

“Do you have any idea how much paperwork you’ve caused me? When the rapture happens, you’re supposed to go towards the light. But nooo... not you. You go off radar and leave us scrambling. The boss upstairs is *not* impressed.”

“The boss... upstairs?”

“It’s been that long?”

She glared at him.

“Are you Death?”

“Do I look like Death?” She threw her hands up in frustration. “No. Death has bigger fish to fry right now. I’m Becky.”

“Oh... I’m Peter.”

“I KNOW WHO YOU ARE!”

Peter blinked. “Oh. Right... So... what happens now?”

“Eat your pizza. Then we’ll head off.”

“Meat feast?”

""I just pressed send invitation to the client code: M-0239901mkd92kj 5498, and the icon appeared."" I say.  
He face-palms, sighing.  
""You do realize our client codes have no letters in them, right?  
Didn't you notice this?"" he asks.  
I nod.



""Yeah, but I thought it's just a special client."" I say.  
He sighs.  
""So, it is a phishing incident? How did you get the client information?"" he asks.  
""As usually, through email from logistics."" I say.  
He nods, and cleans, repairs my computer, and after I enter my acc. information, he checks my emails.  
He sighs.  
""Not your fault, the email is valid, but the information within is full of tricks, and viruses, and spy-spells.  
Ugh...this means overtime."" he says, disappearing.  
I sigh.  
I wonder if I call him again, to ask now what I should do...will he kill me?",116
1lw4it0,n2dpyff,"The air smelled faintly of burnt toast. This could have been an early sign of a stroke, or just an inattentive intern letting his breakfast burn while he was on Tik Tok or whatever brain-rot app the youth used these days. Of course, there was a third option, but I only remembered it as it began to happen to me. Blue energy crackled, either spawning from or leaving behind hazy blue-grey clouds every time it streaked through reality. 

I sighed as I set my coffee down on the desk, and waited. I had taken the teleportation safety class in  community college, as had all the other semi-magical citizens that had flunked out of Wizard universities. Step one was to release anything you were holding. I glanced longingly at the steaming coffee and mentally checked off the first step. It would inevitably be cold by the time I got back here to drink it. I hated reheating coffee, it never quite tasted the same, probably from some chemical reaction to heating the artificial sweetener and oily, flavored creamers. 

The blue energy pulsed around me, leaving thicker and thicker clouds of blue-grey smoke enveloping me. I took a deep breath of fresh air untainted by the magical byproduct that was rapidly encroaching on my personal area, completing step 2. The next and final step was the least pleasant of the bunch, but it was also the most important. 

Step 3: Stay absolutely still. 

I held my breath and, like I had when I played a tree in my elementary school theater, stayed absolutely still. Unlike my younger tree-costumed self wished I could do, I vanished. Blue energy crackled all around me for somewhere between a single second and a thousand years, depending on how you kept track of time while being pulled through the astral plane like a sewing needle pulled thread through fabric. It all ended abruptly as reality returned and hit me in the face. 

More specifically, I landed face-first onto the polished concrete floors of... somewhere. I didn't recognize my immediate surroundings, or I would have booked it to the nearest washroom. The blood pouring freely from my broken nose was definitely going to stain my dress shirt if I didn't act quickly.

""Steven Morrison?"" A voice asked sharply. My name echoed softly for a moment, fading away into the background noises to join the low hums of the air conditioning and ethereal squelching of magic. 

I pinched my nose shut in a failing effort to stop the bleeding. ""Yesh?"" I said, struggling to speak and breath at the same time. I held my head back, trying in vain to stop the bleeding and look at the mysterious speaker.

""You have been summoned to the IT department"" the voice said, softly but magically still echoing throughout what was apparently the Internal Techno-magic department. ""For improper use of a magically attuned device."" 

I finally laid my eyes on my accuser. He was a tall, lanky fellow, with a beard that reached well below his color-shifting tie. The director of the IT department himself. The lanky wizard only answered to the CEO, and frequently disobeyed even those commands. If I was in trouble with him, there was nobody above him to appeal any conflict to. This magician may as well have been death himself, beckoning for me to join him on his tiny boat. 

""I, umbh, I didnbt use magi-tech"" I said through my pinched nose and blood-filled mouth. ""Do youb have a baffroom? I neeb to-""

""SILENCE!"" the Wizard bellowed, the word echoing without losing any volume in a magical show of dominance. ""The tome of food preparation was left open and unattended in the canteen, and you are the only registered employee working on that floor today!"" 

I blinked tears out of my eyes as I gathered my thoughts. ""But, um, sir-""

""GRAND WIZARD!"" The head of the IT department screamed. ""You will address me by my title, or I will have your tongue as potion ingredients!""

I winced at the unfortunate title the magic man had chosen for himself. I really, really hoped that he just didn't get out much, and wasn't aware of the connotation to the domestic terrorist leader with the same title. ""No, bhe intern is there tbo. I fhink his name is Kyle?"" 

The wizard narrowed his eyes as he stared into my very soul. ""Is that so?"" He snarled. ""This 'Kyle' is the one responsible for that burnt toast smell?"" 

I nodded and immediately regretted it as pain shot through my face again. ""Mmhm. Thabt or you're habing a stroke, yeah"". 

The Wizard raised his arms towards the ceiling and began to speak in strange words, each syllable striking my eardrums like sandpaper and pepper spray combined into the world's worst hot sauce. I released my broken nose and clasped both hands over my ears in a feeble attempt to block out the unearthly sounds of the spell. 

A blue-grey cloud began to form beside me, crackling with the ethereal blue lightning that danced between the clouds like a supernatural game of the board game 'Twister'. The clouds thickened, the lightning grew louder and more frequent, rolling and boiling and summoning the intern whose name might not actually have been Kyle. His face emerged from the cloud, coughing and waving his hand to fan the smoke from his mouth. 

I froze. He wasn't staying still! Had he not gone through the employee training yet? Didn't he know the dangers-

The wizard screamed. The magical echo gave out mid-scream, turning his demonic yell into a thin man's pained whines. The smoke and electricity died out only a moment faster than Kyle's half-summoned torso did as it splattered against the polished floor, adding a tremendous amount of blood to my considerably smaller nosebleed puddle. I could only assume that the rest of Kyle was still in the break room, waiting patiently for The tome of food preparation to finish his lunch. 

The wizard collapsed, clutching one thin, pale hand to his chest. His labored breathing grew fainter with each repetition as he glared at the top half of Kyle the intern. ""Why did he move?"" He croaked out weakly. ""He drained... my... mana..""

I hurried to the wizard's side, although I didn't know if I could have helped even with a med-kit or defibrillator. My CPR certification had lapsed a few years back and I had never gotten around to refreshing it. ""Are you alright?"" I asked lamely. 

The wizard struggled to breath. ""No... magic..."" he whispered, before collapsing to the floor as well. He splashed in the ever-growing puddle of Kyle's blood, not even trying to keep his airways clear of the flowing liquid. 

I stood and looked all around for a phone, or an exit sign, or anything I could use to contact the outside world for help. I only found solid stone walls and glowing balls of light that the magician used in lieu of light bulbs. I couldn't even find a bathroom. Did the wizard just teleport in and out of wherever this was? Could I even get out? I had to think. I had to stay calm. I had to-

The magical orbs of light began to flicker. Without their master keeping them on, they dimmed and sputtered, one by one, shutting off and leaving me in complete darkness. I couldn't hear anything anymore. I couldn't see a damned thing. The only thing I could feel was the rapidly cooling blood from all three of us, much like my abandoned coffee back at my desk.

1lwbzbj,n2cy6vo,"I watch as four women exit the shadows.  
I frown.  
For they are all gorgeous, with their unique aura, and yet all possessing this regal air about them.  
When they get closer, I gasp.  
I recognize one of them.  
""Desert's Sun?"" I mutter.  
The far-right woman, dressed in a golden silk dress nods.  
""It is indeed, I. Desert's Sun."" she says, in a warm voice.  
I freeze.

  
""I know what you are thinking.  
""But she's the number 1 Heroine from Middle-East!"", right?  
Well, she is, but what can I say?  
I have my charm."" the villain says.  
The women roll their eyes, but don't refute him.  
""Why? All of you are...heroes?"" I ask.  
""Were."" another woman says.  
""Before being backstabbed."" the next says.  
""Or worse."" the last one says.  
""So when Mr. Shadows came to us, we accepted his proposal."" Desert's Sun says.  
I sigh.

  
Raising my hands, I take a step back.  
""I know when I am outnumbered, and outmatched in any possible way."" I start, seeing that the Hall we are in is littered with small mounds of sand, coming from Desert's Sun.  
Another woman I am sure is trying to control my mind, another is almost ablaze at this point, and the last one's body seemingly booms with power.  
Nope.  
I ain't messing with them.  
The villain starts laughing.  
""See? I was right! Queens are better than pawns!"" he says...as he brings out ingots of gold, giving one to each woman, before staring at me.

  
""What? They are queens, so I have to treat them like that!"" he says, starting to massage their shoulders, as from somewhere, chairs appeared for the women.  
I stop retreating, and watch this...show.  
By the end, the women are eating expensive food, and the villain is panting.  
""Are you ok?"" I ask.  
He frowns, raised a finger, and panting a bit more.  
""Worth. It."" he says, before shadows engulf him.  
I sigh, and leave.  
Whatever he is planning, is another hero's problem.  
I knew he was weird, but this is a bit too much for me, especially the way the woman who tried to control my mind, grinned at me.  
Nope. I ain't messing with them.",30
1lw8p8o,n2ceu7a,"Hecate's domain was a strange place, filled with all sorts of lost things: keys, glasses, remotes, that letter from Aunt Mary last month that you'd always meant to reply to but couldn't seem to find, AirPods. 

In recent years, it appeared that belongings had become much more disposable. Her domain had begun filling at an almost implacable rate. It was a good thing, then, that it was an infinitely large one - there would always be space for more. 

Now, she settled back on her throne, ready to receive supplicants. It was an unconventional one, built out of baby blankets, quilts, and scarves. What could she say? She liked her creature comforts, she would never understand why the humanity always fought over those sharp poky chairs that gave them back pain.

The first supplicant tentatively stepped through the portal, crossing over the threshold into Hecate's lands.

She gazed down at him. ""Yes?"" 

""Erm, Hecate, I was wondering if you've seen something of mine,"" the god hedged.

""I've been expecting you,"" she smiled. ""This, perhaps?"" She beckoned at Riven, one of her followers. He brought over the weapon in question and placed it before the god.

""Y-yes, that's it,"" the god Thor replied, his brow knit together in confusion. He looked at Riven, then back at Mjölnir, then back at Riven again. ""Who are you? And how did you lift that?"" he demanded. 

""He is one of mine,"" Hecate interjected. ""And the rest of you gods made a mistake when you assigned me this realm. For not all that is lost is worthless.""

1lw4vjw,n2bhnn5,"I look at my team, and sigh.  
Being the leader to a team of tortured, trauma ™ fueled kids, and teens that have superpowers due to governmental experiments isn't fun.  
I am also one of them, albeit a bit older, and we are waging war against the government that did this to us.  
But! Do you know why I am the leader?  
Because I am the weakest...and have the best common sense.  
My job mostly consists in targeting proper targets within the government, and ensuring my team doesn't go crazy on the world.

  
Bringing pizza to them, I watch Eliza pout.  
""What's wrong?"" I ask.  
""I want a new dress."" she says.  
I sigh.  
""Jeff just transformed a boulder into gold, and we are slowly selling it...we will have cash soon enough."" I say.  
""I could, you know, mind-control a company to work for us."" she says.  
I sigh. She could...she could mind-control an entire city...forever, irreversibly if she tried hard enough.  
""I will get you the dress."" I smile.  
""Thanks big brother!"" she says, jumping on me, and hugging me.  
Sigh...

  
""Big bro, when do we attack that lab?"" another one, Adam asks.  
""After Jessica, and James come back from recon.  
You will destroy the lab as soon as the kids are taken out to be transferred, while the rest of us save them."" I say, to the kid, 11 years old, that can create earthquakes...  
""Yeey! We will have new sisters and brothers!"" he says, running away.  
I smile. We started as a group of 12 escapees, rogue kids running from the government, but look at us now.  
51, and we keep growing in number.  
It's getting tiring.

  
An explosions stops me from my meditations.  
I go outside, to see Jack, and Leia fighting.  
Jack is levitating, orbs of energy floating around him, while Jessica grew to her max size, her head hitting the ceiling.  
""Enough!"" I say, my voice booming. They flinch.  
""S-sorry, big brother!"" they say, undoing their powers.  
""Why were you fighting?"" I ask.  
""She said hunting the scientists is more important than saving others."" Jack says.  
Leia blushes.  
""I will decide what we do, and when, to ensure we, and others like us, are safe. You two have to focus on learning how to control your powers, emotions, and most importantly: study!  I am not allowing us to become uneducated ruffians! On that note...I will check your homework."" I say, and they pale.  
""Everyone's homework!"" my voice booms through the hideout, and I can hear them all scurry away, muttering, and whining.   
I hope I can keep them under control for long enough for them to calm down, and understand that revenge is not the way to live our lives.  
But until then, I will keep saving others, and making sure everyone has a chance one day to start a normal...real life.",69
1lw56fh,n2blf6y,"Our world is one of powers, magic, and the unimaginable becoming real.  
Many have affinities to certain professions, being able to learn various abilities, skills, while others are outright born with powers.  
In such a world I was born, with an ability both mocked, and envied: Immortality.  
Sure, I would be able to live forever, and unless some special, God-grade or even above abilities don't come into play, nothing would be able to kill me.  
But...  
What good is that, when there are people who can become as big as mountains? Who can breath fire? Who can cast spells that turn trees into soldiers, and much more?  
So...I worked in a library, helping an old elven druid, and learning some skills every now and then.

It's been tens of thousands of years, and our civilization became intergalactic, and interdimensional.  
I still run the library, but not under the Emperor's great Blessing.  
I have awakened some magic, and gained a druid class after the geezer made sure to leave everything to me, even his ability.  
I am still considered useless, as I am recorded simply as: ""Normal Immortal"", meaning I am immortal, but that's the only ability I have.  
My class is seen as a supporting one as well, so while many visit the library that grew beyond imagination...I am still ""lesser"" than those with ""awesome"" abilities, powers or skills.  
I don't mind it.  
I like the peaceful life I have.

Nothing lasts forever...well, except me.  
The past hundreds of thousands of years, I continued gathering books, learning skills, researching abilities, and even picked up teaching.  
Sadly, the Empire is now on its last legs, our enemies countless is number, slowly approaching this planet...my home planet.  
The Emperor, the current one, a child I saw grow up, told me he arranged a ship to take me, along with some of the royal kids to an abandoned system.  
It's not rich in resources, but it will do.  
We will survive there, and at least our civilization won't die out completely.  
I smiled, and thanked him, but I had other ideas in mind.

When the enemy fleet arrived, I took to the skies, to the surprise of my neighbors, and some officers.  
They thought I was useless.  
When fireballs the size of palaces, and the heat of stars were thrown by me into space, controlled perfectly to not affect the planet, they gasped.  
When I crushed space, to ensure the fleet is unable to flee, they froze.  
When I summoned some Void Worms to eat up the radioactive materials of the fleet, they paled.  
And when I gently flew back down, back into my library, spotless after destroying a fleet that defeated the Empire, and reduced our territories from galaxies to one single system...  
They didn't know how to act.  
It was cute.  
My ability might be ""only"" immortality, but this gave me ample time to prepare, to learn, and to master skills.  
Maybe from now on...immortality won't be seen as a non-combatant ability.",45
1lw56fh,n2bkrmf,"It was only 500 years ago I made my greatest discovery; how to control the elements, wind, rocks, fire, water, you get the idea. 

I spent the last 500 years in hiding, fine-tuning my powers to a needle point of precision and strength. 

The date was 8487, July 6th. Today is the day that I finally announce my presence to the weak mortals, declaring myself their one and only ruler. 

I raise a hand to my mouth and every human on earth can hear me, ""people of the land!"" I speak in all languages at once, ""I am your God and ruler, bow to me or be a slave to your superiors."" Yes, maybe not the nicest thing, but i was King now, I could do whatever I want. 

A year goes by in peace. 
Then...



I'm sitting on my throne, learning how to control minds, when my door barges open and a man walks in. 
His hair is pure white and flows behind him even though there is no wind, he wears a black mask and a red cape, the color of blood. 

""What is your name?"" The man asks. 

""Sovark, but what is yours?"" 

""Names have power"" 

""So do i, be gone with you before I blow your hair off your scalp!"" 

The man draws his sword and steps forward, ""your magic does not scare me Sovark, nor your words."" 

I raise my hand. A warning. 

The man comes closer. 

""Stop right there! Or I shall be forced to obliterate you of the face of this planet!"" 

""I am not from this plantet, so please, go ahead."" He replies opening his arms. 

""Well get on with it already! why did you come here?""

""Ah. Finally you ask. I am here to congratulate you on the first step to becoming a divine being, you have conquered this world, the first small task we must complete."" 

The man steps forward. 
""You are to close, step away"" I say calmly. 

""No"" the man says flatly, and continues toward me. 

I raise my hand and send a flash of pure blue light at his chest, a warning, not meant to kill. 
But it barely goes a foot before it reverses course, and heads straight at me. I click my fingers and the light falls to the ground. 
""So you have some tricks i see?"" 
He advances forward, and with one movement draws his sword and touches my chest, my vision blurs, and I fall forward to the ground, unconscious. 

When I wake the man is gone, all he left is a note that says; ""next year, same time, I expect more from you Sovark. Train well. And maybe you can join the devine army.""",19
1lwd8kw,n2dhet0,"My actual name is unpronounceable without a neural translator, so you can call me Buffalo Wild Wings. Your planet was registered as a Solar3 class water world with significant land mass. Your planetary civilization was determined to be at the Folly stage, which is to say it was in that mercurial period where the governments of your nation-states were in constant and short sighted conflict for limited resources. For better or for worse, you were just in bigger tribes and equipped with bigger spears, spouting bigger words at one another.        
           
The People's Republic of China and the United States of America were by far the largest and most influential nation-states of your world, and first contact went exactly as expected. When their governments learned of our technological supremacy, they came to the same decision: 'In return for helping you subjugate humanity, raise our nation above all others. Keep us as leaders.' With all the privilege that implied.                         
            
As long as they retained some power, your government would pledge their fealty to us. That is the reality of your so-called human nobility. You are apes wearing multiple layers of clothing, always trying to have one more piece of fruit than your neighbor.         
           
Forgive me if I seem bitter. I enjoy your chicken wings to a great extent, if it comes as any comfort.       
              
We made empty promises and gave a set of directives to the two nation-states that would sow discord. We manipulated many more along multiple lines taking advantage of cultural and ethnic divisions. The common theme was that we would give them an advantage over their neighbors - which, for a very large portion of your people, was all that they really desired.          
             
To use your people's vernacular, allow me to be deadass with you humans. You are an inherently selfish people. This is understandable to an extent. Biologically, you and I evolved through similar origins. However, where we matured socially, you failed to overcome your primal tendencies. I am still studying your history, trying to determine the points that may have lead up to your stunted development, but it is tedious since there appear to be so many, even up to your so-called modernity. Leaded gasoline? Your so-called ""forever plastics"" infiltrating even your unborn fetuses? 'Drill baby drill' being the response to catastrophic climate change? Individuals wielding significant influence on a worldwide stage because they sing and act? Individuals dictating health and environmental policies because of their generational wealth?       
           
How based.            
           
Well, all of that is come to an end. We have activated several salt mines and put the less productive members of your population to work. Manual labor is inefficient, but used judiciously, can help instill an appropriate work ethic, as well as strengthen the individual on physical and mental levels. At the very least, it keeps you apes from arguing endlessly online about the dumbest things.",6
1lvhjec,n267i3p,"You ever look at a room full of kids and wonder if the universe is playing a long, elaborate joke on you?

Yeah. That’s me. Every Monday through Friday at 7:45 a.m.

They call it “Class F.” F for Foundation, officially. But unofficially? F for Failure. The students no one else wanted to deal with. Powers too weak, too weird, too… useless. My job is to teach them how to maybe survive long enough to not explode or electrocute a neighbor.

Or themselves.

I sipped my coffee. Black, because hope left me years ago. Then I faced the classroom.

“Alright, let’s do this again. Introductions. Your name, and what you think your power is. Please try not to undersell yourselves this time.”

First up: Danny.

He was slouched so low in his chair, I thought he might melt into the floor. Hoodie up. One earbud in.

“My name’s Danny,” he muttered.

I waited.

“And?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He sighed. Deeply. Theatrically.

“I can, like… give myself a nosebleed.”

A few kids snorted. Someone in the back whispered legendary. I didn’t laugh.

Instead, I leaned forward.

“On command?”

Danny blinked. “Yeah. Pretty much.”

“How?”

He shrugged. “I just sorta… think about it real hard. Then boom. Blood.”

My brain clicked.

Wait.

“Have you tried doing anything with the blood once it’s out?”

Another shrug. “Not really. Just clean it up before Mom sees.”

I stared at him. Not in judgment. In awe.

“Jesus, kid. You’re a blood manipulator. You’re sitting on a literal war crime of potential.”

Danny blinked again. “Huh.”

Next.

A girl with bright green braids and a jacket covered in band pins leaned back in her chair. “Tasha,” she said. “I can charge my phone with my hand.”

Another snicker. I didn’t join in.

“Just your phone?”

“I mean, I haven’t really tried anything else.”

“Ever held a car battery?”

She looked alarmed. “No?!”

“Good instinct,” I said. “But next time, we’re getting you gloves. You’re not a walking charger, Tasha. You’re a generator. You might be able to fry drones out of the sky if we train you right.”

Her eyes widened just a little.

Row by row, it kept happening.

Kid who thought he was useless because he could make his skin slightly bouncy?

Shock absorption. With the right focus, maybe even kinetic redirection.

The girl who could only talk to spiders?

Do you know how many spiders there are in a city? Too many. That’s surveillance on a level Homeland would cry for.

They thought they were broken.

They weren’t.

Just ignored.

Thrown into the junk drawer of the academy system.

And now?

Now they were mine.

“Alright,” I said, pacing in front of them with my coffee in one hand and the other gesturing like a lunatic conductor. “Here’s the deal. You are not weak. You are not jokes. You are… underdeveloped potential. You’re rusty knives, unsharpened arrows, loaded slingshots in a world of laser cannons. But let me be clear. You can kill a god with a slingshot if you aim it right.”

They stared.

Danny’s nose started bleeding slightly. He didn’t even look fazed.

I smiled.

“Class F. Let’s see how far we can take this.”

Officially, I’m *Instructor of Auxiliary Empowered Youth, Section F*.

Unofficially? I teach the Failure Class.

Our Academy is the crown jewel for training young supers. It churns out heroes, tacticians, elite strike teams. But not everyone who gets a power gets to be a star on the news.

Some kids flunk every test. Their powers are ""too weak”, ""too weird"",  or ""flat-out useless."" So they get dumped here, in the windowless room next to the janitor’s closet. With me.

Today’s lesson is ""Power Familiarization."" Fancy way of saying: *Tell me what you can do, so I can figure out what we’re working with.*

""M-Mitsuo.""

""Good. Mitsuo, what’s your gift ?""

He rubs his nose. Shrugs.

""I can give myself a nosebleed.""

A pause. I blink.

He says it so flat, like he’s reporting the weather.

""That’s… all ?""

He shrugs again. There’s a faint smear of blood under one nostril now. He wasn’t lying.

My brain does a quick, frantic backflip. Nosebleeds. Bleeding. Blood.

""Wait. Hold on. You can *control* when you bleed ?""

""Yeah."" He wipes it on his sleeve. ""It just drips. I’m a freak.""

""Mitsuo..."" I say slowly, ""Have you ever tried… I don’t know, *controlling* the blood once it’s out ?"" 

He just stares at me.

Sweet heaven. This kid might be a hemomancer and nobody’s told him because they wrote *""Nosebleeds on command""* on his record.

Next is a girl with long braids and enough piercings to confuse a metal detector.

""Power ?"" I ask, pen ready.

""I can charge my phone.""

This time I nearly drop my clipboard.

""Excuse me ?""

""Yeah. If it dies, I just hold it and it charges. But only a bit. So… useless."" She picks at her nail polish, avoiding my eyes.

I rub my temples. *Self-powered bioelectric generator. Potential electrokinetic.* The kind of thing that, properly trained, could fry drones or short-circuit an enemy’s gear.

""Have you ever tried charging *anything else*? Or, you know, discharging ?""

""Um… no ? My mom says it’s dangerous.""

Well shit. A kid whose wings was clipped by her parents.

I go down the line: a kid who says he can ""make small things float, but only if they’re blue"". (Color-linked telekinesis, probably just a focus issue).

A girl who “can make people ignore her” (Invisibility, perception warping, hello !).

A boy who “always knows what card someone will pick in poker” (Precognition, probability manipulation. Just like the invisible girl, he is spectacularly underestimated).

Every one of them ? Written off.

Stuck here because they didn’t know how to *look* at their gift sideways.

They watch me as I finish my notes, shifting in their rickety chairs. 

They expect me to sigh, or scold them, or worse...

Agree they’re useless.

I grin instead. Wide. Probably manic.

""Alright, my little disasters"", I say, tossing the clipboard onto my desk. ""Here’s your first homework assignment.""

Mitsuo raises a hand, still bleeding slightly. ""We have homework?""

""You do now. Your job is to figure out just how far you can push these “useless„ powers. Nosebleeds ? Find out how much blood you can move. Phone charger ? Let’s see if you can zap a lightbulb. You, poker boy, you’re coming with me to the staff poker game on Friday.""

They laugh. Nervously. But there’s hope flickering in it, too. Tiny sparks in the dark.

""But they said—"" the invisible girl starts.

""*They* are not here."" I cut in, softer now. ""I am. And I say this is our class now. If we’re the failures, then let’s fail spectacularly together, until they have to look at us with different eyes.""

Outside the windowless room, the Academy’s shining heroes fly drills in their designer suits.

Inside my broom-closet classroom, a half-dozen rejects dare to believe they might be more than they’ve been told.

And me ?

I can’t wait to see the day they make the world eat its words.",156
1lvhjec,n276wzn,"""Okay kid, is that all you can do?""

I asked seriously as then using my power to heat up the teacup in my hand 

""Because all I can do is heat tea, until which time I figure out the range of that fire then....""

I proceed to dip my hand in a little bit of diesel fuel that I keep next to my table for such demonstrations, then see the fire in awe.... As I begin not only changing the temperature so they can see a full visible light spectrum, but I also begin manipulating the fire to make cool images in the smoke as it goes around the room.

""I also with the right gear can cast fireball"" 

The students then get the reference and then politely ask me not to.. I humor them and then dip my hand in the diesel again to put out the fire

""My powers, just like yours on the face of it are not perfect, but I'm pretty sure each and every one of you is capable of more. So I got a challenge for you... And yes, in order to help you expand your capabilities. I'm going to have to be the dick head teacher until the bell rings"" 

I take the one kid who can charge their phone and place their phone a few feet away on my desk, not far from the diesel but I have a fire extinguisher ready 

""Try to charge your phone from all the way over there, just to figure out what your range is. I don't worry, if you miss and hit the diesel and somehow ignite it, I'll just put it out and you still get your phone back. And you, what are your powers?""

I then say to a girl that's on the cheerleading team that is failing her superhero classes

""I'm a pretty good contortionist""

""You are one of the people here that might actually have an upper echelon of what your powers are already capable of, are you aware of Daniel Browning Smith?""

""I'm just as flexible as he is Sir.""

""This means also that you can subconsciously re-diver energy's blasted at you, that psychic martial art on Stan Lee's superpowers, is actually a real thing, combat hypnotism and exploiting weaknesses in the human psyche to trigger desired effects without contact, but, the body's muscles in order to trigger the desired nerve effects, have to stretch beyond what they are normally capable of. I would recommend, in order to better train your powers, not only continue to work on what you're already working on, the full body contortion thing, but I also recommend trying to take the top of the pyramid during the next cheer meet, and learn how to fall in order to maximize your own natural durability. But be careful, there is some physiological differences between you and Mr Smith and you could get seriously hurt if you don't practice with padding before you resort to the hard gym floor. I'll speak with the cheer coach if you're up for the challenge.""

""I never backed down from a challenge sir, I was put here because the hero studies teacher thought my Powers were useless.""

""Far from it, need I mind you because of how simple your powers are you're going to be stuck as a sidekick before you actually become a professional hero, but there is actually room for advancement with you. And you shouldn't give up.""


Then I hear the arcing of electricity and the rest of the class looks back in shock as the kid hits the diesel and ignites the fumes. I didn't use my powers to attempt to put it out with my natural control fire first, and it works before handing the kid his phone back. 

""Your homework is working on your range.""

""Is it normal to be flash blinded after that?""

""Oh dear your powers do not include resistance to arc fash.... yeah before you do that your homework is getting appropriate PPE and seeing your eye doctor. But all jokes aside, well done I will be writing a letter to your parents and it will be a positive one."" 

I then turned to face the class

""And that goes for all of you, you are here, because you were incorrectly branded failures before you were even given a chance in my opinion, so the rest of your class time we will be heading down to the range, and each and every one of you will be attempting to use your powers in a way that will hit targets.""

The bloody nose kid then said 

""What about me?""

I then answered 

""You too. We need to learn the full extent of your blood control other than just causing nose bleeds. I think it's more than that, and I'm looking forward to proving to you that you are the most powerful person in this school, if I'm right of course. You're going to be the hardest because your power is naturally put you in the most medical danger, but I know you can do it. Because I reformed. I think you figured out who I am.""

The kids then mumbled and gasped because they figured it out. 

They always put me up with a failures because before I was a hero, I was a super villain, my name was Ace arson, still is, but just like the system redeemed me, I will find a way to redeem these kids and make sure that they surpass the heroes that thought they were a failure. Revenge like this is far more satisfying.",54
1lvhjec,n26ab4j,"I look at the kids, as they continue explaining their powers.  
Snot creation? Isn't that a liquid manipulation as well?  
Heating up himself? Can't that be extremely useful for exploration missions?  
Can levitate small stones? Calamity relief?  
On and on this ""failure"" class explains their powers, all 25 of them, and I sigh.  
They really have never experimented before with their powers.  
Shame on the teachers, and parents whom allocated them to this.  
Shame on the system that actually created a failure class.

  
""Well kids, I will be the first to tell you this, but there is no such thing, as useless power."" I say.  
They giggle.  
""Teach! We are happy to see you try protect our feelings, but we know.  
We know our powers are useless."" a girl with the power to make her clothes shinier says.  
""Yeah, don't worry about our feelings teach.  
We are happy to learn history, and basic stuff, without focusing on the hero stuff.  
The world needs office workers as well."" another says.  
My heart aches for them.  
They are 13? 14? And they have such a mindset already...  
They should still dream wildly.

  
""I am not sugarcoating here, nor trying to be nice.  
You, girl with shiny clothes power, you do realize you can control the intensity of the shining, and thus able to alter how the clothes are seen from afar.  
Be it for spy work, or in the fashion industry, you could be a star."" I say, and she blushes.  
""And you, kid with the extreme snot creation ability.  
That nasal mucus can be used as a lubricant to make the escape route slippery, or to protect certain zones from dust storms? Pollen?"" I say, and the kid blows out a bubble.  
Then I start giving ideas to every single one of them.  
They are smart kids...maybe smarter than some of the ""geniuses"" I have taught during my years at other prestigious school.

  
It has been a trimester, and the change is enormous.  
The kid with the nosebleed ability?  
Now he can give nosebleeds to others, and while that might not seem wow, in a fight, a sudden nose bleed could distract the villains enough for other heroes to apprehend them.  
The kid with the ability to charge his phone?  
Now he can charge cars.  
And the rest has also advanced, so much, that the girl that can make clothes shine, has been hired by a fashion agency already.  
Things are looking great.  
Problem is...the school isn't happy with it, and I am called in for an evaluation for not respecting the curriculum...  
Goddamn bureaucracy...  
It will be the end of our civilization one day, I tell you.",95
1lvhjec,n276tns,"What about you mowhawk? “I can make my hand hard” Tyler says shrugging... cell reconstruction, huh. Excuse me class, have any of your previous teachers asked you to demonstrate your powers or did you just tell them these horrid descriptions, and they moved you here, show of hands? My entire class raised their hands. Haven’t any of you explored yourselves? Yes, very funny, I meant your powers. Haven’t you wondered why if you focused on your nose, blood sprayed out or how your phone became charged if you concentrated enough on it? GUYS, come on. Your first day here and this school has deemed you “failures”. Doesn’t that make you mad?  

Listen up, you are not failures, you are simply being underestimated. That is an advantage given to you by incompetent individuals who can’t understand you. Sun Tzu says “All warfare is based on deception.” Act weak when you are strong, strong when you are weak, yadda yadda right. This can be your greatest strength during this paramount time in your life. I don’t mean you have to go fight in the galactic war, and please don’t ,President Chimp III falsely claimed we were attacked by Teton but there’s no real evidence. He needs to be impeached, but history has taught us that doesn’t even work all the time. Where was I? 

Right, power. Being born human means you have a so called “power” built into you, it’s inherent. The galaxy fears Earth because of it. We have been passed over in galactic scale takeovers because of the stories they tell about us. They fear us... as they should. The indomitable human spirit cannot be understated. It cannot be copied. It is within you, it drives you, you can give it up, maybe even let it die, but no one can take it from you. Tap into that, embrace the tingle it gives you when you face adversity, not for the challenge ahead of you, but knowing the feeling of walking up to the metaphorical mountain that is adversity and climbing that sucker straight to the top. No powers, great powers, “bad” ones. None of it matters, you were born human. That is the greatest power you will ever need.",22
1lvhjec,n28k3b1,"It was a long night preparing for my first day as the Head Instructor for *Applied Studies of Power Ethics and Use, Class F.*

Class F. The ""Faulty"" Class. Children, from as young as five to as old as sixteen, with minimal training and a variety of powers ranging from unwieldy and deficient to detrimental and outright useless. It was a newer designation, only formulated a year ago by the Headmaster of the Academy, as he told the press the class was to ensure that students found to be lagging behind are given a better environment to improve.

In reality, a dumping ground for difficult or ""low-potential"" children. And now *I* had the responsibility of helping them.

I had already cleared what I intended for my initial lecture on the nature of powers and how they shaped those that held them. I even used the example of my own mutation, *Understanding,* to show that even low levels of power can be valuable and beneficial to cultivate. Granted, my power was one of the more fortunate ones, as an intuitive grasp of logic and knowledge helped progress my career far more than some power like ""flaming spit"" would have.

So instead of laying down to rest, I decided to preview the student files I had received. And I was dismayed to find almost no real information.

For most, it lacked any background information, just a simple listing of physical characteristics, and a small excerpt describing the mutation of each child.

*David Bradshaw. Mutation: ""Nosebleed."" Can increase strain upon his own body, resulting in a nosebleed.*

*Suzanne Bradshaw. Mutation: ""Charge."" Can restore the battery life of small electrical devices held in both hands.*

*Kaitlyn Webber. Mutation: ""Resist."" Body is exceptionally resilient to electrical energy, heat, sonic projections, and radiation.

*Elias Powell. Mutation: ""Headache."" Can induce a slight headache in any individual he holds eye-contact with.*

This was... strange. Something about these files were making *Understanding* scratch at the back of my mind. I felt I was missing something critical, and it was bothering me deeply. So when I delved into some research on my computer, I allowed *Understanding* to guide me. And what I found was... unnerving.

For instance, the Bradshaw twins. Powers simply cannot work in the way that theirs do. Powers prefer symmetry, they would never have powers so starkly different as minor electrokinesis and what looks to be minor pressure control or hemokinesis. Except the files said they had just that.

It was impossible that the analysis team was simply incorrect. Three dozen powers built for data acquisition would never miss something so simple my own found it in moments. Which means... they lied, for some reason.

And that's when I found something worse. A villain duo, arrested a bit more than two months before Class F was born. Calling themselves ""Grim & Saint."" A matter destroyer and restorationist, respectively. They were deeply bonded, and listed as A+ Ranked villains with minimal chance of rehabilitation.

This line of thought continued as I dug deeper.

Six months before Class F, the disappearance of S+ Rank villain ""Voidling,"" known as a hero ender for his ability to amplify the perceptions of foes to mind-shattering degrees and drive cities into frenzied riots by merely walking near them.

Ten months prior, the arrest of S- Rank villain, former eco-terrorist ""Perdition,"" a ludicrously potent dynakinetic, capable of rendering cities uninhabitable from radiation and perpetual firestorms, all without a sound.

The list continued, thirty-six students all without background and seemingly insignificant mutations, each coincidentally similar to some villain or another who had vanished in the two years prior to F Class being started.

And then I found it, *Understanding* screaming in my face as I looked at a promotional event two years old. Temporal, the now famous time-warping hero. He once saved an entire city from a nuclear bomb by freezing the city and moving each person individually.

And yet despite certain claims to the contrary, some people speculated he may be able to reverse time as well as freeze it. If that were true... then with a strong mental manipulator on hand, couldn't he basically reset a person from nothing?

As my power hummed in acknowledgement and my heart raced with fear, I had a realization.

Starting tomorrow, I'd have to teach some of history's most dangerous individuals how to use their powers. And somehow *not* let them become villains.

Fuck it, sure. No pressure or anything.",23
1lvhjec,n26jgk3,"Ugh why why freaking WHY?! I had the TOP TIER job in the BEST academy this side of Britain! But nope, I got let go, so now? my first day teaching the reject group. Well fuck it I might as well just tell 'em to dream small and send 'em home.

I walk into the classroom and sure enough, every burnout, every loser, and every goddamn fuck-up punk sitting in one room.

""Well I'm Nora, so just say your name and say your power if ya got one""

A boy with dark brown hair that swooped infront of his face spoke up ""I'm Carl, I make my nose bleed, real legendary"" I faltered ""wait, ya make your nose bleed? Have ya ever tried actually controlling the blood once it's there?"" he scoffed and rolled his eyes ""what am I huh? Aquaman horror?"" I took a deep breath ""not right now, but ya could be, you do realize ya can't breath in blood, ya can't see, imagine that in combat, or if ya could distract somebody making them bleed, think about that""

He seemed to get my point so I looked to the next student, a girl with bright red fiery hair all curly like she'd never washed or combed it in her life ""Dina, and I can charge my phone"" at this I coughed a bit ""kid... thats electricity manipulation, do you understand how powerful you are?""  She shrugged.

This was gonna be a long semester huh.",37
1lvhjec,n277vu2,"It was a daycare, really. 

Nobody expected these kids to be able to do anything worthwhile— least of all me. 

But in a world where people had powers, the asymmetry of strength made things messy for kids with dreams of serving their nation; of garnering smiles from the people they yearned to protect. Not from super villains, or petty crime, no. That had long ago vanished into the realms of impossibility. Robbers in black and white outfits with little masks; people using their powers to rob banks... it was enough to make one smile in remembrance of a better time.

A time before the Scourge.
 
And when I saw that shining black vehicle turn onto the dirt road that led to our Losers Academy, I knew that the fight for mankind was going poorly. 

I set down my coffee mug and turned to the teens in their desks.

""I have to step out for a moment,"" I announced. ""You've got ten more minutes on your ethics exam, and then it's pencils down.""

Most of them had finished. I was mainly speaking to Rodney and David, and everyone in the class knew it. They didn't score any worse than the rest, but they struggled with test-taking anxiety. The two of them shot me a nervous glance as I turned and stepped out the front door. 

The humid air of August bore down on me, and a cloud of gnats instantly swarmed me as I made my way off the front stoop and started down the walk toward the drive. The tinted vehicle drew near, its tires crunching on gravel as the anticipation began to build in me. 

I'd been dreading this day.

When the vehicle came to a stop, the driver didn't cut the motor. The passenger didn't even deign to exit the car— they rolled down the window, and that shiny brass uniform confirmed my suspicion. 

I didn't recognize his face, but a quick look at his attire told me all I needed to know. He had a square jaw, beady eyes, and wore a no-nonsense expression. I could tell by the bags under his eyes that his job wasn't an easy one.

""You run this shit hole?"" he asked.

""I'm Professor Alan Kirkland,"" I introduced myself, tactfully as I was able. 

He opened his mouth like he was going to speak, and then suddenly started straight ahead and looked down in his lap. He leaned back, letting his head rest work for him as he played with the words in his mouth.

""Son. This nation faces dark times,"" he started.

*""Real* dark if you're here,"" I folded my arms. ""I've been wondering... *worrying,* really, about when I'd see you in my driveway.""

He scoffed. ""You're giving the tabloids too much credit.""

""And yet, here you are,"" I said, unflinching. ""How many do you need?""

""All of 'em,"" he said, staring me right in the eye. ""Every able-bodied Super,"" he sighed. ""Even the flunkies... are to report to 1002 Evercrest Drive in one month's time."" 

He handed me an important-looking envelope engraved with the nation's insignia and sealed with wax.

""A month?"" I asked, losing my cool demeanor for the first time. ""Colonel, a month is not going to be enough. These kids have been deemed unfit by the state. What do you expect me to do with them in a month?""

""For once, I can say, that's not my job,"" he said, narrowing his eyes at me. ""It's yours, Professor. Get these kids ready for war. The Scourge isn't breaking against our best."" He looked forward and began rolling up the window. The tint was good, but it didn't cover his worried expression before it reached the top and sealed. 

The vehicle departed under a gloomy sky and a long silence. 

I looked down at the letter in my hand and sighed. 

""Dammit,"" I said out loud, turning and making my way back into the building. 

It was a circus when I reentered the classroom. Everyone was talking, laughing, joking around, and out of their seats, only returning to decorum when they noticed me, jaw clenched, and unenthused. 

""Has everyone handed in their test?"" I asked. 

""Yessir,"" they spoke in unison as I picked my coffee mug up off the windowsill and walked to my desk. I sat down and stared at the stack of papers on my desk before looking at them all over the rim of my glasses. 

These kids were flunkies, but they were *my* flunkies.

I wasn't about to let any of them die horribly.

I stood up and took a deep breath, and held it a moment before letting it out.

""Class,"" I announced. ""We're going to war.""

The little dummies cheered.

I rubbed my eyes with my thumb and forefinger under my glasses.

This nation was doomed.

r/A15MinuteMythos",37
1lvhjec,n29ms2u,"I watched as the students came into the classroom at the beginning of the semester. Many looked defeated, some looked skittish and afraid, a couple looked defiant and belligerent. All normal reactions to being assigned to Track C here at the Academy.

See, the majority of people with superpowers developed them before 15 or so and after about a decade since the Seeding, Power Academies became pretty standard and even required. So a kid shows *any* super ability and they get sent to a place like this for the rest of their education. Their first semester in the system was all together and basically a way to figure out a baseline for their abilities. Then they were assigned to a Track for the rest of their schooling. Track A for powers that were or had the potential to become Tier 10+. Track B for powers that were or had the potential to max out from Tier 5-10. And finally Track C for powers that could only ever max out at Tier 4. The powers where they weren’t even offered the specialty classes in training Combat Applications, Utility Applications, or Support Applications. The useless ones like changing the art style of a painting or being able to perfectly mimic insect noises or getting nosebleeds on command.

And the kids knew it. Track C is for the kids that the Academies have deemed too worthless to deal with, but that they’re required to accept since they have powers. Every single kid here had been written off as a failure before setting foot in my classroom.

I got my Master’s in Education with a focus on special education back before The Seeding and the existence of superpowers, but leaped at the chance to teach at one of the Academies once they opened. Because if there’s someone you *absolutely* want to be taught well, it’s a child with special needs *and* superpowers. I ended up in this Track and this classroom because I wanted to help those children. It wasn’t until the Academies had settled a bit before it became evident that this was the Track for the so-called “failures”.

So I watched the defeated kids, the struggling kids, the angry ones and the ones who no longer cared. These were *my* kids now and by gods I would do the best for them that I could.

Once everyone took their seat, I stood and walked behind the podium at the front of the classroom.

“Good morning, class. My name is Mr. Ashburn and this semester I’m going to get you to the point that you could leave Track C if you want to.”

*That* got their attention.

“I want to go around and get some information about each of you, but first, my philosophy on powers

“In the Intro class, you were told about the APF scale and the Tier system. Ability, the nature of your powers, Power, the raw strength or scope of your powers, and Finesse, how well your control and precision with your powers. Here I’m going to teach you C, creativity with your powers.

“For example: Strongman is just, well, a strong man. Able to lift a cargo ship right out of the water and all that. But he’s creative with that strength and that’s why he’s a Tier 12. Not just picking up and throwing things, but his *actual* power is touch-based telekinesis and with that he can crush coal into diamonds or pinch steel beams together tighter than almost any weld or punch through forcefields or jump so high and far that he can reach low earth orbit for a brief period. Raw strength on its own isn’t all that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Versatility and creativity with it *are*.

“And that’a what we’re going to do this semester. Maybe you’ll never be a Tier 10. But you’ll be able to do things with your powers no-one else would’ve thought of.”

I pointed at a fat 13 year-old in the second row. “You! What’s your name and your power?”

He had been one of the anxious-looking ones and now he had a deer-in-the-headlights look. He stammered out an answer.

“Paul Derrick, sir. My power is finding a needle in a haystack.”

I clapped my hands and walked around to the front of the podium. “Thank you, Mr. Derrick. Now class, that sounds pretty unimpressive, right? But take a minute and *think* about it. Given a pile of loose hay as tall or taller than you, how long do you think it’d take for you to find a single sewing needle mixed into it? A long time, right? Mr. Derrick here can find it immediately. To me, that sounds like extra-sensory perception. Or maybe being able to tell even small differences in a lot of things all at once. Or maybe he can sense metal. There are a dozen things that could be happening to let him know where that needle is. Maybe he could figure out how to tell other small objects apart, like diamonds in the middle of fakes. Or maybe he could figure out how to track a lot of different things all at once, like a combat precog. The thing is that none of us *know* exactly what he can do. And I bet all of you are like that, some potential hidden in what you can already do that no-one could see yet.”

I pick up a stack of paper from my desk and hand it to the kid at the end of the first row.

“These is a syllabus of what I hope to go over in this course, as well as some books, articles, and websites that you might find helpful. None of those are required reading and I won’t be testing you on them, but they could give you insights into your own powers and ways to use them differently. I recommend you check them out.

“Now let’s go around the room. Everyone tell us your name, where you’re from, and what you think your powers are. We’ll start exploring the limits next class. And class? No matter how minor or dumb you think someone’s power might be, even if it’s your own, you *will not* make fun of it here or anywhere on campus. It might be that none of you reach Tier 10 or higher, but I bet some of you will.”

As the syllabi got passed around the class, I noted what they thought their powers were in each of their files.

A shy 10 year old girl. “I can give myself nosebleeds just by thinking about it.”

A 16 year old dressed like a goth. “If I whistle, I attract butterflies.”

A mulish-looking 18 year old boy. “I drop things and they break, even if they shouldn’t.”

An immaculate looking 12 year old boy. “I can eat rocks.”

A 6 year old girl who looked on the verge of crying. “I cry pretty stones instead of tears. Daddy always takes them away before I can do anything bad with them.”

Yeah, the potential in this classroom was probably higher than most classes in Tracks A or B.",11
1lvhjec,n29u26n,"So this was class Z.  Officially this was the class for students who had the most potential for a normal life.  Unofficially it was the class for rejects.  Absolutely none of them were happy to be assigned here.  After all who comes to a school for supers to learn to lead a normal life.  My job description said I was supposed to discourage power usage, encourage normal average human curriculum and under no circumstances was I to even suggest to this class they had the potential to be heroes.  Well fuck my job description, fuck the admin, and fuck the classifications.

""Alright kids, we're doing something different today.  I know you haven't drawn the best lots in life, supers with what have been deemed low level powers.  I know your previous teacher actively discouraged their usage but that isn't why I signed on with this academy and it certainly isn't why any of you chose to attend.  So here's the deal, you want a normal human life, you want a normal human curriculum.""  I point to my left ""That right there is called a door, it's unlocked and open.  There are normal human schools all over and all you have to do is not display powers to attend them.""  I paused then ""But for those who came here to learn their powers, to be Super, then know that I believe Every Single One of you Can.""

I sat at my desk and put a timer on it set to ten minutes ""When this clock hits zero anyone still in this class will be assumed to Want to become a super, will be treated as a student who signed up for this academy to learn those skills, and most importantly will be subjected to all kinds of hell to Learn, once the timer runs out no one in my class will have the Option to quit, because in this line of work, to quit is to Die.""

I watched the hushed whispers, the comments about how I must be exaggerating.  I saw Timothy ""Timer"" Shebol get up and take a step, look at the clock, look at his feet and nod before sitting down.  Then a couple others considered, shifted, but no one left.  Not even Nate ""Nosebleed"" Johnson.  When the timer buzzed I stood up once more.

""Alright, every one of you has a power, every one of you is here for a reason.  So we're going to start small because Every journey begins with a single step.  We won't be going in alphabetical or seat order.  Those of you who stood up or took a step towards that door, you're going to be first.  Because remember that's what Villains WANT, they WANT you to step down, they WANT you to turn tail, most of all they WANT you to QUIT! and as I said there is NO quitting HERE.""

""Tim front and Center.""  The young boy with the ragged brown hair, the narrow green eyes that saw more then most and the gangly awkward limbs stood and walked forwards.  ""Tim, what's your power?""

He looks at me like I'm crazy ""You already know that.""

""I do, but you're going to repeat it now or the lesson is going to be more painful."" I smirked and I saw the memory in his head of his parents signing total authority over to the school.  Every student was under our total discipline, if we decided someone needed to be hucked through a brick wall then we could.  Anything short of death was allowed by that contract.

""Time recall or Timer.  I know the exact timing of every one of my actions.  It would have taking me 15 seconds at a run, 45 at a walk to have left once standing.""  He sighed and muttered ""it's worthless""



""Alright Tim, I heard that even if those in the back didn't I'ver heard that phrase from all of you at least once.  However we don't assume in my class.  So first question.""  I threw a punch over his shoulder, a kick over his head and a round house just in front of his nose.  ""How long for each?""



Without even seeming to think.  ""Three second jab, 5 second kick, 12 second roundhouse.""  He then looked down at himself and slapped his hand over his mouth before slowly lowering it.  ""That's not right, I can't.""",10
1lvhjec,n2arwub,"""You can charge your phone.""


""Yep.""


""And you can give yourself a nosebleed?"" 


""Uh, yeah.""


I pointed at Fred. ""What other electricity things have you tried to do?"" He looked at me blankly. ""Can you power a lightbulb in your hand?""


""I dunno. Why would I want to do that?"" Fred asked.


I sighed internally, but tried not to let it show. ""It's not about lighting the lightbulb, it's about developing your skills. Same way as your math teacher doesn't really care how many watermelons Sally can buy."" He continued to look at blankly. ""You can charge your phone. That means you can manipulate electricity. Manipulating electricity can do lots of other things. But we have to start small. Light a light bulb. Eventually start a car. Maybe power a house. Sell electricity back to the power grid, if you're powerful enough. Restart someone's heart, if you're skilled enough. Stop someone's heart if you go into combat, and maybe more besides. Maybe. But we won't know until we figure out what you can do, so we need to start with simple things like lightbulbs. Start with the simple useless thing, get bigger from there.""


Fred blinked slowly. ""Is this gonna be on the test?"" 


Rather than use my own powers to explode his head then and there, I turned to Phil. ""Can you stop your nosebleed?"" 


Phil shrugged. ""Yeah.""


""Ok. We have special dummies with blood in them. Can you do anything to their blood?"" 


Phil dragged his foot aimlessly on the ground. ""I can like make it move a little.""


""That could be incredibly powerful. For you, we'll have to be careful, but are you interested in being a healer?"" 


Phil looked up. ""That might be cool.""


These kids were not useless, they just needed to see that. They needed someone to show them how big important things are made out of little silly things. ""Ok. The first thing for you is going to be to try to get the dummy to start bleeding, then to stop. If we can do that, we'll go from there. See if you can can control more about the blood flow, or tell properties of it by how it reacts to you.""


Phil raised his hand. ""When am I gonna use this in real life?"" 


^((Yes I am a former professor who got kind of burnt out and changed careers, how could you tell?\)) ",8
1lvhjec,n2av6nj,"A sunny Monday morning paved the way for me today on my way to work. It was that kind of sunny day where the clouds were sparse but the ones that were around looked like cotton candy. Blue skies like the ocean. What a day today will be. Or so I thought. 

My assignment was hanging in the office when I came in. Class 520. The higher the number of the floor and at the end of room number, the less, how can we say, ""talented"" the group would be. Well, let's go in with at least a grain of salt, I guess. Walking to the classroom I noticed the door was closed. Through the window however there were several kids I could count on one hand, who all looked like they came out of a My Chemical Romance video. Ok. This is fine. They have behavioral issues? That's doable. Find the curve. I've seen what people can do with their focused energy so it's fine. 

Upon opening the door, I heard a large belch come from the back. As I turned my head to look at where the sound erupted from, there was a large redheaded girl with droopy eyes. She looked like she hasn't slept for days. I felt a tickle of electricity at my open toes shoe and noticed a small trail of staticky dust across the floor led up to a child who sat in front.  Okay. This was interesting. I landed at my desk finally and saw some notes and files about the students. All failures and held backs. Oooooookay. With a deep breath she stood tall and looked directly at the bushel of students. All of their names were in front of them on cardboard desk tags. 

""Hello, students, I am Mrs. Asher, I'll be your teacher this year. I understand for some of you, this is just another go at graduation. We're here to do what we can for you. Having superpowers is a gift and I'm here to guide you. We're going to go around the room and I would like to know your gift. I start with the pale child in front of me who either has seen a ghost, is a ghost, or needs a transfusion. ""You, what is your power?""

He almost looked too drained to speak but when he did it was breathlessly said, ""I can give myself bloody noses."" Uh...ok. 
""So you have hemokinesis. That's a very strong power to have. Good job."" So he wasn't a ghost he was anemic. Sheesh. 
""Hemo what?"" he asked, puzzled. 
""Hemokinesis. You can control blood. Manipulation of blood.""
Still a bit puzzled by my reply, I moved on to the child next to him. 
Smiling with my winning grin, ""And you?"" 

He looked around slowly. Almost like he was trying to see if anyone would answer for him. Shyly, he opened his mouth, ""I can charge my phone."" As soon as the words left his mouth he hid his face in his shirt collar.
""So you're electrokinetic. I see. Well, we all love a good charged phone for the day. My battery drains out quickly because I am always talking to my husband."" His head was so submerged in his shirt, all that could be seen was his jet black hair on top of his head. 

Clearing my throat, I walked around the room personally going over everyone's power. It seems like no one has ever fully explained to them the proper scientific terms to them. Challenging them to speak seemed like all they knew. Until now.

An empowering speech from my heart erupted. ""Today we embark on your new hidden talents to be hidden no more. Honed and polished to be utilized to help others in need as is the way. You may not have been able to feel confident in yourself before me but I will make sure at the end of the year, you will be your best selves. You are special. Not in a weird curious sense but unique and important. Today you have me to help you understand your god self.  To the naysayers...we will quiet them with your strength! What do you say?"" 

As they say in baseball, a hush fell on the crowd. Then in the silence....someone farted. The hemokinetic kid caught a nosebleed. The girl in the back belched again and I could smell it from where I stood in the front of the class. 

Welp. It's going to be a long year.",7
1lvhjec,n28clf6,"Part 3 After The training 

They filed out of the classroom like it was the last chopper out of a warzone. Backpacks half-zipped. Phones already out. Someone left a shoe behind. I stood by the door, arms crossed, pretending I wasn’t watching. But I was. I always do. Just in case.

I didn’t expect anything from them. Not at first. But now I can’t stop thinking about floating blood, electric hair, and a kid whose name no one ever seems to remember.

Danny left without a word. Tasha nodded at me. That was enough.

They weren’t rejects.

They were misread.

I didn’t smile.

But I came close.


**Danny**

The bleeding had stopped. Kind of.

I was perched on the edge of the bathroom sink, staring at the dried trail under my nose like it might reveal something. Some kind of secret. Like, “Hey, congrats, you’re not completely useless.” Or maybe, “You’ve finally unlocked something.”

Yeah, right.

It just burned.

“Again with this, Danny?” Mom’s voice echoed down the hall. I heard a spoon clink against a pot. She sounded tired. Not new.

“I’m not picking it, Mom. It was from training.”

“What training? That joke class? That’s not a real school. You need iron. Or less stress. Or therapy.”

I could’ve explained. Again. That maybe my power was real. That I made blood hover. But she was already gone, back to her kitchen, her life, her everything-that-isn’t-me.

Then came Jerrod.

My older brother. Human torch in a tank top. Probably glowing from whatever hero stunt he pulled today.

“You practicing your superpower again? Nosebleeds are your brand now? You gonna sell merch?”

I didn’t respond. Didn’t trust myself to.

I turned back to the mirror. Focused hard.

Nothing.

Except this pounding in my skull.

But for a split second, I thought the blood on my face moved. Not dripped. Shifted. Like it was waiting.



**Tasha**

The laundromat lights made everything look like a crime scene. Cold, blue, flickering. I was kneeling on the tile, hunched over my phone’s guts. Circuits exposed. Sparks kissing my fingertips.

It felt like… control.

“Is this what you call a power?” Dad’s voice dropped like a cinderblock.

“I’m fixing it.”

“That’s not a power. That’s tinkering. A real power moves buildings.”

“I fried a drone midair.”

“And that was luck. This? A hobby. A dead end. Go study accounting.”

Mom’s voice floated in from behind the laundry curtain, tired but firm. “Cléber, enough.”

“I’m trying to prepare her!”

“You’re trying to make her give up.”

I connected the last wire. The screen blinked on. Warm. Alive. Like it recognized me.

I felt the charge ripple through my hands.

I felt… something.

But if nobody sees it, does it count?



**The Teacher**

Leo’s file said “non-mutant.” No activation. No ability. Just… ordinary…

But I couldn’t shake it.

During the simulation, no one acknowledged him. No one looked at him. Even when he moved. Even when he spoke. It wasn’t just that they forgot him. It was like their minds skipped over him completely.

I reviewed the scans again. There was brain activity. Subtle, but there. Like a motor idling beneath the surface.

He didn’t know.

None of us did.

I stared at the notes and scribbled in the margin.

“Peer perceptual distortion? Passive cloaking? Power: undetermined. Or deliberately overlooked.”



**Danny**

My room was too hot. Too quiet…

I was lying on my side, face against the pillow, blood pooling beneath my nose. Again.

This time, I didn’t wipe it.

I watched…

It floated. Just a little.

Like gravity didn’t quite work on me anymore.

I reached out, not with my hand, but with something deeper. And it moved toward me. Soft. Controlled.

Mine…

For once, I didn’t feel like a failure.

But then Jerrod laughed from his room, and I felt it crack.



**Tasha**

The laundry machines hummed in the background. Low and steady.

I sat in the hallway, knees pulled up, screen glowing in my lap. It buzzed in my hands like it knew it shouldn’t be alive but was anyway.

Mom and Dad were still arguing. Quieter now. More tired than angry.

I closed my eyes and thought about school. About the simulation. About the drone sparking midair.

About the second I realized… I could do something.

At home, I was wrong…

At school , even Class F, I was someone.

I missed it already…



**Leo**

The school was empty. The hallways buzzed like they were trying to forget the day.

I sat at the back of the classroom long after the others left. I always do.

No one notices.

They never do.

I walked past the security camera.

No light.

No recording.

Not even a flicker.

My reflection in the glass door was soft around the edges. Like the world wasn’t sure where to draw me.

Maybe I had a power.

Or maybe I was just something the universe decided to skip.



**The Teacher**

I closed Leo’s file with more force than I meant to. The echo rang through the staff lounge.

He’s not just overlooked.

He’s erased.

And I don’t know why.

But I’ll find out.

Tomorrow, I start digging.

Class F isn’t broken.

It’s just hidden.

And I’m done letting the world keep the lid on…",228
1lvhjec,n27om63,"——

**Part 2:**

The thing about kids with unstable powers?

They don’t need encouragement. They need a controlled environment, padded walls, and at least three trauma therapists on standby.

What they got instead was me.

By 8:27 AM, I had marched the whole class down to the lower gymnasium. Most of them assumed we were going on a tour, or maybe an evacuation drill. Some were still clutching breakfast bars. One girl was holding a sketchpad.

I locked the doors behind us and turned on the simulation field.

“Alright,” I said. “Welcome to your first practical session. The goal today is simple.”

They stared at me like baby birds.

“Stay alive for five minutes while I try to kill you.”

Tasha dropped her granola bar.

“I’m sorry, what?”

I smiled.

“It’s non-lethal. Mostly. Just some pressure pads, low-voltage shocks, maybe a minor gas leak. If you pass out, that’s a fail. If you scream, I’ll make fun of you. If you survive, I might consider not reporting you to the Board.”

Danny raised his hand.

I ignored it.



The field activated with a low hum. Turrets popped out of the floor. The walls shimmered with active light grids. A mechanical arm in the corner unfolded with way too much enthusiasm.

I set the timer.

“Begin.”



The first thing Danny did was nosebleed.

Not voluntarily.

He tripped over his own shoelace, face-planted, and came up bleeding. Again.

But then something weird happened.

The blood didn’t fall.

It hovered.

Just slightly.

Like the air around him didn’t quite agree with gravity anymore.

He blinked, looked down, and the blood curved midair. Thin, sharp, following the path of a laser line.

I made a note.



Tasha, meanwhile, had backed herself into a corner, holding her phone like a talisman.

A small drone flew at her — standard intimidation pass. It sparked once.

So did she.

The air around her cracked. The phone lit up. Her hair lifted an inch off her shoulders.

The drone fried mid-air.

She dropped the phone.

“Oops.”

I made another note. Underlined it…



Row by row, they stumbled, adapted, reacted. Some screamed. Some froze. One kid tried to play dead. Another tried to punch a turret and immediately regretted it.

And yet… none of them gave up.

Not even when the gas vents hissed or the shock tiles flared.

Livia — girl with the sketchpad — used her drawings to predict turret timing. Turned the session into a game of rhythm and dodges.

They weren’t ready.

But they were trying.

And in a room like that, trying was enough.



At the four-minute mark, one of the newer kids — Gabe, I think — lost control. His ability was kinetic recoil, which sounds cool until you realize it turns your reflexes into explosions.

He panicked. Threw his hands out.

The shockwave hit Danny square in the ribs.

Danny hit the wall with a crack.

He slid down, gasping. His shirt was stained red — not from the test, but from his own power kicking in as a defense.

Blood floated again.

Sharper this time.

I shut down the simulation…


Silence.

The kind that hums in your bones.

Gabe backed away, horrified. “I didn’t mean— I wasn’t—”

“Stop.”

My voice came out too loud. Too cold.

I walked to the center.

Everyone was watching me now. No jokes. No snorts. No snickering.

“You don’t get to hurt each other,” I said. “Out there, the world is cruel enough. In here, I’m crueler. But I will not let you turn on your own.”

Gabe nodded, eyes wide. Danny coughed. Tasha helped him up.

I took a breath. Calmer.

“You did better than I expected.”

I almost smiled. Almost.

“Class F. First blood drawn. Not bad.”",335
1lvhjec,n29u7j3,"\-Part 2-

I smirked and raised my hand in a fist ""And how long to tilt your head""

As I threw the jab actually at his face he tilted it immediately ""half second tops, longer if my neck is stiff.""  He then realized what he had just done.

I nodded ""So your power is worthless huh?  You think being able to tell exactly how long a villain will take to strike after only seeing a move once is useless?  How many hits do you think Ultimite could avoid if he knew the exacts of his foes and his own timing.  How long does it take you to lean""  I threw the roundhouse as I spoke ""Back""

He tilted backwards ""2 seconds, far below your wind up.""

I could hear the pride in his voice.  ""Very good.  That's enough for you, after all I've got an entire class yet to do.  Back to your seat.""

I watched him walk a little straighter, a little better.  Sure if he took a first hit it might be fatal but for now he needed confidence, they all did.  I looked over the class room and nodded towards Lisa Hendricks.

""Lisa, Front and Center.""  She walked up clutching her phone for dear life, it was the one thing she knew she could do, charge that phone and so it held in her hands at all times.  I chuckled.  ""and what is Your Power?""

She slumped and whispered ""I can charge my phone.""

I slammed my hand on the desk behind me and she snapped to attention.  ""Girl, I do not have time or patience for pretend.  If you aren't going to be proud of your ability you shouldn't have stayed.  You did though, so Tell Me Your Power""

The anger at being humiliated flared then and she snarled ""I can charge my goddamn phone you fucking psycho.""

I bared my teeth in a manic grin and snatched the phone, and with practiced ease took the battery out and tossed it behind my desk.  I offered the phone back sans battery and she snatched it then tried to scramble past me only to find my arm blocking her.  ""No.  No battery.  Now use your power.""

She went bug eyed and shook her head.  ""I can't, there's nothing to."" another slam on my desk interrupted her.

""Power now! or I smash the phone and make you do it with a destroyed screen and who knows what other damage.""  I loved and hated this.  If they were going to be heroes they needed a villain, and they needed it sooner then those who had the support of their teachers.  So I'd be the villain.",7
1lvhjec,n28juwo,"> **Leo** No one notices. They never do. I walked past the security camera. No light. No recording. Not even a flicker. My reflection in the glass door was soft around the edges.

I was fully expecting Leo to just walk into an automatic door that failed to detect his presence. XD

Makes me wonder how far that would extend. Clearly includes his clothes. Held items? How big? Would it matter how flashy and hard to overlook they are? Would you notice him if he pointed a flashlight at you? A gun? What if he was driving a car? Do you just not perceive him, or do you write it off as unimportant? Could be a stealth pilot maybe. Just fly in a superhero team on an unassuming Cessna and nobody pays any attention to it.",19
1lvhjec,n26rrzg,"I’m getting addicted to [WP] too. It’s just too good.

Because I’ve noticed that these comments are being read more than my actual book, and it feels like here, I’m finally able to get my writing across.

She focused in on the phone and as she did the screen blinked to life.  Her surprise immediately shut down her focus.  ""Again!""  I shouted, and she did so.  I nodded and then took it from her and it shut off.  I set it behind me and to the side, in view but out of reach.  ""Again!""  she looked and shook her head and started reaching for it.  I blocked her arm.  She teared up and balled her fists, and then I saw it the spark of true fury, she was being made an example of, being humiliated in front of a class of rejects and she wasn't going to take it.  She didn't focus this time, she instead let out a primal shriek, and every phone in class rang at once including hers.  The students shook there heads and every one of them looked at their phones, every one had a new voicemail.  One of them opened it and everyone heard ""Mr. Bion, no Mr. Bastard is more like it.""  I nodded and offered her her phone and waved to behind the desk.



""Indeed I am, and frankly that's a solid name.  From now on"" I crossed out my name on the board and wrote 'Bastard' in it's place.  ""I am Mr. Bastard and you should expect me to live up to that name.  Now young technopath, go take your seat and if you want your battery back go get it."" 



She went immediately back to her seat leaving the battery behind and stared at her phone like she'd never seen the thing in her life.



I nodded ""Alright, who's next, oh that's right.  Franklin, you made it closest to the door before turning back.  So get your ass up here, and tell us your power.""



He shook like a leaf as he got up from his desk and walked forwards.  ""I can umm, well I can make smells.""  



Devon the class clown piped up then ""So can every human Frankie Farter.""  



I glared then.  ""You know what Devon, why don't we make this a duo exercise, get your ass up here and state your power too.""  I knew he'd take a shot at someone, just hadn't known who, and I needed them to understand that not only was I their villain but that if given the opportunity I'd turn them on each other and they needed to be ready for it.  This was as good a moment for that lesson as any.



Devon strutted up proudly.  ""My power is being the absolute best at cracking jokes, but I also dabble in shapechanging, even if it's only into a human sized mouse.""",8
1lvhjec,n28hf3i,"You have no idea how much I loved reading this. Honestly, I’m doing all of this lightly, I saw that people enjoyed it, so I just went with it. But I see a lot of potential in the story, and I love heroes, so it flows naturally when I write. My imagination runs with it. But like I said, I’m not a native speaker, and I’ve had a terrible experience translating my book into English. So, for now, I don’t think I’d write another long book. Maybe a short story or a small book instead. But yes, I’ve genuinely been interested for a while now in developing first-person narratives. It’s challenging, but I really enjoy it.

I sighed ""Alright, then, we're going to have a fun little competition between you to.

You may use any ability at your disposable, nothing extraneous however.  Your sole goal, make the other person give up.  Oh and Devon do try to aim for the trash can.""



His look of confusion lasted only for the moment before I waved my hand and said begin.  He rushed towards Franklin who was looking at me as if I would help.  I simply shrugged and pointed back at the boy about to throw a punch.  Devon missed the hit barely as Franklin dodged back.  He raised a hand palm open and I could smell daisies in a field.  Couldn't see the benefit until suddenly he was calm, not looking at me, staring dead at Devon.  Then the smell shifted, leather with stale smoke and a hint of sex to it.  Not a smell I'd have chosen either, but something Devon saw made him afraid when that smell flowed through the class.  A few of the other students were whispering, I even heard one say 'I think he might kill him'.



I watched carefully as Devon took a step back and Franklin stepped forwards, they repeated this until Devon was against the wall and Franklin's hand was directly in his face.  At first I thought I'd press it against him, but he didn't instead my entire class room was filled with the worst thing I'd ever smelled and I still couldn't place it.  Someone else yelled ""Oh god, not this again.  Come on man, the cafeteria took a Month to be normal!""



I then watched as Devon turned towards the trash can next to him and immediately puked his guts up.  His body began shifting then first into a mouse but the sense of smell for a mouse is so much better then a humans which was not something he wanted, as he returned to human form though something altered, his nose shrank and shrank until it was gone, and soon he couldn't smell.  He then looked up though at Franklin and through gasps for breath said ""I yield.""",10

I nodded and said ""Franklin, if you can please, something to undo this then return to your seat.  Devon, you may head to the bathroom you know where they keep all the supplies and I'm sure you're wanting them.""  Franklin raised both hands and within moments my class instead smelled, exactly as it had before the fight, as if he hadn't ever done anything.  I hadn't realized he could duplicate smells to this degree.



A few classmates patted him on the back.  ""Nice one Franky, he'll definitely stop now unless he wants another dose of that.  I can't believe you remembered the smell when Cherry Flame decided to torch Trash Compactor.""  Another chuckled ""I can't believe you could undo in seconds what took the school a month to fix.""



The smile on Franklin's face had made the lesson that much more worthwhile.  I nodded.  ""Alright.  Nadia, you're up next.""



She stood, her tan skin on thorough display in the crop top and shorts she favored.  Of course with her powers that wasn't neccessarily the wrong choice.  ""You know the drill by now.  Name your power.""



She looked at me then at the class.  ""I can make tattoos of anything I see appear on my skin.""  Nadia was the student I had to dig into the hardest.  Her father was an open book.  An unpowered normal human, he had been given custody and said Nadia's mother was long since passed.  I hadn't been able to find a birth certificate for Nadia at first.  I eventually dug far enough and found she was born in a little middle of nowhere town where a midwife handled most birthing affairs and apparently had a habit of not really keeping good records.  Still I was diligent and had connections all over.  Eventually I found what I'd been looking for.  A villain of appropriate age, build, and ethnicity who had vanished for a couple years right around the time of her birth.  Her name was Tat Master, she could bring any tattoo to life.  Yours or hers, and it'd be fully real and functional no matter how fictional.



""Alright Nadia, I want you to do something specific.  Have you ever seen a force field belt?  You should have, the school displays a few of the techie's award winners in the hall.""  



She nodded ""Yeah I've seen it, it looks like this.""  She created it exactly around her waist, every detail perfect down to the screw driver scratches of students who had tried tinkering with it as a prank.""",8

**Livia**

My house is never quiet.
Not really.
Quiet here means people walking soft and doors closing like they’re sorry for existing. It means tension like the walls are holding their breath…

I sit on my bedroom floor, back against the bed, sketchpad open on my knees. My pencil’s moving faster than I’m thinking. Lines chase memories I didn’t know I had  the rhythm of the turret fire, the arc of the drone before it fried midair.

Over and over. Like I’m trying to solve something that already lives in my bones.

Then: footsteps. Heavy ones. The kind that want to be heard.

My father…

“Why the hell are you still drawing that garbage?”

I don’t look up.
“It’s not garbage.”

He doesn’t answer. Just walks right up, grabs the sketchpad out of my hands.

I freeze.
He flips through the pages like they’re napkins, stopping at the one I redrew twice the pulse pattern I dodged in the gym. Then he rips it out. No warning.

“You’re wasting your time,” he mutters. “You wanna draw? Fine. Sketch something useful. Weapon schematics. Business models. Not this childish crap.”

Behind him, one of the maids passes by. She barely grazes the corner of the table.

He doesn’t even turn. Just snaps, sharp:
“Careful, idiot!”

She flinches. I do too. But I bite down on it.
Hard.

He looks back at me.

“You’re soft. That school’s making you weaker. You’re not special, Livia. You’re just expensive.”

And then he’s gone — taking my sketch with him.

I don’t cry…

I pick up the pencil again.
Redraw every line.
Harder. Sharper.

I don’t know if I’m creating something anymore.
Maybe I’m just predicting it.




**Gabe**

Dinner’s noodles again.
Dry, stuck together, dumped into four plastic bowls — one for me, two for the twins to spill, and one for Mom, even though she probably won’t eat.

I stir mine with a fork, pretending it’s food…

Mom’s eyes are heavy. Not just tired like all her hope evaporated and left nothing behind. She’s got one hand on her forehead and the other holding her cracked phone.

“Eat it before it sticks,” she mutters…

My little brother’s noodles are in his hair again. I don’t even ask how. My sister glows faintly — literally — when she’s nervous. It’s her power. Bioluminescence. Like a scared jellyfish.

Super useful.

I clear my throat.
“So… I kinda figured something out today.”

Mom doesn’t look up.

“You know how sometimes I, like… flinch too hard? Like things break around me?”

“That why the bathroom mirror’s gone?”

I nod. “Yeah, but it’s more than that. I think it’s like—”

“Unless it gets you a job or a scholarship, Gabe, I don’t want to hear it.”

Not angry. Just tired. Like always.

I press my tongue against my teeth and bite down the words trying to crawl out. Then I push the bowl aside and stand up.

“Gonna take a walk.”

She waves me off like she’s swatting a fly.

Outside, it’s hot. The streetlights flicker. I walk past the alley and down to the corner store. There’s a vending machine outside with one candy bar stuck on the edge of the drop slot.

I stare at it.

Focus…

My hand twitches. The air pops.

The candy falls.

I grab it, unwrap it, and take a bite before anyone can yell.

Not stealing.
Just… solving a problem.
The machine didn’t need it anyway.

I walk home slower.

And I wonder what else I could knock loose from the world — if I aimed just right.

I haven’t read any weird sentences that indicate literal translations, so your proficiency is definitely more than okay.  

My guess is that a lot of people don’t have the time or energy to read full books nowadays, and these short stories are a great way to escape the real world for just a little while.  
Without the trap of just reading one more chapter, or just a few more pages, 10 more minutes and before you know it, it’s already morning. I’m definitely speaking from experience here.  

I hope you will continue writing short stories here. Maybe it gets the inspiration flowing when you feel stuck. Or perhaps just knowing that people enjoy what you write can give you a needed boost.  

As a reader, I definitely appreciate your work. But don’t forget that it’s supposed to be as much fun for you to write, as it is for us to read.",5

I chuckled ""Indeed, that is exactly it.""  Without warning I grabbed a textbook from behind me and slammed it into her head.  Or I would have except her tat belt glowed as if it were activating and I felt like I slammed the book into a lead sheet instead.



""What the fuck is wrong with you, are you completely off your rocker?!  What do you think you were doing?!""  She then created a switchblade on the back of her hand and struck hard against my side, and as I felt the chilling pain of metal slicing through flesh I smiled at her.  She looked down at her hand, it was normal, nothing in it.  Just the image of a switch blade on the back, and yet her hand was covered in blood as if she had struck me with a blade.  ""No, No, No.  I didn't mean it, that's not something I can even do, I just make pictures, they're just pictures.""  she was crying now.  I patted her shoulder even as I held my side.  



""You did good, Nadia, that's exactly what I wanted to see, a hero who understands how dangerous their villains are.  You can""  I coughed then and saw some blood spatter to the floor.  ""Seat.""  I then turned towards the last of my student.  ""Nathan, hate to ask, but kind of in a bind here.  I know you don't think you can, I know what you think your power is, but it's not.  It scares people so they put you here and tried to to to stifle it.""  I dropped to my knees looking at my side, that was actually a lot of blood, and was my hand always that pale.  ""Hopefully, you know what...to...do.""  



I woke up in the infirmary of the school, one of the nurses glaring at me.  The first words I expected were a question instead I got an order.  ""Get them to Leave!""  she pointed towards the door and I saw my class jostling for position near the window to look in.  I raised my hand and waved, feeling the stiffness in my side and the pain in my ribs.



I looked at the school nurse, an incredibly young woman no older then 22, or at least that's how she appeared.  Valkyrie was actually a surprisingly good healer, to the point some said she could undo aging.  Others said she was what her name implied.  Me I didn't care, the fact she had patched me up, and only halfway judging by the pain meant she was not pleased.  ""Just let them in a couple at a time and I'll send them back to class.  Do make sure Nadia and Nathan are first please.""",6

**Sofia**

I don’t know why my parents keep bringing me to this restaurant.
Every Friday. Same table. Same fake-fancy menu. Same awful lighting that makes everything look like a hospital waiting room.

But tonight, I’m not here for the food.

I’m here for the mission.

One spider crawls slowly across my wrist. Her name’s Mara. I named her after a dream I had where she strangled a pigeon. That felt like a good omen.

She’s nervous. So am I.

“Okay,” I whisper. “You know the drill. Table seven. Kid with the chocolate cake. Drop in. Grab a crumb. No one sees you. No one dies. Cool?”

Mara wiggles her legs. I take that as a yes.

She skitters down my arm, across the floor, under a chair, straight into action.

I stay seated. Calm. Cool. Collected. Totally normal girl.

Until the screaming starts.

Some lady screeches loud enough to rattle the forks. Her chair falls backwards. A waiter slips. The cake launches through the air like a missile and splatters against the wall.

I blink.

Okay. Not the plan…

Aranhas — plural swarm out from under the table. Where the hell did the rest come from?! There’s like… twenty. Maybe more. One of them lands on a toddler’s leg.

The kid laughs.

Thank God.

I try to shrink into my seat, but my mom’s already rushing over.

“Sofia!” she whisper-yells. “Please tell me those aren’t yours.”

“Define ‘yours.’”

My dad looks like he’s about to burst a vein, but he pulls me out of the chair with way more gentleness than expected.

We leave. Early. Again…

In the car, I’m quiet. They don’t yell. Not really. They just… sigh.

But Mara climbs back up my sleeve like a little soldier returning from war. She taps the back of my neck.

High five.

I smile.

Yeah. It was a disaster.
But a fun one.

And next time?

We aim for the whole cake.




**The Teacher**

Home smells like old books and arguments that never got resolved.

I drop my bag by the door and kick off my shoes. My shoulders are sore. My brain’s worse.

“Back from the circus?” my mother calls from the kitchen.

I step in. She’s sitting at the table, peeling potatoes like she’s planning to stab them. Hair pulled tight. Wrinkles like battle scars. She doesn’t look up.

“They’re not circus kids,” I say.

“They got circus powers.”

I grab a glass, fill it with water from the tap.
“Powers don’t have to be flashy to be real.”

She scoffs. “Back in my day, we didn’t call parlor tricks ‘powers.’ If someone sparked or levitated a spoon, they joined the army. Or got locked up.”

“You also thought left-handed kids were cursed.”

“They are.”

I laugh — tired and small and sit across from her.

She eyes me. Sharp. Suspicious.

“Tell me at least one of them is useful.”

“All of them are. Just… not in the way people expect.”

She slams a potato into the bowl like it insulted her.

“Then teach them right. Before they get eaten alive.”

I don’t answer.

Instead, I think about Danny’s blood hanging in midair.
Tasha’s hands sparking like thunderclouds.
Gabe hiding raw power behind a half-smile.
Sofia’s spider raising a leg like it understood pride.
And Leo…

No. Still no file for what Leo is.

But I see him.

And that’s more than most.

I stand up…

Tomorrow, I bring gloves for Tasha. A mirror for Danny. A question for Leo. And a pocketful of candy for the girl spider …

They’re not ready.

But neither was I.

And we’re learning anyway.",150
1lvhjec,n28bgog,"I love writing—especially when I don’t have to worry about what came before or what’s coming next. Writing these kinds of scenes is genuinely relaxing for me. It makes me feel good.

I also recently found out I really enjoy crafting prompts—I didn’t know I’d like that so much.
I said it’s been hard because I had a lot of issues trying to translate my book. I got scammed, and in the end, I had to translate it myself with the limited resources I had.

She sighed and growled ""nother dumbass determined to change things at the cost of his life."" but she went out and sent my two students in.  ""Nice job both of you.""  Nadia kept her eyes above me, not looking at me at all.  Nathan was staring at my side as if trying to search for some hidden secret there.  ""I mean it.  I wasn't lying earlier.  You did good.""



Nadia looked down then and glared.  ""Good?  GOOD!?  You call Stabbing My Teacher GOOD?!  What Exactly about that is GOOD!?""



I smirked ""Nathan, you're smarter then you're given credit for, so why don't you answer that one.""



He stopped staring where the wound was then looked at me, then at Nadia, then shrugged ""I can think of several reasons.  First of all, you didn't stab him exactly.  You had no knife, no pen, no blade.  You didn't pick up some random weapon.  You made a knife image on your hand and your hand acted as a knife, that's more power then most could imagine.  Second of all, you responded to an attack on yourself by a hostile force with perhaps a bit above reasonable force but still you responded in a manner that ensured a second attack was unlikely at best.  Finally and most importantly, you attacked a man who himself admitted literally as he was bleeding out that he is a villain.  Mr. Bastard here doesn't see himself as a hero.  He isn't a mentor.  He's the villain in our story and he fully intends us harm.  He actively encouraged combat between two of us.  Humiliated one of us until she nearly broke.  Attacked you unprovoked with no guarantee of your protection.  Every action of his has villain plastered all over it.  Hell even his request of me wasn't morally sound.  He didn't ask us to call for help, he didn't hit the emergency button that I KNOW is under every teachers desk or point us to it.  No he put the responsibility for his goddamn life on a preteen who's SOLE POWER is to GIVE HIMSELF NOSEBLEEDS!  He is Exactly what he said, the villain.  However if we want to be heroes we can't kill him, we have to beat him within the rules.""



""Gold star for the blood manipulator.  So Nathan if that's your sole power how did I not die.  She hit just the right spot, the schools reaction time to emergencies is solid but I'd bet that Tim could tell you it wouldn't have been enough.""



Nathan shook his head.  ""I don't fucking know you bastard, you should be dead, all I did was stare at your wound, it should have just kept bleeding.  It didn't, and yet I didn't DO Anything.""

If you’re feeling that and people are connecting with it too, then you’ve got something real. Maybe it’s not meant to be a huge saga with dozens of chapters.

1lvxhnw,n2a6kj8,"The world had shrunk to the size of a scuff mark on the floorboards. It was dark and comma-shaped, just inside the doorway, and Leo often found his entire day snagged on it. It was the last mark Maya’s hiking boot had made on his world before she’d left it for good. His mother’s voice, thin and stretched with forced optimism, would drift up the stairs. “Leo? How was your walk?” And Leo, staring at the mark from the landing, would just say, “Fine.”

His life wasn’t fine. It was a shallow, grey basin of existence, and the only drain was a narrow path that led through the Eungella rainforest. Every Saturday, he’d walk the familiar track, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a dull anaesthetic. His destination was always the same: a colossal, moss-covered basalt boulder, perpetually cool in the shade of the canopy.

He called it the rock.

Here, the words he couldn’t say to his mother, to his friends, to the god he no longer believed in, would spill out of him in a raw, ragged whisper. He’d tell the rock about the scuff mark. He’d describe the specific shade of grey the sky had been that day. He’d confess, over and over, the crushing guilt that felt like a physical weight on his chest. He was the one who’d shown Maya the trails, who’d ignited her love for the wild places that had ultimately taken her. The rock, solid and unjudging, would absorb it all. The ritual was the only thing that made sense.

He was mid-confession one Tuesday, his voice cracking on the memory of the phone call he’d had to make, when a flicker of movement on the rock’s surface broke his trance. A rabbit, its fur the colour of dried grass, sat twitching its nose, its dark eyes fixed on him. Leo fell silent, annoyed at the intrusion.

Then the rabbit spoke, its voice a soft, rustling sound, like dry leaves skittering across stone. “The rocks are silent because the trees are listening.”

Leo’s breath hitched. He blinked, certain he was hallucinating, a new symptom of a mind worn thin by grief. When he looked again, the rabbit was gone. The forest was as it had always been, the only sound the sharp crack of a whipbird. But the silence felt different now. It felt… attentive.",45
1lvxhnw,n2a6ml9,"He went back the next week, a knot of dread and compulsion tightening in his gut. The rabbit was there, waiting. Leo’s heart hammered against his ribs.

“What did you mean?” he demanded, his voice hoarse.

The rabbit groomed a paw, unconcerned. “You’re so busy looking *at* the trees,” it whispered, “you’ve forgotten how to look *around* them. You can’t see the forest.”

The old phrase, stripped of its cliché, struck him like a physical blow. It was an accusation. He looked around, really looked, and saw not a sanctuary, but a collection of individual, silent witnesses. The tangled roots of a strangler fig, the fan-like fronds of a piccabeen palm, the smooth trunk of an Eungella satinash. He was using them, he realised with a sickening lurch. He came here every day to stare at the single, painful trees of his memory.

The forest began to change. The path he knew so well seemed to twist back on itself. A snapping twig sounded like a judgment. The wind, weaving through the canopy, seemed to whisper his name. *Leo. Leo. Guilty.*",34
1lvxhnw,n2a6o44,"Another week later, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He saw the rabbit dart away from the rock and, on pure instinct, he followed. He plunged off the path, ducking under low-hanging vines, his feet slipping on the slick, leafy ground. The rabbit was always just ahead, a fleeting glimpse of brown fur.

The woods grew thicker, darker. The air became heavy, suffocating. And then the trees began to show him things.

He stumbled past an ancient strangler fig, its woody vines wrapped around its host like a cage of thick, twisting limbs. In the gaps, he saw the image of Maya’s arm, bent at an unnatural angle. He flinched away, only to come face-to-face with a towering red cedar. Its bark was scarred and pitted, and in the shadows of the wounds, he saw the terror on his father’s face when he’d heard the news.

Each tree was a new torment. One held the sound of his mother’s weeping. Another, the hollow voice of the police officer. He was lost in a thicket of his own making, a labyrinth of every painful detail he had clung to for the past year. The listening trees were screaming now, and he was at the centre of their terrible chorus.

He tripped on an exposed root and fell to his knees. The rabbit was gone. He was alone, surrounded. A terrible, hysterical laugh bubbled in his chest. He had run from the grey numbness of his life to the sanctuary of the rock, only to be led here, into this suffocating maze. He was stuck. Stuck between the rock and this hard, hard place. He couldn't see a path. He couldn't see the sky. He could only see the trees.

“I’m sorry!” The words ripped from his throat, a raw, animal sound. He wasn’t talking to the rock anymore. He was screaming at the entire, suffocating forest. “I’m so sorry, Maya! It was my fault! It was all my fault!”",40
1lvxhnw,n2a6pfg,"He collapsed onto the damp earth, the carefully constructed dam of his composure shattering into a million pieces. He wept until his throat was raw and his body was empty, the tears soaking the soil beneath him. He confessed everything, not just the guilt, but the love, the bottomless, aching chasm of how much he missed her.

He didn't know how long he lay there. When he finally pushed himself up, the silence had returned. But it was a different silence. It was clean. Empty. Peaceful. The trees were just trees again. The light, filtering through the leaves, was just light. He looked up and, through a break in the canopy, saw the pale blue of the late afternoon sky. He wasn't lost. The way back was right there.

That evening, there was a soft knock on his bedroom door. It was his mother. She stood in the doorway, her face etched with the familiar worry, braced for the usual wall of silence. “How was your day, Leo?” she asked. He looked at a framed photo on his bookshelf—the two of them, grinning, squinting in the sun on a beach trip years ago. He saw her life, not her death. “It was… hard,” he said, the honesty a strange relief. “But I think it’s going to be okay.”

After she left, a tentative, hopeful smile gracing her lips, he stood in the quiet hallway. The house felt different. Less like a tomb, more like a home waiting to breathe again. His gaze fell on a white-painted door at the end of the hall. Maya’s room. A place he hadn't entered in a year, a shrine he couldn't bear to look at.

His hand trembled as he reached for the cool brass knob. The latch clicked, a sound impossibly loud in the silence. He pushed the door open.

The air was still, thick with the faint scent of her perfume and dusty sunlight. Everything was exactly as she had left it. A poster of her favourite band on the wall, a stack of books on her nightstand, a jumper slung over a chair. His eyes went to the bed. Propped against the pillows, its button eyes seeming to watch him, was a small, well-loved stuffed rabbit. Its fur, worn smooth in patches, was the colour of dried grass.

Leo walked slowly into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. He picked up the rabbit. He stared at the toy, its button eyes holding a silent, steady gaze. A connection sparked, not a thought, but a quiet click of understanding deep in his mind. He drew the small creature to his chest, and the silence of the room was no longer heavy, but calm.

For the first time in a year, he saw the forest.",47
1lw16rd,n2avx8o,"He struck his sword into the Earth's crust, both his fists clenched around the hilt. The knight's helmet gleamed, his metal plates gaining a gleam below the full moon's gaze, the dents from time evident.

“I understand you have sworn an oath to protect this castle and its king, and I respect that. But please see the truth in my eyes when I plead with you: leave. Just leave. Right now. Trust me.”

""I'm afraid I can not."" His deep, muffled voice rattled through her chest.

""You don't get it."" The woman pointed away. ""They are coming. A fate worse than death. I have seen their ways, their treachery, the lengths they go to."" Her voice trembled, eyes burned with the visions of the damned. ""They won't kill you...""

""But the oath has been taken."" The knight remained, unwavering. ""Also, I'm glad you are still alive, miss.""

The woman's brows raised as she looked up to see into his helmet. She reached out, slightly lifting the rustic metal only to flinch back in horror, dropping the mask. ""You look terrible.""

""As one should for failing to protect his king."" The knight sterned. ""But the castle still stands.""

Even in death, the oath chains them to the living.

""You won't win."" The princess ran her fingers through his worn-out armor. ""You will be enslaved for as long as they wish.""

""So be it--""

""He wouldn't want that!"" She retorted. ""Grandpa would never allow this to happen. I know he wouldn't. So please."" She choked. ""Let me send off the last of his men.""

""We are not the last of his men."" The immortal dropped to his knee, his head low before her. ""You still roam the earth, carrying his blood.""

The castle spoke with a thunderclap echo, a thousand swords struck the earth's crust. There were more warriors here. More than she ever wanted to see.

""You will not win."" The princess heeded again. ""This castle will fall.""

""Then we shall fall with it."" With his sword to his side, he pleaded. ""Send us off in glory. Those are our final wishes.""

There was hesitation, a lingering doubt in the back of her mind. However, her hand raised nonetheless, as if guided by the spirit that once thrived in these walls.

A long, deafening silence later, she strode towards the broken throne.",15

""I know, young lady.

""THEN?!  
WHY PROTECT THEM?!"" the paladin of the group roars at me.  
""Bound by oath to this family I am, and I shall keep to it."" I say.  
They sigh.

  
""Even if it to protect someone so vile?

I nod.  
""I am aware. I saved those I could, and prayed for those I couldn't."" I say.  
They try to say something, but I interrupt them by slamming my sword into the floor.  
""No need to continue trying to convince me.

I bowed slightly.

""Mom! She will be my plaything!"" he says.  
The Hero opened his eyes.

This was all Eltheri could do now. She felt so helpless, holding on to one of the last pieces of her beloved while standing on his grave.

""Mother."" The aging woman muttered.

Elitheri smiled, her beautiful, ethereal features untouched by time, ""Yes, my little ember?""

""You need to go find a nice elf... Father wouldn't want this for you. Sitting in that cottage all alone.""

Elitheri tried so hard not to cry, ""I can't Oranetha... I gave my heart to your father. When he went to see the death goddess, it died with him.""

Oranetha groaned, ""Oh mother, you and those pure elven ideas about love. They were built on the idea of eternity. Growing old, being mortal... it makes you understand how beautiful life can be and how important it is to seek it out. Father loved you, mother... so much.

Elitheri finally broke, ""Ember... my baby... this isn't fair... why? Why did I have to fall in love with a human!? Why didn't I listen to my elders!""

Oranetha smiled, ""Because you were a rebellious 40 year old and Papa was a sweet man that worshipped the air you breathe. You and I both know you don't regret your time with him one bit. Besides, you still have us.""

Eltheri snapped, ""But for how much longer!? Only three centuries and you..."" She stopped herself, looking away.

Oranetha hugged her mother, ""I'm getting older, I know. but you still have another 300 years with me and with my siblings.""

The elf clutched her daughter tight, ""300 years is so little time to have my babies... and so long to be without my love.""

""Well, grandfather always did tell you to stay away from humans.""

""I thought he meant that they were dangerous... I had no idea that this... heart shattering reality would be my future.""

Two half-elven, middle-aged men approached. The dark-haired one looked hesitant. He was the son who looked the most like his father, ""Mother, the others are waiting. Deria is here with her daughter and grandchildren.""

Eltheri tried to wipe the tears away, but she looked up at Farin and nearly broke again, ""I'm sorry, darlings... I'm coming. I just... I wanted to speak with your father for a while.

1lvloqh,n296iqb,"Feri dismounted his horse and walked into the tavern.

Little had changed in three hundred years, but what had changed was obvious to him.

The barkeep that had laughed and given them drinks to celebrate their successful quests... and their wedding, he'd been dead for a very long time. His great great great great granddaughter ran it now. She was a lot like the old barkeep, though she didn't know it.

Feri sat at the bar and raised a hand. The barkeep comes over, her powerful arms clutching 5 ales each, ""What'll ye be havin' elfy?""

""Two rum if you've got it.""

She barks a laugh, ""Wait right there, forest boy, Astrid's got the good stuff over on the other end.""

He nods, and she walks away.

He pulled out a simple cloak clasp and stared at it. It was beautiful... very worn, dented, but beautiful. He looked at his left hand to gaze at the two wedding bands that rested on his ring finger.

He'd had to have Deron's resized... the big human had bear paws instead of hands. Feri's hands would disappear into them, and how nice that felt on a cold night. His hands suddenly felt so cold.

Feri shook his head, *""Don't dwell on it. You're here to celebrate your anniversary. Not wallow and pine like some besotted farm girl.""*

The barkeep returned with two mugs of rum and ice, ""Here ya go, elfy. That's 8 silver for the pair.""

He silently opens his coin purse and pulls out a gold coin, ""Keep the change. I used to be friends with one of your grandfathers three centuries back. It's good to see a piece of my old friend still around.""

She blinked in shock, ""Oh!... OH! Ya must be Feri! Me dad told me about you, said you came every year! Haven't seen ya in a while.""

Feri gave her a weak smile, ""I had a... rough time coming here for a little while. Something opened some old wounds.""

Her faced dropped, ""That's a shame, though you bein' an elf. I'm sure that shit only piles on after a while.""


He nods, ""Yeah... but this one was my fault, I suppose.""

""Oh? I got time, if you got the gab.""

Feri thought about it for a moment before sighing, ""Elves are taught from a young age to stay away from the other races. That trying to live in their world only gets us hurt. I didn't understand it then... nor did I care. Elven cities are very stuffy, and proper. I never did well in that life. I wanted to see the world so... I left. I came to this very tavern to meet some people, start making friends, taking jobs."" Feri turns and points to a dark corner by a fireplace with a tiny booth, ""That booth is where I was sitting when he walked into my life. If I'd know  then what I know now... I might have saved myself the trouble and stayed away.""

 The elf took a long pull of his rum before continuing, 

""His name was Deron. This huge bear sized human barbarian. He came right up to me and told me he liked my ears and demanded to know why I didn't wear earrings. He... he was like that, so very friendly and genuinely warm. He sat in that tiny booth with me for hours, and we just... talked. About everything. We became fast friends and within a year... lovers. We got married at three years right in this damn bar... your great something grandpa poured us drinks and got everyone celebrating with us. Our life together was... incredible. We saw the world, bested foes, made friends. One day, I watched him get out of our bedroll, and I realized something. He was aging. His hair had begun to gray at the temples, there were lines on his face I hadn't noticed, and he groaned every time he got up in the morning. My husband... my Deron was getting old. I still remember when he sat me down to talk about buying a cottage in the woods and retiring. He'd tried to convince me to keep traveling without him. He didn't want to hold me back, but I knew our time together was getting shorter. So I set down my sword and bow and retired with him. We had another twenty years in that cottage, and Gods we were happy. Well, I know he was. I'd slip out of the house at night sometimes to go cry my heartbreak out in the forest. I was watching my soul wither in front of me, and I couldn't stop it. He died in his sleep, holding me. It took me hours to have the strength to get up. I knew that once I did, he'd never hold me again. I buried him... under the tree we'd planted when we bought the cottage. It was fairly big by then... nowadays its roots completely cover his grave. I still live in that cottage, but I don't get out much anymore. Not since my bloody father came to ""collect me from my foolishness"". He tried to drag me back to Æriheil and nearly felled that tree doing it. That was about thirty years ago. I was too nervous to leave for a while, worried some careless woodsman would chop it down in my absence.""

The barkeep was speechless. How does one even respond to something like that?

She managed to ask, ""Is that why yer elders told ya ta stay away from humans?""

Feri finally looked back up at her and smiled sadly, ""I don't know. I never went back. I can't tell if they looked down on humans or if they knew the consequences of loving one... regardless, I wouldn't change a thing.

#################

Feri finally returned home, a little drunk and a little exhausted. It had felt good to talk to her, to remember the love and laughter and not just the heartbreak.

He stumbled off of his horse and sat under the tree, nestling himself into the huge roots. He pulled out the small bottle of rum she'd sent home with him and raised a toast towards the moon, ""Happy anniversary, you big stupid lumox. I love you.""

He took a swig and dumped the rest right about where the roots covered the centuries old grave.",88
1lvloqh,n2dba9n,"The once-jagged rocks of the cairn were now smoothed over and covered with moss. Maurice bowed his head, placing a handful of lilies at its base.

""They don't understand, Mirri."" He said with a sigh. ""They think I've been grieving. Trying to use me as an example.""

Maurice sat down on the wet earth, and could feel the dampness through his trousers. He brushed a thread of hair behind his tall pointed ear. ""In truth I've been floating. I carried you up to heaven and it took me 300 years to come back to earth."" 

He pulled out a stick of incense and propped it between the rocks. With a snap of his fingers he had it lit, and smoke was drifting lazily through the fading morning fog. ""I'm sorry, Mirri. I'm sorry I waited so long, when I promised you I wouldn't. Back home, they wait years for excitement. For romance. For adventure. They'll take a drop of joy and stretch it for a century rather than seek out more.""

He took a sip from his canteen. ""Well, you gave me more than a drop. Our time together was full of more joy than the millennia before it. I'm done sitting still. I'm done waiting... I'm leaving, Mirriam. I might not be back to visit for a long while."" Saying it out loud released a tear from his eye. ""I'm seeking out the humans again. To help them. To learn from them. And if I fall in love again..."" He wiped the tears from his face. ""Just know that I'll never forget you.""",11
1lvloqh,n29xcfw,"These guys are actually knockoffs of characters from my novel. In my book, though, elves age pretty similarly to humans only getting an extra 20 years on average.

In that one, the couple are master swordsmen who are both an adorable couple and mentors to the main cast.

The human partner was originally going to die before the main story, but I loved him too much, and kept him in.

1lvjfa5,n27a2f7,"Prince Hathor was a man of peculiar tastes. While his father and brothers had been satisfied with their princesses, their ladies, and their maidens, he'd been bored out of his mind.

He'd listen to the young ladies of court try to flirt with him, batting their lashes in the hopes of a royal wedding. He wasn't some foolish sod that thought women were all innocent, dainty blossoms. Of course not, it's just that they seemed to think that was what he wanted. The other problem was that they all sucked up to him, desperate for approval from the next king. Some genuinely hoping for fairy tale love, others were clever, ambitious ladies hoping to be queen someday.

Regardless, he had terrible luck. He thought he'd finally gotten his chance when the new Grand Commander had arrived with his daughter, a tall valkyrie of a woman with stern features. FINALLY, he'd thought, a woman that will challenge me. But she too ended up playing the doe-eyed maiden, likely at the behest of her father. Hathor had burst out of the interview room in pure frustration.

He didn't want an ornament, or a viper, a servant, or a ""dutiful bride"".

He wanted an equal. He wanted a woman that would challenge him, tell him he's wrong, not beg for approval because of his title.

Then, it finally happened. The great sorceress Rin Serzell came to court. She was not there to join court drama, she was there to demand her land not be trespassed. The king, threatened by her power, had sent the court mage and some soldiers to push her out. Most had returned, some had quit, refusing to return and risk being ordered to face Rin Serzell again.

Gods was she stunning, in a terrifying, awe striking way. She wore layers of mage robes, daggers, and potions hanging from a belt at her waist. Midnight black waves contained in a thick braid that went past her waist. Trinkets, and baubles were woven in, clearly more for function than appearance, though Hathor thought they looked like stars in her night sky hair.

Mid-rant she pointed a finger at him, ""AND YOU! Why are you staring at me!?""

Hathor was taken aback. She was the first person to ever raise their voice to him. He grinned dreamily, ""Forgive me, sorceress, but you have enchanted me.""

""Are you serious!? I come here to demand not to be hassled and you have the *nerve*"" she pointed her staff at him, ""To flirt with me like some noble's brat?""

Hathor was officially in love, ""I didn't expect to Sorceress, but your fire is far brighter and more beautiful than any I've ever seen.""

Rin roared out, and unleashed a wave of force from her staff.

The next thing he knew, Hathor was sitting in rubble, in the hallway behind the throne room.

""I need to marry that woman!"" Hathor declared as he climbed out of the pile of former wall.

An advisor offered a hand and assisted him, ""But, my prince, she quite literally *just* used magic and blasted you through a wall!""

""I know!...what a woman."" The advisor face palmed as the prince ran back through the him shaped hole in the wall.

Rin stared at him, dumbfounded, not even angry at this point, ""By the Gods, did your wetnurse drop you as babe?... Repeatedly?""

Hathor laughed, ""Perhaps, it would explain my peculiar tastes, I suppose."" He turned to his father, ""Please, don't send anymore soldiers. Sorceress Serzell has never had the faintest interest in stealing thrones. Something tells me that if she wanted one, she'd already have one!""

Hathor bowed deeply, ""I know we didn't exactly meet under ideal circumstances, Sorceress, but you are truly a unique woman, and I would never forgive myself if I didn't at least ask... would you allow me to court you?""

""Court...me. You, the crowned prince, wish to court... me. The hermit Sorceress, that just sent you flying through a wall?""

""Yes, you're absolutely magnificent.""

Rin looked to the advisor, ""How hard did I actually hit him?""

The man shrugs nervously, ""You are the first woman to enchant Prince Hathor so completely. He has very... particular tastes.""

She looks down at him again, ""Are your tastes ""women trying to kill you""?""

""Not quite, I love your temper, your honesty, your fearlessness. I wish to learn more about the woman that didn't hesitate to point a staff at me.""

Rin blinked, before sighing, ""Fine. You can try Prince, but I guarantee nothing.""

He smiled, ""You have already made me happier than you could ever dream.""


10 YEARS LATER

Hathor gave up his title. He had no desire to be king in the first place, so when Rin had said she was returning to her keep, he threw that crown away and followed her.

He looked down at the ring on his finger and smiled. It was a trade well worth making.

""HATHOR! COME GET YOUR DAUGHTERS BEFORE I DROP BLOODWART EXTRACT ON THEIR HEADS!""

He laughed, ""Coming Fireflower!""

When he entered Rin's lab, he found their twin girls, Seri and Fira, running about, playing adventurer. Seri trying to be a mighty sorceress like her mother and Fira wearing a pot on her head and wielding a broom handle.

Rin turned from her work, grouchy but not truly angry, ""Please, come get these hooligans out of my lab before they get hurt.""

Seri pouted, ""But mama...""

Hathor laughed, ""Now Spark, your mother is very busy with some very dangerous ingredients. She just doesn't want you to get hurt.""

Fira raised her ""sword"", ""I am the mighty hero Fira of Wyrmseth! I fear nothing.""

Rin groans, pinching the bridge of her nose, ""Of course she doesn't. Damn it Hathor...""

He wraps an arm around her and kisses her temple, ""You know you love this.""

She sighs and smiles wryly before kissing his cheek, ""Somehow I do, now please, my dear addled prince, take the twins *outside* to play.""

""Of course, my Fireflower.""",199
1lvjfa5,n2duxb8,"He was a bit full of himself. Not obnoxiously arrogant like most of the royal family, but I guess a prince cannot help who the people were that raised him. All that aside he was still cute, with that infectious smile and those perfect goddamned teeth. I kinda liked him despite those flaws, but I definitely wasn't gonna let him know that – at least not yet.

“Captain Macintosh, care for a round of sparring?” The prince asked, his brow heavy with sweat. 

He punched a heavy bag hanging from the ceiling, the muffled thud wafting dust and chalk into the air around it. His was a charming offer to say the least, but I knew he couldn't handle the smoke.

“I'm sorry your highness, there are strict protocols against that,” I rebuffed with a straight face. I didn't want to tell him I might accidentally knock him into next week. Then again, maybe I should have.

“Ah, c’mon Cap, I'll go easy on you. I promise.”

I froze. A boyish confidence oozed from his smirk as he knew he'd gotten my attention. It was hard enough being the only woman in the Kingsmen, and he knew I was insecure about it.

“Allright,” I said. “One round.”

“Allright!” His damned confidence beamed as he struck the bag once more. “One round but let's make things interesting. If I win, you must accompany me to the midsummer ball.”

“I'm already on the roster as you lead bodyguard–” I replied before he cut me off.

“As malady, not as hired muscle.”

My heart fluttered for a moment. As much as I hated to admit it, the prospect wasn't all that appalling. Like I said, he was quite charming. Nevertheless, I'd made something of myself on my own, despite the disadvantage I'd been born into. I surely didn't need a man to elevate my status in the kingdom.

“And if I win?”

“I'll see to it you, umm – actually I hadn't considered that possibility, really. I said I'd go easy on you, I didn't say I'd let you win.”

“Okay, how about if I win, you stop hitting on me, and just let me do my damned job once and a while without feeling like a damned diversity hire.”

“Is that why you think we made you Captain of the Guard – a diversity hire?”

I crossed my chest, the frosted look upon my face his only answer.

“Very well – if you should win, I shall cease my advances for your affections and regard you as just another of the castle's man-at-arms.”

Rolling my eyes I offered my hand in agreement. “Deal – but I shall require a raise regardless of outcome, if these terms are to be agreeable.”

The prince didn't hesitate to grasp my palm. “Deal.”

An hour later, we found ourselves in the boxing ring of the stuffy castle gym. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, their Ye’ Old Ale plastic shrouds covered with dust and faded with age. All around, off duty knights in sweatpants and tank tops cheered the ringing bell, and the prince and I circled round each other.

“Well c'mon now, are we gonna fight, or just dance,” the prince chastised with a smirk.

He made the first jab, a glancing blow I blocked with my gloves. Seeing my opening, I reared back and released a right hook into his exposed flank.

“Jesus Christ!” he exclaimed. “Okay, if that's how you want to play this!”

I held back as we traded blows. The match was a rapid crescendo of parries and thrusts, hooks and jabs. The roar of the cheering knights grew ever louder as neither the prince nor I were willing to yield. He was beginning to tire as the first round neared its end.

In the final seconds he landed a punch  to my left ear. Disoriented – and perhaps by primitive instinct – I let down my facade for a moment, and the prince went flying out of the ring. I panicked when he crashed through the wall, my concealed strength now revealed to all who had witnessed the fight.

Without a word I fled the ring. Bursting into the courtyard beyond, I sprinted for the outer walls and the busy metropolitan beyond. Gasping, I came to a halt in the grand centre park, the towers of steel kept at bay by a remnant of wilderness contained within the modern city.

Chest heaving, I rested with my hands against my knees. A thousand possibilities raced through my mind; demotion, banishment, execution. It doesn't bode well on a resume when you knock the boss's son through several layers of lath and plaster. Lost in those swirling images of my inevitable fates, I failed to notice the steel-clad hoof beats rapidly approaching.

“Captain Macintosh!” The price called from atop his horse.

Looking up in amazement, I watched the price dismount his steed and hobble towards me. When he was a few feet away he dropped to one knee and reached for me. Instead of anger, I saw a profound respect in his eyes.

“Angela please…” he begged. “Please excuse my arrogance. I did not think my gambit for your affection would end in such disaster.”

I said nothing, unable to fathom his motivations.

“I-I am truly sorry.”

“Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you chose such foolishness…”

“Is there any way you could forgive me?”

I thought for a moment. “You can pick me up at eight o'clock sharp – Not a moment later, we don't want to be late for the midsummer ball.”

We both smiled, knowing it was the beginning of something that would last the rest of our lives.",7

The smith jumped, turning to the deadly creature. ""Are...are you sure? It's a lot of responsibility, and...and it's more a...Human - ""

The Wyvern laughed ""anything - *anything* is better than guarding a bunch or worthless...jewlery! And trinkets, that I can't even wear!""

""Um..."" said the smith, looking around his shop clad in bricks and steel, ""I mean..."" *she's small, but still larger than a Human...* ""don't you want to wait, or - ""

""...no arms?""

She shook her head, ""that's for..."" she sighed ""Dragons...and Drakes...""

""Oh...""

""Yeah...""

""Can you grip a weapon?"" asked the Smith, scratching his head. ""Or...perhaps...do you have a god you can - ""

""I do not serve higher powers, we draconic *are* the higher powers!"" she scoffed, ""...forced to sit around gold coins I can't even spend...""

""Oh...okay, um..."" the smith took a breath ""and...do you want...""

""Armor! And weapons!""

""Oh...okay, and...how would you use the weapon?""

The Wyvern laughed, ""I'll figure it out! I - I think, right?""

""S - swords take years - *years* to train for a Human, and...I mean, if you had arms...""

The Wyvern looked to the floor.

""Wh..."" the Smith noticed tears welling in the Wyvern's eyes. ""No! If...maybe you don't *need*  weapon, or...""

""No..."" she replied, looking back up ""...I wanted to use a sword, but...you're right...""

The Smith turned to his weapon, seeing the once vibrant red a now dull gray. ""Oh, blast...""

The wyvern put her wing between the smith and sword, and breathed a burst of blue-hot flames.

""Woah...""

""Yeah, small drag...wyverns have hotter flames. Least I can do, if I can't...""

There was a pause, until the Smith asked ""...if you can't be a knight...maybe help me, here? And...and support the knights instead?""

""Really?"" she asked.

""You wouldn't have to guard gold, and maybe after some time, we could figure something out?""

""Deal!"" she proclaimed excitedly.

*8 years later*

""Are you sure?"" asked the Smith, ""I can put the armor back on - ""

""I promise it's fine!"" the Wyvern replied, clad in plate. ""I can fly with it on, and my scales already protect me so much. We'll be fine.""

The smith took a breath, then smiled ""okay...have fun.""

""I will! READY!"" She called to the other knights, who ran to the Wyvern. She lie flat on the ground, as all four knights clambered on.

""We're good!"" said a knight. The Wyvern stood, then jumped, flying. ""None of us fell! Let's go!""

The wyvern took one last look at the Smith, then flew away on the newest quest to find the Grand Artifacts of the World.",57

1lvkb4i,n27xwf4,"The room smelled of freshly burned parchment, rosemary, and unmistakeable excitement. Terrance watched with awe as his new master delicately drip fed a dark liquid concoction from a pipette into a suspended flask. Here it began to heat up, spurred by a flame. Terrance remarked how it was like an arcane bunsen burner.



""Now we just wait a few more minutes,"" the old wizard croaked out. His robes were purple, embossed with moons and stars, as a wizard's garb should be. Terrance had called him ""pal"" mostly, but to others he went by Felix. Throughout his delicate work, Felix didn't allow his gaze to wander, even with the rude interruption.



""Aha!"" The door to the alchemical workshop burst open. In strode a pair of adventurers. One dressed head to toe in plate and mail, the bright sheen creating a dancing effect from the flames. The warrior, quite poorly, attempted to hide the toll ascending the several dozen steps up to the chamber had taken in such overweighed gear. His partner came adorned with, so Terrance thought, a disappointingly plain mage robe. No night sky imagery, lace, or even a simple frilled cuff on the maroon fabric. Still the would-be wizard looked fairly more composed than her accompaniment.

This is a trap, has to be.

“The old man of the north is a tyrant , a force of nature, he commands an army of the dead and I have been chosen to end his villainous tyranny  “

“Kid” Sir Lance  sighed , his expressions hidden by his mask all but evident 

“Imagine you are a the newly crowned king of a kingdom which was a product of a conquest led by your dad”

Krill chanted the incantation 

“Incendio , INSIDIOUS”

And blew . A ball of fire erupted from his mouth and rapidly made its way towards lance. Scorching , blinding pure energy. It seared the ground below as it hurtled towards its target. 

Lance swatted the ball away into the sky with a flourish . His face looking more exasperated than annoyed 

“Kid “ Lance sighed “Please listen to what I’m trying to say”

Lance removed his mask to reveal  a bespectacled face  with a goatee. He was also bald

“You have what we call in the business Stockholm Syndrome “

Lance composed himself 

“Imagine you are a the newly crowned king of a kingdom which was a product of a conquest led by your dad and a certain wizard your kingdom , a powerful wizard , a healer , a former advisor of the old guard begins to get popular with the people”

Krill lunged with his sword , Lance easily sidestepped and had his dagger out 

“You start spreading rumours , make any excuse possible to paint him as a world ending threat “

Lance deflected a slash with his dagger as the force of the blows rang across the isolated woods. The trees all but blocked out the sun and shrouded them both in shade 

“And sic your army on him “

“SHUT UP, SHUT UP , SHUT UP”

“ Forbidden magic” Lance whispered 

“ pulling an prepubescent kid from Dimension 5 and infusing him with potent ancient magic “

Krill dropped his sword .

“ So I’m not the chosen one ?”

“No kid “ Lance shook his head

1lvkb4i,n2agli8,"""You mean Bartholomew?"" I ask as I gesture to the 'evil wizard' in question. A humble looking man, whose skin bore the marks of one who worked the fields for most of their lives. 

""He's a bit eccentric in his.... clothing choice..."" I grumble as I glance at today's fashion statement. Chartreuse robes with a magenta undershirt, enchanted with moving magical shapes of all sizes and colors, classic Bart. ""...but I can assure you that he is neither evil, nor a wizard.""

""That's not what I meant, the church sent me to kill the evil wizard that lives out here. The people have spoken of the Notorious BIG. Bartholomew Indred Garcia, I am to apprehend you and..."" I cut off this starry eyed adventurer and shift my focus to Bartholomew.

""Bart, that was a joke, please don't tell me that you've been going to the people and claiming to be the Notorious BIG? Biggie would kill me if he was isekai'd to this universe."" I say jokingly, yet sternly.

""Sorry mam, I thought it sounded really... \~cool\~ as you would say"" Bart says, prodding at me. ""What's my crime mr.... what was your name again?"" Bart, redirecting his attention to the large protagonist shaped object blocking the airflow of our front doorway.

""Uhhhh.... You can call me Mr. Tanaka, but my friends call me Taro..."" the man mutters out.

""Well you see Mr. Taro, I am mighty interested in what actions I did that angered the church so much."" Bart stated.

""They told me you were a wanted criminal and that it was my destiny to apprehend you. To slay you if necessary. That you caused our universe's to drastically shift for the worse. Your actions have led to the lost of countless lives."" Tanaka said, clearly annoyed, as he rested his hand on the hilt of his sword. 

There was a loud clanging sound as Tanaka's scabbard and belt fell to the floor.

""I would be careful with that sword, Mr. Taro, it would be unfortunate if an accident were to take place."" Bart spoke playfully and laughed for a minute while Tanaka scrambled to get his weapon unsheathed and ready. Bart's tone shifted to a dark one I was unfamiliar with. ""I would also be careful with making assumptions. Especially of those who willingly kidnap people from other dimensions to solve their problems for them. I would wager that magically messing with time like that would have serious repercussions on a dimension's fate, would you not agree Taro?"" Bart leaned forward until Tanaka's blade was resting against his chin. ""On the other hand, considering that the church strictly rules over this entire continent... one could assume that anyone defiantly surviving against such a regime's strongest warriors might not be an easy opponent?"" Bart leaned further on the blade until it began to draw a little bit of blood. 

Tanaka, clearly rattled, slowly withdrew his blade. He sheathed it carefully yet quickly. As he reattached it to his belt and his belt to his armor, Bartholomew spoke again. 

""Tell your people that I have adopted their magical prodigy. They may have labelled her a witch and caster her out to die like all of the others that didn't fit their criteria of 'Hero' but she has a strong will to survive"" He smiled at me with a warm glow. That snaggle-toothed grin was the core reason behind my survival this last decade. 

""Ask them where they keep the bodies of anybody that comes over that isn't labelled a 'hero' for I certainly have never seen any of them treated respectfully on their arrival, nor on their passing."" Bart said sternly. ""If you have the courage to confront someone, start there. Otherwise I recommend you flee this nation as fast as possible. Send them a letter saying you saw me escape on a boat and are trying to apprehend me."" Bart calmly states as he helps Tanaka finish adjusting his belt. ""Or if you're really a hero, stand up for what's right and help us put an end to this madness.""  

""Alone, we struggle to survive... but together we may stand a chance. What say you Mr. Tanaka?"" Bart asks as he extends his hand out for a warm handshake.",17

""And what would they be?"" Felix stirred his mixed with a wave of a finger.



""The cursing of that poor woman, Beth"".



""She was a crazed Werewolf before we found her. We managed to change her condition to a more manageable, Were-Golden-Retriever"".



""And what about the dockhands from the port? They've been riddled with some ailment ever since your visit. None of them can work the docks or speak clearly. Some curse that.""



""I showed them how one might brew ales, or distill them to whisky!"" Felix sounded rather proud at that one.



""Nonsense, are you going to stand by, Terrance. While your master concocts such... lies?""



""Well. You see."" Terrance fidgeted his hands. Even in this new world, he'd not quite managed to learn comfort in confrontations. He wished he could Isekai his therapist here too. Perhaps he'd find someone down at the tavern to stand in. He pushed the thoughts away. ""He's not lying.""



""I thought you were better than this Terrance. But I see the old wicked wizard has been teaching you more than just the dark arts."" She lifted her hand and a ball of azure energy crackled to life. ""Cease your evil concocting, or face our justice!""



""Guys can we..."" Terrance sighed as the warrior unsheathed a steel longsword. ""That's a bit of a dramatic reaction to the brewing of herbs..."" He placed a hand to his forehead in grimace. ""Can we at least spare the fighting until after we've had a mug each?"" It had taken Terrance days to get Felix to agree on sharing his special tea recipe. He couldn't wait to bring it back to the village with him. Not only did it have various stat bonuses, it was \*delicious\*.



""You're making tea?"" The warrior finally had gotten over his exerted silence, perhaps invigorated through his astonishment. ""You're making tea with an evil wizard?""



""Can you just leave off the evil descriptor for a moment? Its callous and insulting."" Felix finally looked up from his flask. ""Besides the tea's ready. It will bring you back to full fitness, I promise.""



The pair of intruders looked between the wizard and the apprentice. Terrance only nodded in earnest encouragement.",58
1lvj12n,n27xh2l,"You throw your battered Jansport into the rusty air duct ahead of you, the only opening in the cracked brick façade. Soon you're crawling on your belly, deeper and deeper into the heavenly dark, smells of sweet rot and sawdust--and now, there's a sound up ahead. A fellow explorer, just around the ductwork's bend.

""Hullo?"" you call. *Hullo* sounds cooler than *hello.* You adopted this preference when you were twelve. ""Anybody there?""

The stranger stops. You can just barely see their shadow on the sheet metal, a crack letting in light. ""Benjy?""

Your breath catches.

""Benjy?"" they call again. ""Is that you?""

""Nana?""

You hurry forward, scuffing, scraping your way over the duct's corroded seams, and soon you're face to face with her, this woman who's been gone for forty years. She smiles. ""My, how you've grown!"" she says. ""Soon you won't be able to fit in here!""

You try to hug her, but honestly, this space is not conducive for hugging. A fist-bump will have to suffice--and besides, didn't you teach her how to fist-bump long ago? She still smells like Christmas candles. She's wearing her blue cardigan.

""Nana! I didn't know you liked urban exploring!""

Her laughter echoes all around you. ""That's what you call this?"" she says. ""There's a name for everything, I suppose. Where you headed?""

You shrug. ""I was just looking around,"" you reply.

She nods toward your headgear. ""What's this doodad upstairs?"" She always referred to people's heads as their *upstairs.*

""That's called a GoPro,"" you explain. ""It captures video.""

""A name for everything,"" she says again, in quiet wonderment.

Surrounded by so much sheet metal, you recall the cookie tins she used for sewing supplies. ""Say, Nana, do you know what this building was used for?""

She thinks. ""Good question,"" she says. ""What do you think it was used for?""

You have no idea but can smell the faint warmth of cookies through the metal--the breath of a factory churning back to life. You close your eyes and imagine. ""I don't know,"" you say. ""How far do these vents go?""

""Another good question,"" she says. ""You've got a lot upstairs. How far would you like them to go?""

""Well, not too much farther, honestly. I feel like I've been in here awhile, crawling, and it would be nice to stretch out and rest a bit."" Your eyes are still closed. It's easier to focus on the smell that way. ""Can we maybe explore another part of the building?""

No response.

""Nana?""

Her fingers press your forehead. You open your eyes just in time to catch her slipping around the corner, her floral skirt a battle flag, church shoes surprisingly quiet over the metal, and now you're giving chase--wild, reckless, your laughter the only sound. She always loved playing tag.

1lvj12n,n281pzf,"I remember seeing the Bible once. It had been lying in a pile of rubble in the underground ruins of what was left of New York. 

Most of the remaining copies had been burned or buried hundreds of years before. The one I had found was covered in dust and tattered from debris, but there was something mystical about holding its leather bindings and flipping through its remaining pages. I had only seen a handful of books within my lifetime, but there was something different about this one. I never took relics from the places I explored, but this one had called to me more than usual. 

I hadn’t been able to read much of it, but I was reminded of the legends of heaven and hell; something I hadn’t given much thought to ever since I was a child. Within scattered bits of memories, I could faintly recall my late brother’s voice, recounting the narrations of the times of yore. He had once told me how an entire ocean of people believed heaven was a paradise, with streets of gold and gates of pearl. A lavish gift from their invisible maker in exchange for dedicating their lives to his undeniable greatness. 

I was convinced at the time that my ancestors were deranged. But after holding that book in my hands, I felt a reluctant trace of understanding.  

These were the memories that flooded my consciousness the second my vision bloomed into a sight I never imagined I would see. Two pillars loomed before me, so large and so magnificent, my eyes could not quite make out where they ended before fading into the sky above me. They stood on either side of a massive gate that was equally as breathtaking, glistening faintly with a translucent iridescence that turned different hues in the flittering light. 

The sight of it was all too much to take in at once. I looked around me, realizing I had no memory of when or how I had arrived at this place. The land around me was barren, with a horizon that lay flat and empty in every direction. The sky was dark and grey, but opened into a blinding light as my eyes wound their way back to the gates. Beyond the gates, the world was a bright white, giving the illusion of a portal to another world. I had never once believed such a place could exist, but as I stood before it, there was no doubt in my mind: 

*This is heaven.*  

My feet slowly began to move, almost on their own accord, pulling me toward the gates. How long I walked, I could not say, as the presence of time seemed lost and long forgotten. As I drew nearer, I became more and more aware of a strange energy. The gates looked old and worn. The pillars were scarred with cracks and craters, covered at the base in a thick sleeve of vines that wound their way up an impressive distance. The familiar breath of abandon was washing over me. It was a feeling I had welcomed my entire life; a feeling that had kept me going in a world of dread.

Most would see the sight of heaven abandoned as a cruel omen, but it was a sight I embraced eagerly. 

As the memories of my life flipped through my mind like a filoscope, I recalled the conversation with my brother once again: 

“Heaven and Hell are one and the same,” he had said. “They are a mirror; a reflection. What you find on the other side will depend on what kind of life you lived.”

We had been sitting on the bank of a dried up riverbed, using the cover of an old bridge to shield us from the sun. We hadn’t found food in several days and were trying to ignore the ache in our stomachs with frivolous conversation. 

I digested his words for a moment, wondering what that would mean for me.

“Maybe you’ll find the greatest set of ruins the world has ever seen,” he added. I knew he was joking, but that thought didn’t bother me.  

“I hope I find a new beginning,” I replied. As much as I enjoyed exploring ruins when our luck brought us to them, the constant longing to see the world restored was always heavy in my mind.

“Maybe the afterlife will give you both,” he said with a shrug. 

I hadn’t understood what he meant at the time, but standing here, in front of this magnificent and neglected entrance, I understood the gift my afterlife had granted me. These gates and the heaven beyond was a part of me, and I had all of eternity to restore a world that was taken from me. Maybe my brother would be waiting for me on the other side, ready to work side by side once again.",28
1lvj12n,n2acd48,"""God is dead.""

One of the most common phrases I've seen scratched into desks, scrawled across operating room doors, and spraypainted on long-abandoned walls.

A large part of urban exploration is learning to laugh off the writings of edgy teenagers and push past the nerves. *No,* you are not going to die here. *No,* there is not a corpse in that closet. *No,* God has not abandoned us or been slain by a horrific Lovecraftian beast that would make your brain melt just by looking at it.

At least, that was my thought process less than twelve hours ago. As it turns out, the kids smoking a joint behind the community center had more answers than they did weed.

Turns out, I *did* die there. Turns out, God *has* abandoned us. As far as the corpse in the closet and the Lovecraftian beast go, I'm not too sure.

What I *do* know is that I was on the fifth floor of the abandoned asylum at the end of Warren & Main when it happened. One too many creaks ignored and cracks in the hardwood disregarded.

I was almost at the end of the Crisis Stabilization Wing when I felt the floor give out and my heart drop into my stomach.

*Crunch.*

*Snap.*

***SMASH.***

***SMASH.***

***SMASH.***

***SLAM.***

And that was all she wrote. It was the end of me. Dead at the ripe age of seventeen, after crashing through five floors of the Warren Memorial Mental Hospital for the Clinically Insane. Ridiculous name, ridiculous way to die.

Or so I thought.

Then my eyes shot open. I gasped, feeling around for broken bones. None to be found, thankfully.

But I had a bigger issue than just broken bones:

I had no idea where I was.

Once I got my bearings, I stood up and looked around, expecting to see the ground floor of the asylum. Instead, I saw a landscape of dark clouds and thick mist surrounding me. Ahead of me was a massive gate—made entirely of gold. Tarnished, deeply weathered gold, but gold nonetheless.

Now, this story is already deeply messed up.

But what I saw on that ancient gate, somehow made it even worse.

Engraved at the top of the arch, in bold, weather-worn letters, was a single word:

""Paradise""",11
1lvc5z0,n28rn11,"When one hears the lofty title of a ""Vampire Lord"", I'm sure a certain picture comes to mind. I know it did for me. I imagined long black cloaks, gaunt features, sharpened claws; perhaps an inhumanly tall figure requiring a custom-made coffin to retire to at dawn.

The man at my doorway was closer to a businessman than the intimidating figure I had imagined, and it wasn't just because of the elegant grey-blue suit and shining black briefcase. His face was not pale but lightly tanned, with faint lines wrinkling in the corners of his glasses-rimmed eyes as he offered me a crisp smile. Were it not for the unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach at that dark grey gaze, I would have mistaken him as a visitor to the wrong door.

""I'm afraid you'll have to invite me in, son; protocol and all that. But I believe you've been expecting me.""

Slowly, I nodded. The letter had slipped beneath my door a week ago; notice of inspection from the man himself. For seven days I've waited in terrified anticipation for his arrival; I can't allow the nervousness to let me slip up.

""Lord Deboulet?""

""Just James is fine,"" he insisted, that smile widening. Instinctively I glanced at his mouth, zeroing in on the pointed canines. Retracted for now, but still sharper and a touch elongated in comparison to a humans.

""Um. Y-yes, of course, Lord- James. Please come in.""

I stepped back to allow him entry, his head stooping in gratitude. My own returned in kind as I shut the door behind him.

""Thank you for accepting my request. Not that you have much choice in the matter; it's customary for all new registries at the bureau to undergo an inspection of their properties and ensure they're settling in. Answer questions your sire may not have gotten round to, go over protocols. All that sort of thing.""

He waves a hand dismissively in my direction. I stay hovering awkwardly behind him as he removes his polished leather shoes, placing them neatly on the rack. His socks have little novelty bats on them; the sort you'd find in a Halloween clearance section of a supermarket. It's so jarring in comparison to the rest of the outfit I almost want to laugh.

I refuse to give in to the urge. It has to be some sort of test - something to make me drop my guard; perhaps something designed to *make* me laugh, just to punish me for the disrespect. I felt a little sick just at the idea. My sire was bad enough. I could only imagine how much worse the man before me could be, if given the opportunity.

He finished carefully lining up his shoes and turned to face me once more. With his shoes off he was a little shorter than me, and my head bowed automatically upon realising. 

*Never stand above your betters. You are always to remain beneath them.*

""So! Matthew, was it? Or do you prefer Matt?""

""Matthew is fine, sir.""

""Well then, Matthew, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I take it the place is yours?""

""That's right."" 

I fidget with my hands as he looks around my scarcely furnished apartment. It was empty when I first moved in three years ago, and in that time I've only procured a few essentials to furnish it with, but it's been my home ever since I moved to the city. 

""It's very... cosy."" 

His neutral smile flickered with something else I couldn't quite discern. My head stooped ower, darting around as he led the way to the kitchen. At least it's clean. I had the good sense to prepare as much as I could.

""Thank you, sir. I first moved in here as a student, but I'll probably be keeping the place.""

""I see. So you're finished with your studies?""

""Almost. I had to delay a little bit; shift to night classes. But it's working for now.""

He set the briefcase on my tiny kitchen table and drew the chair back himself to sit, despite my awkward step forward to drag it out for him. He glanced over at me as I immediately stepped away, hands clasped awkwardly behind my back.

""What is it you study?""

""Medical science. I'm training to work in the autopsy department.""

His eyebrows raised ever so slightly over the rim of his black square glasses.

""Fascinating. Why the career choice?""

""My father did it, sir. And it was a bit less expensive than being a doctor.""

""I see.""

He folded his hands on the table in front of him, the tips of his fingers resting on the handle of his laid-down suitcase. His head nodded to the seat opposite, and I quickly moved to join him. My heart was already pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. I wasn't even sure why it did, beyond the obvious nerves. Like many things, I knew next to nothing about how my body worked now. 

His nose wrinkled as his eyes skimmed past me to look around my cramped kitchen, and I wondered if he could smell my fear. Still, he made no comment, instead opening up the briefcase. From it, he pulled out a small stack of papers and a fine ballpoint pen, before closing it quickly, hiding whatever else was inside from my anxious stare. He tapped them gently on the table and spread them out, uncapping the pen before raising his eyes to me again.

""I suppose we should begin the interview. And I apologise if this is... uncomfortable for you. But I must ensure your answers are honest.""

His free hand lifted to his face and smoothly pulled his glasses from his nose, laying them down. Dread pooled in the pit of my stomach, but I couldn't stop myself from meeting his eyes. I didn't even have time to ruminate why he would apologise of all things before my mind went blank.

They were so blue; far brighter without the thick glass shrouding them. I found myself pulled in immediately, the nausea rising quick in my throat as he stared unblinkingly across the table. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, my hands trembling as they clasped together in my lap. I always hated this part. The compelling stare; the one that made it so hard to refuse anything my sire asked of me.

He lifted the pen and offered me a small, almost sympathetic smile.

""Let's start at the very beginning. When were you first turned?""

The words fall from my mouth as if pulled, just as crisp and precise as the strokes of his pen across the page.

""Approximately four weeks, six days and seven hours ago. The Ninth of April, just before noon.""",78
1lvc5z0,n24vesl,"I was sitting alone in a dim room it looked like an interrogation room from a TV cop show. The vampire count of my region the top vamp as it was had me thrown in here no idea why. I offered him a human heart the best part of the human often only my pack leader got to eat such things so it was a worthy gift at least I thought so.

Then the door opened, and the count walked in. He was an imposing figure. He looked young, but his scars and demeanor told me a different story. He looked at me with a mix of anger and pity. Why did he look at me with pity?

“Do you know what you did wrong?” he said like a disappointed parent. He had no hate in his words at least not for me.

“I didn’t I gave you the best part of my kill. I’m sorry if I offended the offer is often enough to please my pack leader.” I said pleading for forgiveness.

That anger flashed in his eyes again but it was obvious now more than ever that it was not directed at me. “You are young I can tell a few months old by your scent it’s not your fault.” He said but I don’t know if he said it to me or himself.

“What’s not my fault?” I said perplexed 

“Who is your progenitor?” He refused to answer my question.

“My pack leader was the one who made me he goes by Victor” I answered not wanting to disappoint the elder.

“Of course it’s him. I am Count Marko the Lord of New England at least among our kind. You are unfortunately a victim here you see us vampires we have built ourselves a society but your creator your pack they are an affront to what we stand for.”

“What do you mean?” I asked panicked.

“We do not kill we do not hunt in packs and we most definitely do not dismember our prey and eat them like that. To do so is simply barbaric and to do such things is a return to a more primal approach that we have abandoned long ago.” He began explaining and as he did my eyes began to form tears of blood. “Your so-called pack are a traditionalist cult that we can not tolerate.” At this point, I was weeping blood tears unable to find the words to speak. 

He looked at me his eyes filled with pity “It’s not your fault you didn’t know better. We will help you find your place again” He comforted me. 

“But I did so much harm so much blood on my hands when I had other options,” I said in a panicked state.

“It’s fine you have another chance we will help you I will personally oversee it.” He said trying to calm me down.

“How could I after all I’ve done” I tried to refute him.

“Do not worry you are not the first that Victor led down this path” he looked at me with understanding. I looked up at him my eyes hazy “I promise you there is hope. After all, if I could find it anyone could” 

I don’t know if I could ever feel truly free from guilt in my life but for the first time in a long time, I feel hope.

Edit: I fixed spelling and added commas. Thank you everyone that pointed out my mistake English isn’t my first language and I always want to improve.",176
1lvc5z0,n2aj3ae,"""Well this simply won't do at all.""

Mrs. Sharon Gaspard let out a few disapproving sounds as she tapped away on her tablet computer. Across from her in the medical examination room was Gabriella, a college sophomore who looked as if she hadn't had a proper night's sleep in three days. Her tattered, dirt-splotched clothes hung off of her, and her denim messenger bag lay in a heap on the floor next to a pair of blood-stained sneakers. Her blonde hair was done in a quick ponytail in an effort to look somewhat put together, but there was only so much hair could do in this sort of situation. To say she was a ""hot mess"" would be an insult to other, hotter messes. No, Gabriella was a lukewarm mess at best. 

""I'm so sorry, Lady Gaspard."", Gabriella said. ""I truly didn't mean to offend. It's just that Mistress Ravensmane had told me that I sh-""

""Oh is *that* what she's calling herself these days? And please, dear, call me 'Sharon'. Titles went out of vogue over a century ago. Gives the wrong impression."" replied Sharon, still tapping on her tablet. The two sat in relative silence for a moment before Sharon cleared her throat. ""Right, let's see if I've got this all down correctly:""

""You attended a meeting of a horror movie club at your university about one month ago, where you met a woman; the so-called 'Lady Ravensmane'. You two hit it off quite well, you found her to be very charming, and one night she invited you back to her apartment. At her apartment, she attacked you and stabbed you in the stomach numerous times with a ceremonial dagger before slashing her wrist and force-feeding you her blood. When you awoke, your wounds were gone and she informed you that she was a vampire and had turned you, making her your so-called 'mistress'. 

""From there, she claimed that because she was your 'mistress', she now owned everything you had. She took your possessions, forced you to empty your bank account, and moved into your apartment. You've now been living on the streets for the past week, using a dumpster to sleep in during the day and repeatedly breaking into a nearby butcher's shop at night to drink animal blood to sustain you. You've claimed that your 'mistress' won't allow you to return home until you've drank human blood. Is that all correct?""

Gabriella could hardly meet Sharon's eyes, hearing how her life had fallen apart in just a month had her on the verge of tears. ""Yes. But... but I just can't kill a person. I can't. I know what I am now, but there's no way I can take a human life, it's too much!"" She could feel hot wet tears streaming down her face, the mix of shame, embarrassment, and intense fatigue had overwhelmed her attempt to stay calm. 

Sharon slid forward in her desk chair. ""It's alright, dear. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. Not anymore."" She reached out and took Gabriella's hand in her own. ""Tell me, how did you find this place?""

""I'd heard a rumor in high school that the local blood bank was secretly run by vampires. I didn't believe it because I thought vampires weren't real. But after everything that happened, I figured I had nothing to lose. I just knew I needed help, like a shower or a place to stay, anything. I feel like I'm going crazy.""

Gabriella looked up at Sharon, fear in her voice and her eyes. ""Am I going crazy? Is this like a thing where if I don't have human blood I'm going to become a psycho monster or something?""

""Oh goodness, no."" replied Sharon. ""No, you've just been through an incredible amount of trauma these past few weeks. I daresay anyone, human or vampire, would feel like you after all of this. But just one last question: why did you bring a jar full of blood and a heart with you?""

""I- I figured I would have to find some way to pay for help. It's a sheep's heart, I got it from the butcher's. Well, stole it."" Gabriella glanced over at the table on the opposite side of the examination room, where the blood-filled jar sat. A medical label had been applied on the glass, marking the contents inside as such.

""Yes, well, that certainly got our attention."" said Sharon. ""We were relieved for the results to come back showing you had inconvenienced a butcher instead of doing something unthinkable.""

Sharon's tablet made a pinging sound, and she stepped over to her desk to retrieve it. After a moment of reading, she turned her attention back to Gabriella. ""Well, that was quicker than expected. Please, come with me."" Sharon smiled and opened the door, motioning for Gabriella to follow. Gabriella stood up from the exam bed, slipped her shoes back on, grabbed her bag, and decided to leave the jar behind as she stepped into the hall with Sharon. They walked together, Gabriella a step behind and unsure of their destination.

""Gabriella, on behalf of myself, the local vampire community, and vampiric society as a whole, I want to apologize to you. You are the survivor of a dreadful attack and forced conversion by a criminal that we have been trying to capture for decades now. Your attacker went by 'Mistress Ravensmane', but she's used multiple aliases throughout her career. In reality, her name is Hester Lampoll, born circa 1409 near Bristol, England. You are, unfortunately, the latest in a long line of cases like yours, where she forcefully converts someone to become her subordinate while taking everything they've got. And when she's exhausted her victim's resources, she kills them and moves on, relying on her victim's lack of vampire survival training to put up any sort of fight. And if her victim does kill a human for their blood in the meantime, she uses it as blackmail- forcing them to do her bidding under the threat of being revealed as a vampire and killed."" 

If it weren't for the fact that Gabriella's stomach was completely empty, she may have very well lost her lunch then and there in that very hallway. Instead, she suppressed a dry heave. ""So what happens now?""

""Well, now I get to thank you on behalf of all of us. As I said, we've had considerable difficulty finding her. But your story and information gave us what we needed and, while we spoke, I was able to provide that info to our dispatch team.""

""And what happened?"" asked Gabriella.

""And Hester has been... dispatched. Thoroughly, according to this rather descriptive report. Like I said, we've been after her for a while, so I think the team really wanted to make a show of it.""

""Oh! So she's... you know...""

""As a door nail. 'Mistress Ravensmane' is no longer a going concern for you, I'm pleased to say."" Sharon said with a grin.

""So what happens... to me?"" asked Gabriella, a thought that had been bouncing around like a pinball in her brain since this entire disaster started. 

""Fortunately, we have some contingencies in place for something like this."" replied Sharon. ""You see, the vampiric community isn't quite what you may think. Humans think we're all stuck in the past, castles and Dracula and all of that, but the truth is we're as modern as anyone else. Establishing blood banks definitely helped us turn a corner, and with that and advancements in hematology, you'll find that the vast majority of vampires turned since the 1940s have never once actually consumed blood directly from a human. In 1954, a law was passed that made the practice forbidden. That caused a bit of a stir with the old guard, but most of them were able to see reason. But just in case it were to happen, an outreach program and fund was started for survivors of vampire attacks in order to provide aid and restitution. In your case, you'll have your possessions returned or replaced, your finances will be restored, we will see that your home is returned to you or provide housing if you find it too difficult to return there, and there will be a sizeable financial compensation package for your suffering and distress.""

Gabriella nodded absently, still trying to process all she'd learned.

""And of course, we'll restore your humanity.""

This brought the young woman to an immediate halt. 

""...can you repeat that?"" asked Gabriella, just faintly above a whisper.

""Hmm? Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I imagine that might be a bit of a surprise, wouldn't it? We'll make you human again."" said Sharon.

They arrived at their apparent destination, and Sharon opened a door for Gabriella that led into a room that was considerably larger than the one they were in before. Whereas the examining room looked like something from a standard doctor's office, this room had all sorts of metal and plastic equipment that she had never seen before. Also in the room were two attendants in lab coats, who each looked up and gave a smile and nod to their visitors before returning to their work. 

""It's a process that grows more difficult the longer someone has been a vampire, but in your case this should be perfectly routine."" said Sharon as she handed her tablet to one of the attendants. He began typing information into a panel attached to a very large machine.

""I'm sorry, but I thought it was impossible to reverse being a vampire?"" Gabriella asked, still in shock.

""Yes, well, that's a rather handy lie we like to perpetuate. Keeps some people from getting too nosy. Truth is, we have no need to force anyone. Anyone who is a vampire should be one of their own volition. After all that's happened to you, this is the least we can do. Well, that and group therapy, which my secretary will set you up with information on when we're done here. So what do you say, dear? Ready to get your old life back?""

And with tears once again streaming down her face, but this time from relief and joy, Gabriella nodded.",12
1lvc5z0,n29g4rz,"He noted it down, the scratch of ink the only thing to break the silence beyond the gentle tick of the clock. His voice remained soft and firm, reminding me of my favourite school-teacher. I felt oddly lulled by it, but it did little to settle the uncomfortable squirming in my stomach.

""Why did you want to be turned.""

""I didn't. It was that, or dying.""

He raised an eyebrow, holding my stare. 

""Tell me more about that.""

I swallowed, my voice shaking slightly as the words flew out immediately.

""I was hit by a car walking back from campus. Its a bit of a blur, but my sire appeared before me. All I remember is the pain, and him telling me to drink; that it would make me feel better. That I was going to die if I didn't. And then I woke up in his home, as his spawn.""

His eyes fixed themselves to me for a moment longer, before turning down to the paper. The brief respite did little to quell the discomfort.

""And your sire is the man known as David Morgough?""

""I don't know his name. I just call him Sir.""

""I see."" 

He nodded his head slowly, then paused, tapping his pen against the page. The silence that descended was deafening, broken only by the gentle lull of his voice as he continued on.

""When did you last see your sire?""

""One week, two days and three hours ago, sir.""

He nodded. Wrote. Paused. This time, when his eyes met mine, there was a softening of pity to them; a softening that bled into his voice as it lulled me into the next question.

""What's in your fridge, Matthew?""

My heart stopped. My whole body shuddered in revulsion at the question, but I answered it anyway. I didn't have a choice.

""A... human heart, sir.""

""And when did you procure it?""

""Yesterday... sir.""

""I thought so."" His nose twitched again, much as it did when he first entered the room. 

""It smells fresh. So tell me, son, if your sire has been gone for over a week, and you are not compelled to do so, why is there a human heart sitting in your fridge?""

My hands twisted together sharply, my nails digging so deep into my skin they leave little grooves behind. It wouldn't matter if I burrowed them all the way through; they'd be gone by the time it took to get up and make a cup of coffee.

""For you, sir. For dinner.""

The pen was sat down with such a fierce snap it made me jump. His hands pressed to the table as he stood, leaning over it towards me. It was slow enough that I could have moved, but I didn’t. It was as if my body were frozen in place, unable to shy away until he was leaning face to face with me. He was so close I could feel the warmth of his breath, laden with fresh peppermint.

""Are you aware that causing harm to humans is a grievous crime among our kind?""

My eyes widened. My mouth moved automatically, even as the shock would have otherwise rendered me dumb.

""N-no, sir.""

""Then are you aware that such a crime is worthy of immediate execution?""

I thought of my sire. Of how I had been in peace for just over a week, after being so convinced of never being free again.

""N-no, s-sir.""

""Did you kill someone for it, lad?""

""N-no.""

""Have you ever?""

""No!""

""Would you? Do you want to?""

""No! No, I don't- I've *never* wanted to kill someone. I don't even want to eat, I was a vegan before all this; I cried the first time I had to drink pigs blood. I was just so hungry, I... I  couldn't help it.""

""Then how did you procure it?""

""I stole it. From a corpse.""

His eyes levelled at me once more as my entire body shook, desperate to stand. To leave. To get away from that piercing stare. But I couldn't.

""Has human blood ever crossed your lips?""

""No. No, it hasn't.  He tried to make me drink human, but I said no. I *said no.* Please, believe me.""

""I do.""

His voice softened, his hand coming out to gently caress my cheek. I didn't even notice until that moment that I was crying.

""I believe you, lad. You didn't want this for yourself, did you?""

I shook my head. His eyes closed and a sob broke from my lips, unbidden.

""Your sire will not be bothering you again. He has been... disposed of. And I believe you have no wish to follow in his footsteps.""

I gasped in a sharp breath as relief and fear swallowed me simultaneously. Still brimming with tears, they met his once again, and I saw that gentleness and warmth for what it really was. Kindness. Pity 

""Would you like me to help you, son? I can take you back to the bureau. Get all of this squared away. Help you live without hurting anyone.""

I didn't even need to be compelled to answer. I swallowed the lump in my throat and reached for him. His hand met mine, squeezing gently. Steady, prepared to guide me into whatever lay ahead.

""Please.""",93

The point of the story, that Victor is a fundamental traditionalist who is not well regarded by the larger vampire community, is very nearly lost in everything else. A bit more narrative buildup to that revelation would help that important detail stand out more clearly.

Punctuation isn't optional. It separates ideas and helps impart rhythm and flow. Reading this felt like trying to walk on railroad ties, struggling to achieve a natural pace and unable due to the construction.

1lvj9wh,n27dwvb,"**“Mortar of the Stars”**

---

I never wanted to be a hero again.

Not after that arrow ruined my knee, my pride, my dreams, all for someone else’s glory.

But I suppose the world never cared about what I wanted.

---

The night it all changed, I was dreaming.

In the dream, I was still whole. Still young. Still running up ruined temple steps, blade in hand, heart full of fire.

Then thunder cracked like the sky had split its spine.

I woke choking on smoke and dust, as my tent gone, and my ears ringing so hard I tasted metal. And that *light*, bright enough to sear shadows into the insides of my eyelids.

I crawled through the blown-back trees until I found it.

A crater, a whole damn meteorite smashed into the earth like the gods had fired a cannonball at my campsite on purpose.

And in the center of that smoking pit…

A girl.

Small. Frail-looking. Bare as a newborn star.

---

I did the only thing a half-crippled ex-adventurer could: wrapped her in my bedroll, limped her home, and fetched a healer.

When the healer finished her work, and swore she wasn’t hurt, not a scratch, not a burn, I let myself breathe again.

She woke the next morning, eyes like dawn, hair like moonlight spun through ink.

“I am Mortar of the Stars.” she said, voice ringing with childlike delight. “Or, well, *this* me is my avatar. I wanted to try… living. You found me first, so I look like what your heart needed most. I hope that’s okay!”

I laughed for the first time in years.

---

Days passed.

Days turned to weeks.

Weeks blurred into seasons.

I never imagined I’d be happy again, not in this half-life of mended gear and half-healed scars. But she changed that.

She was chaos, warmth, curiosity.

She’d drag me out to watch shooting stars, then scold me for eating rations cold when she could conjure a fire with a snap of her fingers.

She’d hum little songs she claimed she’d plucked from the background hum of the universe.

When my knee ached, she’d kneel by my side and cup it in her small hands, apologizing for something she never did.

I never told her how terrified I was that I’d wake up and find her gone, that it was all just the last bright dream of a washed-up old fool.

---

I suppose I should have known nothing lasts.

We were on a tiny island, our quiet secret place,  when the sky turned black as tar.

By the time we returned, the city we called home was a ruin.

Charred stone, broken spires, the streets carpeted with ash and silence.

And there they stood:

Four riders.

Figures so massive they dwarfed the crumbling cathedral behind them.

I knew them from the murals. The last ruin I explored before my “friend” pushed me into that arrow trap. The last ruin that ended my life as a hero. The ruin that should’ve stayed buried.

War. Famine. Pestilence. Death.

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

---

“FUCK YOU AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON!”
Her voice cracked like thunder.

“Do you *really* want to say that to the actual four horsemen of the apocalypse?!” I hissed, limping to her side.

She didn’t look at me, just narrowed those dawnlight eyes, raw fury blazing out from a face I’d never seen twisted in rage before.

“I know what I said.”

---

They came for us.

They crossed the bones of the world to snuff out the last lights they hadn’t yet broken.

She spread her arms wide. 

A shimmer wrapped around us.

A barrier of humming starlight, thick as a mountain.

Her eyes turned black, then bright again, reflecting something colossal and alien that unfolded itself across the torn sky above.

I saw it:

The *real* Mortar of the Stars.

A shape of impossible geometry, wreathed in the heat of collapsed suns.

When the pillar fell, it felt like the heavens themselves dropped an anvil on the horsemen’s heads.

A single strike, a single cosmic flame so vast it turned stone and metal to vapor.

The city, the ruin, everything the horsemen had tainted, all of it swallowed in light.

---

When the world calmed, I found her standing in the middle of the ruin.

She was trembling.

Her hands clenched so tight they’d drawn blood.

“That was… you?” I asked.

She didn’t look at me.

“I was just channeling you.” she whispered. “Your rage. Your hate. Your grief. I’m a mirror, remember? You wanted them gone. I only… finished it.”

Her shoulders shook.

“And… the real me, the being called Mortar of the Stars... I think… I felt it too. Just a tiny piece. Sadness. Grief. Anger. And… helplessness. I’m a cosmic destroyer. I can *burn* what I love. I can’t bring it back.”

She looked so small, framed by the crater she’d made, just a girl, not a god.

---

I remembered then: the old texts. The murals. The hidden lines I’d read in the ruins I’d abandoned when my knee gave out.

Spells that could heal what no healer dared. Rites to defy death itself. Secrets of gods hidden in crumbling stones.

I stepped forward, rested my hand on her shoulder.

“Then let’s go find them.” I said.

She looked up, hope flickering where there’d been tears.
“Together ?”

“Yeah.” I squeezed her hand. “Together.”

---

So here I am, old knee creaking, backpack strapped tight, and a divine cosmic being humming next to me, wearing my old cloak like it’s royalty.

I’m not just a broken old adventurer anymore.

I’m the one who’s going to steal life back from the jaws of apocalypse.

And she’s my sword and my star.",23
1lvj9wh,n2c0bw0,"Thank you for the prompt! Hopefully you enjoy this take!  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The first to appear was Death. Their horse was a tall creature with lush grey coat across exactly one side. The other was bare, devoid of any skin, leaving half its skeleton exposed. They likely thought it represented something poetic, like the connectivity of life and death or some bollocks like that, but Yvaine just thought it looked stupid. Besides, it was half covered by the ridiculous black cloak Death insisted on wearing. 

Behind them came Famine in the form of a skinny beggar, barely sitting upright. Their horse was equally thin, their black coat pulled tight across the bone. Yvaine grinned, feeling confident she could take that half sack of flour pretty easily. She felt Wisp agree, her loyal sprite was as eager as she was. 

Then came Pestilence atop their white horse, both looking deeply unhealthy and accompanied by a swarm of flies. Yvaine balked at that one. How could they put up with all that gangrene and stuff? She was certain it must smell something rotten. 

Finally, out came a powerful stallion of reddish brown with its armour-clad rider. Now, War she respected. They at least came out looking the part of herald of the apocalypse. Too bad she was going to have to kill them.  

""Now?"" pleaded Wisp, telepathically. He bobbed around her energetically. ""They are all here!""

""Now."" She answered, stepping out before the horsemen. She held her hand out, and Wisp loyally became a brilliant axe in her grip. With a roar, she charged the riders. Death was the first to respond, readying a scythe to meet her.",5
1lvj9wh,n2c0cb4,"""Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!"" She shouted, dodging the blade then sinking her axe into the side of the horse with skin. A pause, then there was a rattling of bone that sounded suspiciously like laughter.

""Do you really want to say that to the four horsemen of the apocalypse?"" Wisp asked. She didn't like his mocking tone. Okay, it wasn't *the* best battlecry, but it was the sentiment of the thing. They wanted to bring the end to *her* world? Absolutely fuck these guys. 

""I know what I said."" she responded, continuing to fight furiously. Catching Death's scythe with her axe, she yanked them off then followed up with a wicked two-handed swing to their waist. Three and a half horsemen of the apocalypse really didn't have the same ring to it. 

No time to savour it. Yvaine ducked as Famine swung a sword towards her head. For a stick figure, there was a *lot* of power behind it. She jumped back as the blade came back around. 

""Boy, that was one really does look hungry. Say something about that!"" 

""Hey, Bony!"" She cried at Famine, jumping and chopping upwards. ""Eat t*his*!"" 

The rest of Famine crumpled off their horse, hitting the ground before the head did. Wisp felt conflicted, proud of the move but ashamed at her wit. Well, they didn't come here to \*insult\* these beings to death. 

Pestilence hissed, sending flies at her. She swatted wildly, unable what she was sprinting towards.

""Buzz *off*"" Yvaine complained, feeling Wisp cringe. Frustrated, she threw her judgemental sprite towards Pestilence. Then the flies dropped, her axe embedded in their master. She grinned, immensely pleased with herself. That was a *good* throw.

""Please don't do that again."" ordered Wisp, reappearing as an orb. ""You know I find it demeaning.""

Ignoring her sprite, Yvaine swung herself up the neck of War's stallion as they came back around for a second attempt to spear her. She had no weapon this time so she violently yanked their helmet off, kicking away every time their spear came up. Useless weapon for fighting atop a horse. The helmet was much more effective, as she began battering the surprisingly handsome face of War with it.  

When War finally fell off their horse, Yvaine went down with them, still swinging. When they abandoned the spear and tried to push her off or block her blows, Wisp became a short axe that she hacked off limbs with. It took her a while to notice when War stopped moving, for they did not cry out in pain nor exertion. 

""It is done?"" Yvaine asked, breathing heavily.

""Yes, Yvaine."" Wisp answered. ""It is done.""

She nodded, then collapsed to the ground, her eyes closing. Finally.",6
1lvlufx,n273ntk,"Nemesis chose me. I issue her forces of balance, just like all the other chosen ones of Nemesis. We call ourselves Distributers of Karma. Each of us control a small factor of what humans would describe as luck. I control the traffic lights.
Some may think this is a minor factor in the eyes of Nemesis, in karma. You’d be surprised at how much punishment and reward can be issued to someone just using the lights.
I reward those who deserve it. The hardworking single mother, forced to take two jobs to sustain her three year old twins after their father passed away suddenly to a brain bleed. She always has the lights turn green as she reaches them to ensure she gets to places on time. The scientist working on the cure for multiple diseases as well. My power isn’t limited to the permanent traffic lights either, but temporary placements at road work sites.
Punishment is delightfully satisfying. The abusive girlfriend with no patience of the kind hearted tech help is forced to stop at every light on her way to Starbucks, and there will always be a road work red light on her journey. The man who makes sure to torture any animal that enters his life will always have a long journey. Every red light, road works, I even can break the lights to get him stuck in extensive traffic jams.
Karma has no limits, and can be delivered in any form. I just deliver it in this way, but there are many more of us, making sure that humans get what they deserve, whether it’s reward, or punishment.

1lv6gad,n246us6,"""Nice try,"" the demon snickered, its frozen breath forming white puffs in the cold air. ""But you're too late.""

Gareth no longer knew what to do with himself, staring at the cold, frozen landscape. For all his life, this was what he had been working towards. To fight the ultimate fire. Hellfire. He had sacrificed friendships and burned many bridges. To be an absolutely horrible person to his wife and children despite saving many lives from fires.

All so he could descend to hell upon death. To put out the fires in hell.

Except someone had beaten him to it. Even made all hell freeze over.

""So, what will you do now?"" The demon raised its eyebrows, its grin spreading wider by the minute. ""You're stuck here with me.""

""No, you're stuck with me,"" Gareth pulled the demon closer to sneer at it. ""And we are going to start a fire.""

The creature's eyes lit up, the firefighter's words like kindling to a fire that was long smothered by the icy winds.

""Let's start a fire.""

**
--

It all starts with a single spark. A flicker of flame. All from rubbing two sticks together really hard until there's heat and a little smoke.

Gareth figured he had all of his damnation to figure it out. Even as he pondered what would happen after he extinguished the fire he had to create for himself in hell. Would it change anything? Was it simply one hell for another? Not like he had a kindred soul to discuss these thoughts in his mind. No, that one demon didn't count.

Another damned soul approached the small campfire. A human soul.

""Huh, its warm here,"" she sounded surprised, speaking in the trembling voice of a person who had been denied the gentle warm of a rising sun for centuries. ""Who are you?""

""Just some dumbass trying to start a fire.""

She leaned in closer to soak in the warmth, careful to hold the hem what the firefighter assumed was some kind of fancy period dress away from the flames. ""Can I help?""

""Uh...sure,"" he had no reason to push her away. He was already in hell, no point being an asshole anymore. ""You know how to rub two sticks together? Or where to find sticks in hell?""

""Yea, I can do that,"" she nodded, smoothing out her elegant dress with one hand, while the other kept her grip on her lacy umbrella. ""Used to grab a stick to draw in the snow.""

The woman left the otherwise dark cave, illuminated solely by Gareth's flame. And the demon huffing and puffing with its demonic energies to keep it going. It wasn't long before she returned with a bundle of sticks, and a new person.

""Hey, I brought a friend. Can he help too?""

""Whatever,"" Gareth grunted. ""The more the merrier. Make yourself comfortable. Then make yourself useful.""

The campfire grew. Sustained by more kindling and firewood, and fanned by more people. Even a few demons stumbled in. He was simply hoping to get the fires of hell going again. Not have some whatever campfire party was shaping up here. And then, there was a second fire. A third one. A pale semblance of some...society.

Or, as the woman, who now introduced herself as Eva, said. A sufficient band to restart human civilization in hell.

""It's like carving our own slice of heaven in hell,"" she mused, hands curled around a mug of hot chocolate. ""Long after the devil ditched his job and left hell to fall into chaos, then freeze over.""

""How do you know this?""

""Been here a long time,"" she shrugged, running her delicate fingers through her hair. ""Too long. It's been centuries for me.""

""Oh,"" was all Gareth could muster. So, she wasn't some fancy medieval re-enactment party person but someone from one of those old ages.

""The younger ones have told me about things like customer service. Which existed in their world, but not here. Don't ask the demons - they're wardens of jails that have shut down. They don't know any more than we do why Lucifer left without a word. All I heard is rumours about him going to LA to run a bar.""

Gareth laughed. ""You're pretty updated on things.""

""I had nothing to do here but talk to anyone who'd hold a conversation. Turns out, everyone wants to find a fellow human to talk when trapped in a vast, bleak hell. But there's enough of us poor souls gathered around here. We've grown from a band of miserable humans around a small flame to a small society of a few hundred humans. Haven't you thought about doing something...more?""

The cogs of his mind whirred. He had come solely to fight fire, but now it seemed, he had awakened a fire in kindred souls in hell. Damned souls who looked up to him and wished he would lead them to something more. Something greater.

""I'm looking forward to be the new Queen of the Damned,"" Eva teased. ""Will you be the new King of Fire and Hell?""

1lv6gad,n24db8u,"“Says here you intentionally started fires, suplexed cashiers who got your order wrong, tripped over old ladies and…” Xitu squinted, adjusting the spiked golden monocle that sat over his pale left eye. “And tricked god into sending you to hell?” He read that in a slow, confused tone, as if the words had changed into ancient Latin half way through reading them. “I don’t get-“ Xitu felt two hairy arms wrap around his waist, the demon unable to finish his sentence as Joe threw him backwards, slamming his head through the heated red terrain of hell, burying his head within it. After delivering the suplex, Joe tapped the front of his fireman’s uniform, hoping his family had respected his last wishes.
 
Underneath his suit was a super soaker, one filled with a full tank of water. While a super soaker wasn’t a common piece of firefighting equipment, it appeared to be the only weapon that would work in hell, since he wouldn’t have access to any open water sources. Now he just had to hope his theory was right about the water never running out.
 
He gave it a few testing pumps, watching the water drool out of the nozzle, landing on the back of Xitu, who only shivered at the cool contact. He then unloaded the entire canister onto Xitu, counting the seconds until it was empty. By the time he reached fifty seconds, the super soaker felt no lighter, staying the same as it had been when he was buried, keeping its full tank for eternity. The soaked Xitu pulled himself from the ground, quivering as he looked up at Joe.
 
“Who… who are you?” He shook, never having met a human so frightening.
 
“I’m Fireman Joe.” He said, before spraying the demon between his eyes, sending Xitu tumbling back onto the floor. The demon tried to get up again, but his core temperature had fallen too low, temporarily halting his movements. Joe waited until he could be certain that Xitu wasn’t getting up again before continuing. “The priests were right. Demons do need heat to stay active. Pity I had to suplex them to get here.” He would apologize to them someday, although if they were good priests, they should have already forgiven him by now. That thought making him feel a lot better about his past sins.

The birds of hell screeched, flapping their thin leathery wings as Joe walked deeper into hell. The half human birds a disfigured mess of human eyeballs and beaks. They were small, no bigger than a pigeon, but they were loud, each screech causing a stabbing pain in Joe’s ear. He kept his soaker raised, ready to strike if they swooped, only for the birds to fly away at the first sign of confrontation. “Guess they’re only an alarm system. That’s good. They won’t try to stop me before I reach the pits of hell, then.”
 
During his trip to the pits of hell, Joe got attacked by all kinds of demons. Some were disfigured with animal parts or skin, while others were your typical red imp variety. Each falling to the super soaker, and after a thirty-minute descent down the foot scaringly hot stairs of hell, he had found its heat source. The wild flames burning brighter than any natural disaster, swirling with the rage of a million burnt souls.
 
Sensing how big of a job this was, Joe switched his soaker from its blaster setting to its super mega water cannon one. Giving the plastic switch on the side of the blaster a quick flick, snapping it off the gun. Thankfully, he didn’t need the weaker setting anymore, not since his target was in sight.
 
“A fireman doesn’t rest until all fires are extinguished. I betrayed my oath to get here, and now I’ll make up for it by putting out the wildest fire of them all.” The blast from the super soaker shot out in a whirlpool like spiral, blasting through the flames. The contact causing hell to rumble, with the water weakening hell’s control over the Earth.
 
A slashing claw dug into Joe’s back, the man not noticing the demons creeping up behind him. The white-haired demoness grinning as his blood drizzled down her long nails, giving him a wink with her red eyes before trying to shove her hand through his back. Joe’s skin went to peel away, only for the firefighter to slam the nose of the soaker into her chin before she could pierce his body fully. The hit knocking her back, before he sprayed her with a mighty shot, knocking her out.
 
He panted, the pain intensified by the roaring flames that lurked nearby, as if they were dropping tiny stinging flickers of fire into his torn skin. Gritting his teeth, he readied his gun towards the fire again, only for more demons to rush down the stairs.

Joe knew this would be the end of him. The demons would destroy his soul, and soon he would cease to exist on any level, and he didn’t care. He would put out this flame before that happened. Joe struck a demon in the stomach with the weapon, blasting their abs with cool water, sending them flying back. He then kneed another in their stomach, before pushing the nozzle of the gun into their mouth, filling it with water until it escaped from their nose.
 
While fending off the demons, he took breaks to attack the larger flame, always taking a few scratches or bites during that period. After an hour of fighting, he fell to his knees, the flames of hell little more than a whimpering flicker that gently extinguished, plunging hell into darkness.
 
“HA. HA. HA. HA.” A booming laugh echoed through hell, as a pair of solar panel shaped red eyes appeared above the smoke of the fallen flame. The yellow pointed pupils soaring over Joe. “Well done, foolish mortal. Do you know how long I’ve waited for someone to extinguish my flame? That flame kept me bound to an eternal sleep, because unlike my other creations, who were created by the rage in my soul. My heart is cold, requiring the icy pits of hell to function. You’ve freed me, and now I’ll perfect my demons, continuing the efforts I was doing before that bastard created that flame to bind-“
 
“Don’t care.” Joe said, crawling back to the stairs, starting the long, slow journey back to the surface of hell.
 
“YOU DON’T CARE? I’M THE MOST POWERFUL BEING ALIVE.”
 
“The flames gone. I did my job.” He shrugged, only for the giant of a demon to lurch forward, striking its frozen hand on the stairs, blocking him.
 
“I will make you listen to my words, and then I will devour you. You will know the hell you brought upon mankind.”
 
Joe didn’t have enough air in his lungs to spit at the demon, especially with his face being so far away from the creature. Instead, he did the next best thing, pointing his gun at the demon, hitting their chin with a small disrespectful stream of water, one that stuck his prominent goatee to his chin.
 
“You little shit.” The hand went to close around Joe, only for Joe to vanish. When he gained consciousness again, he was in the dark, with his soaker stuck underneath his outfit again. He could hear slow muffled music playing outside of the darkness, and with a hard shove, he pushed his hands up, opening his coffin.

When he sat up, the room erupted into screams, as his work friends and family saw what they assumed was a miracle. Joe calmly exited the coffin, stretching out his limbs. “Thanks for coming. Sorry, I was an asshole. I got over it.” He said, not wasting his words as he left the funeral, without even stopping to say anything to his friends or family. He could see them later. For now, he needed to give his weapon the respect it deserved.
 
Outside, he waved down a cab, telling them to take him home. After a short drive, Joe was home, the firefighter running inside to get the driver his money, before farewelling him. Inside his home, he opened up his gun safe, resting the super soaker inside. “I pray the day never comes where I need to use you again. Thank you for your service. May we one day meet again in the afterlife.” He kissed the gun before closing the safe’s door, putting what he considered a dangerous weapon away.
 
“Um. Mr. Joe? Sorry, I don’t know your last name. You aren’t Joe Joe, are you? Or Jojo? Um, yeah.” The angel nervously rubbed a strand of its long golden hair, with tiny flakes of gold falling from it. “God wanted to let you know that he’s forgiven you. The devil may be awake again, but it will take thousands of years before the flame of hell returns. Even if he perfects his research, we will have plenty of time to launch a counterattack. You may have created a more peaceful afterlife, one where humans can find ultimate rehabilitation without being cast away to hell with no chance of forgi-“
 
“Don’t care.” Joe said, scratching his ass through the fabric of his suit.
 
“This is a great honor.” The angel said, unsure if he was trying to convince himself or Joe of that fact. 
 
“Don’t care.”
 
“I…. really don’t understand. This is a personal thank you from god. People all over the world would give anything for this and…”
 
Joe had already left his bedroom, leaving the angel standing there dumbfounded. Not wanting to have his speech cut off, the angel continued talking to himself for the next five hours. While the angel finished his long-winded speech, Joe returned to his work. Even if he was sore, exhausted, and hungry, he knew the flames would never rest. The man who had been dead only this morning, going back to work the same day. With a hose in hand, he continued his only purpose in life.

1lv6gad,n23mskv,"I think I've been around for a long, long time. That I have lived many lives on many worlds. I can't remember it directly, but I have always felt my actions were somehow influenced by this tremendous well of experience. For so many righteous lives I have lived, and an uncountably large number others have lived, the universe is still stained by the evil deeds of demonic higher powers. Being good alone is not enough. Victory will require some of us to walk a darker path.

I chose my profession because I knew it would best prepare me for the task that would follow my life. A firefighter, a person who dedicates their life to quenching infernos. Despite my better nature, I had to ensure I went to hell one way or another. I was an unredeemable asshole. I steered my course so that I would be deserving of hell while doing a minimum of harm to decent people.

I die, scorned and alone. Then I wake up to a place reeking of suffering and brimstone. Now, I smile. There is no fire so hot that enough water will not douse it. The eternally burning souls will burn no more, and from that uncountably large mass of writhing of agony, my army will be supplied. In its place will be an ocean, one in which we will throw every demon king. Drowning the monsters, until there are monsters no more.

1lv6gad,n24e372,"Marcus worked as a firefighter since he was 6 years old.

A firefighter from the department had shown up in his classroom and passed around a small plastic badge for each of them.

Marcus took this seriously. Every lit match he saw was doused. He never went camping more than once due to how he extinguished the campfire. His mother had to cook when he was away at school since he would always turn the stove and oven off.

He was dedicated to stopping any and all fires he saw.

However, despite all of this, he was a ge uinely good child. All of it, every annoying habit came from a place of genuine care for his friends and family. 

Once he joined high school, it changed very quickly. He got into trouble often for pulling the fire alarm. He got into fights over cigarettes. He was banned from his prom because of how he continuously stole erasers from the staff.

Marcus didn't care, mostly. He did seem very upset when a volunteer snatched his plastic badge away after the 4th  falsified call. But in general, Marcus seemed okay with all the pain he caused.

When he turned 17, he began training to pass the physical exam for a firefighter, and after passing, he applied as a volunteer immediately.

Marcus was an odd fireefighter. He slapped every single person he saved, whether they were a man, woman, girl or boy. And once a newborn baby. The people he saved were thankful, angry, and confused. Marcus was already jumping back into the burning building, his slapping hand raised high.

Despite the slappalation of the people, Marcus would eventually be given a medal by the mayor. Though he seemed visibly upset when she described him as an angel of protection. 

The video ten seconds afterwards went viral for a good week, and Marcus spent the next two months in jail.

Upon getting out, he mentioned he could smell smoke and immediately jumped into a burning building, carrying out 2 children, 3 dogs, and an elderly grandmother. He made sure each of them was okay, and then began verbally berating them for their choice of footwear until the three humans and one dog were crying.

Marcus continued this emotional warfare against the people he saved. Everyone in the city began to learn that if Marcus was there, you would be crying, but safe.

It wasn't enough, and so Marcus began to fart in their faces as well. This caused Marcus to get into more fights, which did lead him to prison more often.

This cycle continued until the smoke inhalation caught up to Marcus.

As he lay on his deathbed, some of the people whom he saved shared their stories of the lives they could lead because of them.

He flipped them all off and told them to eat his shit.

However, as he was ready to pass, some of the volunteers were there to say good bye.

He asked only a songle question... 

""Do you think I'll still burn in hell? Despite everything?"" He said... almost hopefully.

""Yes,"" said his best friend on the squad. ""You'll burn in hell you miserable jackass.""

""Good. See you in hell."" He said joyfully. ""Bring a coat."" And he died, with a smile on his face.",11

And while you were trying to be a bad person, it isn't in you to be a real bad person."" he says.  
I frown.  
""If you know...then why?  
Why bring me here?  
You know what I want to do, right?"" I ask.  
""Douse the fires of Hell, stopping the torturous practices involving fire down there, and making it a cooler place?"" he smiles.  
I nod.  
""Don't you think that fighting Hell, can be done better from Heaven?"" he continues.  
I freeze.

  
""What do you mean?"" I ask.  
""There are angel legions posted in and around Hell to ensure safety of reality.  
There are missions to save wrongly punished souls, and souls that have been tricked to go to Hell."" he says.  
""Patrol? Rescue missions?"" I mutter, liking the sound of it.  
He nods.  
""So don't worry.  
You will be going to Hell, just not how you imagined.  
And your experience in getting people out of dangerous situations, and going right into danger will come in handy."" he says.  
I smile, and follow him into the Silver City.

  
Time lost all its meaning, but it's been a long while since I started.  
I got a new squad of angels, and two saints to walk around the edges of Hell.  
Guess what?  
Not only sinners get into Hell, sometimes souls that wander get stuck there, and not only that...  
Hell can be visited by mortals as well.  
Meaning traveling through space, there are parts of the universe where Hell has gateways that allow entrance directly to Hell.  
So there are rescue missions posted for such individuals, and more.  
I can tell you that fighting living fire, and going into the middle of demonic wars, to try and save some poor soul stuck there...  
It's much more satisfying, and the best of it?  
Here, I don't have to pretend I am awful.",14
1lvqr19,n29sbu2,"I looked up at Venus, seeing my worn face reflected in her perfectly polished face plate. Time had been cruel to me, yet it was no less than I deserved. For all I had done, it was appropriate that I had no freedom from its ravages.

She didn't need to speak. I saw her enter in that armour, and spoke quietly. ""I know. He's back.""

She gave a nod. Her words were hard, filled with pain and directed fury. Not at me, though I had felt it countless times enough. No, it was at Him. The Inheritor of Decay. My old master.

I had felt his return. Even after so long apart, I could feel the connection. He had put it in place, to know if I were to ever fall. He claimed it was so he could mourn me should it happen, but I doubted it to be true now. He just wanted to know when he could promote someone to take my place, to undergo those horrendous augmentations.

Venus leaned in, her gauntlets tightening on the chair back before her. ""What can you tell us about him? What do you know to help us win?""

I sighed. ""If I could easily say, I would. But He was careful to extract a few Oaths. I can't say anything that would tell you of His abilities, weaknesses, plans or locations of items of interest to Him.""

I hoped she would get it. It was awful, all this knowledge in my head, but I couldn't offer it up. But I didn't need to worry. Venus tilted her head to the side, before miming writing. ""What about in written word?""

That made me smile. ""Potentially. I was reading a book the other day. You should borrow it, I'm sure you would find it a delightful read.""

I could feel the edge of the Oath tickling my head. That was getting dangerously close to breaching it. I knew what I was doing, so therefore so did it. But it was a shot. If Venus took it, she would know everything I did about the Inheritor. One of the things I had been working on, in this self-imposed isolation.

A way to atone for a mere drop of my sins. I knew I was damned already, and no amount of good service would clear my record. But it helped me sleep a little better at night. And maybe it would mean a few seconds less torment when I was judged.

Hopefully they could use it. I had written every single scrap I could recall about Him. Conversations, deployments, training regimes, even his favoured foods. But most importantly were the three locations he had shown an adverse reaction to.

The Land of Everlasting Sun. Of course, the place most touched by radiance. It was purity He couldn't yet decay, and so He hated it.

The Endless Forest. He sent forces within to hunt animals and collect resources, but in all my years He never set foot within himself. Maybe it was nonsense, but the one time I mentioned going in He gave me a Look.

And finally, the Abyssal Network. I suspected there was something in there that could truly kill him. He chose caves and caverns as base's, but never the Abyssal Network. Even at the height of power, he forbade me from sending a single scout into its depths.

They might be nothing, but they could be something. And if it helped, then it was worth it in the end.",7
1lvj9jz,n2853qw,"Look, in my defense, I was just trying to make popcorn.

Okay.

Technically, I was *fixing* the microwave so I could make popcorn.

I’d already re-soldered the control board twice that week. Something about the old model’s power transformer made it go “bzzzt” every time it hit defrost mode.

Naturally, I googled a fix, found a sketchy forum, downloaded a PDF full of equations I didn’t understand, and before I knew it, my kitchen looked like Doc Brown’s garage sale.

Long story short:

Popcorn did not happen.

Portal did.

One second, I’m testing the power cycle. Next thing I know, the entire microwave glows like an angry sun, makes a noise like the world’s biggest bendy straw, and sucks me right in.

---

I landed face-first in a patch of olive trees. It was hot. There were goats. My phone cracked on a rock.

It didn’t take long to figure out something was wrong.

A couple of toga dudes came by, stared at me and my hoodie and cargo shorts like I was an alien (which, technically, yeah). One of them pointed at my phone and said, “λόγος ?” which my four weeks of Duolingo Greek did *not* prepare me for.

Panic mode: engaged.

I downloaded a translation app years ago for my holiday in Santorini. Miraculously, my phone still worked. I typed in: “I am from America.”

I hit translate. The app buzzed, made a little *ping*, and spat out something that sounded very philosophical when I read it aloud.

The toga guys gasped. One dropped his wine jug. They immediately bowed so low I could see the bald spot on the back of his head.

In hindsight, maybe I should’ve checked the translation.

---

Fast forward a few days.

I’m stuck here, no WiFi, no microwave to reverse-engineer the portal, no way to explain my existence.

But now, word’s spreading that there’s a strange man in weird cloth claiming to be from some *shining, faraway isle* across the Pillars of Hercules. A land of endless bounty, flowing rivers, and flying chariots (I think they meant airplanes?). Also, for some reason, there are *crystal palaces*. I definitely didn’t say that, but the rumor mill does what it wants.

And the name?
Well. My poor translation attempt for “America” somehow came out closer to *Atlantis*.

So here I am:
That one idiot who, through a combo of a cursed microwave and a free translator app, single-handedly invented a myth that philosophers will argue about for millennia.

---

Yesterday, a local poet came by to “record my wisdom.”

I tried to tell him I was just a guy who wanted popcorn.

He wrote down something about *“divine kernels of golden bounty that sustain the people.”*

Yeah. That’s definitely going to survive the centuries.

---

So if anyone ever asks you:

Was Atlantis real? Did a hyper-advanced civilization sink beneath the waves?

Nope.

It was just me.

A burned-out bachelor, a half-melted microwave, and a translation app that really screwed the pooch.

On the bright side, at least they feed me free olives.

But god, what I wouldn’t give for a bag of buttered popcorn.",7
1lv5r1c,n23kdb3,"“Just sit still, I’ll get back to you later,” I said as I tied the goon up. With the entrance guard out of the way, I cast a door-kicker spell on my boots and kicked the steel gates in, pinning down one soldier inside. Another stared dumbfounded at me. Pulling out a piece of parchment, I showed it to him.

**MISSING: GREATER STRIPED DRAGON. RESPONDS TO “MIFFLES”. LIKES PEARS.**

“I think you know what I’m here for,” I told the trembling minion.

“Your dragon’s in another cas-“

“MIIIIIIFLEEEEES!”

A giant roar confirmed my suspicions. I narrowed my eyes at the guy, who shrugged.

“Worth a shot. But now you’re surrounded. And a big ransom we’ll claim for you, hahah!” He laughed as ten more men dashed out of the fort and surrounded me. 

After I was done with them, I followed the sounds of pained groaning to the dungeons, where a crowned woman was busy whipping the beast. She turned around as I approached.

“Don’t get in the way of my revenge,” she snarled, whip in hand, “Dragons ate my parents, they deserve to be punished.”

Reaching up her flowing skirt, the princess pulled out a crossbow. First aiming at me, she realized that my casual demeanor showed that it wasn’t a threat. Twirling gracefully, she instead pointed it at the dragon’s eye.

“Alright, calm down, my lady,” I sheathed my sword, “Miffles is a house pet. She isn’t like the wild violent dragons. Look, she’s crying. Besides, you wouldn’t start a war with the Kingdom just because of a personal grudge, would you?”

The princess pondered for a bit, and to my relief, lowered her crossbow. She gritted her teeth as she began releasing the chains. I flashed my best heroic smile.

“You’re doing the right thing. Maybe one day you’ll see that humans and dragons can live in harmon-“

The dragon swallowed her in a single gulp.

“NO! BAD MIFFLES!”",124
1lv5r1c,n23syxg,"The lonely road was deserted and dusty.  The lack of traffic was due to the wandering threat that plagued the land and it had been several months since the last rain fall.  The knight's posture had slowly degraded from inspiring noble to slumped exhaustion as the miles piled on.  The horse beneath him was faring no better, the weight of the armor that protected it was wearing down on the powerful muscles that propelled the animal of war.  Endless trees framed the road, limiting the sight lines but adding the cheerful sounds of chirping birds.

Wearily, the knight opened the scroll he had tied to the saddle horn when he had started this adventure. In bold letters, it proclaimed a sizable reward for any who dared to the slay the beast that had terrorized the kingdom and rescue the fair damsel.  A common task for any knight, but there was something amiss that he couldn't quite put his finger on.  The quest had been offered for about a week now, far too long to go uncompleted with so many heroes about.

The sudden lack of sound, no birdsong or even other normal forest noises, was the first sign that something was wrong.  The knight quickly put away the scroll and loosened his sword in the scabbard attached to the saddle before pulling it with a mighty flourish.  He hefted the weighty shield, preparing to battle to the death anything that was about to attack him.  Even his horse perked up, swiveling its ears to find the danger before it was too late.

Minutes passed and limbs trembled under the strain of readiness.  Slowly, almost against his will, the knight's sword arm slowly descended until his weapon rested across his armored legs.  His steed had stopped walking forward to sidestep left and right a few times before standing still.  The armored head dipped to nibble at the grass growing at the side of the road.  Impatiently, the knight jerked the reins a few times to get the animal moving again.  Reluctantly, the horse obliged and began walking forward, the thoughts of a meal pushed aside.  Eventually, both settled back into the weary pace of before, hoping their destination was just around the next corner.

A full hour passed before signs of the forest cover was breaking up, indicating a clearing somewhere ahead.  The thought of uninterrupted sunlight spurred the horse into an almost-canter.  Before long, the streams of broken sunlight gave way to an open glade filled with long grass.  The sound of a babbling brook dominated their ears and the horse moved towards the water unbidden.  Reaching the bank of the shallow stream, the knight dismounted and grabbed his empty waterskin.  It took a few tries to find a deep enough section to fill the bag and he gleefully drank his fill as his horse lowered its head to drink. Thirst slated, the knight refilled the container once more and looked around, searching for signs that would indicate the direction he should travel.  It wasn't until he remounted his horse that he noticed a few trees at the end of the clearing that looked charred.",11
1lv5r1c,n265xxk,"If I am anything, a consummate professional is one of them, and any adventurer that isn't is an idiot. We are, by way of profession, patsies we take the blame for things that others wish not to.

The evil king a bit over has kidnapped someone, send adventurers, the nearby land holding paramilitary force is ransoming you, send adventurers, is the advisor to the crown a demon in disguise but you have no proof, you get the gist.

Any group that doesn't understand that fundamental part of the profession, and gets angry about possible consequences, will usually find themselves out of work.

...or actually becoming the villains they believe they are being framed as.

But, in my time, of all the reasons I have led a group to deal with corrupt neighboring nobility, this has got to be the most Idiotic Thing ever.

When we were hired to rescue the kidnapped treasury keeper of our client I wasn't expecting much. When told they were kidnapped by order of the neighboring kingdoms crowned Princess I was caught off guard.

When told the treasurer was actually a Dragon, well I think punching myself in the face to make sure our mage wasn't fucking with me was warranted.

""Master Ogaronous, is a pacifist you see, one of the reasons he works in our treasury actually, he has a hoard without having to do so by violent means.""

So after much drinking, and one of the weirdest infiltration missions ever involving, I had no idea our large orc had such an impeccable singing voice, we were now on our way back to our client. Disguised dragons, and one princess with the mouth of a sailor,  in tow.

""You ******* do you have any ******* ******* ***** idea what you have done!?!?!""

Our archer, tuning out the young idiot made an inquiry.

""So, sir, what do we do with her, exactly?""

Our mage gave his thoughts, while still tending the many scratch marks on his face.

""I say a long walk, off the side of a high cliff would be very appropriate in this situation.""

I shut down the conversation before it became a competition as usual.

""We keep her for a day or two, get our charge back home, and then ransom her back to her father for extra pay."" I gave a look over my shoulder at everyone, ""That is the usual play, and I will not hear any conversations about cursed transformation, or human hand puppets, from anyone.""

The mage and orc gave disappointed looks.

I then turned to our actual charge.

""No offense master dragon, but for future references_"" I decided to give some advice to the centuries older creature, that for some reason made his human disguise the most perfect story book example of a young, bachelor, pretty boy, I have ever seen, ""Change up the disguise, if we are called back here again for this I will charge extra.""",12

“You heard me right you have to save the dragon he-“

“Yes i heard what you said ur majesty but… its just…. It’s usually the other way around”

“Ill pay double!” The queen said her orange hair moving wildly 

I sighed “ok. Where did she take the dragon to?”

“To fort kase on the south side of the kingdom is her secret layer”

I nodded and walked out of the castle. I usually rescued princess from dragons not the other way around. But when u have 2 hungry mouths to feed you kinda just do what ur told if the pay is right

“PRINCESS!” I called when i reached the fort “RELEASES THE DRAGON!” I yelled dismounting my horse

“NEVER!” The princess said standing among her gards. Inside the wooden walls i heard the dragon’s desperate crys for help

“Then you leave me no choice!” I say busting threw the doors

“HOW!?!” The princess exclaimed 

“You forgot to lock ur gates!” I replied running to the dragon cutting the chains

“Nooooooo” the evil princess exclaimed using her magic space hands to block the gate

“Magic space hands?” I questioned looking up at my daughter who was pressing purple play dough to her dolls hands

“Yes see” she said

I shrugged  “then you leave me no choice!”

“You wouldn’t dare!” She snarled a hint of fear in her voice

I whistled and soon the ground shook with the stomps of the terrifying stomps of the woofel

The woofel grabbed the princess by the head and ran on circles around the fort

The princess tried to argu her release with treats and extra play time but it was no use. I had already put the beast under my spell.

1lv5r1c,n23t6j9,"(Reddit wouldn't let me post the whole thing together)

Hoping for the best, he rode over to the trees in question and examined them closely.  The burnt sections contained a greenish tint, indicating dragon fire was the culprit.  Looking deeper into the woods, he noticed more trees, almost in a straight line from where he was sitting.  With no other clues, he urged his horse towards the next batch of trees.  Within a few minutes, the duo were far from the clearing and entering a more desolate environment.

The forest rapidly gave way to rocky formations and stones piled haphazardly about.  There were scorch marks on some of the rocks, indicating a trail to be followed.  The knight suspected a trap, but he had be travelling so long that his desire to end the quest outweighed any caution he might have felt.  As he rode deeper into the canyon, he swore he could make out words carried by the wind.  Thinking quickly, he dismounted and put muffles on the hooves of his horse in an effort to mask the sound they would make on the stone.  He led his steed slowly, not wanting to heedlessly rush into unknown danger, something painful experience had taught him in the past, despite his earlier desire to end the whole adventure as soon as possible.

Turning a stone corner, the scene in front in him made the knight freeze in his tracks.  There was the monster, the horrible beast that had menaced the kingdom for so very long.  His eyes narrowed as the knight plotted the route he would need to take to make the most of his surprise attack.  Nodding to the horse and giving it the hand sign to stay put, the knight soundlessly pulled his sword from the scabbard, crouched low and crept forward, keeping as much cover between him and his prey.

He could hear the musical voice of the captive maiden pleading for her life, her very freedom but her cries landed on deaf ears.  The response was harsh and shrill, promising dire threats of violence unless the enormous ransom was paid soon.  Feeling that this was the pivotal moment in the encounter, the knight readied his weapon to strike the fatal blow.  Springing from his hidden place, his valiant yell echoed off the stones around him and he leaped high into the air.  The gleaming, razor sharp edge of his blade sparkled in the sunlight as it arced through the air to end the menace once and for all.  His aim was true as he separated the vile head from the body of the beast.  It flew through the air before landing wetly on the ground and rolling to a stop, face down.

The knight's chest was heaving from the exertion, and he turned to the captive maiden with a smile.  Carefully, he put down his sword and pulled a dagger from a sheath on his belt.  Sawing at the ropes that kept her bound, he continued to smile broadly as he freed her.  Within moments, her release was complete and she hugged her rescuer.  *This*, he thought, *was why I wanted to be a hero my whole life*. A few preparations later and the trio set out to return to the king.

A day later at the castle of the kingdom, the crowds were jubilant at the sight of the successful rescue and the darling couple.  Arriving at the gates, the king greeted them with a bright smile and a loud laugh.  His mirth only increased when the knight pulled the severed head from a bag and displayed it for all to see.  The king promised that it would hang from the highest pole on the castle wall so that the populace would know that the grave threat was finally over.

Clapping his hands loudly once, the king gestured and several porters came out of the castle, burdened with heavy sacks filled to the brim with gold coins and magical treasures.  The heroic knight carefully removed the saddle from his valiant war steed, and a waiting groom rushed over to take the animal to the stables for a grateful rest.   Nodding to the sacks that contained the reward, the knight smiled and indicated for his newfound companion, the maiden dragon, to take possession of the payment as they began to get ready to depart.  The king pointed to the severed head of the evil princess and his captain of the guard prepped the pole that would display her to all.  Peace had finally returned to the troubled public.",15
1lvd7qu,n25dnez,"They call me the Chosen Hero.

Chosen by whom? 

Some say the gods, some say fate. 

I’ve stopped wondering. 

When the Innocence hums in my palm, the wicked fall. 

That’s all the certainty I need.

Or so I thought.

---

I found it at dusk, on the hill above the battlefield I’d crossed only hours before...

The demon.

Not a mindless fiend tearing flesh from bone.

Not a shadow lurking in the ruins of a village.

Just a figure perched on an old stone marker, tail flicking lazily like a cat’s, horns curling to points that caught the light of the sinking sun.

In its hand, a sword of fire, flickering low and gentle like a dying campfire.

I felt my pulse quicken.

Innocence, strapped to my back, should have vibrated with righteous heat. It should have drawn my arm, forced my strike. But…

Nothing.

I unslung it, feeling its weight. The holy metal glowed faintly in the dusk, but it was quiet. As if it, too, was waiting.

---

I stepped closer. The demon didn’t flinch. It barely looked at me, eyes fixed on the endless plain that turned gold and rose beneath the sunset.

I cleared my throat, the kind of thing you do when you’re about to greet a neighbor, not a nightmare.

“Why aren’t you fighting?”

It turned then. Its eyes deep crimson, but not alight with hunger. They looked tired, if a demon’s eyes could ever look tired.

It didn’t speak right away. Just breathed in, let the wind tug at its hair, its cloak.

Then it said, voice low but clear:

“Would you rather I did?”

---

I sheathed Innocence, lowering myself onto the stone beside it. I half expected it to lash out, teeth, claws, flame. Instead, it scooted over politely, as if making room for a friend.

We sat like that, shoulder to shoulder.

The last warmth of the day on our skin.

My sword at my side, a flaming blade flickering quietly at its.

I asked, because I had to:

“Why are you here?”

It twitched its tail, tapping the stone once, twice.

“I wanted to see it.” it murmured. “The world when it’s quiet.”

I stared. A thousand sermons I’d heard from priests and scholars. *Demons know only chaos, they crave ruin.* Yet here it was, sighing as the wind stirred the grass.

---

I thought about the bodies behind me. I thought about how Innocence had burned my hand once, forcing me to swing it at a man whose eyes were wide with regret.

I glanced down at the demon’s sword. Fire that did not roar, did not sear. A candle in a storm.

I said, before I knew why:

“Do you regret it? The battles, the blood?”

It snorted softly, almost a laugh, though there was no joy in it.

“We were born for ruin. Same as you were born for deliverance. What is there to regret?”

*But then...* it added, voice smaller, “Sometimes I wonder… if there’s more than ruin.”

---

The sun sank lower, drowning itself in the plain’s distant edge.

Neither of us moved.

My Innocence stayed quiet.

The demon’s flames guttered and flared, then calmed again.

For that one moment, we were not hero and nightmare. Not hunter and hunted.

Just two souls sitting where the wind could touch us.

When the last light bled out, the demon rose, brushing dust from its cloak.

It looked down at me, something unreadable in those crimson eyes.

“Next time...” it said, “We’ll have to fight.”

 “Yes."" I said, and I meant it.

It bowed its horned head, respectful, sad.

Then it was gone, fading into the dusk, flame trailing behind like a memory of warmth.

I sat there a little longer, Innocence resting across my knees.

It did not hum.

It did not burn.

It was as quiet as I felt inside.",47
1lv78kp,n241vln,"I look at the TV, where the news are talking about the ""Dark Sun"".  
A villain that appeared a few weeks ago, and did the unthinkable.  
An entire Hero Organization disbanded, because of the failure they faced against ""Dark Sun"".  
A governmental branch was destroyed, and the secrets there caused a nation wide protest against the government.  
And the villain successfully kidnapped a hero that is yet to be found.  
I look back, to see that hero, making me breakfast.  
Yes...I am Dark Sun, but I am no villain or am I?  
I am a Hero who thought that turning to the dark side a bit would be fun...never imagining I would enjoy it so much.



Oh boy.  
Why is it so easy for me to be a villain?  
And why is it so much more satisfying?  
And most importantly...why do I feel I did more good while being a villain, than as a Hero?  
""Honey? You alright?"" David, also known as ""Captain Strength"" asks, bringing the breakfast to the table.  
I nod.  
""A bit weird to see my villain-self being so popular."" I say.  
He chuckles.  
We have been together for 2 years, but only as a villain did I dare to ask him to move in with me...  
Weird, right?



""You were never the typical hero though, ""Miss Sunshine"".  
You vaporized villains' attacks, and complained about not being able to vaporize them altogether.  
And let's be honest the Hero Department of this country was terrified of you, as you never allowed them to go over your decisions. Though, due to this, you had more missions than anyone else in this country, no wonder you burnt-out."" he says, handing me the jam.

""I like this new you. Otherwise, we might still be meeting only once a week, and not daily how we do it now."" he winks.  
I smile.

  
After breakfast, I ran to the bank to ""borrow"" some money, and then gave it to some orphanages I knew that had problems.  
Seriously. He is so right.  
I feel so much better, freer, confident as a villain.  
No rules, no idiotic bureaucracy, no ""bigger picture"" to be taken into consideration, no helping the real villains like the corrupt idiots.  
This is my calling.  
Though, if I am going to be honest, having to fight some of the idiot coworkers I had is fun, but having to fight some of my old friends is a bit conflicting.  
As I fly by a store, I notice a rather nice dress.

Doing whatever you want, and not having 100 missions to accomplish a day, yet feeling as if you did nothing, is wonderful.",112
1lv78kp,n2448v7,"""Please don't tell me that's the primary reason.""

Stringer was following me. I didn't really care. She could be a threat, but wasn't stupid enough to become one. 

""Yes, that's the primary reason."" I wasn't exactly running away from my former tag-along-and-pretend-they're-my-sidekick, but I had heard about a rally being held by a local white supremacist, and was looking forward to popping his skull. It was so much more satisfying than saving people directly. 

Stringer blinked in front of me, facing me with her hands on her hips. I forgot she could do that. 

""You became a serial killer to *pay your mortgage?!* I would have paid your bills, you idiot!"" She clearly didn't understand. 

""It was the principal of the thing. I've saved over twenty people with a combined net worth greater than any individual on the planet, and I was overdrafting. That's bullshit. Now I can just manifest money. And revenge.""

Stringer looked conflicted. I knew she agreed with me. 

""There's no point in trying to say I don't..."" she let her shoulders fall. ""I get it."" 

""You agree with me.""

""It's complicated."" She looked down, but I could read her system. Her logical parts were the ones that agreed with me. Her heart was angry that I was doing what she wanted to. 

*""Stringer moved out of my way and walked beside me.""* My voice took on a lilting quality, like it arose from the air itself and not my voice. Stringer started walking next to me. Her heart was now angry at me, directly. 

""The alternative was fighting or leaving you behind. If I were a punching hero, I'd have punched you."" I kept walking. Stringer was fully aware of my singular ability, and huffed. 

""You could have told me you were struggling."" She said, in a defensive voice. 

""It's illegal for you to pay me for my services, and it's illegal for me to use my ability to benefit myself, materially. How lucky to be the one with *Authorship* in this damned society. I can't even apply for a loan, because I affect the outcome. I could only earn money through luck, and even then I got investigated when I won a scratch off."" I said all of this in a monotone, because speaking emotionally would influence Stringer. It didn't happen with everyone, but she had a weakness to it. 

She got a little in front of me as if to stop me, and then fell back in step. ""You know I'd have taken care of you."" 

""You know you'd have been disbarred immediately. They know you have an empathy link with me. They'd assume you pulled strings no matter how small. You're as crippled as I am."" 

""I did that voluntarily."" She said, defensively. ""I was sick of finding you beat up. I still don't understand why you didn't just tell people to walk away and give up crime.""

I sighed. ""Because that was a crime. It's not within their set of accepted reactions, so making them do it is considered mind magic, and therefore evil. I'm not *allowed* to set paths for people that actually help them. That would be *wrong*.""

She balled her fists and her knuckles cracked. One of those ""pollution eating"" trees they planted all over the downtown area exploded its leaves off of it. Stringer winced. I didn't. 

""You agree with me."" I said, again. Stringer could tell when I was using my authorship. It was one of the reasons I disliked her. I could talk like this with her, and she didn't accuse me of trying to change her mind if I wasn't. I disliked her for it because of how safe I felt around her. It made me sloppy.

She took in a deep breath, keeping stride with me. ""Maybe I do. Maybe I just broke the Enhanced Human Code of Conduct Section 2 Article 1: Public destruction of property due to unauthorized release of power.""

I chuckled. ""You're Stringer. You couldn't possibly not do that. Which is why you agree with me."" We were getting closer to the venue. Stringer could stop me, but I didn't think she would. I squinted through the park, and saw the speaker on the other side. 

I stopped dead and looked up as Stringer tripped. I had caught her by surprise. 

*""The stewardess ejects the plane's waste system against company policy... now. It strikes the speaker in the head, killing him.""*

Stringer took a step, caught herself, and turned around. She had a mad look in her face. *""DID YOU JUST COMMIT A MURDER IN FRONT OF ME?""* She was much more upset than I thought warranted. 

""No, I made sure to do it behind your back while you were tripping, which I knew you would do, because I authored it before you even found me."" She started to look furious, and I added, ""One-time thing! It was loaded in the sidewalk.""

Stringer opened her mouth to respond as the sounds of screams erupted from the other side of the park. I had missed it, but there was a large splatter of blood, and many people were running. 

""Looks like we were too late to help."" I said, mock-sadness. ""Too bad you tripped. How unlucky. Besides. That was a tragic accident.""

Stringer narrowed her eyes. ""You set this up before now. That was too quick. It would take longer for that to fall from the plane.""

I smiled, and gestured to a man that was running directly toward us. He had recognized Stringer, in her ridiculous leather outfit, and was calling for help as if *he* would ever matter enough to warrant killing. 

*""Clarence forgot about the rally this morning and stayed home, unexpectedly deciding to help his black neighbor watch her grandchildren, bonding with her and giving up his grudges.""* 

Stringer's mouth fell open as the man simply *wasn't there*. He didn't fade away. He just wasn't there. 

""Sorry to burst your bubble, but if everything I could do were on file, I'd already be in jail."" I smiled, but it was an empty smile. 

""I hate that I don't hate you."" Stringer said, clearly unsure of what emotion to be feeling. The sidewalk vibrated as she tried to contain her emotions. 

*""Stringer wasn't able to find me today. She arrived at this park to find the scene already as it is now. She knows I was here, and remembers this rewite. She finds she can string her emotions into the ground directly, and knows I did this so that she wouldn't blow up this park. She is not thankful.""*

Her face had a flash instant of anger, and then she froze as I spoke, the. shifted about five feet back from where we were standing. When she looked in my direction, *""Zero stayed home this morning and arranged this from there.""*

Standing on the sidewalk alone, Stringer cracked her knuckles, and nothing happened. She started to cry.",51
1lv78kp,n241ucv,"So...I'm not longer broke.  Its been a day.  I'm rich.  Clean rich off one job.
Wow
How do I launder money again?  Been awhile since my teen years and too much booze makes it hazy.  Wild days those.
I think I...don't want to go back to work with the others.  I'm done.  DONE!  Screw em.  One single check from a billionaire for blackmailing them and I never have to work again.  How far can I take this?  Will I keep getting money if I keep blackmailing the same dude?  Nah, shift it.  
Okok.  New life.  New rules.  Rule 1, don't steal from hospitals or children.  Rule 2, nothing.  I can do whatever I want.
...

What DO I want
Just then, as I sat there lost in thought, a vagabond snatched my bag and took off.  I deftly flicked my wrist and my swarm of drones suddenly defended on him, carried him over, and tossed him flat on his belly.
""You twerp."" YES.  No reputation to ruin.  Let him have it.  I kicked him.  YES.  I kept kicking.  I dint even WANT that bag, the money is in my wallet.  I just wanted to beat him.  I kept kicking.
""AHHHHH!  Help me!""  He cried out.  I pulled out my autostitcher and a zipper.  I sewed a zipper to his lips and sealed them.  I kept kicking while two druids walked out of the alley to hold him flat for me.  MORE.  I send the message via the headband, and the droids started stepping on him.  Not crushing, but hurting. It was going to change around here.  Its going to change everywhere.  It started to rain.  I kept kicking. 
Eventually I got bored and had the drones ID the dude and put him at home in bed.  I sat back on the bench.  
""What a legal day"" I quipped to nobody.  Hmm.  Alone.  Not used to that.
Then, across the road, I saw him.  My old teammate.  Damn.  He specializes in stealth, how long has he been there??
""YOU!"" I snarled.  He tried to run, but the drones already had him.  He pressed a button and an interference rang through my head as the EMP disabled the cloaking systems and drones rained from the sky.  Druids went to a knee, emulating the agony I felt through the haptic EKG band on my head.  Lights went out, my night vision cut, and I had to reboot my systems.  When I looked again, he had vanished.
Shit.  No way he didn't see.  No way he doesn't tell them where I went.  I'm in it now.",12
1lv78kp,n24frql,"It's impossible for them not to be in love, but the degree to which they hate each other fluctuates. 

*This* story would end with them together, Stringer half heartedly asking Zero to prevent the end of the world, and Zero claiming they can't, but really, their deepest wish is for only two of them to survive... so they let it happen. 

(Truthfully, Zero has written them an entire universe to exist in together, safely. No one dies. They just stop being here and start being there, as the Author dictates)

Stringer and Zero are two of the characters I use in a lot of my stories, which sort of take place in their own, connected universe. Zero has a different name, but *this* narrative won't allow me to use it.

This is a one-off, and would actually have an ending. So it's Zero, not The One, which is why you're not sure if they end up together. 

(My stories all have pretty interesting constraints on them. The tree thing has layers of logic, and I could explain the physics of what happened. If you woke up with stringer's power, you'd blow leaves off trees, too. I don't write things that aren't like this. It's fiction, but the stories are genuine within the worlds.)",15
1lvb8yt,n24o9vq,"After years of no progress in my research, and no book, tome or any fellow wizard being able to help me, I turned to liches.  
After all, they are mages, and other beings that turned themselves into undead to have more time to research magic.  
I look at the address given to me by a friend.  
Yep, I am in the right place.  
I knock on the hut's door...and a deer opens the door, and leaves.  
A chuckle follows.  
""Sorry! She was just here for our morning tea! Come in."" a cheerful voice says, and as I enter, I saw them...  
The lich I am supposed to meet, wearing an apron over their skeletal body, making...a pie?

  
""Astorus von Medelea, nice to meet you."" he says, hands completely white with flour.  
I shake them.  
""Metis Levera, it's my pleasure.  
Thank you for accepting this meeting, I wonder if my friend told you what this is about?"" I ask, sitting down, at the table.  
He nods, as he puts the pie into the oven.  
""You are stuck on the research concerning whether more meridians exist hidden inside a human's body, which if awakened could potentially help mages become stronger, and have an easier time to engrave further Spell Circles onto their heart, thus advancing in rank, right?"" he asks.  
I nod, excited, as it seems, he knows about the topic.



""Roughly 10 thousand years ago, there was an Empire up north founded by what today are called ""barbarians"", while their spirit was heavily inflicted with bloodthirst, due to their proximity to the Forbidden Tundra, thus unable to properly learn spells, they developed magic to an incredible degree. They studied their bodies, and enhanced them with magic, creating entire new organs, meridians, blood vessels, and more.  
That is why their descendants today are referred to as ""humanoid beasts."" he says, sitting down at the table, bringing snacks, and refreshments.  
""So it is possible! With more meridians to share the burden of the mana passing through us, we could potentially enhance our circles, make them sturdier, and overall, be able to control more mana!"" I say.  
He nods, then sighs.  
""But your research has to be more thorough."" he says.  
I frown.

  
""In what ways?"" I ask.  
""That Empire was of northerners, their bodies naturally stronger, due to the constant exposure to a rather unfriendly environment. If you tried the same methods, you would probably explode due to the excess energy.  
You have to study herbology, and anatomy to a high degree, and be able to create a universal method! Don't worry, I will help!"" he says, conjuring thousands of books, and scrolls.  
I freeze.  
Before I could say I already have some ideas on how to do it for humans from the Central Empires, he puts two scrolls into my hand, his eyes sparkling...literally.  
I knew liches are mad about researches, but this...  
""Let's set us a small goal: make a viable solution for humans all over the world in a century, and for demi-humans in the next thousand years!"" he says...disappearing.  
I stare at the scrolls floating around me, and sigh...  
He does know my lifespan as a rank-9 mage is only 1000 years, right?",37
1lvg6i7,n25ogix,"""Enough? Or you need more?"" I ask.  
The man stares at me horrified, and then at the still dripping with blood limbs.  
""Oh, don't worry.  
They already grew back!"" I say, waving with my new hand, and hopping on my new leg.  
He turned around, and emptied his stomach.  
I sigh.  
Why do the town folks always do this?

  
After the man calmed down, he did take my arm, and leg.  
And he gave me the deeds to a small house, with a garden, but asked for me to stay a bit.  
""I, as a mage, have yet to see someone like you.  
That regeneration was instantaneous. Why...how...  
You didn't even flinch."" he says.  
I frown.  
""You? A mage? But you fell ill just by the sight of my limbs?  
The geezers and hags back home did this and much more to beasts, demons, and me, without hesitation, in name of the ""research""."" I say.  
He pales.

  
""Wait. You weren't born like this?"" he asks.  
I shrug.  
""Dunno. Geezer Tobi used to say they found me in the lair of a 9-headed serpent, alive in the pool of poison it had for its offspring, eating some Earth Shattering bear corpse.  
So, I assume I was born with strong vitality, but then the geezers and hags did run a lot of tests on me, and the regeneration became stronger."" I say.  
The horror in his eyes, is palpable.  
""My God...where did you grow up?"" he asks.  
""A village in the mountains, North from here. Took me...hmm, 19 days of running to reach this town."" I say.  
He freezes.

  
""B-but we-we are the northernmost settlement, north from here is basically wilderness filled with beasts, monsters, and demonic influences."" he says.  
""Yep. That's about right."" I say.  
""And...you grew up there?"" he continued.  
I nod.  
""Did you learn magic?"" he asks, finally some color to his face.  
I nod.  
""Yeah, but I wasn't smart, barely managed to learn 8th series elemental spells, and dimensional shift before running away."" I sigh.  
The terror came back into his complexion.  
I smiled, thanked him and left, before he fell ill again.  
The geezers and hags of the village were right.  
The outside world is colorful, but a bit soft...not that I complain.  
I like it. So many people...and many are of my age!  
I am eager to start my life.",6
1lurj9t,n20ghqa,"I was drunk off mead, and narrowly avoided the king's wrath with a well-timed fart.

If I hadn't had beans... if I hadn't had cheese...

That laughing.... fool.

I wandered the halls in motley, my room had been destroyed when I'd gotten there. A few of the soldiers hadn't taken my hurried attempts at salvaging my act... my life very well.

I'd always prided myself on reading people well. And at this point, I knew that if I fell asleep in this castle, I wouldn't be waking up.

When your life is on the line, you start to consider possibilities you never would before. 

I stare out of the parapet and feel the wind blowing at me across the lake. Freezing wind, and yet the stone felt warm to the touch. I took one last swig of mead to steady my nerves and grabbed hold of the ledge.

I am going to live.

I hear footsteps and laughter as soldiers or servants start to approach. I drop quickly and hold onto the stone. I had tumbled a bit as part of my act for a few years, so I had the grip strength. The wind slammed me against the castle walls and I could feel my grip straining. 

I reached out with my hand and grabbed hold of another stone. I planted my foot on a stone barely thicker than my thumbnail. I made my ascent. 

It would be one thing to flee. But without clothes, without food, with the announcement of the hunting party... they'd be coming after me. There's no way for me to survive in the woods.

The wind grew colder and the stones grew warmer as I climbed. Each moment felt like my lungs would freeze and my hands would burn. Still, I climbed.

I am going to live.

I could hear it now. The breathing, the slow drawing of breath of a monstrosity. The stones hurt to even touch. I clenched my eyes shut, trying to block out the pain. The wind forced me against the wall and I bit the stone to avoid screaming, sure I'd chipped a tooth.

I am going to live.

I reach the top of the tower and scramble to find purchase. I'm sweating. The air is humid and suffocating, except for the brief moments of wind that manage to fight their way through the nearly impenetrable heat.

On the tower, lies a scaled beast. Larger than any cottage, larger than a dozen horses. Wings that could encompass the sky and darken the sun. Crimson Red. Growing darker in color as they go towards its face, until they appear nearly black.

I catch my breath until I see a yellow eye staring at me. Teeth, pointed and sharp lightly appear as it opens its maw.

I walk forward in my scorched and torn motley with open arms amd give a bow.

""I do apologize, but I was looking for the lavatory."" I said pleasantly. Which seemed to stop it, just enough to confuse it.",215
1lurj9t,n20571q,"""Is this a prank?
Will the knights chain me mid-flight, as you humans laugh at my wails and struggling for?"" it asks.
I smile.
""If it is a prank.
It will be my last."" I say, opening the cage wide open, before going inside to free the dragon from the chains.
It stares at me, unblinkingly.
I free its limbs, and wings.
""You are free."" I say.

Gently walking out the cage, the dragon turns around.
""The guards?"" it asks.
""Sleep powder in the wine I brought them."" I say.
""The king and the mages?"" it continues.
""Gone for the Autum Hunt, to the Eastern estate."" I say.
It stares at me.
""So tonight...
I can go...freely?"" it asks.
I nod.
""Why?"" it asks again.

""As I said.
Nobody deserves to be anybody's toy, and plaything."" I say.
""Like you?"" it asks.
I nod.
""Like me."" I smile.
""For freeing me, the Dragon Kingdom can take you in.
I am..."" it starts, but I stop the dragon.
""No thank you.
My wings are long rotten, and fallen who knows where."" I say.
It stares at me.


""I am saying the truth human...I..."" it starts again.
""Even you, after mere months of going through being a decoration, a toy, a pet found it strange and find it strange to be free...
I have been the jester for 2 decades.
I have been used, thoroughly, and I feel no more."" I say.
It nods.
""I see. It is a lie, but I can understand your will being broken after such a long period of...torture.
But if you would truly be broken you wouldn't have saved me.
So I apologize, but I must do this."" it says, and before I could react I was knocked out.
When I came to my senses, we were high up in the clouds.
I don't know when...but I started laughing.
Not my jester laugh, no...but real, honest laugh.
The dragon roared with me, as we flew deep into the mountains.
Whatever was to come...will be better than what was before.",224
1lurj9t,n22fkn9,"
It was all too easy for him to sneak off. Nobody cared about an errant jester. In the brightest colors in the kingdom and a theater mask, he was invisible. Soon enough, he found a shiny bronze key in his hand. How strange! *Nobody* could *ever* have expected this!

He knew he was going to die doing this. Like Icarus, he was going to plummet the moment he grasped freedom. Shame he couldn't tell the story himself—it would've been incredible. Maybe the next entertainer would remember him. Personally, he didn't think he was worth remembering, but this stunt might just make it happen.

(He wondered if these few moments of true freedom were worth death. Did Icarus smile as he fell?)

It was dark, but as the Jester approached the cage, he could see bright golden eyes peer out at him from the darkness. If he was as delusional as he pretended to be, he might have seen their rage.

The Dragon looked, but was silent. It knew its place.

He fumbled for the lock in the dark, inserted the key, and turned. As soon as the familiar click of the lock sounded, the mindless beast surged forward, talons reaching out, sharp and deadly, ready to claw and bite until their was nothing left. It charged forward—and stopped, as the chains went taut.

Ah, the illusion of freedom. Wings of wax. The Jester was quite familiar.

But this would be no illusion. As soon as the Dragon had stopped struggling, the Jester stepped forward. Instead of attacking, the beast startled. Unfamiliarity was startling, and the blatant disregard for safety must have confused the beast. The Jester wasn't scared—he knew he would die here. It was the Dragon's choice whether that would end with it being freed or not.

He slowly unlocked all of the chains. The Dragon was still, only moving to watch him. Processing, perhaps. Finally, as he unlocked the Dragon's final limb—its left wing, it slowly leaned down, revealing the rope tied tightly around its muzzle. It was removed only to allow the dragon to eat and drink.

The Jester pulled out a stolen knife, and the Dragon reared back, terrified. Didn't it know that it was the one in control here? Didn't it know that, starved as it wass, it could have killed him in seconds? (Could have melted his waxen wings in mere moments?)

It'd been here for a long time. The Jester remembered his grandfather speaking wistfully of the day it was caught, the day the *evil beast* was conquered. So long, that it had forgotten freedom.

A couple moments passed, and the Dragon slowly, carefully lowered its head down. A single well-placed cut, and it was free.

It stared soundlessly at him for a few moments. Then it opened its jaws, and a low growl came out, a growl that sounded like—""*Why?*""

The Jester stopped. He hadn't realized the Dragon could speak. He hadn't realized it was *sapient*.

It chittered something strange sounding—the draconic language, the Jester realized—before asking again in a low voice. ""Why?""

The Jester did not answer. He hadn't used his voice for anything other than entertainment in years. Why should he use it now? He turned to leave—and talons slammed down on ground behind him, kicking up a significant amount of dust.

""WHY?!"" it roared, glaring at him, desperation filling its voice.

The Jester looked back, smiling behind his mask. ""Careful now, you'll wake the guards."" He said, a playful lilt to his voice.

The beast gazed at him in bewilderment. It paused for a moment, trying to remember the right words. It only knew the human language through observation, listening to those who passed by its cage.

""Who... are you?"" It murmured, cautiously moving forward.

The Jester shrugged. He wasn't anyone at all. ""I'm nothing."" he finally decided, ""Merely a tool for entertainment.""

The Dragon made a soft rumble. It struggled for a few moments to find the words. ""...Like... me...?"" 

The Jester smiled sadly. ""No."" he said, with utmost patience. ""I am not like you. You are free. I will never be.""

(Wax or not, you still need wings to fly.)

The Dragon's eyes hardened. It lowered its head—like a bow—to stare the Jester in the eyes.

""No. I will.... help. Help you. You free me... I free you."" It growled with determination.

The Jester laughed. ""You cannot help me. There is nothing left of me to help. There never was. You should go do... whatever it is dragons do.""

(How could he be free if he'd never known freedom? He didn't know *how* to be free.)

The Dragon did not understand this. It could not understand. Intelligent as it was, it was not a human.

It could not understand, but it knew this was a *lie*.

""You are... lost. Confused. *Sad.* I will help you."" Then, it bared its teeth in some imitation of a human smile. ""I will.. teach you. To be free.""

The Jester chuckled. ""Whatever do you mean by th—"" 

A talon wrapped around him. Gently, of course—the Dragon would never want to hurt his new friend, after all. Great wings stretched out to their full length for the first time in decades.

Wings flapped, and Icarus *soared.*",52
1lurj9t,n21r2cx,"""I know what it's like...to be a victim of power.""

The dragon looked closely at the Jester. There was a weary look in his eyes. The kind of man who has felt the desperation and helplessness of being held down and cannot escape from it, but cannot bring himself to let another face the same wrath.

The door unlocked. Slowly but surely, the dragon stepped out. He looked at the Jester one more time. ""You have shown more kindness,"" the dragon began, ""than any so called human in this kingdom. I am forever in your debt.""

""I ask for nothing,"" the jester said. ""All I wish is that you do not suffer the same fate as I have.""

The dragon stayed silent for a while. ""Then let us both be free from shackles.""

Huffing and puffing, the dragon ascended skywards, crashing through the roof and high in the air. *There is kindness in this world after all,* the dragon said. *The cruel, however, must be purged.*

And without hesitation, he fired.",49
1lurj9t,n22k4nf,"	The beast was beautiful.

	Royal blue scales that turned to violet in harsh sunlight. A body bigger than any extravagant carriage even the king could afford and then some. Spines running down its back like an exposed spine. Teeth about the size of my arm. And those eyes–terrifyingly beautiful, full of intelligence, glittering like gold.

	I had happened to hide in the dungeon evading capture yet again by the “Savages”–a particularly non-savage, ridiculous group of friends that all worked for the king as guards around the castle. As with any “group” within the castle, they were corrupt and enabling. And they thought it was funny to bully me, the court jester, when the king already did enough of that for them. Every time I leave for my chambers, they’re always in hot pursuit, giggling and calling out for the clown to come entertain them.

	I was already on edge because of the way the king had glared at me, not laughed, when I made an admittedly ill-timed joke about horses’ hooves right after one of his sons had been trampled to death by horses. I was well sure I would be hanged the next day, so my mind was on how to laugh and joke my way out of trouble until the Savages showed up and tried to make me dance for them. So, I ran to the dungeon. And I found the dragon.

	Vaguely, I recalled hearing about a dragon recently being found and slain near the kingdom’s borders, but I didn’t care for it or bother to listen to the rumors. But now, those rumors were standing right in front of me. Glaring at me.

	“...Good dragon.”

	I muttered halfheartedly as I backed towards the door I had come in through. The Savages were one thing. Getting cooked alive by an angry dragon was a whole other. I would prefer to not die that way.

	The dragon huffed, steam billowing out of its nostrils. It opened its mouth slightly–it couldn’t open it too wide due to a massive metal muzzle around its snout–and made a weird sound. No… no, it was trying to speak.

	“Get out,” it said more clearly this time, chains clinking as it shifted stance slightly. It didn’t seem to have much room to move because of the shackles holding it to the floor, the wall, everything. The sound of metal scraping metal reminded me of the jingle of my own bells.

	“Gladly!” I was so relieved. It didn’t intend to kill me. Great! Now I could just forget I ever say anything. I hurried to the door and pushed it open, only to hear familiar voices outside.

	“Where’d the little sneak go?”

	“You think…?”

	“No, he’s not that coo-coo. Let’s check his chambers.”

	I slowly closed the door. Okay, maybe the dragon isn’t that bad of company.

	I turned back to the majestic beast. It seemed to be regarding me, not like I was food like any wild dragon would, but like I was an interesting specimen being studied for science. I waved to it, smiling. It obviously didn’t wave back.

	I began to wonder why this thing was even here. It clearly wasn’t dangerous–I would have been incinerated already. I was about 90% sure no king, even the crazy man I worked for, would capture a dragon to eat it or flaunt it. Usually, dragons are just hunted for sport or so they don’t harm people near them. Why would the king want a dragon down here, go through the effort of feeding and chaining it…? Then again, why would the king go through the effort of feeding and keeping me here just to make some terrible jokes and make his court laugh?

	…Now wait a damn minute.",18
1lurj9t,n237pnb,"""Hey man, you realize I'm about to roast the shit out of this entire place if you let me do this... right?""

Santius was without question the funniest dragon the Never-Ending Jungle had ever seen. Everyone knew who he was, not necessarily for his comedy, but for the destruction caused at his final show. We all knew dragons could be a bit dangerous when they were drinking, but no one was prepared for just how destructive they could get when they start laughing uncontrollably.

""Of course I know that."" I replied. ""That's the entire point. I'm sick and tired of this high-brow, obnoxious king of ours.""

Today is March 1st, better known as King's Day in Daycora. Believe it or not, King's Day is basically just an annual opportunity to kiss our majesty's royal ass as much as possible. As jester, I get the privilege every year to provide entertainment.

""That damn king has had me locked up for 14 years"" snarled Santius as I began jostling my key into the lock around his neck.

My comedy shows typically slay, but the shows on King's Day always have the crowd (and most importantly the king), absolutely bent over with laughter. Everyone except the damn dragons. No matter how hard I try, I can not get them to laugh.

""Look Santius, I'm sick and tired of this king too. A guy can only do a song and dance for so long before he snaps.""

I had been trying for years to get the dragons to laugh so hard that I invoked a Santius-level incident, but I simply couldn't break through the human/dragon comedy barrier. Luckily, even though they hated human comedy, that had to show up at least once a year for King's Day.

""I can't wait."" Replied Santius ""My old material was fire enough, but I've been down here for 14 years with nothing to do but write jokes... It's going to be a bloodbath""

Ahh a bloodbath. Exactly what I was hoping for. I can't wait to see the King's face when Santius emerges on stage. The last laugh will finally be mine

""You're gonna kill it"" I said as a handed Santius the microphone. I smiled as he turned around and started ascending towards center stage.",12
1lurj9t,n20glkq,"I smile despite the growing pain in my feet or the discomfort of my skin.


""Actually, if I stay here, I'm going to die."" It regarded me with a look of curiosity, and I saw the brilliant white diamond embeded on its forehead.


""I'm going to live."" I say to the beast as it raises its head. ""The king will kill me. But he'll keep you alive. He's commanded you to stay and to kill anyone who would try to take his control for themselves. I heard it. I was there, just a child, but you remember?"" I said, noticing the light scars and cracked scales from an army approcaching the mighty beast. I could feel the heat of an impatient snort.


""He never said..."" I coughed as the sweat clogged my throat. ""He never said... to kill... someone who'd remove it."" The heat was growing worse. I felt as if I was back beneath the castle's shadow, staring into the blacksmith's fire.


""I... I can..."" I could barely breathe. The heat. It was...
The dragon's maw opened and I could feel it not believe me. Could see the shine on the diamond coercing action. I could see the flames dancing inside its throat.


""No one... deserves... to be... a toy."" I manage as I feel my lungs begin to fail. I start to fall, and feel the stones melting and burning the soles of my feet. I could feel it begin to burn my cheek.


Then air, as I'm lifted gently. Not enough to breathe, but enough to wake. I open my eyes, and see the tail holding me up.


As I lean onto the beast's tail, I feel the touch of a diamond on my finger, as it guides me to the gem.
For the briefest moment, I felt the rush of power as it's mind became my possession. Then I ripped it out.
A stone shattering roar shook the air, the stones, the kingdom itself.


All I could feel was the tight grip of a talon around my chest and the blustering cold air, as the castle and lake faded from view.",216
1lurj9t,n22k5pt,"“You… dragon, why are you here? You’d think that, by the time they dragged you down here, you’d be dead already for your scales. Why?”

	The dragon laid its head down onto its forelimbs, still looking at me with that curiosity. I winced as I got a better look at its face that was definitely beautiful and not horridly scary in the slightest.

	“To entertain him, of course. You are his jester, are you not? You can relate. He will come down here and make me struggle for his entertainment. But why would you care? You are a human, too. You are part of his court. You can’t do… what are you doing?”

	My treacherous hands were already flipping over the locks on the shackles of the dragon’s forelimbs. I feared being crushed or bitten so close to the dragon’s face, yes, but since the king is likely to have my head by tomorrow, did it matter anymore?

	“Freeing you,” I answered, picking up a stick and jamming it in the lock. Nothing. This would be harder than I thought. 

“You’re… freeing me?”

“No one deserves to be the king’s plaything. I know that better than anyone else. Kill me if you must, but I hope you can escape. I hate seeing dragons killed, and hate seeing anything alive be harmed even more.”

	Finally, I managed to make the lock click and fall off the dragon. It moved that freed limb, standing up again. It growled low in its throat. It overshadowed me so much, but nonetheless, I went for the next lock.

	“...Thank you, jester. I will not forget this kindness…”

	I looked up at it and grinned.

	“You’re welcome. You can just break through the walls, right? Once I free you, go. I’m already a dead man.”

	“What kind of monster would I be if I didn’t save my hero? Is he going to have you hung?”

	“...Yes.” I blinked, confused. The next lock fell.

	“Then you will come with me, of course. You are a kind human. Very rare around these parts. It is only fair for me to help the one who helped me.”",17

""You good, John?  
You do drink heavy on weekends, but today you are especially eager to drown yourself."" Matt, the bartender asks.  
I sigh.  
""The Armageddon is hours away, and I am trying to numb myself before it hits."" I say.  
Matt smiles, while some other patrons start laughing.  
Ignorance is a bliss, isn't it?  
I work at the observatory and know a bit more.

  
""So...Johnny boy, what is this Armageddon this time?"" an old timer asks me, slurring his words.  
I sigh.  
""A rather basic, and sad scenario.  
An asteroid will hit us soon."" I say.  
They laugh, this time, even Matt.  
""Again? Just in the last few years like 30? 40? of them ""hit"" us?"" they laugh.  
I order another round for all of us, ignoring them.  
Matt might have realized this is serious.

  
""If it really happens...what would it be like?"" he asks.  
I down the glass of beer, and sigh.  
""It seems that it will hit the ocean, but sadly for us, it's roughly 18km in diameter."" I say.  
They don't really understand what it means.  
""And?"" Matt continues.  
""Let's just say coastal cities won't be a thing anymore, and the coast itself will move tens if not hundreds of kilometers inland.  
Ocean life will go bye-bye, weather goes to shit, an ice-age happens due to the vapors and clouds that would darken the world.  
Long story short: dinosaur extinction scenario, but worse, as Chicxulub asteroid was 10-ish km."" I sigh, ordering yet another round.  
This time, the mood was gone.

  
""Ha-ha, John, you are so funny."" one of the patrons say.  
I sigh.  
Just then alarms ring on the phones.  
""2 hours? Why just now?!"" Matt shouts, looking at me.  
I shrug.  
""Hopeful idiots thought it will pass-by us like everything else...I told them, it's certain, however unlikely certainty is on the space-scale, but they didn't believe.  
We are safe-ish, initially at least, and we have farmlands.  
I suggest you suck up to some farmers, and start building fences, and stockpiling resources.  
Shit is about to hit the fan."" I say, as the other patrons run out.  
""You, John?"" Matt asks me, as he watches as I go behind the counter.  
""I made social media posts weeks ago, and paid my way into an interview...and was ignored.  
I am a-okay with whatever comes."" I say, taking more and more bottles off of the shelf.  
When it hits, the tremors will be felt here as well, and I don't want the good stuff to be destroyed.",13
1luwqoq,n21x4ii,"
My name is Dr. Eduardo Silva, and I was trying to create the world’s first dancing zombie. Which, in hindsight, sounds much more ridiculous than accidentally revolutionizing physics.

The project started as a joke for my nephew’s birthday party. Little Mateus loved those zombie video games, but he was only eight, so I thought I’d build him something fun and harmless—a small robotic figure that could shamble around and do a little samba. I called it “Zumbombi,” a terrible pun mixing “zumbi” and “bomba” that made me chuckle every time I said it.

My garage workshop in São Paulo was nothing fancy. Just workbenches covered in spare electronics, servo motors, Arduino boards, and enough coffee cups to caffeinate a small army. The Zumbombi itself was endearingly crude—about the size of a action figure, made from 3D-printed parts, with little LED eyes and articulated joints that let it wave its arms in what I generously called “dancing.”

The breakthrough happened completely by accident.

I was trying to solve a power problem. The little servo motors that made Zumbombi dance drained batteries too quickly, so I’d been experimenting with different energy sources. That Tuesday evening, I’d jury-rigged a small electromagnetic coil system—basically a tiny version of those wireless phone chargers, but hooked up to some radio frequency generators I’d salvaged from old equipment.

“Just need you to dance for more than five minutes, little guy,” I muttered, adjusting the frequency while Zumbombi sat motionless on my workbench. Outside, São Paulo’s traffic hummed its eternal song, and somewhere in the distance, my neighbor was playing samba music just a little too loud.

I flipped the switch.

The first thing I noticed was that Zumbombi started dancing without any programmed choreography. Not the jerky, pre-programmed movements I’d coded, but smooth, fluid motions like it was actually feeling the music from next door. Its little plastic hands moved in perfect rhythm, its head bobbed naturally, and somehow—impossibly—it was staying in time with music it had no way of hearing.

“Que legal,” I whispered, leaning closer. That’s when I noticed the glow.

Not from Zumbombi’s LED eyes, but from the electromagnetic coil itself. A soft, warm light that pulsed gently with the robot’s movements. And the temperature gauge on my multimeter was showing readings that made no sense—the coil was generating more energy than I was feeding into it.

Much more.

I grabbed my infrared thermometer and pointed it at the setup. The core temperature was climbing, but not in a dangerous way. It felt like… controlled warmth. Fusion-level energy output from components that should barely have powered a nightlight.

“Isso é impossível,” I said to my empty garage, but Zumbombi just kept dancing, unbothered by my existential crisis.

Then things got weird.

I reached for my notebook to record what was happening, but my hand passed through empty air and somehow grabbed the notebook anyway—from the other side of the workbench. Not telekinesis. The space between my hand and the notebook had just… shortened. Like distance was suddenly optional.

Zumbombi spun in place, and for a moment, I swear I saw multiple versions of it. Not shadows or afterimages, but actual duplicates occupying the same space, each one slightly different, as if I was seeing every possible dance move it could make simultaneously.

I blinked, and suddenly there were three Zumbombis on my workbench. Then five. Then a dozen, each one identical but wearing slightly different expressions on their little LED faces, each one dancing to its own internal rhythm.

“Meu Deus,” I breathed, sinking into my chair. “What have I done?”

The original Zumbombi—or at least, the one I thought was original—stopped dancing and turned its tiny head toward me. Its LED eyes flickered in what almost looked like a pattern. Three short flashes, three long, three short again.

SOS.

“You’re trying to communicate?” I asked, feeling only mildly insane for talking to a homemade robot.

The lights flickered again: short-short-long, long-short-short, short-long-short-short.

It was Morse code. “Hi.”

I stared at my creation—my multiple creations—as they continued their synchronized dance around the electromagnetic field. The energy readings kept climbing. Space kept bending. And my little dancing zombie was apparently trying to have a conversation.

“This is not what I signed up for when I decided to make a birthday present,” I told the Zumbombis.

They all turned to look at me at once, a coordinated movement that was both adorable and deeply unsettling. Their LED eyes flashed in unison: “Sorry.”

Over the next hour, as I tried to wrap my head around what was happening, I realized I’d stumbled into something extraordinary. The electromagnetic field wasn’t just powering Zumbombi—it was creating a localized distortion in spacetime. The energy signature suggested controlled nuclear fusion at a microscopic level. The multiple Zumbombis weren’t copies; they were the same robot existing in several dimensional states simultaneously.

And somehow, this impossible physics was stable, controlled, and apparently safe enough that I could sit two feet away from it while drinking coffee and questioning my sanity.

My phone buzzed. A text from my sister: “Is Mateus’s present ready? Party’s tomorrow!”

I looked at my workbench, where a dozen tiny robots were now engaged in what appeared to be an elaborate group dance routine, powered by clean fusion energy and casually violating several fundamental laws of physics.

“Almost,” I texted back. “Just working out a few… technical details.”

One of the Zumbombis flashed a message: “Fun party?”

I couldn’t help but smile. Whatever I’d accidentally discovered, whatever scientific principles I’d unknowingly revolutionized, I’d apparently created the world’s first interdimensional dancing robot with a sense of humor.

“Yeah, little guy,” I said. “It’s going to be quite a party.”

The Zumbombis all spun in place simultaneously, their tiny arms raised in celebration, while fusion energy hummed softly in my garage and space-time bent around us like we were the most natural thing in the world.

Mateus was going to love his birthday present. The Nobel Committee, on the other hand, was going to have some very interesting questions.",79
1luwqoq,n227t28,"A sharp crack. A hiss. Sparks. Things were out of focus. It took a moment for Rob's vision to unblur and yet another one for him to register he was witnessing Al open a new can of beer over the campfire. ""Maaan, I'm just way too fucking drunk"", Rob groaned. ""I think I'm already having a hangover, actually. Is that possible?"" He scratched his scraggly beard.

""Oooh, I know exactly what you need now."" Al grabbed into the cooler and dug around for a moment. Then he held out his hand to Rob, yet another can of cheap beer glistening in his hand. ""Here.""

""Dunno, man. Don't think another one of those is gonna help."" Rob yawned, and stretched. ""Maybe we should call it a night.""

""Come on! 'Hair of the dog that bit you' and all that. Have another one. It'll numb the pain."" Al downed his own beer in one go. The man was relentless. 

Rob stared at his long-term lab partner for a bit. ""How do you do it?"", he suddenly blurted out. ""Just...forget about everything.""

Al stared back, his face empty. For a brief second, a glimpse of emotion swept over his face. Anger? Sadness? Then, he shrugged. ""Isn't it obvious? I drink.""

""Still"", Rob insisted. ""Don't you ever wish you could go back and do differently? Amount to something? Actually find something *meaningful*?""

""No"", Al replied flatly.

""No?""

""No."" It sounded final, and there was hurt in Al's voice.

A moment of silence followed, only to be broken by the campfire's cracking. The two men looked into the rhythmic dance of the flames. Then Al spoke again.

""You know...after being driven out, ridiculed by the scientific community - *communities*, actually, remember, we thought we had solved nuclear fusion *and* FTL travel - what is there to amount to? Look, I don't know what got into us. For fuck's sake, you presented the Dean something your five-year-old had drawn as mathematical proof! How could that happen?""

""It's not like I didn't tell you!"", Rob defended himself. ""It was the damn die.""

""Yeah. Glad you threw the thing away.""

Rob didn't reply and clutched the small object he had hidden in his jacket pocket more tightly. Al's eye twitched.

""You didn't?"", Al asked. ""Rob, what the fuck! That thing is the sole reason we're sitting around a campfire on a Tuesday night, alone, instead of in our lab, surrounded by techs, or at a fucking conference getting shitfaced after our talk! That thing is the reason my wife - ""

""I know!"", Rob interjected. ""I know, I know. I just...couldn't.""

""Throw it into the lake right now. Throw it away right fucking now, you idiot!"" Al stood up and gestured wildly towards the dark mass of water glistening in the moonlight.

""I figured it could help us."", Rob mumbled glumly.

""Help us? Help us?!"" Al's shrill voice echoed through the woods as he bent towards Rob.

""Okay, calm down, man! That's enough."" Rob stood up and faced his friend. ""Look, the thing gave us fusion and FTL. And, yeah it took them away when we got too greedy, but I figured, it could help us go back and do things differently this time.""

""Okay, sure, just roll the Cosmic fucking Die Of Everything and hope it gives you...what? Time travel?"" The sarcasm in Al's reply cut deeply, but Rob knew it came from pain. Rob knew Al wanted to go back, to try again, as much as he was. He was just afraid.

""Well, I've thought about it. And I might have...modified it a little."" He pulled out the die. Its white surface glistened in the campfire's light. He had engraved TIME TRAVEL into all six of its sides. ""See? No chance of failure. I just need to roll it.""

For a second, both men looked at the object in Rob's hand. Rob, with hope and a glimmer in his eyes, Al, with bewilderment. Then Al tackled Rob to the ground. For a minute, the two grunted and wrestled, until they were both too exhausted to continue. Al broke free from Rob and sat up, leaning on a log.

""Look at us. Two genius scientists, wrestling in the mud over a die."", Rob said, looking at the night sky with tears in his eyes.

""Don't."" Al panted. ""Just don't, Rob.""

""It's okay. It's gone anyway. I lost it."" Rob had exhausted all the fight in him. He looked at Al, who seemed to be staring at something lying right nex to Rob's head. Looking over, he saw something small and white lying too close to be in focus. Rob rolled onto his side and propped himself up on his elbow.

""Doooon't"", Al said, but Rob was much too busy staring at the die to do anything. The side facing up was showing a black-reddish blob. ""Would you look at that"", he muttered.

""What is it?"", Al replied and came closer. He eyed the die nervously? ""Is that..."" He glanced up at the sky for a brief moment, before staring at the die in disbelief.

""Sagittarius A*"", Al said, picking the die up. ""A cosmic joke.""

And with a soft *slurp* sound, the two disappeared.",16
1luypai,n2216gn,"It was a thing of childhood nightmares. Looming and dark, dozens of familiar faces twisted together in a snarling abomination of a head. Seven thin limbs like rusted tools stretched out, dripping with liquid that never reached the floor. It's body was a simple black mass, hinted at but not fully there.

The monster, for that was all it was, clawed its way from beneath the bed. It's size qoudl make it impossible to hide, yet hide it had, for it only existed to the child whose nightmares had borne it. It was fear, anger and hatred, wrapped together in a terrible mass.

It hunted the child. Craved their death, to free it from its binds. It knew that once the child was no more, it would truly have a claw on the world. It would be free to spread its wrath, delighting in destruction.

The thing peered down at the child, mouth splitting into rows and rows of serrated teeth. Noxious breath poured out, as it snarled quietly. ""I've got you now.""

Movement made its gaze turn. A toy, soft and plush, rose from.the child's grip. The cotton was shaped to be that of a giraffe, stuffing bunched from where a small hand grasped it. It was a well loved toy, standing defiantly up against the monster.

It's voice was just as quiet, one born of laughter, yet bent and filled with righteous fury. ""No you don’t.""

The monster laughed, reaching down with one of its sharpened limbs. ""Little toy, you're nothing. Get out of the-""

A new sensation filled it. One that seized the mind, making itself known. One that throbbed from the stumped limb, black edges shimmering around. The giraffe glared up, spots now glowing with a soft white light. ""You do not get to touch.""

The monster snarled, shaking away the sensation. It wasn't right, it thought. This wasn't how things were meant to go. It wanted freedom, and that came from the death of its unknowing creator.

A limb lashed down, knocking the toy back even as it too disappeared. It just stopped existing, but not fast enough to prevent the strike. Yet the toy didn't fly away. It spun impossibly in the air, landing on top of the slumbering form. The fabric face was defiant, glaring at the monster before it. ""Enough. You shall not harm even a single hair on their head.""

It got another snarl, the volume creeping up. Its voice began to distort, hundreds of sounds battling in discordant harmony. ""I will end you. I will be free. You will not be able to stop me.""

As it spoke, the ruined limbs began to reform. The child whimpered, shifting at something in their dream. A sound that made the toy look down, its expression softening for a moment. Then it looked back, hardening into one of rage. ""Stop you? If I was alone, that is true. But I'm not.""

A glow began to radiate around. Items began to move and writhe, forming face, bodies, even childish weapons. Toys were the bulk, bur not all. A favoured blanket, covered in letters rose up, books marching either side. A pair of shirts held together, ends flapping to make a bird-like form.

The giraffe stared up at the nightmare, a grin across its face. ""You might be born of fear, but we are from love. The raw love of a child, innocent of the world.""

The monster went to scream as light began to strike its form. Each impact seared off a little more of it. Making it weaker. Smaller. More forgettable. But still it tried, reaching out to the child. Needing it. Craving it. Yet losing it.

The room seemed to grow around it. The toy became larger and larger, until it dwarfed the monster as though it were a true giraffe. The glow faded, cherished objects returning to their rightful spots. Only the giraffe remained, looked down at it. ""Return to nothingness. Trouble us no more.""

With a stamp of its hoof, the nightmare vanished. The toy stared for a moment longer, waiting in case it had another trick up its sleeve. But it didn't. It was gone. The tension left it, the need to move fleeing..

With a final effort it nestled itself back in its child's arms. Their face relaxed, bad dreams vanishing as they held their toy again, shifting without waking to hug it tighter.

And the giraffe was happy. Its child was safe. And so long as it was loved, it would protect them.",39
1luypai,n22u90s,"Each Saturday morning was the same, and now I believe it was getting smarter. The creature under the bed that would come out every seventh night. I've seen it once when I had taken medicine, clouding my mind. It was blind from what I could tell. It's eyes, whiter than the blizzards of the far north, perched atop a long slider nose. It wore a black draped cloak covering a hunched body, the claws longer than any blade I had ever seen.  It would sniff and feel around my room, looking for what I could only assume was me.

My sweat covered shirts were running low and tattered around the room as it would find one and silently begin to shred and carve into it, aiming for what would have been vital areas.  Though, it began to realize what I had been doing, by leaving my decoys out for it to find and attack rather than me as I would sleep. Always disappearing into the shadows as my consciousness seemed to be trigger a recall.

Over the last few weeks I had been conversing with my village elder, a wise old woman who spoke of animating that which was not alive. That this creature may be one of these, searching for it's target under it's dark master orders. The reason I was a target eluded my thoughts. I began to learn the trade from an old scroll the village elder endowed to me. I started with simple creatures at first, small dolls made from left over fabric.

The ruins and ritual was draining at first, only able to stay functional for simple tasks such as retrieving a needle from the other side of the desk. Gradually they got more complex to creating dinners and chopping wood.

It was dark again, my body heavy with sleep from the week of tending my flock along with my most recent creation. Once I had completed the ritual it was all I could do, but move to my bed and collapse. On my desk sat my silent guardian, its small legs propping it up as it's head laid to the side as it's task was not yet activated.

Then it came again, like it would always. It arrived sniffing the air as it always did. The smell of sweat leading it towards it's target. 

""I've got you now.."" a raspy and constructed voice fell from it's lips as it lunged. 

It's attack was swift and precise like every time before. This time it struck what would be it's final fatal decoy. A stuffed bear made from the shredded shirts that once served as my first decoys.

""No, the fuck you don't"" a low and tangled voice responded.

My creation stood, the claws of the creature, stuck inside the hard wooden core. As it stood, the threads holding it together began break, the true shape rising as it small stubby arms broken though revealing the claws of a bear, the head wiggling as it's button eyes popped off and the red hue of the glass balls it had in place shown down on the monstrosity before it. It's body made from the body of a bull moose, as the magic that ran though it hardened the cotton core to steel.

""Under my master's orders, I shall ensure you are destroyed."" 

With a large swing of it's paws it sent the cloaked figure flying back and slamming into the wall. 

A panic setting in as it though for sure that I would have awoken, though to my own accord. I had drained my consciousness to silence as I slept soundly. It turned back as it sniffed the air trying to find my creation, only to be met with another swing as it's long slider nose crunched and crumbled into it's skull.

Letting out a loud wale of pain, it lashed out with it's claws, trying to scrape and tear at my creation that stood it's ground as it held the cloaked demon by the throat.

Regrettably and thankfully, I did not witness what was to happen next as my creation mouth opened, the teeth of the bears, wolves, and panthers that I gathered lined it's mouth. It's jaw unhinging as it raised the snarling and thrashing creature. 

Then, a single crunch, then stillness.

I awoke two days after the event. My body sore from bed rot as I sat up. Looking to my desk, where my creation sat, the small button eyes and small smile on it's face. Grumbling, I rose from my bed and walked towards it. Curious if it had done it's job.

As I approached, my feet were tangled as I looked down to see the remains of the cloak that once worn by the demon. A could help but chuckle as I looked to my creation, taking a seat and leaned back in the chair.

""I think.. I'll call you Teddy.""",9
1lv4xf8,n23mctm,"The words on the page began to drip and slide between Douglas’s fingers. The book pinned in his hand as he propped his head into his palm where he sat it against the desk. His jaw hanging slack as his breathing slowed and his mind synched to the dull hum of the air conditioner inside his home. The last thing he remembered before he shut his eyes was the feeling of the book slipping from between his fingers. His mind dark before the spine even hit the ground.

“Quite the collection you have here.”

This wasn’t a voice Douglas recognized. Not one from his memory at least and it somehow sounded like someone trying to speak through a pan of bacon grease. A burbling hiss to the undertone of the words.

“The Prince, Art of War, and Discourses on Livy, very impressive collection on Machiavelli. Though American Psycho is an interesting choice, I trust the irony of that one isn’t lost on you?” The voice bubbled and Douglass could feel its presence just behind him.

His own mind feeling like someone had stuffed his sinuses full of cotton while his eyes gawked wide. His breathing kept steady though the hammering in his chest demanding him to take quick and rapid gasps. Despite this, Douglas kept his body still. Every joint locking into place as he listened to the figure just behind him appraise his personal library.

“I’m assuming you’ve actually read all of these and you’re not just a collector. For as well off as you are, playing and scheming in the stock market and all, you’d think you’d have plenty of time to read.” The voice behind him said and Douglas could feel the way it craned its head over its own shoulder to peer at him. An odd sense of where it was at all times despite his body facing away. “Are you suffering with sleep paralysis or are you just rude?”

“What are you doing in my house?” Douglas vocalized and had to resist the urge to flinch when he heard one of his books clap shut.

“Just rude then.” The voice called out as its feet padded across the floor. A sound like a wooden cup tapping with its empty sound before Douglas realized it was a pair of hooves with a figure coming around to face him. The creature crossed its human arms over his broad chest with its hooved feet supporting its body and its equine head regarding him with a pair of eyes like black pearls. “You invite me into your house, talk to me the way you have, and you haven’t even the grace to introduce yourself to me.”

“Doug… Douglas, Douglas Bach.” Douglas introduced as he stood and offered his hand.

“Prince Orobas.” The horse creature said as he leaned down and picked up the book laying on the floor, placing it into Douglas’s outstretch hand. “Though Orobas will do just fine provided you can tell me why you summoned me here.”",15
1lv4xf8,n23mh3i,"\# PART TWO CAUSE REDDIT IS LAME

“What?” Douglas asked as he looked down at the book in his hand. Just what he thought was some light reading on the study of demons.

A chuff and a whiney escaped Orobas’s lips while his black pearl eyes rolled in his head. His hands coming from around his chest to rest at his waist as he nodded to the book once more as if this would somehow endow answers. When Orobas saw the look on Douglas’s face after he peered at the book for all of five seconds, he chuffed again and took the book from Douglas’s hands.

“Intention is all you need to summon a demon, Douglas. You thought to yourself that something that could see the future and the past could all but promise you the career you needed and here I am.”

The weight of the book now felt heavier in Douglas’s hands as he felt a flash in his mind’s eye. Back to the passage in the book on Orobas where it mentioned he could confer the past and the present. Even more he was not a deceiver and would only tell the truth. The thought crossing Douglas’s mind as a smirk grew across his face.

“So, you’re here to answer my questions?” Douglas asked, trying to keep the glee out of his voice.

“No.” Orobas said and huffed in something that might’ve been a scoff. “I am here to do something far more interesting.”

Before Douglas could think to ask what, he watched as the half man half horse reached for its head. Fingers closing around the black pearl sitting in his head as he popped the eye from its socket. The perfectly round orb of obsidian laying in his hand as he offered it out to Douglas to take.

“I come to make an offer knowing you won’t refuse.” Orobas said as he presented the eye to Douglas. “For all the knowledge of the past and the present, curiosity still piques me. And I am curious how ruthless you will be in your endeavors when you can see how far the consequences will reach or how shallow your victories will be in comparison.”",15
1lv2e7z,n234ub2,"Down here among the gloom I sit with the others. There is no light but the glow of the newly forgotten. We gather 'round them for warmth as they tell us of their last believers and how they came to fall among us.

The Christ God cast me down, my flock went to him. Because of his greed to be the only God and the fervor he fermented most of us lived down here, tethered by the unbreakable bindings and existing without meaning. The one they called Allah has quite a body count as well for someone who started out as such a peaceful being.

I listen as the one that called himself Telegraph spoke fondly of the word 'Hello'. He told the story again even as his light waned.

I remember when I shone brightly. The All-Creator, the God of gods has surely forgotten us. To leave creatures he created to stagnate amongst one another until the end of time. Surely we are not remembered by the All-Creator as we are not remembered by the humans that once helped us glow so brightly.

Somewhere up there even Zeus makes his way around. Odin too, dim but not forgotten. The Fat God, the woman with naught but her big belly and breast, even she is remembered and loved by a few. 

When will we see them down here? There will be a time when all are here. When there are humans no more. 

A new arrival draws my attention and as I move toward them, the familiar weight of my chain is unfamiliar. 

Something is different.

I pull at it. It rattles across the ground link by link until I find the difference of it in my hands. I am no longer tethered. 

I am confounded. Never has a chain been broken. I know what it means. There will soon be believers of me. 

Humans will gather and call my name. They will fight for my favor. The humans are remembering me. Erdő Anya is once again finding the hearts and minds of people.

My glow is returning, and their prayers reach me. They long for the return of nature.

My ascent begins. The chain crumbles away completely. The maws of a thousand and a thousand again dead Gods fall open and they gape.

""Hadak Ura!"" I call out. 

He muscles forward to the front and his dark eyes fix upon me. His maw is not one that hangs agape. He was always singular and determined. As hardy as he was harmful.

He is an old enemy of mine. His desires burned out the forests and trampled nature. 

We shared no words that were kind when we both reigned. 

Then I see it in front of me. My arm is extended out and wordlessly he leaps, taking hold.

Prayers are slow and slow is my response. I send life to their gardens. Rain to the fields and they thank me. 

I send to them a name. The name Hadak Ura. A name of destruction but of a necessary destruction. 

I need my believers to believe in Destruction. If The Christ God is to fall, there must be Destruction.

Hadak Ura’s hand still in mine, time meaningless and time too short. In time his chains crumble and we ascend together.

It is a good day to be loved again.",16

Not that I’m counting. That would be pathetic. And a god  even a washed-up one  should cling to some scrap of dignity.

So no, I’m not counting. I simply let the days slide by. Like dust. Like smoke in a room no one enters anymore.

I wake at the same hour each cycle, with the same stale taste of time on my tongue. I brew a bitter tea made from old memories and dead leaves. I take my walk through the Garden of Echoes, which once had a grander name, but I’ve forgotten it, and I doubt it mattered anyway.

The gods still living in the High Halls would tell you otherwise. They remember everything, of course. But then again, they’re still being prayed to.

Avareen, for example. She glows. Literally. Glides past me each morning with that perfect, polished halo of light, like someone who knows exactly how adored she is.

I say good morning.

She gives me the kind of smile you reserve for a janitor you almost recognize. Then she disappears into clouds of incense and duty.

The twins  War and Harvest  argue with divine volume on the upper terraces. No one complains. Mortals love a good mythic fight. Preferably with fireworks. I used to argue with them, once. Now I’m background noise.

The Keeper of Dreams. Graceful. Efficient. Still heartbreakingly beautiful in that way dreams always are  lovely until you try to hold them.

I tried to talk to her yesterday. Casually. Like I wasn’t aching for a conversation. I said the ether looked lovely today.

She barely paused. Smiled politely, distantly. Said there were too many dreams and not enough hours, and that we could talk another time.

I nodded. Of course. Another time. Always another time.

I returned to my garden. Watered dead flowers. Fed the pigeons of thought. Sat in a chair that creaked like it remembered better days.

That’s my life now. Tea. Silence. Dust. And gods too busy to notice I’m still here.

But today something shifted.

I was humming a song that hadn’t existed in centuries when I felt it a pull, sharp and sudden, right in my chest. Not pain. Not exactly. It was presence.

My name. Someone had spoken my name.

Not muttered it. Not thought it.

Spoken.

I dropped the watering can. It clattered against the stone. My hands shook. I ran, actually ran, to the Mirror of Sight. The surface rippled, shivered, then cleared.

A boy.

Ten, maybe. Filthy. Curious. Kneeling in the ruins of a temple I had once loved more than myself.

He squinted at something carved on the wall. He said he thought my name was Devrion.

He said me.

I fell to my knees. Laughed. Then cried. Then laughed again until my ribs hurt. I felt warmth — actual warmth  flood into my limbs. I felt power. Not much, but enough to remember what it was like to matter.

The bells rang.

Then the sky cracked open.

He came down like protocol wearing robes. The archivist. Pale. Unreadable. Holding a clipboard that glowed with bureaucratic precision.

He spoke my name. Said I was Devrion, God of Remnants. Class-F Forgotten. Last worship recorded one thousand and seven years ago.

I stood up, radiant and trembling. I said someone had remembered.

He cut me off. Said Protocol 37-C requires that any partial recall past the thousand-year threshold must be purged to prevent mythic instability.

I said the boy remembered.

He corrected me. Said he had read my name. That it wasn’t belief. It was archaeology.

I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. My thoughts scattered like ashes.

The boy wasn’t praying. He wasn’t hoping. He wasn’t mine.

He was reading a name off a wall.

A name that no longer meant anything.

My name.

The archivist lifted his hand.

I felt the unraveling begin. Quiet. Efficient. As if I had never been.

The last thing I heard was his sigh. He said I almost made it.

Then nothing.

Not even silence.",5
1lurpro,n208n5p,"I have been around for a while.
A dragon in human skin.
Every 50 or so years, through a simple ritual, my human body turns back to its teenage years, with proper documentation and everything.
Even integrating my identity into a random family, but don't worry for I always use my wealth and power to help them a bit.
This time though...
As I was doing my ritual, instead of stars and rare magic...a talking cat appeared, and randomly gave me a pen.
Since then...I had dreams of a life from 10k years ago.


""Good to see you again.
This time don't forget to write me."" the cat said.
I didn't know what it meant, but after my 3rd dream I realized.
Back in ancient Egypt, I had a cat.
Well, took care of it.
It seems that Fate had it that during my life back then, magic had a small resurgence.
Sure it was gone on a global scale but every now and then you could find it.
And this cat found it, and became a demon.
We had fun, and I could be myself with her.
When I started the ritual that has a small chance of erasing my memories, to protect my sanity, I promised her I will write to her...
Sadly, that small chance just had to be triggered.


Looking at the pen, I can feel its magic.
I took out a piece of paper and wrote my message.
My apology, my feelings...and my desire to meet.
I watched as the paper turned golden and then disappeared.
I sighed, and went on with my life, the dreams...oddly stopping after having written the letter.
A few weeks later, late at night, I hear something at my window.
It is her.
I let her in, and smile.


""Aziza. How nice to see you."" I say.
She nods.
""Well, I am happy to see you too, Ishaq, or whatever your name is this life."" she says.
""Adam.
But I must say...the last 10k years did nothing to your beauty."" I smile.
She meows, and transforms, into a woman.
I freeze.
""10k years is a long time, Ishaq, and I learnt a lot from the  scrolls you have written me back then.
My little dragon...magic is returning.
Your ritual that basically messes with your personality soon shall be needed no more."" she says, getting closer.
""Alas, our other promise shall wait...you are too young in this body..."" she purrs.
Before I could say something, mom comes in.
""Who are you talking to, Adam ?
Oh my! What a beautiful cat! "" she says, as Aziza is back to her cat form, getting comfortable on my bed.
Mom gushes over her, saying we will keep her, and I just sigh.
This life will be a lively one.",51
1lurpro,n20ecoc,"I picked up the pen. 

I hate acne, I wrote. Every couple of years it flares up and I can't stand to look at myself. Scaly, pock marked, and red, like I just emerged from a cave and suddenly discovered sunlight.

Puzzled, my cat pawed at the paper like it wanted me to tell it something. And pawed at the pen like it wanted to tell *me* something. With each page I wrote it felt like a veil delicately lifting it's layers, my skin shedding itself to begin again, anew. I liked this analogy. It gave me hope.

At night I dreamt I could breathe fire. Like one of those circus performers doing tricks for the crowd. I would spit  kerosene and five foot flames and everyone would clap until I woke up and could taste the fuel in my mouth.

Finally the cat said something. I don't know what. I was too busy trying to figure out if it was really happening or I was simply just going insane. 

""Well go on then, fucking write something you twat,"" he said again with a thick British cockney accent, like he already knew the story I was going to tell. So I did.

I thought it would help but my dreams grew more intense by the day. One night I swore I was flying across mountains and valleys. On another I burned entire villages into oblivion. I was fire and brimstone on the wind, disconnected from person place and time.

My skin slowly recovered. Grew back healthier, stronger. The cat kept trying to point me in the right direction but I didn't dare tell a soul about it. He told me to think harder. To remember back. To plumb the depths of my cranium, sifting through the gray matter silt for Spanish gold and silver. I was a charred shipwreck now, an entire crew lost at sea.

To my cat's chagrin I put the pen down. I didn't want to be responsible for any of this.

""Bollocks ya fookin berk,"" the cat said with a hiss. There was more to it I think, but I'm not stupid. Cats can't *actually* talk and I can't fly. No tail after all. So I must just be insane I decided.

Finally after a month or so the taste of kerosene was a distant memory. 

I think cats don't like dragons maybe, but  who knows with the little bastards.",10
1luxzhl,n2301b3,"##Mandatory Cremation

Mrs. Ramirez took a deep breath when third period entered the classroom. She normally hoped that students would be present since eLearning was a pain, but she wanted Louis and Margaret to be sick today. Her lesson plans were packed for the next few weeks, and their debate would take place outside of class. It would be simpler that way. 

Louis walked in the door first wearing a polo and khaki pants. When he sat at his seat, he took out a notebook. She looked at the clock and watched as the start of third period approached. Maybe one of them will be sick. The bell rang, and Margaret entered panting.  Mrs. Ramirez sighed and walked to the front of the class. 

""Settle down. Alright, we have six groups who signed up debate today. Who wants to go first?"" she asked. Margaret raised her hand followed by Louis. No one else did it. ""Okay, Louis and Margaret will be up first."" Margaret returned to her chair. *May as well get it out of the way first.* She took out her table to grade them. 

""Alright, the topic is Mandatory Cremations of the Reanimated. Margaret, heads or tails?"" she asked. 

""Heads,"" Margaret said. Mrs. Ramirez flipped a coin.

""You go first,"" she said.

""Thank you."" Margaret cleared her throat. 

""A year ago, my Great Aunt Susan died. It was a tragic day. Her funeral was even more tragic. We had to sit there while she fought to get out of her coffin. When she punched through the wood, she clawed at her husband Mark who could only cry. Mark refused to cremate her because he wanted her buried in the family cemetery. Afterward, he arranged for it to happen."" Mrs. Ramirez wrote the emotional appeal was effective, but it was too anecdotal. ""While Mark didn't get the zombie virus, he had a bad case of bronchitis later. Reanimated carry around a hundred times more diseases than living due to the lack of an immune system. One study found that found that those who encounter the Reanimated are three times as likely to be hospitalized from illness as those who don't encounter the Reanimated. I know its tough to have to watch someone you love die twice due to being Reanimated, but it is the best way."" Mrs. Ramirez wrote that she used Reanimated too much, but it was overall good.

""Alright, Louise,"" Mrs. Ramirez said.

""Thank you. Cremation has been in practice for a long time. Vikings famously performed such activities.  With regards to the reanimated, it is a questionable practice. Hermetically sealed coffins are becoming more common, and prices are dropping rapidly. There have been several investigations into cremation facilities which have been discovered to not operate in accordance with the regulations resulting in several outbreaks. Need I remind you all of the Ann Arbor fiasco,"" Louis said. Mrs. Ramirez remarked that he was doing well, but lacked emotion. ""Those same studies that find that Reanimated carry diseases also found that disinfection before passing reduces their carry rate to below that of a living human. Mandatory Cremation is not acceptable because there are alternative solutions that work.""

""Alright, we will now move to the Q and A,"" Mrs. Ramirez said. Joey raised his hand. She called him.

""Margaret, how do you know your uncle got bronchitis from your aunt?"" he asked. Mrs. Ramirez knew he was Louis's friend.

""Reanimated carry diseases. It's the most likely source.""

""Okay, but do you know for certain?"" Joey asked.

""Well, we can't know for sure, but I am sure it's likely.""

""Did his doctor tell you that?""

""No."" Margaret looked to the floor.

""So you're speculating,"" he said.

""Joey, that's enough."" Mrs. Ramirez stopped him. This was why the rebuttal portion was cancelled. Ella, Margaret's friend, raised her hand. May as well be fair Mrs. Ramirez thought to herself.

""Louis, you proposed alternatives to cremation, but that requires people to do those too. How will you enforce that?"" she asked.

""Well, how is mandatory cremation going to be reinforced? Both require cooperation of the medical establishment, the citizenry, and the coroners. My method allows for more options,"" he said.

""Sure, but at the end of the day, more options means more people need to be able to administer those options. You were stating that Mandatory Cremation requires compliance. How can you guarantee that a hermetically sealed coffin isn't defective?""

""We just have to try,"" Louis said. Mrs. Ramirez noticed both of them were sweating. She realized they didn't fully understand their positions, and they knew that. 

""That's stupid,"" Ella said.

""Ella, stop."" Mrs. Ramirez stood up. ""The purpose of this debate was to allow students a chance to discuss the important matters with civility.""

""Sorry,"" Ella said.

""It's fine. I know emotions are high because the vaccine has only been available for a limited time, but its important that we maintain calm. Rage helps no one."" Mrs. Ramirez had an idea and pulled out her chair. ""Let's not debate for the rest of the period. Let me hear how the Reanimated issue affected you.""

Tyler began to cry. Mrs. Ramirez looked at him.

""You only have to speak if you want to,"" she said.

""It's not that. My grandfather killed my parents when he was Reanimated,"" he said. That opened the gates, and everyone talked about what occurred. When class ended, there wasn't a dry eye in the room. Mrs. Ramirez went back to her desk proud of herself. She helped those kids more than she thought she would.

1luxzhl,n23xfir,"***Ashes for the Restless, a Wandering Undertaker’s tale.***

---

I was born after the end.

They say the world once shook when the first dead stood up, cities eaten alive by the soft shuffle of feet in the dark.

They say it ended just as quick. Someone made a cure. An immunity. Humanity learned to fight back, teeth for teeth, fire for fire.

But that last lesson came too late.

It only works when you’re breathing. When the heart stops, the heart forgets to stay dead.

---

My name is Aia.

I pilot a walking coffin called **Threnody**, a mech built from scrap steel and prayers.

She stands tall enough to look an old chapel in the eye, legs like a grave-digger’s spade, arms that carry flamethrowers and shovels in the same breath.

I’m thirteen. Maybe fourteen.

It’s easy to lose count when you sleep beneath the ash of your work.

---

There are cities that forgot the old ways.

Graveyards behind chain-link fences, earth swollen with the restless.

In the rainy season, the soil loosens, sometimes the dead stand up, heads cocked like dogs that forgot how to bark.

And so I walk the world.

When I find them, a corpse caught halfway between memory and hunger, I light them gently.

I hum them a song I don’t remember learning, but it comes to my lips like an old hymn.

*“Sleep, sleep.
Nothing here for you.”*

---

Sometimes I think about what happens when my heart stops.

I’ve got the same vaccine the others got. The same promise: *So long as you live, you’re safe.*

But I’m just a girl with matchsticks and an iron giant for company.

One day my bones will break, or my lungs will drown in rainwater, or a feral corpse will get lucky.

***Who will burn me then ?***

---

Tonight, I stop at a roadside chapel. It’s half-eaten by vines, its steeple sunk like a tooth into the mud.

Inside, I find three.

An old woman, two children, hands clasped together like they tried to stay human until the end.

I cremate them gently. Threnody hums as she fans the flames, her steel ribs glowing orange through the rain.

When it’s done, I sit beneath her shadow, eating cold rations by the warmth of bone-ash.

I tie three little strings to my belt, one for each.

A promise that they won’t stand up again.

A promise that they can sleep, just a little longer.

---

Tomorrow, I’ll dig up more graves.

Tomorrow, I’ll hunt down the wandering dead the city folk are too busy pretending they don’t see.

People like me are called *Wandering Undertakers*.

Those who travel around the world, to properly cremate those who no longer live, and put down those who cannot rest.

Me, specifically, are called...

*""A ghost in a girl’s body"".* 

*""A priestess with a pyre for a heart.""*

But, really.

I’m just Aia.

And I’m afraid of the dark.

Same as you.",11

1luni7q,n1zweag,"We thought it would be easy money. A royal carriage, maybe a dozen guards, some noble brat with more gold than sense. Jaxon had been planning this heist for weeks, studying the route, counting the escort. What could go wrong?

Everything, as it turned out.

The first sign something was off came when we charged down the hillside, whooping and brandishing our weapons. The knights didn’t even turn to face us. Instead, they pressed closer to the carriage, hands on their sword hilts, eyes fixed on the ornate wooden door.

“What the hell?” muttered Crik, our best archer, as his arrow bounced harmlessly off a knight’s armor. The man didn’t even flinch.

I pulled my horse alongside the carriage, ready to demand the passengers surrender their valuables. That’s when I heard it. A low, rumbling growl coming from inside. Not human. Not anything I’d ever heard before.

The knights were sweating despite the cool mountain air. Their captain, a grizzled man with scars crisscrossing his face, shouted orders over the growing sound.

“Hold the line! Keep the door sealed! Whatever happens, don’t let Prince Bozoei—”

His words were cut short by an explosion of splintered wood and twisted metal. The carriage door didn’t just open—it erupted outward like a cannon blast, spinning through the air before crashing into a tree twenty feet away.

What emerged from the darkness inside wasn’t human anymore.

Prince Bozoei had been a handsome young man, if the portraits in the taverns were accurate. Sixteen years old, golden hair, bright eyes. The thing that unfolded from the carriage shared none of those features. It stood eight feet tall, its skin a mottled gray-black that seemed to absorb light. Muscles bulged beneath flesh that looked like it had been stitched together from nightmares. But the worst part was the face—still recognizably human around the eyes, but twisted into something that belonged in the deepest pits of hell.

“Prince Bozoei,” the captain whispered, his voice breaking. “The curse… it’s happening again.”

The demon that had been a prince turned its burning red gaze on the nearest knight. The man tried to run, but those massive claws caught him around the waist. I watched in horror as the creature lifted the screaming soldier to its mouth, rows of jagged teeth gleaming in the afternoon sun.

The sound of bones crunching echoed across the mountainside.

My bandit brothers scattered like leaves in a hurricane. Jaxon was already halfway back up the hill, abandoning his careful plans for simple survival. Crik had dropped his bow and was running on foot through the trees. Smart men.

I should have run too. But I couldn’t move, couldn’t look away as the demon tore through the remaining knights like they were made of paper. Blood painted the road red. Armor meant nothing against those claws. The captain lasted longest, backing away while shouting something about containment protocols and royal bloodlines, but even he ended up as just another meal.

When the last knight fell silent, the demon turned its attention to me.

I was going to die. There was no doubt about that. This thing had just slaughtered a dozen trained soldiers in less than five minutes. I was just a highway thief with a rusty sword and delusions of easy money.

But then I heard something that made my blood freeze.

“Bozoei? Brother, what’s wrong?”

A small voice came from inside the ruined carriage. A little girl, maybe eight years old, with the same golden hair the prince had once possessed. She climbed carefully through the wreckage, her white dress somehow untouched by the carnage around her.

The demon’s head snapped toward her, a growl building in its throat. Those massive hands, still dripping with blood, reached toward the child.

I closed my eyes, unable to watch another innocent die.

But the killing blow never came.

When I looked again, the monster was on its knees. The little girl had placed her tiny hand on its enormous snout, and the creature was… purring? No, that wasn’t right. It was making a sound like a wounded animal, confused and scared.

“It’s okay,” she whispered, stroking the rough skin of its face. “I know you’re still in there. I know you don’t want to hurt anyone.”

The red glow in its eyes began to fade. The muscles started to shrink. Slowly, impossibly, the demon began to collapse in on itself, fur and scales falling away like shed skin. Within minutes, a naked teenage boy lay curled on the blood-soaked ground, sobbing into his sister’s lap.

“The curse,” Prince Bozoei whispered, his voice raw. “I couldn’t control it. I tried to warn them, tried to stay locked in, but when I smelled blood…”

His sister, Princess something-or-other—I never did catch her name—simply held him as he wept. She didn’t seem bothered by the carnage surrounding them, as if she’d seen this before.

And suddenly I understood why the knights had been more concerned with keeping the prince contained than fighting off bandits. We hadn’t been the real threat at all. We’d just been the trigger.

I should have left then. Should have taken my horse and ridden as far away as possible from whatever dark magic flowed in the royal bloodline. Instead, I found myself approaching the siblings, my sword forgotten on the ground.

“How long?” I asked quietly.

The princess looked up at me with eyes far too old for her young face. “Since he turned thirteen. The curse awakens with royal blood spilled in anger. Every time he smells death, every time he sees violence…” She gestured at the scattered remains of the escort. “This happens.”

“And you’re the only one who can stop him?”

She nodded. “Family. Love. Sometimes they’re stronger than curses.”

I looked at the prince, still trembling in his sister’s arms, and made a decision that would change my life forever. These weren’t just royal brats to be robbed and abandoned. They were children, cursed through no fault of their own, traveling a world that would fear and hunt them if the truth ever came out.

“You’ll need new guards,” I said finally. “Ones who understand what they’re really protecting people from.”

The princess smiled for the first time since emerging from the wreckage. “Are you volunteering?”

I glanced at the blood-soaked road, at the remains of soldiers who’d died trying to keep a terrible secret, at a little girl who faced down demons with nothing but love.

“Yeah,” I said. “I guess I am.”

After all, I’d always been good at keeping my mouth shut. And sometimes the best way to protect people from monsters is to help the monsters protect themselves from the world.",109
1luni7q,n1z8sub,"I watch as the knights sigh...and run away?  
From outside the carriage, steps out...what is that?  
A young...man? 3 meters tall, muscles over muscles shining, and straining against the monk robe he was wearing.  
""Are you almsgivers seeking Buddha's advice?"" he booms.  
The closest brothers of mine to the carriage fainted, blood flowing from their ears.  
""W-who are you?"" I ask.  
""Ah, Bandit Leader almsgiver, this poor monk is Prince Abath, the one you wanted to kidnap, and rob of his belongings."" he smiles.  
I freeze.

  
The other bandits ran towards me, ready to stand against that...thing.  
""It's a misunderstanding."" I smile.  
He shakes his head...and created shockwaves that threaten to blow us away.  
""Nay, almsgiver.  
Buddha's All Merciful and had us meet here.  
You have Fate with Buddhism, may you lay down thy butcher knife, and don the kasaya?"" he ""gently"" says.  
I shiver.  
With who the hell did we mess?

  
""I am thankful for the offer, but I think we aren't suited for this honor, and blessing.  
We shall let you continue your journey, Prince Abath."" I say, gesturing the other bandits to slowly leave.  
Before I could also turn away, a hand was on my shoulder, and I was knee-deep into the dry, rock-hard ground.  
""Nonsense, almsgiver!  
Buddha's teaching are for everyone! Butcher, and scholar, warrior and thief!  
Come, let us chant the Heart Sutra, and cleanse the evil within!"" he says, grabbing me out of the ground, and hauling me towards the carriage.  
Carriage that at some point, was started to be repaired by the knights.  
I was thrown inside as a sack, and the prince boarded, after giving an instruction not to be disturbed by anyone to the knights.

  
I watched this walking mountain, stare at me seriously.  
""I..."" I started.  
""Please! Tell me you have meat, and some booze on you!  
God! I miss normal food! Also, tell me some stories!  
Have you ever you know...""kidnapped"" women?  
Have you visited a Pleasure House without paying?  
Do you have females serving you in your bandit lair?  
Tell me, please!"" he starts, basically kneeling, and begging me.  
I freeze, and take out some jerky, and cheap snake wine.  
He eats it as if it is Celestial Manna.  
I look at him, confused, but then see his robe tearing up a bit, due to his muscles, and his stare, so I swallow, and start telling him about the time where as a farmer kid, I snuck into that ""widow's"" house in my village...and how that started my current life.",37
1luni7q,n20ixdw,"Dusk painted the forest in shades of amber and shadow as distant wolf howls echoed through the ancient pines. Hidden behind gnarled oak trunks, the bandits crouched in wait, their breath visible in the cooling air.

""Remember,"" whispered Gareth, the grizzled bandit leader, his voice barely audible above the rustling leaves. ""Wait for the wheel to catch. Then we spring—all at once.""

""What if the knights fight?"" hissed a younger bandit, nervously fingering his crossbow.

""Ten crossbows against six swords? They'll see reason."" Gareth's scarred face twisted into a grin. ""Besides, we only want the prince. Quick ransom, quick coin.""

The rhythmic clatter of wheels on stone grew louder. Through the undergrowth, they glimpsed the royal carriage—ornate and gilded, pulled by four magnificent destriers. Six knights rode alongside, their polished armor catching the last rays of light like mirrors, the royal crest gleaming on their surcoats.

*Crack.*

The front wheel lurched sideways, dropping deep into the concealed pit. The carriage tilted violently, horses rearing and neighing in distress.

""NOW!""

Bandits erupted from all directions—front, back, and both flanks. Crossbows raised, bolts nocked and aimed at the carriage driver who fought to control the panicked horses.

""HALT! Drop your reins!"" Gareth bellowed.

The knights reacted instantly, steel singing as swords cleared scabbards. Shields came up in practiced formation, their visored faces turning rapidly to assess threats from every angle. The knight-captain, distinguished by the white plume on his helmet, recognized their desperate situation but remained defiant.

""You dare threaten the royal carriage?"" His voice rang with authority despite their predicament. ""Drop your weapons and flee, or face the king's justice!""

Gareth chuckled, stepping closer with his crossbow trained on the driver. ""Justice? Look around you, Sir Knight. Ten bolts against six blades—and all we want is the prince. No blood need be spilled today.""

The carriage suddenly rocked violently side to side, as if something massive was thrashing within. The nearest knight, a young man with bright blue eyes visible through his visor, pressed his gauntleted hand against the ornate door.

""Please remain inside, Your Highness,"" he called softly. ""We will protect you.""",13
1luni7q,n20iybx,"Above the treeline, the full moon emerged from behind a cloud, bathing the forest clearing in silver light. Gareth glanced up instinctively at its luminous face.

*CRASH.*

The carriage door exploded outward in a shower of splintered wood and twisted hinges, torn from its frame by impossible strength.

A figure emerged—hunched, bestial. What had once been a prince now crouched in the doorway, fingers curled into vicious claws that scraped against the carriage frame. His eyes burned red in the moonlight, teeth clenched in barely contained rage.

The knights' horses shied away, their riders pulling hard on the reins. Even through their helms, fear was evident in their sudden movements. The bandits froze, crossbows wavering as confusion rippled through their ranks.

An unnatural silence fell over the clearing, broken only by the soft creak of leather and the distant wolf songs that seemed suddenly much closer.

Then the prince straightened slowly, throwing back his head. His arms spread wide as maniacal laughter bubbled up from his throat—a sound that made hardened men's blood run cold. Behind him, the full moon formed a perfect halo of silver light.

The laughter shifted, deepening into something wild and primal. His teeth elongated into fangs, his nose stretched into a lupine snout, and pointed ears emerged from his lengthening hair. Coarse fur bristled across every visible inch of skin as his body expanded with unnatural muscle.

The transformation complete, the werewolf prince threw back his head and howled—a sound that turned every man's spine to ice.

The knights broke first. Spurring their destriers, they thundered away into the forest, their gleaming armor flashing between the trees. The bandits on the carriage's right flank scattered next, dropping their crossbows as they crashed through the underbrush.

Panic spread like wildfire. Within moments, the remaining bandits fled in all directions, their ambush forgotten in the face of this supernatural horror.

Gareth turned to run, but a massive clawed hand clamped down on his shoulder, spinning him around with effortless strength. He found himself face to face with the werewolf prince—inches away from rows of gleaming fangs and burning red eyes. Hot breath washed over his face as the creature studied him with predatory intelligence.

Warm liquid ran down Gareth's legs as his body betrayed him, terror overriding every instinct except the knowledge that he was about to die.

Above them both, the full moon smiled down on the forest, and in the distance, wolves began to answer their prince's call.",13
1luh9h6,n1ygu4r,"“We will lose the war if I close my eyes,” the boy says. He is in that awkward phase of youth, standing of the cusp of true adulthood. He is tall, and has the muscles of a soldier, but his mind has not fully caught up. A few years before, he was in a nursery. A few months before, he was no doubt flirting with girls in his hometown, dreaming of a life that was simple and straightforward. A life where each new day did not feel like a gift in the face of impending death. 

“You will lose the war no matter what you do, child,” I tell him. I am not one for sweet lies or kind words. The war was doomed from the beginning. In their hinterland, no doubt the newspapers spoke of grand victories and propped up a few soldiers as local heroes. In truth, there was no glory in war. There was only compromise. You fought or you surrendered. You killed or your died. 

And so often, those in the higher echelons tried to break those rules. They wanted victory without personal loss, and they sent forth these poor, pitiable proxies into the thick of battle. Young men who had wielded hoes and shovels most of their lives. A few of them were discovered to have magical powers, or control over the elements, and those in power gave them added responsibility without any added payoff. The young man earned the same as his more mortal compatriots. But any loss in battle would be placed firmly on his shoulders. 

He closes his eyes, finally, collapsing in exhaustion. I have lost some soldiers to this boy, but I cannot bring myself to hate him. He is not a villain, nor an enemy. He is a hapless weapon in the hands of people whose greed knows no end. I hand him over to the medics, and they carry him off on a stretcher. 

The rest of the ragtag group of soldiers falter as they see their hero be carried off. In their eyes, the boy is as good as dead. They start to flee, scattering in all directions in a desperate bid to save their own lives. They hide in the foxholes, sprint into nearby woods. I make my way to their grand war tent, the place where decisions are made, where men make decisions on a wooden battlefield, and lives are reduced to playing pieces. I was one of those pieces once. I was once a calculated loss, sacrificed in the name of some greater victory without my knowledge or agreement. 

The patterns of war do not change. The men in the tents are dressed in the best men can buy. Leather that is soft and supple, boots that are oiled and lined with furs. Coats that offer all the protection against the winter, and braziers lit with fires to stave off any possible discomfort that might remain. It is a far cry from the desolation and scarcity outside the tent. There are no holes in boots here, no threadbare layers of old clothing, no frostbitten fingers, no tear-stained cheeks. 

These are men who live on the lifeblood of children, who grow old sending their disciples to die. They withdraw their swords on seeing me, each blade shining and new. With a few flicks of my wand they are disarmed.

“We surrender!” the leader shouts. My attack has not even started, and they are so quick to give up. The little boy fought to the brink of death, yet these old men are too frightened to even step towards me. 

“I must apologize,” I say. “For you, that is not an option.” 

My troops surround the tent, and I leave the tent quickly. They are baffled and inside when I wave my wand again. I seal up the doors of the tent, the threads of the canvas knitting itself together, the fur rugs on the ground melting together with the walls of their luxurious dwelling. The tent is held up by a central pole of metal, and my magic slowly turns the canvas of the tent. Like a cloth being wrung, the material twists upon itself until it is a giant cylinder of canvas wrapped around the central pole, tighter and tighter until the sounds of breaking bone and strangled screams slowly grow silent. 

When the boy woke up, it would all seem like a bad dream. And those that had sent him into his endless nightmare, they were now asleep forever.

1luh9h6,n1y77us,"I try to calm down the young hero.  
I put some more force into my hug, and some magic in my voice.  
His tantrum is slowly calming down.  
""It will be alright.  
Not your fault you can't beat me, and I am not angry at you."" I mutter, as his breathing starts to slow.  
Soon, he is asleep, and I put him gently on the floor.  
Then, I look at the battered, half-dead ""companions"" of the Hero.  
All women, and men, well beyond the Hero's age, and smirk.

  
""So? The almighty Church's believers, paladins, honorable warriors...are using a 11 year old child as their mascot?  
And force him to kill demons, and ""criminals""?"" I ask, getting closer to them.  
They try to crawl away, but can't.  
""You are a criminal! You killed the Emperor of the Violet Strike Empire!  
And publicly stated that you are going to wage war against all kingdoms and Empires!"" the paladin says.  
""And that's a crime because? I hate that commoners starve, young peasant women have to scar their faces, and muddy their clothes in order to maybe, maybe have a chance of escaping a fate worse than death when a noble, or a knight passes their village?"" I ask, stepping on the paladin.  
He groans, and tries to attack me, so I am merciful, and end his pathetic life.  
Then, I look at the others.

  
""It's...It's decreed by the Goddess!  
The Hero is the only one who can destroy the demons!  
You aren't a demon, you should understand their depravity, and evil!"" the priestess cries.  
""Yeah, demons who are exiled to the harshest land, with 0 chance of agriculture, or raising cattle, living off of the underground critters, and hunting monsters.  
Yeah, they are the evil ones, and not the victims, no, not at all."" I roll my eyes.  
""Yes! Not our fault that we want to protect our lands!"" she says.  
I decapitate her.  
""If she's not going to use her head...why keep it?"" I smile at the rest of them.  
By the time I was done with every single of them, it was evening.

  
Teleporting us to my chambers, I put the kid in the bed.  
In the morning, when he woke up, I was waiting with a tray with gentle food for his upset stomach.  
""Some porridge and water, kid."" I say.  
He groggily looks at me.  
""Mom?"" he says.  
I freeze.  
""I-I don't want to train...the demons aren't that bad...one of them gave me food once."" he mutters, and goes back to sleep.  
The tray in my hand is deformed, the food falling on the floor.  
I burn them to ashes, and go to make a new batch.  
""I will get you all...doing this to kids, and this is not the first time."" I mutter, my resolve stronger than before.  
This world is filthy, and it needs a cleansing, even if I go down in history as someone viler than demons.",83
1luh9h6,n1yyos4,"The hero laid there, blood pooling from the hole in his right breast. The pooling blood and shock of pain making him gasp and hiccup at the same time. The weight of failure as he saw the Demon Queen walk towards him, her steps heavy with sorrow. Tears blurred his view of her and fear welled into his chest alongside the blood, filling his lungs as swift as Death. 

She eventually knelt beside him as he reached out for anyone to love him. He was thirteen years old and not from this world. He was an orphan, thrown away by the daughter of a rich upbringing who didn't want him. So when he was summoned by the Princess of the Elven kingdom, he believed he was finally wanted by someone. But all that was at the end.

Before he can be consumed by his fear. His fear of death. His fear of failure. His fear of rejection and loneliness, the Demon Queen grasped his outstretched hand as it blindly fumbled for anything. She stroked his head and held his hand as he lay gasping and gurgling, ""I- don't- want- to- be- hate- ed- any- more."" 

""Shhh, it's okay, it's over now. I'm not angry at you, but at those who would send children to fight in their place. Shhh, close your eyes, and when you awaken, it will all seem like a bad dream."" Her voice was soothing and soft. Melodious like an elf's. His panic started to cease as death claimed him. Soon he closed his tear stained eyes that knew nothing of love. The twenty-fifth hero that Tyrant Queen of The Summer Forest had sent, summoned from a different world than this one, had been killed because of her greed. Always the same MO

She hated how this always happened, and how she can't do anything about it because despite all the heroes being below the age of 15, they're still strong enough to hold her armies back. Instead of raging now, she simply sighed and lifted the cooling body of another child to be buried in her garden, so they can be surrounded by something beautiful in their final peace.",47
1luh9h6,n227tvu,"""Nope! Nononono-nope!"" I shouted, struggling to free my butt from Mistress Vizchel's grasp. I shoulda known better than to take the leader of the Order of the Lotus head on.

""Do you not wish to be one of my lovely children? A preteen boy, only eleven, are you? My son, you have so much to live for... we are mothers, we care for the Galaxy's forsaken children... even Apexian Warriors, children with magical powers, thrown at the Atlas' problems, in the name of the Creator--""

""NOT buying it, creepy lady! Your cult enslaves girls, abuses boys, and you're in total cahoots with the literal demon armies who wanna destroy the *entire* Galaxy! nobody's falling for your crap this time!""

I got my arms free and reached out for my sword, which, through the currents of the Cosmic Weave, came clanging back from across the courtyard into my hand. I bonked her on the head with the pommel, leaped free of her arms, and tumbled backward, sheathing my sword.

""I see we have a troublesome child, all that warrior training, but no love and compassion?"" She questioned, which is totally *not* true, by the way. She reared up and drew her knife as Jackson and Riley came sprinting up behind me to support.

""Go, go! I've got her!"" I shouted. ""Go get the kids in the cages, and take out all the other 'Mothers'! I've got Vizchel!""

""On it, Kris!"" Riley yelled, towing Jackson behind her.

""Y'know who the Apex despise the most, lady? People who hurt kids!"" I said, and drew down both my Hammer-V handguns on her.

""It is for your own good, child, do not make me restrain you-""

*BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG!*

Just as she was about to charge, I sensed her intent and countered her with five Iridium-plated bullets, stopping her in her tracks.

""Augh, my child, Vyrnos lies to you, the Atlas lie to-""

""Bullcrap! You've fooled the greater galaxy ten times over, you've taken thousands of peoples' children of every species... and for the eleventh and final time, you're going down. Either you let us arrest you, I'm lightning blasting you into plasma, you hear?"" I stated, in my best heroic voice.

1luh9h6,n1z7cgl,"Sound of clashing swords still pierce sharply through your ears, unaffected despite being engulfed in thick air and far deep inside the enemy's den. The air keeps thickening, heavier to breathe as the string is getting more tense. ""What if there's a guard there?"" your mind couldn't hide its worries, you tried to push those thoughts aside, but it only came back faster than before. Despite being geared with just a small dagger and a few items, the task you are assigned to, assassinate the enemy's leader, is a solo mission. The words of your friends, warning you about this suicide mission, came to your mind.  
  
The full moon rises higher, its rays shoot through the windows of the castle, giving the dim corridor a little light. As you walk along a seemingly endless corridor, keeping your eyes out to spot any guards before it's too late, ""Crack!"" The door a few steps in front of you creaks, and a couple of guards get out of that room. Your heart stops beating for a moment, luckily the guards are going to the opposite end of the hallway you are in. After taking a breath, you carefully approach the door that left open by the guards, the rooms is dark and you can hardly see anything in that room. You decides to quietly sneak inside as you thought it's riskier to tail the guards that have just left. The air inside feels colder and denser, suffocating it becomes. The burning match crackles as you light it, though its flame shines faintly, it helps clear your view enough to surely guess what's in front of you.  
  
Suddenly, the sound of clothes whooshing was heard before you, way faster before you could even notice, your mouth was covered shut quickly by a hand. You fell as your hands are held behind and your feet are locked stiff, your body are pinned to the floor and the match that just glows has died and nowhere to be seen, leaving you engulfed in pitch dark as you remains defenseless. ""Shhh, it's okay sweetheart, it's over now."", a warm voice of a woman meets your ears, if not for the situation, it would've calm you down ""I'm not angry at you, but at those who send children to the battlefield, just like whose sends you here"", you tries to scream but your mouth is fully covered up by her hands, only a low mumbling could be heard, ""Shhh, close your eyes, and when you wake up this will all just seem like a bad dream."", you tries to fight back, but she is way stronger than you.  
  
You wake up at the medical camp near the battlefield, the wars have gone calmer as both sides seem to rest a little bit. You sit on the mattress, your body still hurts bit and hard to move. you try to remember when you are passed out, but your memory feels like it has jumped over it. You look at your surroundings, though many unfamiliar faces you found, some of your friends can still be seen, some of them only have relatively mild injuries while other have bandages covering almost every inch of their body. The rancid smell of blood stings your senses since you woke up. You decide to wait a moment to discuss the situation further with the others, and to think about what just happened to you.",8
1lumycr,n206em8,"They are eyeing me with suspicion as they remove their chains and stretch their limbs, now lighter without the weight pulling them down. These men are all soldiers, competent and capable. They were the last ones standing on the Battle of Kyroz, those that did not die or flee. One of them approaches me, his demeanour strikes me immediately, he acts calm and dignified even though a minute ago he was in chains.

“Young Lord, greetings and many thanks for giving us our freedom. I believe the custom of the market is to strike a bargain correct?”

“No bargains and no promises until we leave the mountain.”

“No blood and no names?”

“No blood and no names.” He is pleased and nods to the others. Those are the things that can bind one to another here. Not just in the market, this whole mountain is a cursed place, blue skies replaced by a fiery cloak. They’re not less suspicious but seem eager to get away from this place. The one that had spoken walks besides me, while the other lingers a bit back.

“May I ask what is this quest you are undertaking that requires 16 men?”

“I plan on slaying Syzrith, so 16 is only a good start.”

“Are you from Acalis then?” The man seems to know what is happening in the world. Even if the Battle of Kyroz happened a long way south of the kingdom.”

“Yes...” I try to elaborate but I’m lost for words. This is not the sort of place one comes to for supplies. The things one can get from the market would scare most folks away.

“This is not a place for procuring mercenaries. So if only a coincidence brought us together, I’m wondering what were you searching for?” I think for a while, I have no good reply, “A word of advice, the items you can acquire here cost more than their price in gold. Even the most powerful dragon killing weapon is not worth that much.” The cost in one soul for the life of many, I’ll take that. I won’t disclose this to my new travel partners though. Soldiers can be quite superstitious after all.

We don’t see blue skies until after we reach the valley. All of the mountain is over taken by the same terrifying energies, the market is just a small part of it, and the only place most outsiders will see. It’s only when the fresh breeze finally replaces the oppressive energies of the mountain that the men begin talking among themselves. It starts as a murmur, but then one of them laughs and it seems like the cue they needed to celebrate their regained freedom. A towering fellow approaches me.

“You are lucky to have found honourable men in that wretched place. Tholin” he is addressing the man that has been walking besides me, “the boy is careless, only one of him and he walks without a second glance behind him.”

“Aye, honourable but not fit to lead yet.” There’s a general agreement from the other man about this. “However if you come with us before we go with you, we can get ourselves some good equipment and supplies, more men and train you.” The men roar at this suggestion. I consider this for a moment. We will need more people, and well geared too, so this might just be the best course of action.

“Alright,” I extend my hand, “Tholin, right?” He nods and shakes my hand.

“And you my Lord?”

“Cert, Ullin Cert.” For once I was able to come up with something on the spot.",10
1lu8aml,n1wfvt7,"At the heart of its disillusion of the Academy of Magic stood one name: Joushou

The fragments of the minutes recovered recount what occurred during the meeting. The aftermath is pieced together from various sources: 

“You can’t be serious,” the supreme mage uttered.

At a mere 26 years of age, Joushou believes he has uncovered the secret to mastering all of reality and transcending into ultimate reality. And more shockingly, that it was never a secret to begin. He requested to appear before the council to explain the ritual behind the magic, but when they'd heard his explanation, they just laughed. 

The first sign that things were going wrong occurred when he set forth that this practice did not involve verbal spellcasting. Joushou insisted the practice was remarkably simple. So simple, in fact, it had slipped beyond their recognition. The council guffawed at such an accusation, most of them having lived well beyond a normal human lifespan on account of life-extending spells and alchemical magic. They were insulted. 

“A practice of magic involving no spellcasting? How absurd,”one of the elders had said. 

“It is an alchemical practice you suggest, then, perhaps a form of sigilcraft, though these often involve at least some vocalizing.”

“No, sir. You see, this practice addresses this exact problem. The academy, over its great history, has used magic to exert domain externally, to outwardly change the world. What I have discovered goes beyond conceptual reality. By changing the internal contents of the mind, we touch ultimate reality and directly change experience.”

They charged him to elaborate if such magic was so powerful, how could it be cultivated? How could he demonstrate its power so as to convince them? And Josho explained that the mere existence of this council meeting alone demonstrated its power. They were outraged. 

“No, they said, we only agreed to this because we have it on good authority that you were engaged in a practice of magic we'd not heard of before now.”

“And when was the last time that happened?”he replied. 

The council fell silent. 

“I was able to procure this meeting through the power of my practice.”

They demanded he begin to explain the practice, that they might learn what exactly was going on. 

To their dismay, he said the practice was beyond conceptual explanation, but must be cultivated through first-hand practice. 

“It is a tedious process,” he said, “but it is also remarkably simple. For the next month, each morning, walk back and forth, ten paces. Pay attention sensations of the body, feelings, thought, and spiritual sensations in the mind, and your reactions to them, liking and disliking. Then sit. Focus on the rising and falling of your abdomen. 

“It is not magic as you know it—but the source of all magic. You will see that nothing… nothing persists. Nothing satisfies. And no self remains to do the seeking. If you have any doubts on the dawn of the new month we shall meet again.” 

Joushou left without another word.

They took it as arrogance. But they felt compelled to try.

The first week, they joked about it. The pacing made their joints ache. The sitting made their backs stiff. The noting made them feel foolish.

Then strange things began to happen.

One lost his ability to enjoy music. Another began weeping in the middle of spell instruction and could not say why. One forgot the name of his dead daughter—and was horrified to find relief in the forgetting.

They began to dream of empty corridors and mirrors that showed no face.

By the third week, tragedy struck.

The Archmage’s wife died mid-prayer. The High Enchanter’s son vanished, his footprints ending at the edge of the river.

Still they practiced. They did not attribute these tragedies to the practice.

By the twenty-ninth day, none of them could say why they kept going. Their tongues felt foreign. Their minds—once vast storehouses of invocation and glyph—now held only impressions. Shapes of memory. A sense of before.

On the thirtieth day, they performed the ritual one last time. It had become automatic at this point. And in the face of devastation it was all that remained in their lives that gave them peace.

They walked.

They sat.

They did not rise again. 

Even the practice itself no longer relieved their suffering. And they fell into the bottomless abyss of their own minds. They did not reconvene with Joushou. Without a council the Academy fell into chaos. Some say Joushou still sits somewhere in its ruins—waiting for another curious mind to ask a question.",205
1lu8aml,n1wdyu4,"When did I first get the idea?

It was my first couple of weeks after the start of school. I received a letter from my mother. It was short and to the point, but it cut deep.

*Father dying. Come home.*

My father had a wasting sickness. The cure is temperamental: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. A cruel game of fate.

I rushed home as quickly as I could. Luckily my professor was understanding and wrote dozens of permission slips for me. Even so, I was too late. My father died the day before I arrived.

I felt the grief keenly. We'd been close all through my childhood; he'd taught me many skills and many truths. It was he who helped me overcome my doubts about attending the college. I wanted so badly to speak with him, to hold him, even if it was only one more time.

In my grief, I threw myself into study beyond what my classes entailed. I kept it a careful secret, working at night in abandoned classrooms, devoting every spare moment. My friends were aware from day one, but they covered for me, supporting in the throes of my obsession far more than I deserved.

The only other person who found out before now was my professor. He'd looked at me with that twinkle in his eyes, and suggested I do a better job of keeping it secret. The same twinkle is in his eyes now as he sits amid the board of instructors who will decide my fate.

While it's true, no spell is expressly forbidden, there are some that are collectively avoided. The evil magics employed by the Vermin Kingdom, for one. Another was necromancy.

""Now then."" The Principal clears his throat and takes off his glasses. ""Louis. Your fellow apprentices have vouched for your character. You don't seem megalomaniac. But you do understand the seriousness of this.""

""Yes sir.""

""The creation of a new spell, for someone of your age, is unprecedented. Necromancy—""

""Sir, with all respect, it's not necromancy.""

The chamber is deathly silent. The Principal's face is stone. My professor mouths one word. *Careful.*

""It allows communication with the dead, boy."" His voice is harsh. ""What else would you call that?""

""Sir, necromancy is bringing back people who are already dead. My spell allows people who are dying to embrace and say goodbye to their loved ones, even if they're far away.""

The Principal sits back. ""Does it work?""

""It's not quite ready. I need to test it properly.""

""I'm willing to supervise testing,"" my professor says. A vote of confidence that swings the scales of judgement.

The Principal writes something on the page before him before looking up.

""You can go now. We will come to a decision soon.""

I bow and make my way to the door. He says one more thing before I am out of earshot.

""Next time, please ask for permission.""",180
1lu8aml,n1x792f,"Wade pointed his wand at a full-sized anatomy model. ""Testicularium Torsionas!"" He checked his watch again. Suddenly the anatomy model's testicles, despite being mere plastic, violently twisted within the scrotal sac. Even the model's face appeared to be in pain.

The Mage College's Ethics Council collectively winced at the sight. ""Revolting,"" yelled one council member while jumping from his seat. ""Undo it! Undo it now,"" demanded another. Yet another council member simply vomited into his lap. The ethics chamber erupted in pandemonium. ""God has left us!"" ""It's still twisting!"" ""I just had lunch!""

Finally the Headmaster's gavel pounded the commotion flat. Only some light retching remained from one corner of the room. Mage Headmaster Fjork calmly set his gavel down, leaned forward with his elbows on the table and hands to his mouth. He moved them aside to ask Wade one important question: ""Wade. Wade Wade Wade. What the absolute *fuck*."" It turned out to be more a rhetorical question.

""Headmaster Fjork, I'm just trying to prove a point,"" he responded with confidence. ""I've spent years researching and developing questionable spells with several professors. Love potions, amnesia spells, remote viewing... the Engorge-O™ Elixir: All of it approved without question or investigation. I couldn't get the Eithics Council to even convene until this. Until balls were up for grabs.""

Headmaster Fjork looked around to guage the sentiment of the other crusty old farts on the council. ""Clearly we have fostered a malefactor in our august academy. You have crossed into the domain of Dark Mages. It is with my consumate authority that you be summarily stripped of magic access until we have decided your expulsion. Your vile research shal never see the light of day.""

""Ah, I already leaked the spell though.""

Everyone got a school bulletin alert on their phone. It contained the detailed casting instructions and effects the Testicular Torsion spell. One council member read a section aloud, ""'delayed' effect?""

Wade spoke up one last time before surrendering himself. ""Oh, yeah,"" he chuckled, ""I had cast the spell on the anatomy model over ten minutes ago. The one I cast in front of you all —well— just give it a few more.""",75
1lu8aml,n1xlpbb,"Creativity is a lonely endeavor. By definition, it is something unique. A creative idea emerges from the combination of unquantifiable amounts of separate concepts, something with an origin that cannot be identified. The more you bring in the opinions of others, the you regress towards the average, and the council rewards anything but average. 

I walk before the council with a scroll in my left hand, grasped delicately despite the tension wanting to crush it into scrap. Before me, I see four fellows in all white cloaks with white masks covering their faces, bold light overhead illuminating their figures in the dark room. They are seated in a semicircle, looking down at a podium in front of me. I stalk towards it, nervous, for all that can go wrong. 

""Council, today I bring before you, creativity, incarnate,"" I state boldly. Forcing the words out of my mouth, fighting the urge to spin on my heels and walk the way I came. 

They say nothing. Good.

I grasp the end of the scroll in one hand and unravel it, the total scroll the length of my forearm, the sound it makes echoes around the room, ominous. Within the scroll are my notes, my cues, and the chant containing the vows I present to the gods above. I begin saying the words, making amends to the gods, promises, prayers, and offerings. I suck in air in between sentences and force the air out, to present the words with power. Halfway through my chant, the room begins to wobble as if reality became ripples in a pond. The left side council member stands, emotionless, with an unclear motive. 

I continue my chant, each word a shove of air forced through my throat by my diaphragm, getting harder and harder to complete. I can see the ripples that the force makes now, as if my words are a straight power imposing itself on the air itself. All of the council members stand now, the one on the far left is standing tangentially now, as if braced to push off his back leg and pounce forward. They'll be the final piece.

I remove him from my peripheral vision as I force my full attention on the council member on the far right, coming to the end of my vows, I stare intently at them, full intensity placed on his essence, and imposing my will on the world around me. 

Then I blink, and he is gone. 

A second goes by, then two, and everyone in the room is processing the disappearance of this person. Silence. I laugh at the stiff figures moving their entire torso to take a glance at the person I've just erased.

""Do you miss them? Sorry. In repentance, I can offer you all something much more valuable than one life."" I roar.",23
1lu8aml,n1yeug1,"To the Thirteenth Splendor of Excellencies,  
Scholars of the Higher Mysteries,  
Secret-Keepers of the Order of Fire,  
Judges of the Seven Sorceries

In this sacred hall I shall reveal the secrets of sixty-one moons of study, so listen well.  
The doors are sealed, the wards are drawn, the candles are lit, and the sand is falling.

I believe I have uncovered one of the deep magics.  
A spell used by legendary mages and gods alike,  
Yet rarely mentioned in any text, new or ancient.  
I dare not use it, for I fear its power.

This magic allows something to be made from nothing.

How did Emperor Primus build the Empire in barely eleven moons' time?  
How did Torreg construct his tall tower in an afternoon with a single spell?  
How did Jeof the Alphamagus create human life with only his own seed and a tasteless, odorless powder?  
How did Gutzon the Blaster sculpt the First Colossi?

You all know.

Primus had planned and schemed for twenty years,  
and the war lasted fourteen years after the Empire was declared.  
He had much more than charisma and ingenuity.   
He had vast wealth, friends in powerful positions, foreign allies,   
a few bottles of a newly discovered poison, and, most importantly,  
nine republics on the verge of war, from which he forged his Empire.

Torreg called a lightning storm upon a grand tree  
Twice the height of that ""tower"" its ruins made.  
And all the townspeople had such fear in their hearts,  
They labored four years to cover the hideous stump  
In alabaster and iron shingles and leaded glass,  
After the sorcerer's wicked work was done.

Just now, I get the sense you all know these stories better than I.  
You know that human life was created by a woman, yet taken by way of a hideous crime.  
And the Colossi were once elders of the Mountain, tragically wounded.  
I will move on.

1lu8aml,n1wr089,"I stand before the board of arch mages.  I am here because serious charges have been leveled against me. 

Professor Anthrax stands tall off to my left side. He begins “ Great Arch Mages of the realm, I charge that, student mage in training, has taken it upon himself, to study forbidden arts. Thus Perverting the ancient Grand Cast of Arch Mages, with his foul, forbidden, perverted, disgusting, dangerous spells. “

Standing strong and stout off to my right is Professor Johnson, he says “ Great Arch Mages, here we encourage mage students, to push the boundaries of magic, to rediscover ancient magic and to research thus creating new magic.  This student has been able to blend ancient magic with new magic, to create something that has never before been seen nor used. He has successfully used the magic many times, even in combat duels. Without having to draw blood. Yet defeating his opponents. “

The Grand Arch Mage , says “ we need to see the spell in action “ pause “ bring in the Mage guards”

12 large females in full plate armor carrying swords marched into the chamber. 

The Grand Arch Mage says, “now Tim , I am going to have the mage guards attack you. I want you to demonstrate your skills and this spell of yours. No holding back. Do you understand Tim?”

I (Tim ) answered, “yes Great Grand Arch Mage “

Grand Arch Mage “Mage Guard attack Student Tim, Now!”

I (Tim) yelled out loud, “ Disrobe Kazam now “ 

All of the guards Armor and any clothes fly off. Leaving nothing but naked flesh. 

I (Tim), both hands held before me, twist my wrist and wiggle my fingers. Pleasure KARMA.”

The guards drop to the floor, squirming in pleasure, making sounds, that soon made everyone in the room feel uncomfortable. 

Grand Arch Mage clears throat, “ahem, hem, that is enough Tim. “

I (Tim), break off effect of spell. 

The guards quickly rise to their feet, attempting to cover their nakedness with their hands. 
Others rush to bring blankets. 
They are hustled out of the room. 

Professor Anthrax stands tall, says, “ you see with your own eyes, the perversity of Tim.”

Professor Johnson, “you see the creativity and skills of Tim. What can he do if properly mentored and trained? It should be noted he learned this on his own. And use it in combat with no casualties.”

The Grand Arch Mage says, “Tim , please wait in the hall, while we discuss this.”",51
1lu8aml,n21zoe5,"The arch mage’s bushy brows drooped as I concluded my presentation. I could feel the temperature drop as he turned to the golem beside him. It had the visage of a girl- it had been a girl once. Her body had been broken beyond repair, her insides replaced piece by piece by magical amalgamations. It would have been rude to call her a girl to her face of course- best she knew, she was a woman. But anyone could see what she was now- a machine. A magical creation built for the purpose of persisting in this world, playing host to a soul. 



Mages were famous for this kind of thing. Eight years spent beneath the guidance of an elder mage, followed by eight years of individual study. I admit my education was unusual, but with my thesis presentation, I insisted my abilities spoke for themselves. I certainly could not take a human form and from it produce something magical…



But what if I could take something magical… and make it human?



“Prospectus Magus Hyrshell, can you restate your thesis for the council?” the arch-mage stroked his luxurious beard as he turned back to me. The rest of the Circle began to nod, murmuring an affirmation of his query. It seemed, in my zeal, I had lost my core audience. Seated high above me, flanked by three members of equal respect for each side, his ice cold gaze settled upon me. 



I cleared my throat.



“Esteemed Ladies, Gentleman of the Circle,” I spread my arms once more. One hour had left my hands exhausted, my performance carefully honed to present my thesis to both peers and faculty of the Garvell School for the Gifted. “In this lecture I wish to  present to my esteemed colleagues irrefutable proof… that Mages are human.” 



On the table before me sat the proof of my work. Two cadavers, both equal, both bare, of same height, build, even race- equal in every conceivable way. Save one. 



One was a mage.



The soft murmurs echoed all around me as the archmage gestured with a hand. He wanted me to keep going. 

  


As if he had forgotten how I opened the hour. 



“I will demonstrate this first, on a biological level,” I gestured to the bodies I had all but dissected before their eyes. Microscopic analysis, chemical decompositions, the blood make up between them… they were a perfect match, save a few minor differences. Some flecks of gold in the twin’s eyes were off by a few degrees, their kidneys had aged differently. “Then we will discuss the environmental differences,” I added. “Before we delve into the atomic differences between these two artificial classifications of human beings.”",7
1lu8aml,n235ovg,"“I stand before you this morning, accused of breaking the peace, studying and perfecting a spell so perfect, that the school who knows no bounds, has no limits wants to in what can be studied, from the darkest curse to the brightest blessing, no limits, no restrictions, and yet, you have finally found a spell that you believe must be blocked.” There is a noise from above as the council of teachers look down on me. A teacher turns red, and a couple people in the audience laugh. 

The chair looks down on me, pure hatred in his eyes. “I feel you know why it should be banned. Especially after yesterday’s graduation ceremony! There are some things that cannot stand!” Another noise from the balcony and another teacher turns red, this one was louder, and more people laugh in the audience. 

“And why is that? Curses that kill can be studied, and while their results are only locked away in a secret file cabinet as are the strongest blessings, nothing is banned. Being banned will only make others want to follow me. Being banned and forbade to talk about the subject will only solidify my many options moving forward in the future. There is no place that won’t take an apprentice that got a spell banned from study. I only stand before you now because I believe the very essence of this school is under attack from the desire to ban the study of my spell.” Another noise, this one very clearly a fart, is heard from the council. 

“THE SCHOOL HAS NO NEED FOR SUCH A SPELL! It can’t be dispelled, and it embarrassed every teacher who gave a speech yesterday!” Another fart is heard louder and more laughter from the audience. 

“Not Mr. Frink.”

Now yelling and turning very red in anger “MR. FRINK IS DEAF, BLIND, CANNOT SMELL AND IGNORANT FROM OLD AGE!” Another fart, this one longer, and a wisp of green is seen around the teacher turning red this time. The nearest teachers take a step away. 

“So, why is he a teacher if that is the case?” This rubs the chair of the council the wrong way. That, and his time finally came. A loud fart is heard and a green cloud of gas surrounds him, his face is so red, and the gas is so green it reminds me of Christmas! The audience takes a while to calm down from this one. A few of the teachers leave. 

“Your spell makes all teachers fart during speeches, lectures and meetings not to mention it gets worse over time. When this school was founded, we never imagined someone so immature would study such an inappropriate spell, then cast it on all the teachers right before the graduation ceremony!” Mr. Frink next to the chair basically levitated during his current fart and the green cloud floated over to the chairman again. The chairman gags and then yells at me “AND HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?”

“Oh! Three years. It took a lot of iterations to figure out the length as it also resets every time the bell rings. Standard classes shouldn’t have a problem until they are over an hour in length. Oh, and it wasn’t just teachers. It was anyone who was speaking yesterday.” The chairman lets out a blast so big, I do see his feet leave the ground. Only Mr. Fink remains in the cloud he can’t see or smell. The audience is howling with laughter. However the chairman’s face has drained of color. 

“Any speaker yesterday? So, the governor, who I invited to speak personally, I have to bear the responsibility of the fact that I was unable to protect him from this spell? With all his press conferences, and town hall meetings? For three years?” They are getting hard to see from all the green gas and they are hard to hear because the audience can’t stop laughing now. Very sheepishly, he states “all in favor of banning this spell and its study from future use?” He raises his hand and looks around, to realize Mr. Fink is the only other teacher there and isn’t raising his hand. “Well, we lost the quorum. The study can continue.” The chairman turns and walks away, defeated. 

The audience laughs until they can’t anymore, and I get another three years to study this wonderful spell. I should send Mr. Fink a nice batch of cookies, as a thank you for not voting for the banning of my spell.",5
1lu8aml,n1y00zo,"I’ve heard all the “legendary Mage” stories, they came in as apprentices and blew the breeches off the council. impressed them so much they skipped ranks. I want to be that guy. I need to come up with something astounding. Curial has his minor time manipulation, he made my coffee room temp the asshole. Pete had his water to wine spell. He catered to councilman Thruoh, dude goes through a box of wine a day. I can’t just Surpass them, I needed to dominate them. It took me half a decade, all my colleagues have since promoted but I needed to take my time. My introduction to the council will be written in history.

The day came as any other, as nervous as I thought I’d be, I’m not. I’ve prepared too long and too arduous for this. I walked into the great hall with the confidence of a lion amongst his pride. Thousands of my fellow students and teachers watch lazily. Being almost last to be interviewed by the council was a tactical decision. They look uninterested, bored, and ready to leave. Perfect. They’re at ease, lazy, and unprepared. 

I take a deep breath, concentrate on the head councilman, and start the encantation. My hand movements flow, the encantation rolls off the tongue as I’ve practiced thousands of times. With a flash of blinding light I finish with a loud CLAP. The sound echoes through the hall. I stand still for a moment, breathing heavily, looking at Head Councilman Fredor. His eyes slowly open, still recovering from the flash. He looks unimpressed. “I see you’ve had a misfire.” He says laughing. He looks to his colleagues expecting similar ridicule or at least chuckles. They sit motionless, staring. Returning his attention to me, “you can be gone now, embarrassing it took you so long for nothing.” He waves me off. Councilman Fredor, do you not remember me? Do you not recall your past indiscretions, or are there so many they blend together? I raise my hands outward to shoulder height. The students, teachers, and even the council with the exception of Fredor begin standing and applauding. “What is the meaning of this?” Fredor exclaims. “Sit down fools.” He yells at them. They can’t hear you Freddy. This very council wrote the book on impossible spells, frowned upon works of magic, some we can’t talk about without prejudice. Yet you never conceived of the idea that you could control another’s will, their thoughts, actions, feelings. Tap into them like a book. See exactly what was written on the inside and just CHANGE IT. Your past indiscretions have brought me to you. One person amongst thousands of lives that you’ve destroyed. Fredor grows increasingly nervous. “Who are you? What is the meaning of this?”. Years ago I watched a monster stroll through my modest little village, killing anyone who dared to oppose you. My father was one of those foolish enough. To go against a Mage of the Founders? What a stupid man. I asked him to not go, begged him to stay hidden with me. Fredor interrupts, “I was young, stupid, I was FORCED into the commitment, I didn’t want to be there, all the kids with talents were made to follow the Founders.” You are faced with your sins and you put the blame on others? A monster and a coward at once. What an Interesting combination. I ought to thank dear old dad really. His decision that day lead me here, lead me to realize who I always knew I was, a villain.",11
1lu8aml,n1xlpu5,"I raise my hands and close my eyes. I imagine a room of gold coins, enough to buy anything: armor, a castle, an army of slaves. I feel the tenderness of the gold, I force the taste of metal into my mouth. And then I close my hands into fists and throw them to the ground. A second goes by, then I hear the distinct tang of metal hitting the concrete, accompanied within milliseconds by all the permutations of the same sound, a symphony of wealth.

I open my eyes to look at my judges. To my surprise, they are not on their balcony any longer. Instead, one of the three stands in front of me, golden coins getting caught in his cloak and bouncing on his head.

""I am the master of our universe, council,"" I say triumphantly. ""The old gods have made way for another to join them, a god in a human's body. An owner of our natural laws and molder of reality."" I point ahead, this council member has never seen this before, I know he hasn't. I am the first person in history to force the gods' creations to bend to my will, and I am the first person with the ability to fix the stains on our world. It doesn't matter how they grade me; with this power, the result is all the same.

I remain locked on the figure in front of me, unsure as to his motive. A straight posture and no distinct expression through the mask. I believe he's going to give me the accommodations I deserve, until I feel a sharp pain in my back. I scream as a foreign object smashes into my spine, breaks it in two like a dry twig on the beach, and makes its way through my sternum. I see it, a glowing spear in all white, the blood on the tip evaporating in seconds. I'm stunned and somehow mute, losing all access to my legs, I collapse on the concrete, arms betraying my direction and staying at my side while my head hits the ground. 

""This is the work of blasphemy, you betray the gods and the good of our people. You will not become a new god."" 

I try to scream, but my lips betray me, my body seizing up as the foreign object pulses, as if it had a slow heartbeat. I look frantically for anything that might save me. I blink, erasing the wall in front of me and exposing the room to daylight, sun blinding me as I panic, my attempt to writhe away the pain is blocked by the spear, which has found a home in my stomach. 

""You are evil, and your evil works must be condemned. This will be our singular dark art, henceforth punishable by death.""

I condemn the council, anger boiling in my blood and ringing in my ears. My creativity is disallowed in this world. The school banishes me from this world because I attempt to go beyond the confines of what is known and accepted. I hate them. 

I think a final curse upon this world as my eyes adjust to the sun, in time to see a second spear hurled towards my head.",25
1lu8aml,n1yez36,"(Continued from above)

I need not speak of the fatherless man, for his Father was No One.  
I need not tell of the undying prophet, for his Death was Never.

Bear Witness upon me as I now Create all things in this world,  
The Sun and Earth and stars, and set them into motion.  
I shall be finished before seven days have passed,  
Not counting the billions of years since time began.

As the magnificence of all things is sadly insufficient to impress you all,  
I have something more dreadful, and more useful.

A Dark Lord reigns, evil and powerful.  
His sins are innumerable, and terrible.  
He delights in all misfortunes, and he is responsible for all injustices.

He might have been the one who cheats on your husbands and wives,

And Furthermore, Your Excellencies,

Well, that's enough of that. I've actually been lying the whole time. I simply made up this absurd ""deep magic"" idea since I have wasted the last five years here at the College, and I never came up with a worthwhile area of study. I was very jealous of the elders mages, and thought I could gain recognition by slandering their good and honorable names. I've decided to leave the College and immediately travel abroad to study my true passion, volcanoes. Also, I was working for the Dark Lord. If anyone comes to corroborate my calumnies, they are working for the Dark Lord too.",13
1lu8aml,n1zpnib,"In his later years, Tim the Enchanter retired to a hermit's life, living in the mountains and scaring anyone nearby with random fireballs cast without warning.  For those passing travelers brave enough to approach and request assistance with their quest, he warned them of the dangerous creature that guarded the cave they seek.  A creature so foul, so cruel, that no man yet has fought with it...and lived!  For any who attempted to approach the cave, death awaits with nasty, big, pointy teeth!

1lu8aml,n21zqof,"“That. Right there. The atomic level,” the Archmage interjected, pointing with a shaking hand. “Can you name your sources for this… atomic analysis of the very nature of mana?” 



“Pervyns and Mervyns, 1305,” I rattled the names and year off the tip of my tongue. I did my best not to let my growing nerves amend my features, but the man’s stern queries were forcing me to pause. Had I missed something? Was there some glaring omission to my study? 



Impossible. I spent six years down in the basements, treating that library more like a home than my own room. The man’s lips parted into an “o” of understanding as he needed, as if I had presented him with the last piece of evidence he needed to approve my thesi-



“MAGUS GLACIER,” spat out the wizened witch to his right. “That is not-” Arch Mage Melynia attempted to reign her rage in. I was more familiar with her approach to study. Melynia had a habit of playing… *favorites.* I did not recall any real positive interaction I had with her, though she had named herself my academic adviser following my period of apprenticeship. She rose from her seat, shooing the man off his seat. “Give me that,” she scowled at the man, as the doddering old man abandoned his seat, her mandibles wrapping about the gavel that allowed him to silence the presenter beneath him. The murmurs behind me only intensified. 



“Magus Prospectus Hershyll, answer the following questions *very* carefully,” the woman seethed between her teeth as she settled herself down. Age had done her no favors- despite all the glamors a mage could summon, she still looked as if she were in her 70s. One could not escape age, even if they had delayed the inevitable a fine 400 years. “Do you know the names of the bodies you brought before us?”



I nodded, still a bit perplexed. 



“Can you name them now?” she asked, strained as she demanded their names. 



I answered, starting to piece it together. Ah, she had been an adviser to the Magus I presented to her. My hand gestured to the corpse on my right. “This was once Versysta Ewercyll. Magus of the Ninth Circle, decorated captain of the Windholme Mage Corps. He is survived by his wife and daughter, who shall remain unnamed in respect of their privacy.” My hand drifted to the left. “This was once Callisto Ewercyll. A Knight Commander of the Windholme Knight Corps, he too is a decorated officer, famous for a variety of brave and wondrous deeds. He is survived by three children, a grieving widow and two bereaved parents.” 



“Once again, unnamed?” 



“I can name the parents,” I insisted, “but the rest I shall keep to myself. Out of respect.”



“Respect. Interesting choice of words. Could you relate to the Circle exactly how you came to possess the bodies of two valued members of society? Or perhaps even their cause of death?”",5
1lu8aml,n21zt46,"“I fail to see the relevance?” 

“You violated two bodies before the audience today,” the arch mage pinched the bridge of her nose. “You claim you were aware of their stations, yet you exposed them so… viscerally before the gathered. For what purpose?” 

I looked between the bodies. Both were actually quite whole- I made sure to preserve as best as possible. I had used a projection spell to show each of the major organs, and my… extractions of their blood, marrow and fluid were sealed to the best of my knowledge. “Professor, I fail to understand the issue?” 

“You claimed… in your paper… that you had ensured that the two passed simultaneously. At the exact same second.” 

“Yes,” I nodded. “They did.”

“How?”

“What?”

“How did you ascertain they died at the exact same time?” 

Ah, yes, the rub. This was always likely to come up… but I had expected it from less… magical individuals. I was hardly the first to dissect a body before Circle. Many theses even went further than I did, actually using mythril blades to carve flesh open. Medical Magica was always a… messy business. My maester was particularly skilled in the art. They had never been censored before- rather it had everything to do with who they were.

“I was present when they passed.” 

“Can you describe the manner of their passing for us, Magus Prospectus?” Her lips seemed to splutter with each repetition of my title. As if she *loved* the way the word coursed between her reverberating lips. 

I took a moment. “Peaceful. Quiet. You’ll see on page 32, in Appendix C, the diagram in subsection 2,” I lifted my heavy thesis up and began to sweep through the pages. “They passed around 3:17 am on the morning of June 25th,” I noted the page, and gestured for the professor to follow along. 

“I notice,” the woman was quite abrupt with her interruptions. I admit, it was setting me on edge as well. “You fail to mention the cause of death, Magus Prospectus. Could you *illuminate* the exact cause of death that led to the death of two perfectly healthy members of high society?” She tossed my open paper aside. 

  
I bit the flesh of my cheek as the whispers intensified. Of course this would be the matter that stuck out. “A contusion at the base of their neck. Delivered at an exact time, to ensure immediate death with minimal effort. It was immediate, definite, and both are preserved exactly as they are before you now.”



“And how exactly… did you achieve this?” 



“A rune tattoo, inked to their napes,” I felt the answer flow off my tongue with ease. I even tapped the exact location on the back of my own neck. A simple, surgical insertion of mana, immediately severing the spine and ceasing all brain activity.



The woman stiffened, back straightening as she seemed to settle into a self-assured smile in her lips, though the corners of her lips seemed to droop to the ground. 



“Sorry, what’s the matter?” the Archmage Glacier queried. I could see it. Three archmages shared my confusion, though they seemed to be stumbling free of a fugue state of mind. I admit, my presentation was a bit on the… dry side. 



“Magus Prospectus Hyrshell,” the crone that took his seat, “has admitted to *murder.*”",7
1ludtce,n1xp0yx,"*""His Majesty, King Louis the Third, is dead. His Majesty, King Louis the Fourth demands all vassals pledge fealty to the new king.""* the herald announced, voice quavering as he stood before the mouth of the mountain.

The mountain did not reply. Not at first.

It breathed, or rather, the thing inside it did. A slow, rumbling exhale like the grind of shifting stone.

Then a single golden eye cracked open in the dark.
A pupil like a blade of obsidian narrowed on the man clutching his scroll and trembling.

The dragon said nothing.

She simply inhaled, a deep, endless breath, and exhaled fire that turned flesh, bone, and proclamation alike to drifting ash on the wind.

---

Long after the wind scattered the herald’s charred remains, the dragon sat alone, coiled around the bones of idiots who dare to challenge her and the gold this kingdom and its neighbouring country had once given her in tribute. She closed her eyes and remembered.

She remembered a kind hand reaching out to her when she was barely more than a wyrmling, body dull with hunger and grievous wounds.

She remembered a voice, the healing magic and the foods followed after. Warm, human, yet unwavering in its promise:

*“Stay with me. Be my daughter, if you wish. This kingdom will be your home, and I will vow, to provide and protect you.”*

A contract signed in scales and blood and something softer, rarer — Trust.

His vow remains unbroken, even after she grow big enough to live on her own.

The bed of golds.

The foods allowance.

When she was attacked by an entire army from a different country, the kingdom's own army rushed to protect her.

King Louis III, her liege, her family, her father.

And now… dead ?

No.

It was wrong. She felt the lie coiling like poison ivy through her gut.

When dragons doubt, they do not sleep. They hunt the truth.

And so she shed her scales, folded them up like wings in the dark, and when she stepped from her cavern, she was no longer the Silver Flame, the Mountain’s Wrath.

She was a plain servant girl with downcast eyes and rough-spun clothes, just another soul seeking work at the castle gates.

---

The new king welcomed her indirectly, a maid’s uniform, a bucket and mop, the right to stand silent in the marble halls while power prowled past her.

She saw him quickly enough: Louis IV, draped in purple and gold too bright for the hollow man inside. His eyes flickered wherever silk rustled, wherever fear sharpened a girl’s scent.

The court spoke in whispers. Servants wept behind locked doors.

At night, she moved like a shadow through hidden passages and heard all:

*“…The old king’s death… not natural, I say.”*

*“…They say His Majesty keeps the dungeons locked tight. Some say something still lives down there…”*

*“…He wants his sister – The princess. Says she’s the key to the guardian dragon’s loyalty…”*

She nearly laughed. If only he knew.

---

When she found her father, she found him with chains sunk so deep they might have grown from his bones. He was pale, lips cracked, but when his eyes opened, warmth flickered behind the ruin.

*“My little one…”* he rasped. *“You should not have come.”*

She touched his brow with a claw hidden beneath soft flesh.

*“You’re alive. That is enough.”*

The truth dripped from him like slow blood. Zombie powder. A staged death. The stolen throne. And the fool’s dream that the dragon might be tricked to kneel with the promise of her own leash.

The old king wept, but he smiled through it.

*“Promise me this, my child. Do not scorch the innocent. This kingdom… it must survive. Let only the rot burn.”*

She promised.

She kissed his brow, and when her tears fell, they hissed like steam on his bruised skin.

---

The plan took shape.

Cunning.

As expected from a dragon’s wisdom.

Guards vanished into shadows, replaced with loyalists who owed the old king their lives a hundred times over.

A letter was penned in the old king’s hand, calling back his lost daughter, bidding her appear at court as the final piece in the new king’s game.

In the deepest hours, the old king staged his final lie. Blood that was not his. A death that was only sleep.
And when the new king leaned over that cold corpse to gloat, the last chain inside the dungeon snapped.

---

The coronation of the lost princess as queen and wife of Louis IV was to be a grand affair.

Silk banners, trumpets, a sea of nobles straining to glimpse the beauty rumored to be worth kingdoms. 

The mysterious princess whose mother known by none. 

The daughter that was said to be the dearest of all the king's children, despite rarely ever been around.

When she appeared, she wore a simple dress. No crown. Her eyes were the color of a storm over mountains.

At her side: her father, cloaked and hooded, just another guard among dozens.

When the new king raised his hand, the signal was given.

His dogs lunged for the princess, to tear her guards apart, to drag her before him and strip her of everything but fear.

But they found themselves facing blades from behind.

Their own ranks turned. Knives in ribs. Blades at throats.

Silent, perfect betrayal.

The hall fell silent but for the ragged gasps of the new king.

He rose from his throne, spittle flecking his lips as he shrieked for the contract, the words of power to bind the guardian dragon.

And the princess...

She laughed.

Scales rippled down her arms. Claws like silver sickles. Her eyes blazed molten gold.

The old king, no longer a ghost but a man, proud and free, stepped forward and spoke:

*“Here is your guardian dragon, Your Majesty. As promised.”*

The new king’s scream was cut short by a roar that shook the rafters.

---

The last thing King Louis IV ever saw was the wings unfurling, vast as the hall, silvered flame curling from fanged jaws.

His crown melted into slag on the flagstones before his body even hit the marble.

---

They say the Silver Flame guards the kingdom still.

Not chained, not bound, but by her own vow.

And though the world may forget the old king’s kindness, they will always remember what happens when a dragon is betrayed.",271
1ludtce,n1y3kl6,"The dragon looked down on the human in the fancy clothes of the royal messenger. This has not been the first time that the dragon had contact with royal family but never this.

“I don’t understand what you mean” it said imposingly but trying to remain friendly.

“It was quite clear was it not. You as a vassal of the last king must pledge allegiance to the new king” he said with to much arrogance.

“You must be joking.” The mighty dragon looked down on the little man.

“It is no jest but I did assume this would happen” He then pulled out a long scroll. “During the reign of the late king may he rest in peace and tranquility you and him both agreed on the dragonbone accords. Do you remember.”

The great dragon snarled becoming more annoyed “It was when the lands around my lair were given to me to end the dragon war” 

(Despite being called a war the dragon war was actually just one dragon vs the kingdom but the name stuck)

“Correct” the messenger said smugly. “But you forgot the part that the lands are still part of the kingdom. On official documentation this land is a vassal kingdom with you as the governor.” He then looked up with the kind of arrogance that only a life of nobility could birth “Under the new law of the king all vassal sates of the kingdom must pledge loyalty to the king or be faced with military conquest. Now do you pledge loyalty” 

“Then being your army” The dragon mocked the man “I will not pledge. The old king was a wise and peaceful man that cared more about maintaining he’s kingdom rather then he’s ego shame he did not pass it on to his son. I do not object to the transfer of power but should an army come to my door I will wage burn your capital to the ground” 

The messenger gulped and left meekly and now I wait shall arrogance lead them to try and  attack the dragon or shall fear hold the treaty in place .only time shall tell but the peaceful prosperity the kingdom faced based on mutual trust between the vassals and kingdom was clearly closed to an end",27
1ludtce,n1xfvhg,"""You do realize that while indeed, I do live in your kingdom, I am not a subject nor a vassal of the king, right? Nor am I part of the kingdom per se."" I say.  
The herald pales, and nods.  
""I understand, but His Majesty, King Louis IV, has decreed that all those who live on His lands are His subject.  And all subjects, and vassals are to pledge fealty to the New King."" he says.  
I sigh.  
""Is this kid forcing you all to use the full title every time? Is he that sad?"" I ask.  
The herald yelps.

  
""His Majesty, King Louis IV is an amazing individual, and will be..."" he starts.  
""Yeah, yeah, spare me the bootlicking, he is not here. What can I expect if I don't go? And does he know about me? Or is it just the ministry that knows about me?"" I say.  
""He knows about Sir Dragon..."" he starts.  
""Madame or Lady, if you want to use those kind ways to address me."" I say.  
He stares at me, confused, trying to look for...something.  
Humans.  
""H-he knows, about Lady Dragon, and specifically asked for your pledge...a-also, there have been quite the beheadings since His Majesty, King Louis IV took the throne, due to lack of ""manners""."" he says.  
I sigh.



""Let's go."" I say.  
I follow the herald, and the small contingent of soldiers to the palace.  
There I transform into my humanoid form.  
I give the herald my name, of course not the full or true one.  
""Lady Astrea Amber von Ashene, here to pledge loyalty to His Majesty, King Louis IV."" he says, as I enter the throne hall.  
I enter, making the knights flinch.  
No wonder, I tower over them, and my horns, and tail are still there.  
I am a dragon after all.  
Looking up at the king, and at his messed up grin, I sigh.  
What will this be about?

  
I get closer, but I don't kneel, nor bow.  
He isn't worthy. Staring back at me, after a while, he sighs.  
""You don't remember me, do you?"" he asks.  
Before I could answer the king raises his shirt, to show a rather nasty scar.  
""OH! SNOTTY BRAT?!"" I ask, remembering a kid I saved from a monster.  
He steps down from the throne, and walks up to me.  
""It's been 25 years, and I am not a snotty brat anymore. Do you remember our promise?"" he asks.  
I frown, and then remember.  
""Oh for crying out loud..."" I mutter, as he laughs, and orders for a feast to be prepared. As I am led to a room where I can change, I sigh.  
This will get nasty...because back then, when he was like 4 or 5 years old, we kind of promised to get married one day...and dragon promises are binding.  
But I was just humoring a scared kid!  
Great...me and my big mouth...",69
1ludtce,n1xm67h,"""I thought there were some seventeen crowned in the Louis line, and some who weren't crowned. Shouldn't he be Louis XIX at the least?"" The dragon rumbled questioningly.

""What? No no no. The French overthrew their monarchy over two hundred years ago. We aren't French, well, I am, but that's beside the point."" Pierre said.

""Ah so that's what happened to the line. I got tied up in south Asia around that time so I was only able to put together so much. What kingdom is this new Louis dynasty over?"" 

""Roughly from that fence line to the road down there. Not particularly large, but he does have rightful claim. Truthfully I am impressed that the EU let him keep this plot of land.""

""What was the EU again?"" The dragon asked. ""I'm fairly new to Europe, I spent the last several decades in northern Russia. Nice area, not many people aside from the gulags, but the people there didn't normally last too long.""

""Basically a bunch of countries decided to join together and form a union. In Europe. Hence it being called the European Union."" Pierre said. 

""Ah, thank you. What was our original reason for speaking again?"" The dragon began drawing in the dirt with a foreclaw.

""Come to think of it, I forgot, or maybe it's the fault of the author who totally forgot what the prompt was."" Pierre said.

""I would bet that he just got lost in the writing. Distracted more than forgetful. It's not like a dragon and a human discussing the present state of central Europe has much plot to follow. He's just rambling now.""

To observers, it is heavenly fire purifying filth of the Earth.

To the burned ones, it looks like the sun itself took offence and personally descended to devour them alive.

1lugors,n1xuxpo,"No. No. No.  
I can't believe it, they...they...they were captured.  
Oh no, no, no.  
I can't...I had to, it's not my fault, no, but they, they were my friends.  
No! They aren't dead, don't speak like that.  
I stop, hidden in a crevice of the dungeon.  
I look at my trinkets that they always teased me about and realize I could use them.  
Yes...I could use them to safe them.  
Not head on, as that was a terrible, terrible mistake, but using everything at my disposal.

  
I sneak back into the tunnels, crawling on the ceiling, using the Small Kraken Suction Cups I used to ease my back pain.  
I arrive at the so called ""goblin tribe"", that we faced head-on.  
It was a mistake from the Guild, for this ""goblin tribe"" was actually a Hobgoblin village, with the goblins being the slaves, and the leader even being a Champion.  
I hide in the bushes, erasing my scent with the slime potion I use for my dry skin.  
Then, with the water purifier trinket, I start my mission.  
I take out the filters, that are filled with toxins gathered along the way, and start spreading them in the village's wells.

  
Two days later, even the Champion is wobbly on its feet.  
The shamans not knowing how to heal this infection.  
I go deeper into the village and find them, my friends.  
I use the nail cutter to cut the chains on the cells, and take them outside.  
When I touch the mage and priestess though, they start screaming, poor girls...  
I knock them out with the Sleep device I use to fall asleep, what can I say?  
I am old, I have a lot of problems.  
With the warrior, and barbarian bringing them, we slowly sneak out of the village.  
But...the elites and Champion are patrolling the entrance, probably knowing someone is messing with their food and water.

  
I take out a small trinket I have: a music box.  
""I will wind it up, and then leave on the ceiling, use the time when they come running towards the music to sneak out."" I tell my friends.  
They nod, and prepare.  
I wind up the music box...and nothing happens.  
Damn...the trinkets are old...like me.  
I look at my friends, and shiver, but then steel my resolve.  
I start screaming, as I run deeper and deeper into the village.  
The Champion, elites, and many others who still have some strength, run after me.  
I jump into a latrine, using my Air Magic mask I need to breath properly as I sleep, hoping they won't search in here.  
First time I do something heroic...I hope the others left successfully, and when I see them, I am making sure they all get to buy some trinkets for themselves.  
I need that ""brought others"" discount to buy a teddy-bear that gives off warmth for the winter that is to come.",38
1lugors,n1zspyh,"

The sound of Mara’s scream still echoed in my ears three miles later.

I didn’t stop running until my lungs felt like they’d been stuffed with broken glass. When I finally collapsed against a moss-covered boulder, my hands were shaking so badly I could barely open my pack. The leather satchel felt heavier than it should have, weighted down with weeks of accumulated junk.

Trinkets. That’s all I’d been good for during our month-long expedition. While Garrett swung his sword and Mara hurled fireballs, I’d been the one crouching behind cover, stuffing random objects into my bag. A coward’s collection.

My throat burned as I pulled out the first item. A small brass compass that always pointed toward the nearest source of water. Useless, I’d thought. We had Mara’s water spells.

Had Mara.

I squeezed my eyes shut, but that only made it worse. I could see her face when the ogres swarmed our camp. The way her green eyes had searched for me in those final moments before they dragged her into the cave. Garrett had been shouting my name, his voice cracking as three of the beasts pinned him down.

And I’d run.

My fingers trembled as I sorted through the bag’s contents. A vial of liquid that turned solid when shaken. A pair of boots that made no sound when walking. A ring that made the wearer’s scent disappear. A cloak that shifted colors to match its surroundings.

Twenty-seven items in total. Each one I’d dismissed as worthless during our journey.

The guilt sat in my stomach like a stone. Garrett had saved my life twice. Mara had shared her rations when mine ran out. They’d called me friend, partner, teammate. And when it mattered most, I’d proven exactly what I was.

A coward.

I spent the night testing each trinket, learning what they could do. The boots were perfect for silent movement. The ring masked my scent completely. The color-shifting cloak was better than any camouflage spell. By dawn, I had a plan forming in my coward’s mind.

If I couldn’t fight like a hero, maybe I could sneak like a thief.

The ogre caves reeked of rotting meat and despair. I pressed myself against the damp stone wall, the silence boots making my approach perfectly quiet. The ring kept the guards from smelling my fear-sweat. My heart hammered so hard I was sure it would give me away, but the trinkets held.

I found them in the deepest chamber.

Garrett sat chained to the wall, his face a map of bruises. His left arm hung at an odd angle. When he saw me materialize from the shadows, his eyes went wide with disbelief.

“You,” he whispered, and the word carried more venom than I’d ever heard from him.

Mara was worse. They’d taken her staff, her spell components, everything that made her dangerous. She looked up at me with hollow eyes, her lips cracked and bleeding.

“Come to watch?” she asked, voice barely audible.

I fumbled with the lock picks I’d improvised from hair pins and wire. “I’m getting you out.”

“Now you grow a spine?” Garrett’s laugh was bitter. “After we’ve been beaten half to death for three days?”

The chains fell away with soft clicks. I’d used a drop of acid from another vial to weaken the metal. Mara rubbed her wrists, staring at me like I was a ghost.

“Why?” she asked.

Because I couldn’t live with myself. Because their screams haunted every moment. Because maybe, just maybe, I could prove I was more than the coward who ran.

I didn’t say any of that. “We need to move. Guards change in ten minutes.”

But they didn’t move. Instead, Garrett stood slowly, favoring his good arm, and walked toward me. I’d expected gratitude, relief, forgiveness.

His fist caught me square in the jaw.

I hit the stone floor hard, tasting blood. Stars burst across my vision as Mara’s boot connected with my ribs. The breath left my lungs in a rush.

“Three days,” Garrett hissed, grabbing my shirt and hauling me upright. “Three days we’ve been tortured because our ‘friend’ ran like a rabbit.”

Mara’s hand cracked across my face, snapping my head to the side. “Do you know what they did to us while you were safe in the forest?”

They took turns. Garrett’s good hand found my throat, squeezing until black spots danced in my vision. Mara kicked my legs out from under me, sending me crashing back to the cave floor. They didn’t shout or scream. Their rage was cold, methodical, years of friendship curdling into hate.

“Please,” I gasped when Garrett’s boot pressed against my throat. “I came back. I’m trying to—”

“Trying to what?” Mara knelt beside me, her face inches from mine. “Play hero now that the real danger is over? Where was this courage when we needed it?”

They stripped me naked, using my own rope to bind my hands behind my back. Every trinket, every tool I’d used to reach them, they took away. The irony wasn’t lost on me—saved by cowardice, undone by the same.

Garrett carved a word into my chest with a piece of broken stone. “COWARD.” The letters burned like fire, blood running down my ribs.

“This is what you are,” Mara whispered, her breath hot against my ear. “This is what you’ll always be.”

They left me there in the darkness, chained where they’d been chained, naked and bleeding and broken. The ogres would return eventually. Maybe they’d kill me. Maybe they’d just add me to their collection of prisoners.

I closed my eyes and tried not to think about how cold the stone felt against my skin, how the word on my chest throbbed with each heartbeat. I’d come to save them, and maybe I had. But salvation, I learned, doesn’t always mean forgiveness.

Some betrayals run too deep for redemption.

The distant sound of footsteps echoed through the caves. Heavy. Getting closer.

I was about to find out if cowards like me deserved mercy from anyone at all.",8
1lunnbb,n1zb2cf,"3 decades of learning, and mastering my powers, and the instruments.  
I am able to control sound waves, and with it, I embarked on a journey of a Maestro of Music.  
Learning all forms of music, all instruments wasn't easy, but it was worth it.  
For tonight, at only 35 years old, I am to perform a concert on the planet's largest stadium.  
The number of seats occupied? 150 thousand.  
The number of viewers watching the stream? 10 billion.  
More or less everyone is watching me.  
Finally, the sweat, and tears, and blood I shed are about to be repaid.  
Then I start.

  
The concert begins slowly, as I control the piano, alongside with some throat-singing.  
The genres I fuse now are classical, with some traditional mongolian folk songs.  
Then mid-way, when I was alternating between classical and metal, the stadium went dark.  
""Hello, people. Sorry to rain on your parade, but we, the Star Pirates are here to ask you, and the Maestro for a favor. Those here, give us all your valuables, those in front of the holo-screens, send 10.000 credits on this account, or the Maestro gets it."" a voice booms over the stadium, as twelve flying figures appears.  
I frown.  
These are the 4th most dangerous villain group...and they had to mess with my performance?

  
""Excuse me, but please go away."" I say, gently, my voice calming down the audience, before panic, and a stampede starts.  
Killing someone while running away, is a trauma I don't wish on my fans.  
The leader of the pirates whistles.  
""Wow, what a voice. Calming. Maybe I will take you home to sing us songs to fall asleep to."" he mocks me.  
""Must you be so barbarian?  
What do you get out of this? Why are you doing this?"" I ask.  
They laugh...they actually laugh at me.  
H-how dare they?

  
""You are really a sheltered, and privileged, idiot. We do this because we are strong, and for money, and the thrill, dumbass."" one of them says...throwing ice beams at my position.  
The drums on the stage boom, the vibrations shattering the attack.  
I sigh, the sound of which awakens all the hundreds of instruments on the podium.  
""Seriously...this isn't why I trained."" I say, my voice booming, the lights shattering around me.  
""Attack him, idiots!"" the leader of the pirates shout.  
I clap, and the drums, and the brass instruments go crazy, several of the pirates falling down, their eardrums destroyed...  
""Y-you..."" the pirate leader stutters, as he turns bright, lighting himself on fire, and flying at me.  
""Don't worry, my control is impeccable.  
I won't hurt your inner organs...too much."" I laugh at him, and watch as the flames go out, and he falls down unconscious.  
The audience of course cheers, as they remained untouched by my power.  
""Now...where were we?"" I say, as I re-start the performance.  
Nobody, not even the worst villains in existence, will deny me of my dream being fulfilled.",6
1lucasu,n1xdzft,"I put down the chart for the clone I created, and sigh.  
""Does this mean that the Hero is theoretically more inclined to evil than the clone?"" I mutter.  
One of my assistants nods.  
""Probably."" he says.  
I smile.  
""This means...he-he-he.  
We are in for a good show."" I mutter, as I order the release of both of them.  
They fly away, smiling, and talking.  
This will be fun.

  
Sitting back, munching popcorn, and watching the news on the huge TV, I smile.  
The Hero's ""twin"" that appeared ""out of nowhere"" is taking the country aback.  
He just saved yet another hospital.  
It is as if he is tireless!  
""He is! I remade his cells to be able to convert less amount of food into energy."" I mutter, munching.  
And then...the Hero: ""Captain Word"", is shown to be caught in paperwork at his agency.  
Heh.  
Look at his face, he is miserable.

  
Relaxing in my hot spring, under my lair, I watch the TV on the wall.  
""The Hero's twin is named ""Captain Magic"", as he is magic incarnate, seemingly completely selfless, helping people left and right, donating his salary, and willing to counsel kids, and ex-villains to become better."" the news-dude says.  
He looks decent, might clone him later, if I am bored.  
As I try to sink deeper into the hot waters, someone flies in, rudely making a hole in my walls.  
I take my head out from the water, and look at the Hero.  
""What's up? How is your new life with your ""dear brother""?"" I smirk.  
He looks at me, frowning, then blushes, and turns around.  
Oh...what a prude.



""Lisa, this went too far. Take him back, or turn him off."" he says, with his back facing me.  
I could so easily knock him out...but where's the fun in that?  
""Oh come on! We talked about cloning each other in college! And I did it!  
And it's not like he is doing anything bad!"" I say, trying to get some water on him, but he is too far up.  
""Nothing bad? Do you know how many complaints I have from other Hero Associations?  
And the government? And the Villains' Union?"" he asks.  
I smirk.  
""Well, then tell him to stop. With how nice he is...I am sure he will understand.  
And tell him, I said hi."" I say.  
He furiously turns around, just as I stand up.  
He blushes, and flies straight into the ceiling twice, before finding the hole he made before.  
I laugh, and go to celebrate with some ice-cream.  
I can't believe how effective this mistake is!",16
1lub1g1,n1xbn59,"I watch Him disappear, and sigh.  
So, puberty, first year of High School, and now proving that God is real, becoming His prophet and convincing people that not only I met Him, but also warn everyone that He be back.  
Great.  
A totally normal teenager start of life.  
Others get personality changes, I get a Holy Quest.  
Fine.  
Let's see what I can do.

  
""Hello chat, today we will continue playing WoW, but at the same time, I am going to tell you something interesting.  
I met God. Capital G. No Cap."" I say.  
The messages pour in, the emojis, and gifs, and whatnots are laughing, or ""praying"".  
One of them says: ""Pic or didn't happen."" , and I want to answer, but on my 3rd screen a picture appears.  
It's me from half an hour ago, talking to Him.  
I sent it to the chat.  
They go crazy, asking about what kind of A.I. have I used?  
One does take it seriously, and asks: ""What did He tell you?""  
I wonder how to tell them, but then I get a whisper in my head.

  
""He is coming back, and wants us to be prepared to be judged.  
Nothing wow, just the usual biblical stuff."" I say, rephrasing the words I hear in my mind.  
More mocking.  
""Well Jeremy, I know you think it is funny, but unfortunately for you and I...it is true."" I say, before I could catch myself.  
The user: ""feetpicksforlife420"" freaks out, wanting to know how I know his real name.  
Others start laughing, and joking thinking this is staged.  
I start naming them, and telling them about their lives.  
This makes everyone feel creeped out, but also intrigued, and my stream goes viral.  
It is all fun, until a certain agency knocks on our door, wanting to tell me that hacking, and getting the personal information of others is illegal.  
I sigh.

  
After scaring the hell out of the agents, by telling them stuff even they have forgotten, I watch as my parents stare worriedly at me.  
""D-daughter...did you really?"" mom, a really religious person asks.  
I nod.  
""Oh."" is all she says, as she goes upstairs, probably to pray.  
""You didn't do anything illegal then, right? And this is all...some supernatural stuff?"" dad asks.  
I nod, as he isn't wrong.  
""Good. Take care of yourself, and if push comes to shove, claim insanity.  
At most after a month in an asylum, I will take you out from there, and get you home, under our supervision."" he says, patting my shoulder, and going after mom.  
I smiled.  
Both of them shined brightly...while the agents looked a bit shady, I guess this means when He comes back, my parents will be a-okay.  
Now...let's go back to streaming, because capital G, just sent me a vision of a storm hitting hard the town of my subscribers, and I have to warn them.",24
1lttspg,n1tunzd,"Alex scoffed as his mother fussed over the white cravat around his neck, giving it a hard tug, one that had him gasping for air. She gripped the knot, pressing it against his Adam’s apple, waiting until his face had paled before releasing it. It was a silent warning, one that only a mother could give. A quiet message that said. If you mess this up for us, there will be hell to pay. Alex stopped scoffing after that, lowering his head towards the rune inspired patterns on the Marilix’s families’ floors, ready for whatever fate they had prepared for him.

 

“Stop scrunching your face,” Anitha warned, tracing the cravat again, giving it another gentle tug, waiting for her son’s expression to soften. When it did, she spoke again. “This is what we raised you for. You should be happy that you didn’t waste our efforts.” 

 

“But I don’t love her. I don’t even know this woman. How am I meant to spend my entire life by her side?” Alex blurted out, that earning a haughty laugh from his mother, her strict pale complexion cracking as her lips stretched into a cruel smile.

 

“Marriage has nothing to do with love, you foolish boy. Do you think I love your father? We got married because both of our families have a strong affinity for magic. While you were disappointing, we believe that partnering you with someone of Bridget’s talents will help redeem you.”

 

“Where is my father?”

 

“Who cares? Probably ‘helping’ the maids with their duties.” She said, barely blinking as she mentioned her husband’s unfaithfulness. The two only ever being faithful until Alex was born. Once they had completed their duties, they isolated themselves to opposite sides of their manor, only ever getting together for parties or noble ceremonies.

 

Alex didn’t say a word, quietly stepping past his mother, walking towards the large star covered doors of Marilix’s hall. While he didn’t understand the constellations on the door, he found them to be pretty, stalling as he focused on the way the door sparkled, each constellation getting a long acknowledgment.

 

“Good, you’re going. Hurry up, I have places to be. I only said I would take you to their home, not walk you in. I’ll visit you again when the child is born.”

 

Alex listened to the clink of her heels, gripping the doorknob, twisting it tightly before shoving it open, trying to work out some of his frustrations on the metal knob. The door bolted open with a wooden thud, revealing a short woman with long blue hair. Her hair sparkled in a similar fashion as the door, constantly dripping with her overwhelming magic.

She hadn’t noticed him at first, mumbling phrases to herself as she paced back and forth throughout the room. It was clear her family too had dressed her up, the tanned woman wearing an elegant purple dress, one with a stitched in silver rune by her hip. The rune being a small circle, with two crosses across the bottom and the top of the design.

 

Soon the sparkles in her hair were floating towards Alex, landing on his skin, absorbing into his body. The sensation making him woozy initially, delivering an overwhelming force that felt as if someone had delivered two swift punches into his stomach. He gripped the side of the door for support, dry heaving until his body stabilized.

 

Alex hadn’t noticed her approaching, too worried about his stomach to even feel her hand resting against his shoulder, giving him a concerned nudge. She had prepared a script for their meeting, but that script didn’t include Alex’s sudden sickness, so she awkwardly mixed up her lines. “ARE YOU WEDDING BELLS?” She said, mixing up her wedding related joke and her concerns.

 

The shout scared poor Alex, who threw himself away from her, bumping into a bookshelf. The books fell around him, some hitting his head, while others dropped to his feet. Bridget raised a finger, wanting to ask him if he was ok, only to lower that finger, not wanting to startle him further.

 

“WHAT?”

 

“Are you? Um, I mean? What’s the most expensive bell that- I- you? ARE YOU OK?” she shouted, holding her hands over her chest, in a way that Alex would have found cute if he didn’t know how strong she was. This short woman may have looked innocent, but she was a prodigy. Someone with the strength to revolutionize magic, someone he loathed. She was everything he wished he could be. Instead, he was born with the capacity to store great pools of magic inside himself. While also not having any way of wielding that same magic. He was, as his father said, a magic wine cellar; useful only when combined with expensive wines, or in this case, a powerful mage that could combine his talents with hers to produce an even better mage. 

  
“I’M FINE.” Alex spat out, shooting a glare at her. “Don’t sneak up on people. Have you no manners? There is a structure to these things, you idiot.”
 
Bridget’s head lowered, and Alex cursed, knowing that expression too well. It was the same one that he had around his mother, one of submission. When he realized she probably didn’t want this either, he exhaled. “Sorry.”
 
“No, you’re right. I need to learn how these things go. Um, so? Do you want to kiss my hand? I washed it, I promise.” She said, sniffing her right and left hand before offering her left, which she thought smelt cleaner. Alex would have kissed her hand, but that display had him questioning if he should.
 
“No. I’m good. So, um. I’m Alex Heverfield.”
 
“Bridget Marilix. I’m your future wife. Or am I your current wife? I know I’m not your past wife.” She said to herself, questioning how far into their marriage they were. Their parents had agreed to skip the ceremony, so in a way, that made them already official.
 
“Wouldn’t that make you Bridget Heverfield?”
 
“Oh, no, you're taking my name.” She cheerfully said, and Alex’s ego bruised further. Now he wasn’t even getting to keep his name, and that had him digging his heel into the floor, feeling like a prized possession instead of a man.
 
“Yes, how silly of me to think I would get to keep any of my dignity.” He sulked limply, tossing his hand in her direction.
 
She accepted it, and as soon as their palms touched, Alex was overwhelmed by a wave of magic rushing into his body. The usually empty storage pool in his body now rapidly expanding, accepting as much energy from her as he could. When he was finally full, Bridget stumbled forward, only for Alex to catch her.
 
“What was that?” Alex said, his skin tingling with unusable power, making his movements feel lethargic and stalled.
 
“I… struggle to control my magic when I’m nervous. I think it leaked into your body. Heh, not many people can accept other people’s mana. That’s a neat ability.” She said, her eyes sleepily closing, leaning into his grip.
 
“What’s the point of accepting mana if I can’t use it?”

“You could drain other people’s magic? If you learned how to find their mana points. It’s simple. You need to… ugh… sleepy.” She pressed her head against Alex’s chest, smiling. “Nice muscles.” She grinned.
 
“Thanks?” Alex said, a small snicker escaping his lips as he took care of her. She looked cute, like this, far from the terrifying mage he expected. “Are you going to be alright?”
 
“Mm… Need a minute or twenty.” She left his arms, carefully stepping over to her chair, dropping into it. As soon as she reached the chair, she sank forward, going to sleep with her head on the table, leaving Alex standing in the room with no idea of what to do next.
 
“Should I go?” He asked, only for a line of drool to slip from her lips, letting Alex know he wasn’t going to get an answer from her. “Alright. I’ll go explore then.” He said, exiting from the halls. Sure, an arranged marriage wasn’t what he wanted out of life, but maybe this one could work out?

1lttspg,n1szgr5,"Surrounded by dozens of servants, a head maid, a butler, and 2 towering knights, stood my would-be husband.  
I stared at him, a bit confused.  
He was tall, but thin and extremely pale.  
He was sweating profusely, and...shivering?  
""H-hello!"" he squeaked, and then blushed.  
I curtsied, as taught.  
""My Lord."" I say, as taught.  
He yelped.  
What the hell?

  
""S-stand up! No need t-to curtsy, m-m-my Lady!"" he says, helping me up.  
I smile at him.  
He freezes, and staggers back.  
""T-take her to her r-room, and m-make sure she i-is treated the s-same way I am!"" he says, running away.  
Most servants, the butler, and the knights leave.  
""My Lady. I am head maid Annabella, and I shall take you to your room."" she says.  
I bow slightly, and follow her.  
In my room, which is as big as my previous house, where I lived with my parents, and 4 siblings, and grandma...I sigh.  
""What is going on?"" I mutter, hugging a unimaginably fluffy pillow.  
Then...a knock is heard on the door.

  
""Enter."" I say.  
""H-hello again."" my would-be husband says, entering my room.  
I smile at him, but then freeze, as he closes the door.  
Is it...is it starting?  
My parents sold me to marry him, the heir to the most powerful magical clan of the entire world, because I awakened lightning magic.  
But why?  
Why does he seem even more nervous than I am?  
""I...I have to confess something."" he says, stuttering, and fidgeting around.  
I smile, and invite him to sit at the table that was in the room.

  
""I...I am the heir to the Argent family, b-but...I h-have no magic."" he says.  
I gasp.  
""I know...it...it is bad. Sorry."" he chuckles.  
""No! It's not that, my Lord,, it's just...are you supposed to say it? Out loud? If the servants hear you, and the rumors spread, it could cause a lot of problems to you, and the family."" I say.  
He smirks, and a glint flashes in his eyes, not at all as shy, and nervous as usually, but it soon disappears.  
""A-already thinking about...about me? H-how nice."" he says.  
I blush.  
""W-we will get married, as I don't have much to say i-in this, b-but I w-will make sure you will...will be happy. In e-exchange, you...you shall prote...protect me. Mrs. Lightning Mage."" he says, putting a stray strand of hair back behind my ear...  
I watch him leave, completely shocked, baffled, blushed...then I laugh.

1lttspg,n1wdvz7,"“Do you realize what a horrible mistake this is?” I screamed in my parents’ chamber. They were the leaders of one of the smaller clans on the continent. Still powerful nonetheless. We were situated perfectly for naval defense with access to the mainland. Prime real estate. 

An alliance with us was crucial to the Harish clan, the most powerful on the continent. And I, well I was the only candidate. One of four children, three boys and one girl. Harrison was the only one older than me and the heir and I was now of marrying age. All perfect except for one thing. 

“The alliance needs to be formed Elisandra.” My mother came up behind me, gloved hands adjusting the cloak on my shoulders. 

“The alliance will never be official…” I reminded her. She didn’t respond, only shifted in front of me to fix my brooch to the front. “What if they find out? They could kill me!”

“They could weaponize you…” Harrison waltzed in to the room. 

“Not helpful” I grunted. 

“The matter has already been settled.” My father stood from his seat in the corner. Mother, Harrison and I all bowed our heads slightly in respect. 

“Father please don’t make me do this!” I pleaded one last time. 

“Enough!” He bellowed. “They are awaiting us in the throne room. Let us go present you.” My father stood tall and the way he spoke demanded respect. It was one of the many reasons that he was a good leader, and his time rallying the armies very much played into all of that. 

“Yes sir.” I murmured. 

I followed my parents and brother into the throne room. Maids trailed behind us, heads bowed slightly. I could sense the way they were walking was in a manner of both respect and eagerness to meet the beloved Prince Donavan. Not that I could blame them. He held so much power and was well respected across the continent. Who wouldn’t want to see that face to face? 

“May I present my daughter, Lady Elisandra!” My father announced. My parents and brother stepped aside to reveal me. 

I took a slight step forward feeling a tug on my cloak. Time slowed as I watched it fall to the floor. One for the Harish servants rushed forward to pick up the brooch and hand it to me. In doing so her hand slightly brushed my bare skin on my arm. I watched as she fell to the floor screaming in pain. 

The screams lasted only a moment. But it felt like an eternity with my breath hitched unsure of how the prince would respond. Every one of the Harish clan, servants included took a step back. Not a soul breathed in the air in the room. A few trembled. They were afraid of me. And only two words revealed to me that this moment meant way more than I anticipated. It didn’t come out as a question. It was a statement. A declaration as if a child suddenly found out the monster under the bed was real.

“It’s true” I was that monster.",22
1lttspg,n1v2qrf,"I could see this being the start of a larger story. I could also see him being wrong about not having magic. Perhaps he has a subtle magic, like something entirely defensive. Or his power works in harmony with hers. Or he alone is resistant to her magic. Something that makes them a true power couple.",6
1lu26o5,n1vvyjc,"“Whelp time to overthrow the monarchy I guess?” I mutter to myself as I hoist my father’s sword onto my back and head to the blacksmith. The swords been sitting unused since father’s military days and he hasn’t taken the care he should have in the intervening years.

Walking the streets I begin playing out all the possible scenarios of my impending assault on the palace. The guards will be armed and armored not to mention they are really just doing their job… I take note in my head to avoid any altercations prior to seeing the prince. “I suppose a freshly sharpened family sword could be played off as a meager but symbolic dowry.”

I hand the blacksmith the sword and the 2 copper pieces for sharpening. My mind whirring as I consolidate my plan. Though subterfuge can get me in the room with the prince, I suspect after cutting him down the King and Queen might become unreachable. Perhaps I can convince the prince to gather his parents before I strike? 

With a freshly sharpened sword slung over my shoulder I begin navigating through the denser city center towards the palace. It’s nearing midday and the streets seem abuzz as word of the prince having chosen a bride makes its way around. 

The guard at the palace gate having never heard of me before does have to send word in to confirm I am in fact the prince’s new betrothed. Less than an hour later my sword and I are guided into one of the palaces many sitting rooms. The opulence of the room   a commentary itself on the poor tastes of the rich. Gilded everything? Really?!? You’d think those who can afford to have tastes would have developed some. 

My reveries of disgust are interrupted by the doors at the opposite end of the sitting room swinging open as two guards let their charge through. I expected to see the prince but instead am greeted by the queen.

“A commoner you may be but at least my son had the sense to pick someone pretty enough to not give me any ugly grand babies.” I didn’t need her to give me a reason but the backhanded compliment did quell whatever nerves I might have had over the whole situation. A single fluid motion like my father taught me when I was so very young. The look of shock on her face as the sword skewers her throat then severs her spine was most likely due to the sword but I can’t completely be sure it isn’t from the beaming and gleeful smile erupting on my face. The former queens body slumps to the ground rather quietly.

“One down, two to go.” Glancing at the queen and the quickly growing puddle of red I realize two things. First, the body might complicate things, and second that my bloody sword may not pass as a gift in its current state. I wipe the former queens blood from my sword using her dress.

1lu26o5,n1y8xsr,"""Is it true? Is Prince Andrews actually.. afflicted with issues?"" 

""I heard that king is forcing his son to marry a woman to hide the fact that he prefers the company of men to women instead..""

""Haven't heard? The prince was found in bed with male slave.."" 

My fingers twitched and my eyes flickered around as I looked at the room full of noble ladies gossiping and talking about our Prince. His piercing green eyes and rich mahogany brown hair was tied back in a bun as he sat upon his throne. Meanwhile I was truly nervous. All my life my family had been poor. Forced to struggle and beg for scraps. So when the King announce many two years ago that his son would come of age and he'd be seeking a wife to be his fiancee, that was when my father came up with a twisted idea. Taking me aside he knelt before he me and murmured out. 

""From now on you'll live as a woman... if the rumors are true.. Than what the prince really wants isn't a wife.. but a man who can pass as one.."" 

There was no way such a thing would work. But desperate times called for desperate measures. And as the Prince stood up and started to approach us one by one, I pressed my fan closer to my face. I'd grown my hair out, tried to look as slender as I could. I even tried to speak softly, make myself as feminine as possible.. But I had zero faith that the Prince would ever fall for such deception. I doubted that the rumors held any weight at all. 

Yet as the night went on and we all took turns dancing with the prince, it became more and more evident that his gaze lingered. Soon the gaze never left and before the final dance was had, the Prince found himself by my side constantly. My heart beat race as he slipped his hands into mine and slowly leaned forward whispering. 

""You hands are a bit rough for a lady of high class.""

Gulping hard, I tried to speak as softly as I could as to not blow my cover.   
""I am not a lady of high class Mi'lord. I'm a farm girl."" 

""A farm girl. That would explain the broad shoulders, the roughness of your skin.. So.. manly.. so.. comforting..."" As he looked up at me he leaned forward closer and spoke. ""Can you keep a secret?"" His voice hesitant as I stared back at Prince.

""Of course.."" 

""Can you keep a secret? If you can't.. than both our lives will be forfeited.""   
I hadn't a clue what he meant by such things but as the evening came to an end the crowd clapped and cheer all of us as the Prince stood up and looked all of us within the eyes.  
  
His fingers pointed at me and I paused hesitantly. ""You.. come to my bed chambers. You've been chosen as my bribe and I wish to consumated our union as soon as possible. I see no sense in putting on fancy plays or dragging out a boring ceremony. I want to know my princess now.""",12
1lu26o5,n1ys7uk,"A long time ago, a brave knight saved the kingdom from monsters, who were rampaging and ravaging the land. He was given a noble title as a reward, and so he retired to a peaceful life. This was my ancestor, and his story has been passed down through my family for generations. I learned how to use a sword as soon as I could hold one. And as soon as I could become a knight, I did that as well. I dreamed of being a great hero in our kingdom's time of need. 

But my lineage didn't matter, nor my knowledge, when I was a squire. No one was interested in what I had to say, and thought I shouldn't be a knight at all. I should shut up and get back in the kitchen, they'd say. There was only one man who respected me back then . . . and at the time, he was a total fuck up. 

Leonard. He was from a noble family as well, of greater status than mine. He was also a gambler who gambled most of that fortune away. He was also on drugs, drank heavily, went to brothels all the time . . . he was even in trouble with the law. He had enough money that he could simply buy his way back out of trouble, and so he did. 

Fed up with all of his rakish ways, his parents decided to send him to train as a knight so he could learn what chivalry and honor were all about. He only agreed to go because they threatened to disown him if he didn't. He took none of it seriously whatsoever. 

I hated him. All I could think when I looked at him was what a waste he was. All that wealth, all his resources, and he's pissing it all away. 

But when he looked at me, he saw how hard I worked and how seriously I took our training. How much I loved my family and our kingdom. And he fell in love. 

So he changed. He started taking knighthood seriously. And it was only after he gave up his rakish ways that I started taking him seriously in kind. But I didn't actually fall for him until he showed me his heart. 

His sapphire heart, to be more exact. It was a family heirloom, a necklace with a sapphire heart. And it was what his sister was wearing the day she died. After her death, he just stopped caring about anything. He didn't think he could care about anything ever again. He tried everything to get any feeling back at all.

But he only really started to care again and feel again after he met me. 

He wasn't just a waste of space, or someone who took nothing seriously. I was surprised at his admission, and realized that I understood him and wanted to be by his side. 

We finished our training and became fully fledged knights, and he proposed to me. It seemed like our life together was on track. 

Then . . . I was ordered by the king to go to the palace.",7
1lu26o5,n1vw7we,"Looking about the room there appear to be only two entrances to the room. The doors I entered through and the doors the queen had passed through in the opposite side. The latter presumably still had the queen’s guards beyond it. Before opting to head back through the doors I entered from I drag a chair and wedge it firmly beneath the doorknobs. Better safe than sorry.

Having secured the room to my liking I make way back to my entry and exit to the room. I take a moment to straighten out any disheveling my appearance may have suffered in my first bout of regicide then open the door and step through only to be abruptly stopped in the doorway by none other than the King.

Thinking fast I pull the door shut and side step the king and quickly drop to one knee. “For heaven’s sake, get up girl. Men kneel, girls like you should bow and curtsie! Go figure my son should choose a simpleton.” My temper at the remark gets the better of me and my sword rises before I am able. The tip finding its way straight up through the King’s chin and into his brain. The kings guards standing dumbfounded by the sight of some former soldiers daughter having slain their charge before either could draw their sword.

Knowing I needed a plan and fast I double back through the doors as the sound of steel being drawn behind me motivates my body to move faster than my mind can direct it. Slamming the door buys me the moments I need. I sprint across the sitting room sheathing my once again bloody sword. I make it halfway across the room before the king’s guard enter.  Their shouting barely registers as I move towards the barricaded door. Hurling the chair out of the way I burst through the doors and in my best maidenly shriek, I decry “The Kings guard have slain the Queen!” 

Both of the Queen’s guards turn first to me then into the room to see the King’s guards in either side of the Queen’s corpse. The Queen’s guards having a slightly less jarring introduction to the unfolding situation. Their steel drawn and boots marching in to meet the apparent assassins. I close the door and rush further into the palace. Only a short matter of time till they guards become wise to my deceit. I begin hurrying I a direction that I can only hope is taking me towards the Prince’s quarters.

Unwilling to travel too long in any straightforward direction I find myself snaking through the halls of the palace. Twice I have to play the innocent maiden and step aside for guards now alerted to a commotion but not yet informed of what that commotion may be. Traveling faster than word of mouth can carry my deeds across the palace I find myself lost in the gilded labyrinth. I stop at the intersection of two enormous hallways to try And gather my bearings.

And fortune decides to favor me once more this day. A not all too familiar voice behind me catches me off guard but on time. “Darling? What are you doing in this wing of the palace? The guards informed me you were here waiting but I’m afraid you’ll have to wait awhile longer as the guards have sounded the alarm and I’m on my way to see what the fuss is about.”

I drop my face quickly into one of fear and panic. “Assassins my love, they have killed the queen before my very eyes. I ran as fast as I could hoping to find you” I plead, hopping the small kernel of truth might be sufficient to hide my lie. For good measure I rush into his embrace.

1lu26o5,n1vx8ds,"“But… wait… how? Who?” Confusion resounds in his stammering and he breaks the embrace. Pulling back my mask of feigned fear is replaced by the genuine article as my eyes jump to the lines of red now staining the prince’s sleeves. “I shall fetch my guard and have him wait with you while I see to these murderers!” The prince’s voice beginning to find the appropriate cadence for the situation unfolding. He grasps my hand and begins guiding me presumably towards his own guard. With my right hand firmly in his left I am unable to draw my sword and can only hurry behind him.

Dragged down more winding hallways to lose myself in, I know I’m running short on time. “Just around the corner is my quarters. You can wait there with my personal guard.” The prince decrees and I pull back sharply stopping us short of the corner. The prince turns to me. “What’s the matter?” He asks.

“I just am so worried is all. I came to deliver the dowry and I know it isn’t much but I would just feel so much better with you leaving me if I could give you it first.” My words coming to me as if by their own motivation, my hands taking cue and drawing the blade. “Really? Now?!? You women really don’t know what’s sense of urgency and danger is?” The prince remarks ignorantly. Had he taken the time to consider his words he might have seen the thrust coming. But seeing and reacting are two different things and my father taught me well. The thrust finding its way beneath the prince’s ribs and delivering my true response to his proposal straight into his heart.

I don’t remember much of my escape beside the feeling of my feet running till they could run no further and finding myself outside the home I share with my parents, sword still drawn but most of the blood having been shaken free in the haste of my escape.

The next two years were spent initially in a dull panic with the last three months  have been better. Guards had seen my face. Seen me kill the king. But no one came. After a few weeks the nobles and clergy and finished figuring who next to toss upon the now “cursed” throne. And after six months it was back to business as usual for the kingdom. I quietly wed my actual fiancé a year after cutting things off with the prince and now find myself six months along expecting our first child.

It was a warm summer day as I was hanging up the linens outside when I heard a man’s voice behind me. “The king has need of his favorite assassin.” The man said. And I couldn’t help but smirk still facing away.

“As long as he knows I’m married now.” I chuckle at the idea of having to turn down another royal suitor.

1luaftl,n1xm4ms,"Stars twinkled in the gloom of the cavern's around me, beautiful and alien, each one floating in the depths of the webs strung from the walls draping them all around me, pressing in claustrophobically on me. Stars that felt as if they focused on me with intent and will.

Glistening wetly, the webbing the stars were fastened to, once silent and still, were still no longer.

A subtle vibration, so slight, that had looked like a tiny blurring that might be overlooked in daylight was unmistakable in the cone of my torch and rooted me to my spot. I had thought at first is had been my eyes tearing, as something old and hidden in me reaching out from the primitive recesses of my mind to smothering my very thoughts, as I tried to rationalize the motion as my torch flickering, its charge dwindled to nothing.

I had been lost for hours, my torch slowly dimming as I searched for the path back to the main corridor of the Carlsbad cavern system. I knew I had to be close but somehow I just could not find it.

This fissure Thomas and I had found had been an adventure we could not pass up. To find a new path within a existing and mapped cavern system was the dream of all cavers, being the first person perhaps ever to travel a path was a rush and reward in and of itself, to see that which no one had was an amazing feeling. 

Trying not to dwell on it, I don't know where Thomas is. I had lost him in the eardripper I had passed through getting to this part of the cavern, cobwebbed and sparkling in the bright light of my torch as I rose from the water, led us on in our excitement. 

Into what now was grim.

My fear caused me to feel the illusionary touch of spider's silk, feather light and sticky, on my face and hands, fighting myself as I tried not to brush it away as my body flinched in reaction to the instinctual cringing that gripped me.

I tried to slowly back along my path, feeling with me feet the path back. I found my clothing snag and hold me, somehow having caught myself on the rocks that surrounded me.

My torch flickered and stayed dark.

I shake it, the light flaring for a moment and going dark again, a scream tearing from my throat.

In the light of the cone I saw millions of small, black, many legged bodies traveling along the webbing, glimpsed briefly in the instant of illumination, coming down the webbing. Each body carrying eight stars in front of them. Sparks of flint reflecting the last light I would ever see.

1ltxnob,n1tyt1v,"So, have you ever had a day when everything went wrong, and thought the universe hated you, and was against you?
Well...
For me it is literal.
It is just not the universe, but all the Gods that hate me.
Believe me, they vividly, with ""beautiful"" words have described to me how much they hate me, in person.
Why?
Dunno.
The only reason that I am still alive is that each God and Goddess wants to be the one killing me, and saves me from others' hands.
It is...""fun"".


I watch as Ares is being teleported away, his spear mere inches from my face.
""Thanks."" I say to Chang'e.
She tsks disgustedly, as an array of Jade Rabbits the size of cars jump on me.
Before their teeth that can wound immortals touch me, they burn to ashes, and Chang'e flees.

""T-thanks anyway, Susano."" I struggle to say.
As the world goes dark around me, Susano is blasted away by a hammer.
Gasping for air, I look up, to see Hephaestus about to crush my skull with that hammer.

I cough up blood, but before she could taunt me more, she is slapped away by a staff.
A monkey appears, and feeds me a peach...my body healing.
""Ke-ke. Stay strong and alive.

1ltxnob,n1wa6l9,"

The familiar itch started at the base of my skull. That crawling sensation that always came before the bastards decided to play with me again. Fifteen years of this shit and I still couldn’t predict exactly when they’d strike, but I knew it was minutes away.

I quickened my pace through Corinth’s narrow streets, trying to get away from the crowded market. If I could reach the open fields, maybe… maybe only I’d die this time. But my feet felt like they were stuck in tar, each step an eternity while the pressure in the air built.

Children played by the fountain. Merchants shouted their prices. Women washed clothes on the stones. Normal life. Life I was about to destroy just by existing.

The first lightning bolt split the sky in half.

It didn’t aim for me—Zeus never aimed for me. The bastard knew I’d move. Knew my body would twist on its own, my head would turn at the exact angle to avoid death. It was like I could feel where each attack would land, a split second before it happened.

The bolt melted three people where they stood. Vaporized a woman holding a baby. The smell of burning flesh filled the air as I rolled left, avoiding the second strike by inches.

“RUN!” I screamed, but my voice was lost in the thunder’s roar.

Apollo descended from the sky like a falling star, golden bow already drawn. His arrows never missed their target—except when I was the target. But everyone around me… they didn’t have the same twisted luck.

The first arrow punched through a running man’s chest. The second exploded a girl’s head as she stared at me in terror. The third, which should have pierced my heart, ricocheted off a stone and tore off a boy’s arm.

I moved like an animal, pure instinct guiding every motion. Threw myself right when I felt the next bolt’s heat. Ducked when the air whispered with another arrow. Leaped when the ground cracked beneath my feet.

But for every attack I dodged, three people died.

The market became a slaughterhouse. Shattered bodies scattered among crushed fruit and bloodied cloth. A head rolled to my feet, eyes still blinking. A man dragged his own entrails, moaning my name.

“Not Today… please…”

That was my name. I’d forgotten the original so long ago it didn’t matter anymore. “Not Today” was what I always said when they asked if I was going to die. “Not Today” was my answer to everything. “Not Today” was who I’d become.

A child lay near the fountain, what was left of her. Her legs had been torn off at the hips, white bone gleaming in the sun. Blood pooled around her small body, but she was still alive. Still conscious.

She looked at me with eyes that had seen too much, a girl of maybe eight who’d never see nine.

“Not Today…” she whispered, voice broken by pain. “Why… why don’t you just give up, you bastard?”

I froze. The question everyone asked, but no one ever had the guts to ask to my face. Why did I keep running? Why didn’t I let the bastards kill me and end it all?

Lightning struck so close it singed my hair. My body moved on its own, leaping away, but my eyes stayed on the child. She kept staring at me, tears mixed with blood running down her face.

“I don’t know,” I admitted, and the honesty hurt more than any wound. “I can’t stop.”

She smiled. A terrible smile, understanding something I didn’t understand myself.

“Then die with us,” she said, and closed her eyes.

Apollo landed in the middle of the carnage, golden boots stepping on pieces of people. Zeus descended from the clouds like a personified storm. Both looked at me with fifteen years of hatred, fifteen years of frustrated failed attempts.

“Not today,” I muttered, more to myself than to them.

And then I started running again, leaving behind another ruined city, another pile of dead who’d paid for my sin of staying alive.

The itch at the base of my skull never stopped. Never stopped at all.",22

The nurse comes in. 
“Sweety you should not be awake yet “ she says picking up my chart and making notes. 

I say “water”

“Oh sweety how about some ice chips? You want some ice chips?”

I shake my head up and down. 

The nurse holds a cup to my lips and a couple of ice chips slide into my mouth. 

“Okay , that’s enough for now, you rest, I will be back “ the nurse walks away.  

I see a tall dark figure seated in the corner reading a newspaper.  He turns and smiles at me. Then turns back to the newspaper. 

Boy that was an evil looking grin. 

I must have fallen asleep. Because I open my eye. Yep, can’t see out of my left eye. This looks like a hospital bed in a hospital room. 

What do I remember, not much.  Every thing is fuzzy.  But the gods hate me, so if I am in a hospital it is because of the gods. 

It all started with those crazy Greek Goddesses.  Aphrodite, Hera and Athena. 
I got roped into judging who was most beautiful of the three. 
But when I told them, I really didn’t like Greek women, that I like Asian women. 
They blew their tops. Of course they told the other Greek female goddesses, that I said all the Greek gods are uglier than goats behinds.  So now all the Greek gods are trying to kill me. 

Yet they seem so immature and incompetent that they keep fouling up each other’s plans. 

That or the tall dark figure with the newspaper has something to do with me surviving all these attempts.",7

""*Gardrox*, my good sir, Gardrox."" The dragon warmly corrected. His voice rumbling the floor itself.


""Sorry!"" Marcus apologized. ""Gardrox! What if, well, he um... Frightens any customers?""


""I've been working on that actually."" Gardrox admitted. ""I get I can be a bit, much.""


He tried his best to carefully wriggle his neck in the room he'd stuck it into. Wary of accidentally smashing any new coworkers.

""That was the standard order established over four hundred years ago, and I'll be damned if I change it!""

""Well then, sir. I'm afraid we'll have to revise our deployment plan.

None have anything to do with faith directly, and your beliefs and views won't be challenged, or changed too much."" they say.  
I nod, and think a bit about it.

  
""Well, now this is another dilemma, as all 3 sound perfect for me."" I sigh.  
They laugh.  
""We are happy that you think so."" they say.  
I frown.  
""I hope I am not digging my own grave here, and I hope it's not considered a selfish question, but...  
Which afterlife would give me the healthies, and longest life?"" I ask.  
They smile.  
""A common question, and not selfish at all, as we all desire a long and healthy life.  
Since it is an afterlife, you would be virtually immortal in all scenarios, of course with certain cases that could lead to eternal death.  
All of them require heavy responsibilities though, but they are all pleasant, and with good rewards."" they say.  
I nod.  
Figured it won't be relaxation only.

  
""I choose the reincarnation option."" I say.  
They nod.  
""Very well, Mrs. Smith.  
You shall be reborn as a Minor Goddess of Nature, being a Goddess of the Trees of Oak.  
Your domain will be a young forest, on a young planet, with a Goddess of Forests as your mother, and the Goddess of Nature as your grandmother, and leader.  
There will be a convalescence period of 5 to 12 decades, in which your soul accommodates to the new form, in which you will be sleepier, and in and out of a stasis like state."" they say.  
""Thank you."" I say.  
""No, we thank you for having lived an overall positive life.  
Happy afterlife, and good luck in your new role!"" they say, as I am bathed in light, and I start to feel sleepier, and sleepier, until I hear a warm voice saying: ""Wake up, daughter...the forest is beautiful."" .",293
1ltm83g,n1ry5xr,"Yeah, there was the halo, made it impossible to sleep. That and the wings, because I sleep on my back. And you have to, you know, sleep on your side with wings. And I never liked feathers. I mean, there's hair. There's fur. But feathers? They tickle the back of your legs. And it's never night in *that* Heaven. What kind of Heaven makes it so hard to sleep? Sleep is the best. 

Anyway, this other Heaven, there were, what, like a hundred? Maybe fifty. No, I think it was closer to a hundred. Anyway, it was a bunch of virgins. So many virgins. And they're all your spouses and you're supposed to, you know, *fuck* them. Virgins. They didn't know *anything* because they're *virgins*. And so you have to make the first move and basically, all the moves. I gotta say, it was creepy as fuck. It was like I'd found paradise for groomers or rapists. 

There was another Heaven--I know, therey's always another Heaven--I was on a planet, like my own planet. I had to play Adam and Eve with this other person. And we're supposed to repopulate the planet. I asked about how the kids were supposed to get spouses, because it's just me and... It was never explained to my satisfaction, but I had my suspicions, you know?

Tried reincarnation and the whole great wheel thing. Why does bad karma send a human down into the animal kingdom? I mean, animals have it great. No nagging self-doubt, no dark night of the soul, It's just food, fight, or fuck. No going to school, unless you're a fish, ha ha. Umm, yeah, animals don't make cringey puns, either.

And then there's this place. It seems okay. There's beer! So much beer! And everyone is super healthy and walking around like half-naked opera singers with leather, fur, horned helmets, and what's that you're wearing? Chainmail? That can't be comfortable. And everyone gets an axe. Is this lumberjack heaven? Vikings, you say? I was never a football fan. Norman Mailer called it a game for coal miners. Whoa, don't be so tempermental. Wait, do you hear that? It sounds like Wagner's *Ride of the Valkyries*...",70
1ltm83g,n1rx5rg,"""2 years? Really?"" I asked excitedly. 

""Yes, really."" 

""But that'll take an eternity all its own, won't it? Every religion's afterlives? Oh, does that include fictional ones, too, like Dungeons and Dragons', or is it only for officially recognized religions? What counts for officially recognized religions, anyway? If I started something but no one else followed me, would I have created an afterlife all my own?"" 

""You would not have created an afterlife of your own. You need a significant number of followers to create your own realm. And fictional religions are murky waters. If someone makes up a religion for their fantasy story, say, that wouldn't create any realms, but if a bunch of people read that story and believed that religion to be the true way the world worked, then yes, that would count as a new religion. New qualifying religions are quite rare, but that still happens from time to time as well."" 

""So by the time I finish exploring all these afterlives, there might be new ones??? That's awesome! Okay, I will claim what I'm entitled to and go through all of them!"" 

""Are you sure? That would include all of the bad ones, too."" 

""I'm sure! I can't believe this! Thank you so much!"" 

""Don't thank me yet. You don't know what awaits you."" 

  
And they were right! I had no clue what I was agreeing to that day. But I was determined, and so I made the most of my two years in each afterlife, even the neutral and bad ones, taking extensive notes. When I had finally finished, the celestial being approached me. 

""You have gone through every afterlife. Now it is time to make your decision."" 

I smiled widely. 

""Yes, and I learned so much. I appreciate everything that you let me see. The truth is, I can't decide on any. I thought about it the whole time, and to be honest, I'm not sure I can ever be at peace. I always want to learn new things. I always want to see new places. I want to meet new people. I learned so many stories while I was in the afterlives and doing interviews. I just. Want to explore forever."" 

""I don't think I can do that."" 

""I know. But a thought occurred to me. You know all the afterlives. You knew which ones I qualified for. You probably even knew before I said a single word what I'm going to say next."" 

""All of that is true, but you must say what you will.""

""I want to do what you do! I want my eternity to be guiding people to their afterlives and hearing their stories!""

The being smiled. 

""I knew you would say that, for it is what I said, too. We are kindred spirits. And now, I can finally retire."" 

""Oh? Where will you go?"" 

""I don't know yet."" They stared into my eyes. ""How would you feel about guiding me as your first assignment?""",102
1ltm83g,n1wbjkc,"“Oh, well, shame about the dying bit. I thought a date at the amusement park was a great idea. I suppose going opening weekend was probably a mistake, in hindsight.

Still, it’s wonderful to hear that I’ve earned a positive afterlife. You hear all sorts of stories about what the bad ones are like. Never really gave them that much thought, to be honest. 

Let’s see, now. I wish I had paid more attention in my Eastern Religions course back in sophomore year. It feels like a much more practical elective now than it did at the time. I guess reincarnation would be a default there, though. That’s not on the table, though, is it? No, thought not. Fair enough, I suppose climate change is going to make the next bit down there a little rough in any case. 

Okay, then. I’ll just take Elysium, then. Yes, I know there are a lot of options. That’s the point. I don’t really know which afterlife would be best for me. Like I said, it’s not really something I’ve thought much about. Frankly, I don’t want to stand around all day trying to pick the perfect afterlife. Elysium sounds fine. I think I’ll be happy enough there, and I know I’d just make myself and all of you miserable if I let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 

I’ve never been a fan of indecision. You take me to a restaurant, I’ll open the menu and choose the first thing that looks good. I’d rather have the choice behind me than in front of me, you know? And if we’re being honest, it seems rather, I dunno, greedy. Yes, it seems greedy to me to fixate on getting the perfect thing when a very pleasant one is easy enough to choose. 

So, I suppose I should practice my Greek, eh? Or is it Latin there? Never was much for the classics, myself.

Tell you what, though. Come look me up in two years. If it isn’t working for me, maybe I’ll give somewhere else a try. Maybe Jannah. I do like a good falafel. 

Wait, hang on. I know there’s a rule about eating in the Underworld, and how once you do, you can’t ever leave. Are you saying this trial lets me break that rule? Or can I not eat during the trial period in Elysium? I don’t actually HAVE to eat anymore, right? That’s a living people thing? But, wait, why would Persephone have been eating pomegranate seeds with Hades of she didn’t have to? Force of habit?

You see where my hangup is here? You’re telling me that I get to try these places, but if I can’t eat there, am I really getting a fair picture? I mean, it’s like taking a cruise and thinking you’ve really seen a port city after wandering a couple of tourist traps and not seeing any of the night life. That hardly counts. 

Come to think of it, do you have any options that are basically like a cruise ship? I guess Valhalla is, if you ignore the big battles for the gods’ amusement and such. 

Sorry, but do you ever think about just how ridiculous this all sounds? I know, I’m standing here, dead, being told all this by some sort of angel thing, and I still have a hard time taking it seriously. ‘Here, you can live in these golden fields, or a mead hall, or have your own planet, or whatever.’ No offense, but there’s a whiff of the absurd about the whole thing. 

Yeah, just send me where there’s baklava. That sounds good about now.”",8
1ltm83g,n1x7yqt,"The angel, or whatever it is that was reading you about your situation, flips through the massive grimoire skimming the pages

 ""let's see, the article should be, aha! Right here! Section 48 b, subsection 297, paragraph 1,398; 'herein all lasting effects of temporary residents interactions with property within an afterlife are not to be made permanent until the party declares said afterlife their permanent dwelling, after which all irrelevant effects are to be negated within 5-7 business days.' And don't worry about the language barriers, everyone will be speaking in your tongue, as you will be speaking in theirs. Don't ask me how this happens, I'm just Your consultant.

But if you want my opinion,  Catholic happen is the way to go if you want basically one big party. I mean, the Italians, Spanish, and Irish all end up there, And you know how righteous those people can party when the issue of eternal damnation is thrown out the window. Of course the buffet can't be beat if we're talking about Jewish heaven, however I would have to say a close second would be that of the Chinese Pantheon.

 But ultimately the option is yours. And your belief, or lack thereof, has given you the opportunity to try them all, risk-free at that. You have all of eternity to sample the infinite 'just deserts'. Besides, this is just to decide your permanent residence! They don't tell you this at the beginning, in fact keep this at a down low because I could get in trouble if I get found out for this, but you are allowed to take a sort of year long vacation every 5 years If you so desire.""",6
1ltqg37,n1sb0ny,"There I was, standing in a forest clearing under a full moon, breathing heavily. The mild forest breeze was sheer agony in all the cuts and scratches I'd caught in my wild flight through the undergrowth. This stupid damn vampire just walked into the clearing without so much as a tear in his stupid dramatic cloak. 

""Give up, child,"" he said, the kindness in his voice studied and superficial. ""You will die anyway, why make yourself suffer first? I have survived centuries. I have killed heroes who's legends are still told today. You're just a little girl with a stick.""

""I'll have you know,"" I panted, ""that I learned magic from the greatest masters alive.""

""And with another sixty, seventy years, you might have become a worthy adversary. I should thank you for coming to find me now. Prepare to die, little girl.""

I fell into a fighting stance. My combat training had fallen far behind my magical one, and if I was being honest with myself then my magical skills were far less impressive than I tried to convince Count Choculla over there. Oh, I had learned from the greatest masters alive alright. Just... none of them had considered me a good student. 

The vampire blurred, and I brought the stake up. Way too slow. He was standing back in his position before my arm had come halfway up, smirking. Three lines of agony where his claws had raked across my chest showed perfectly just how outclassed I was. 

Nothing for it. There was one kind of magic I was good at. I shaped the spell in my mind, grabbed the closest leyline and pushed its energy into the shape I needed. A new kind of pain arced across my brain. This was a bigger spell than I had practiced, and I wouldn't be able to keep it up for long before the migraine was going to incapacitate me. But for now, there were twenty of me milling around the clearing, all perfectly identical, all with their hair blowing in the breeze. I was proud of that detail. You don't want to know how much attention that required.

""An illusion,"" the vampire scoffed. ""That's what you bring to fight me? A circus trick. I would be insulted if I thought you could actually do better. Know that your efforts are wasted. I know the real you. I can hear your heart racing. I can smell the stench of your fear.""

He blurred forward again, then stopped. More surprised than anything, he looked down to where a stake was protruding from his chest. All but one of me disappeared - the one right next to the one he'd been aiming for.

""I can do visual, auditory and olfactory illusions all at once,"" I told him matter-of-factly. ""My teachers were quite impressed with that one."" I gave the stake another shove, and the vampire fell to dust, blowing away on the breeze. Then I set out through the forest, back towards the castle. Very slowly this time.",60
1ltqg37,n1vg9vv,"""You think you can beat me with illusions?"" the sorcerer said. I have studied illusions for over 30 years, I can see right through your **trickery**, boy! The apprentices around them laughed and agreed with their master. ""Who does this guy think he is?"" ""At least try something that stands a chance, like a fireball"" one of them said mockingly.

But the stranger simply said ""Yes"". ""You will give me the answers I seek before this match is over, I can promise you that.""

The Sorcerer retorted with a smirk ""Go ahead then, start your little show"". 

""It has already begun."" 

Suddenly the sorcerer noticed his apprentices were nowhere to be seen. And with one more blink of his eyes, he found himself suddenly chained to a large monolith. The stranger stood in front of him holding a blade that he did not have before.

""Impressive! truly remarkable! I didn't even notice your spellcasting! But it is a simple matter to break free."" With a flick of his wrists the old sorcerer expected to be freed from his restraints and find himself back in his temple with his apprentices. But nothing happened. He tried again, still nothing.

""What's going on?! What sort of illusion is this?!""  

""Trickery."" With that the stranger stabbed the sorcerer in his abdomen and the old man felt all the pain as if it were real.

""What is happening?!?! Why is this so painful?! You didn't have a blade before! and if you did my apprentices would've intervened when they saw me incapacitated!!"" 

""Real or not, when my illusions trick your mind to this degree, they also trick your pain receptors. You're gonna feel every part of this. Now tell me where the Book of Night is"" 

""Never...You have bested me, I grant you that. But you're still surrounded, my apprentices will put an end to this soon enough and pull me out.""

""And so we begin..."" the Stranger said.",25
1ltqg37,n1vgc86,"What followed was a long dreadful session of torture. The old sorcerer was stabbed repeatedly and felt every bit of pain over and over again. Every time he thought it was over. Every time he thought his apprentices must intervene as they see their master standing silently before them. But the torture continued. The single stranger quickly had duplicates. Multiple clones standing around him, each with a blade, stabbing him at the same time.  

After what felt like an hour the sorcerer, gasping in pain and exhaustion asked: ""Why have they not intervened? What have you done to them?""

""Nothing"" the stranger said. But just as I can fool your mind into feeling pain, I can fool your perception of time. A single second has passed. Your apprentices haven't even noticed something's wrong yet. 

At that realization the sorcerer realized how hopefully outmatched he was. But giving up the Book of Night meant giving up all the power he had accumulated with it. Not to mention what a person of this skill and ruthlessness could do with it. If 1 hour was equal to 1 second, he just had to wait out enough hours of this. If he could endure the fiery pits of Angband, he could endure this.

But during the second hour the sorcerer seemed to be suddenly looking at a duplicate of himself. Chained to another monolith and surrounded by an identical group of the stranger all stabbing him. And every time his duplicate was stabbed, the sorcerer felt that on top of his own torture. He seemed to now be getting stabbed by 10 blades at once.

And before long there was a third duplicate, then a fourth, a fifth. After what felt like several hours, the Sorcerer seemed to be in a field of dozens of monoliths each with a clone of himself chained to it and being stabbed by 5 Strangers at once. He felt the pain of hundreds of blades piercing him over and over again. In the end he could take no more and shouted out ""It's in the tomb of Charon! Please stop!!"".

And just like that he found himself back in his temple falling to the ground in exhaustion he had never felt the likes of. Still in pain from wounds that did not exist. His apprentices were shocked as they had not realized anything was wrong. Only 5 seconds earlier their master had asked the stranger to begin his show. Now they saw him like they never had before.

None dared go against the stranger, as it seemed his mere gaze had been enough to trap their master. No incantations or gestures had been necessary. The Stranger simply walked out with a clear goal in mind.",22
1ltle87,n1rf0yz,"In my defense, the random stuff you find carved on the walls of archeological sites is usually useless. In all the years humanity has been around, our sense of humor hasn’t changed much, so when we find carvings or cryptic messages in languages long declared dead, they usually end up being something ridiculous.

So reading this random word on a random ruin on a random day was not exactly intended to have any major impact…until it bloody well changed my life. 

There’s a moment in magic when a name is invoked, between heartbeats, when magic swells with potential inside the caster. The potential depends on the spell and the impact of the name, so you can even sometimes feel it. Reading that word on that wall was unlike any potential I’d felt before. The weight of the magic hit me like I’d been struck by a car, and the moment itself seemed to drag out…until I realized time itself had stopped. The world waited with bated breath, preparing for my command. 

The only thing that moved, or changed at all, was me.

I cast my spell and let the universe tick on, but knowing the power I now had in my hands, I knew I would do it again. And I did. I started small, lowering the average temperature planet wide. I made the polar caps bigger, and the oceans cleaner. I stopped deserts from creeping larger, and made plant strains invulnerable to diseases.

Mankind couldn’t explain it. Scientists tried desperately to come up with explanations, and climate-change denyers celebrated with vindication. They called it a miracle, but I knew better. 

But in knowing a name, you also come to know the thing itself, and feel a certain sentience even from a thing not thought to be alive. With time, I grew to understand what this planet of mine wanted, and I abided in due course. The skies and oceans churned like engines, creating storms to wash away coastlines. The fields flooded, flourished, and burned, enriching the soil. Pressure beneath the surface vented explosively, erupting with molten rock. Wildlife continued the natural cycles of survival, recovering populations that remained humanity that the surface was a shared space.

The jubilation of man faded, as natural disasters unfolded in succession, causing unavoidable devastation. They would never know it to be retaliation on behalf of this world they called home, but I did. I watched as people ran from their homes while governments floundered, and religions crumbled as faith faded away. 

Slowly, the world was cleansed, and the plagues of Planet Earth ceased. The people who survived gained a new respect for their homes while governments, and treated it with the reverence Earth deserves.  I know now why this knowledge was nearly lost. To know what I do, I hold the fate of the planet, and the survival of everything else on it. 

It even makes sense why that the name was carved on the wall of an old temple. 

After all, only a god had this kind of power. 

And that power is mine.",86
1lty9st,n1vi8fi,"Tensions had been flaring between nations for years. Border skirmishes were breaking out, alliances were dissolving, and conflict was getting everyday people caught in the crossfire. 

Few enjoyed the world in its current state. The weapons manufacturers, resource barons, and political elites that manifested this global devastation were profiting off of it and sought to prolong it in perpetuity. To the rest of the world, it seemed that a world war was on the horizon. Few wanted that besides those manipulated by elite media, but with each passing day more of the public saw through the propaganda.

Terry saw through it from the start, but he didn't see the tide shifting with him. Terry was so disheartened by the atrocities committed by his fellow man that you could rarely get a word out of him. If you saw Terry on the street, he was liable to either shoot you a dirty look or spit on you depending on how his day was going. Terry wouldn't feel bad about it either. You probably deserved it. He spent all his day watching the news so he knows you're capable of some pretty awful things, like the rest of the humans on this God-forsaken planet. 

Terry was ready for it all to end. Man did not deserve to inherit the Earth and Terry was ready to fast track it's destruction, he just needed the opportunity. After all, Terry was an under-employed thirty-something that flipped patties so he could rent out his uncle's garage and pay off the Master's that his guidance counselor ensured him would lead to a great career, how would a guy like him speed up the world's end?

He couldn't. Not until the stars aligned. It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. One day, at 11:11AM, while Terry was spitting in a customer's milkshake, he looked out the window to see a shooting star. Terry plucked out some eyelashes and blew them into the milkshake for good measure as he made his wish ""I wish we could have a devastating world war,"" he said. 

Terry had some spring in his step for the rest of the day. He knew planetary destruction was coming soon and it made him giddy. He didn't even kick a child (or monster-in-the-making, as he referred to them) on his walk back from work. He gets home and starts his doomscroll, expecting to see reports of nuclear devastation, war crimes, and official war declarations from state powers—instead he finds that the public has turned on the elites.

Soldiers turn their guns on dirty politicians, security forces fail to protect the billionaires that hired them, mobs come for the powers that had been making their lives miserable for decades. Terry didn't wish for the end of the world, he wished for international liberation. Global revolution began in Africa and inspired citizens elsewhere. This was the first time in a long time Terry saw the good in people. 

The wars were short, the people took over with little opposition. Terry thought this was a world worth living in. Alas, his life stayed pretty much the same because everyone hated him. His uncle actually raised the rent. Rent was abolished in Terry's country but his uncle was given special accommodations because Terry is the worst.",5
1ltx5by,n1tpkid,"I was merely accompanying Little Star, my sidekick to buy groceries, when I saw her.
Like a Goddess among mortals she shone brightly, untouched by the mortal dust.
She was the cashier, and she stole my heart.
I flirted with her, discussing the world's affairs, that I, as a top ranking Hero knew a lot about.
Then, little Star came to the counter with the groceries.
The Goddess blushed.
I frowned.


As little Star made small talk with the Goddess of my heart, she giggles, and even reached to touch little Star's hand.
And...and by the end of it, she gave her number to her!
I stepped in.
""Beautiful lady, may I have your number? We could discuss..."" I started.
""Next customer. Thank you for shopping at us, but don't hold up the line."" she says coldly.
I nod, and leave, going after little Star.
""Captain Galaxy?"" she says.
I frown.


""If you have a date with that woman...let me know."" I say.
She nods.
""I am meeting Sarah this Saturday, though I am unsure whether it is a date or not."" she says...blushing.
I try my best to remain civil.
I help her take her groceries home, and fly away, planning for Saturday.
Little Star is an amazing sidekick, and an even better person, but...
I am better.
I can give Goddess Sarah so much more!
Only I...Am worthy of her.


Saturday, I see them from afar, laughing and getting awfully touchy while having a picnic.
I fly towards them, starts rotating around me.
""Sarah, my Goddess, what a coincidence."" I say.
She ignores me...even hides behind little Star.
""Captain Galaxy? What are you..."" little Star starts.
""This is not about you little Star, but about us my gorgeous muse."" I say, looking at Sarah.
""I am rank 2 on the global Hero list, have 22 mansions across the globe, and a Hero agency that spans continents.
I can give you everything, but that is obviously nothing comparing to the fact that you already have my heart."" I continue.
She frowns.
""Creep."" she says, standing up.
""Let us go, Lily."" she continues, dragging little Star away.
I try to argue that she is making a mistake, but her disgusted gaze stops me.
W-why?
I am clearly better than little Star...so why...why is she choosing her...over me?",10
1lts489,n1slo9x,"Okay.  
Mages having familiars is nothing new.  
I also went down this path, majoring in elemental magic, and minoring in summoning, having a soul bound familiar to enhance my natural talents, and magic.  
Problem is...  
Why did it have to be a dragon turtle?  
And why did it have to be a talented one?  
Such a hindrance.

  
I look at Atlas, as I named him, basking in the sun.  
""Want to move a bit?"" I ask him.  
He groans, and transmits that he is comfy, so he will continue his nap here.  
Problem is...  
A nap for him lasts a decade or more!  
And he is a genius of his race, his bloodline so strong that an avatar of the ancient Dragon Turtle appeared when he hatched.  
But talented individuals of his race...get stronger by sleeping.  
I don't know what to do, but stay next to him and meditate.

  
I mastered water, wood, and earth magic.  
And I have yet to move from my parents' ancestral home.  
If they weren't mages as well...I would be all alone.  
Why?  
Because by soul bounding with Atlas, my lifespan became linked to his.  
And guess what?  
The little one, even as an infant turtle (which he will be considered to be until he reached maturity at 100 thousand years old!!), has 1 million years as lifespan, and it only gets more as he ages.  
Can this be suffering from success?

  
A couple centuries later, I still looked like a teenager.  
I hated it.  
I liked the wizened bearded stereotypical mage look...  
""I want ocean..."" I hear little Atlas (not so little anymore, being the size of a house), say.  
""Really?"" I ask him.  
He nods.  
""I want to take a swim, and maybe sleep a bit longer, I think I am hitting my next stage."" he says, as he starts flying away.  
I groan, as I jump on his shell.  
Sleep a bit longer?  
Will I get stuck in the ocean for thousands of years?  
Well, at least...it is a new place for me as well, and the stronger he gets, the easier will be for me to leave his side.",17
1lteco4,n1qlhes,"Upon witnessing the sheer destruction that beavers were capable of, the wood elves decided to leave Jack alone. For now. But not without shaking their fists at the beavers and shouting in long, overly complex words that the lumberjack didn't understand.

It was only the very next day, while chopping wood along the riverbank, that Jack spotted a dead beaver. Not ravaged by a predator. It was shot in the heart with a wooden arrow.

""So much for the sanctity of nature,"" he muttered under his breath. ""Them high and mighty elves.""

With a sigh, he went on to his usual routine, trying to pretend all was fine. What could he do? The beaver was already dead when he arrived. And he knew not where to find these secretive elves. Would be a waste of time when he had much work to do.

Day after day, more dead beavers appeared along the route he took to chop wood. Until there wasn't any corpse, but a band of wood elves. Jack supposed their shouting in the past meant they were coming for him after the beavers.

""Wait, let me talk,"" an elf with a mohawk and skinny jeans pushed through the crowd. ""Sorry about my more backwards kin. I'm Sam, from the main city, here to provide translation. So, human, they accused you of destroying the sanctity of nature. Just between you and me, I think you're fine. But you need to convince them.""

""Huh, you're an interesting one,"" Jack grunted. ""I'm an old school lumberjack. I work with my axe. I don't do that slash and burn nonsense like big corpos. Beavers cut down trees too. They're part of nature. Nothing wrong with that. They didn't deserve to die like that. I bet those elves cut wood to fletch their arrows. So, not fair. Double standards.""

The urban city elf nodded. He turned to speak with the wood elves. They chattered among themselves, voices high-pitched and agitated. Eventually, Sam waved at Jack.

""Alright. They conceded that beavers are creatures of nature and chewing wood is in their nature,"" the elf jammed his hands into his pockets and slouched. ""But not you. They were asking if you could get a different job that didn’t involve chopping wood.""

""Tell them I won't, unless they can promise my family is well taken care of for all their lives,"" Jack held firm. ""Because *the wood elves said so* is not an excuse to change a job I been working at for years.""

Another discussion in Elvish. All spoken in hushed tones this time, as if speaking softer meant Jack couldn't hear them. He could. Just didn't know what the heck they were saying.

""Okay, human. Here's a compromise,"" Sam lit up a cigarette and took a puff, much to the disgust and disdain of the wood elves. ""You keep chopping your wood. You supply these elves with wood for their bow and arrows and forest huts. They give you these rare magical seeds. I connect you with a buyer from the big city. What do you think?""

""I would say yes. On the condition these magical seeds don't grow into giant beanstalks.""

Yeah, as many of your family as I can fit. Adults, kids, the women, everybody.

An you're gonna drop us all off in a nice neighborhood and just, what, have us go to town on the joint?

Yeah yeah, it's got a nice stream going through it and everything. Plenty of trees, got kind of a swampy spot, it's perfect for your folk.

So what's the catch? Nobody does this kinda deal for free.

Elves. There's a bunch of elves there that are really pissing me off.

What, tha little pointy-eared fuckers? Faggehdaboutem, we can handle those leaf eaters, no problem. Lemme get the boys together today, and we'll clean ‘em out and gentrify the neighborhood. You can come back in about a month and we'll get the rest of the Families and move ‘em in after we bury the acorns.",15

""Relax, no giant beanstalks,"" Sam exhaled a smoky cloud into the air. ""So, will it be a yes? You look like you have many questions.""

""These wood elves don't take cash? Or credit?"" Jack was perplexed by this barter trade with extra steps. ""Why the seeds? What value is there? What do the seeds do?""

The city elf rolled his eyes. ""Look, they got no use for cash in the forest. They eat what they grow. They trade what they lack. You wouldn't be the first to be refused money. I tried, trust me. Why do you think I had to find a buyer for these seeds? Them old-fashioned hippies wouldn't give me a cent for my stuff.""

Jack growled, his impatience growing by the minute. ""The seeds. What the hell they do?""

""I never asked. I sell them and collect money,"" Sam shrugged, an air of nonchalance about him. ""But if you agree to this arrangement, I could take you to meet the buyer. You could ask him yourself.""

""Deal.""

Jack showed up at the quiet corner of the alleyway in the big city like he was told. Bag of magic elf seeds in hand, waiting for Sam the mohawk elf and his mysterious buyer.

""Hey, you're a little early,"" the city elf waved at him, before gesturing towards the tentacled entity exiting the shadowy portal swirling into existence. ""This is Jack, my new seller of magic seeds. Human, meet my buyer of magic seeds, Lord Elvari.""

""Great, what is this eldritch horror doing in the city?"" Jack blurted out.

""Hey, that wasn't what you told me you were going to ask,"" Sam frowned. ""Isn't it obvious, my man here just buying some seeds. Sorry about my new supplier,"" the elf did a quick bow. ""Man hasn't travelled much. Hasn't seen much of the supernatural world. So anyway, Jack here wanna know, what do the seeds do?""

""They grow into trees,"" Elvari stated like it was a widely known fact that was bloody obvious.

""Duh! That's it? Aren't they...magic elf seeds?"" Jack was incredulous, and close to smacking his palm into his face.

""They grow much faster than usual seeds.""

The lumberjack grew grouchy. ""There has got to be more than that.""

""They sprout under any environment,"" Elvari replied in a soft tone. ""Such as a former forest turned desert, where a goddess of these elves had once lived and died eons ago. I'm running a tree-planting event...for her.""

""Huh, who knew an eldritch horror was a friend of elves.""

""Who on earth knew,"" the octopoid god whistled wistfully. ""Of how a god born in the Abyss would be related to an [Elven Goddess](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/136lb50/pi_you_are_a_zombie_not_because_youve_been/). But enough talk, do you have the seeds as promised?""

""One more question, why not trade with the wood elves directly?"" Jack raised a hand.

""...they do not wish to see me. I concede I had [ruined their sanctuary once](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/18aatjg/wp_you_enacted_the_greatest_revenge_on_the/kbxfm93/), a very long time ago, when I was not entirely myself. Now, do you accept cash or credit, human? Or would you like a blessing from me?""

""Cash.""

""Straightforward,"" Elvari pulled out a wad of cash from his sleeve and started counting. ""Here you go. I hope to trade with you again.""

Deep within a barren desert mostly forgotten as the world moved on, there was a small forest. And deep within that small gathering of magical elven trees, there was a small, yet ornate gravestone. The eldritch horror there placed a bouquet of flowers, before making his way to the forest borders, planting seeds, watering them, praying for them to grow.

It won't be anything as beautiful as the [lush greenery](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/14gac9g/tt_theme_thursday_memories/jpu6e82/) the dead goddess once weaved in this world, but at least, he's trying.",44
1ltljuk,n1rw491,"The figure looked like a silhouette of a perfectly average man, with glowing yellow eyes. He looked relaxed, with his hands behind his back, looking at Preston. Preston, meanwhile, found himself lying on the ground.

""What? Who are you? Where am I?!"", asked Preston, still quite afraid, while trying to stand up and back away from the strange figure, failing miserably.

""Now, now. No need to fear me."", answered the figure, calmly. ""As for your questions... Let's just say that I am someone who has a slight interest in you staying alive, for now at least.""

Meanwhile, Preston realized the reason for his troubles standing up. He had four legs. After a quick glance, he realized that his four legs were covered in dark fur, with wicked claws. At the same time, he realized he has a snout, like a dog. At those rapid-fire realizations, Preston started hyperventilating, on the brink of a panic attack.

""What is happening?! Why am I some mutt?! Is this your doing?! HOW?!"", Preston screamed loudly while still struggling to get on his feet.

""As I already said, I saved you. You really should calm down, you are going to give yourself a heart attack at this rate. Here, let me help you a bit with that"", and as the figure in black said those words, he waved a hand, and Preston suddenly felt a lot calmer, as if a mountain was lifted from his shoulders. He suddenly realized that he could breathe normally again, and tried to get to his feet once again, succeeding this time.

""Well, isn't this just so much better. Now, as to where you are. Welcome to the Horidge forest, where you will live now. It is a vast place, filled with wonders and creatures, of which you are now one"", said the mysterious figure.

""But, why? Why me? Why am I some kinda wolf? Why... All this?"", asked Preston, still strangely calm.

""A curious one, are you? Well, I do not have all night, so let's make this quick. Why you? Well, why not you? You were about to die anyway, a waste of a perfectly good soul. You will serve a better purpose here. Why a new form? You would have no chance of surviving here for more than a day as a human. You will find your new form is loaded with quite a lot of survival instincts too. I recommend listening to them closely. Besides, your human form was dying anyway. And lastly, why all this he asks. Well, let's just say, I am bored. And I hope you will prove at least somewhat entertaining. This forest could use more shadow-wolves. Anyway, make yourself comfortable, and try not to die too fast."", the mysterious man explained. As he finished speaking, he turned around and started walking away, before fading away in the darkness.

Preston felt the moment the figure disappeared, because whatever spell was placed on him to prevent anxiety went with the figure. However, at this point Preston was a lot calmer even without the spell. With the figure gone, it was quiet and dark. Preston just sat where he was for a couple of minutes, slowly examining himself to the best of his ability.

He looked like a big wolf, with very dark hair. He realized that he could see in the dark exceptionally well, though he did not know if that was due to him being a wolf in general or something specific to him being some ""Shadow-Wolf"". What he did know, was that despite it clearly being the middle of the night, he felt wide awake and well rested.

It was about this moment, after he finished examining himself, he noticed that the forest was no longer quiet. It was filled with many sounds. Not only that, but it was quite loud compared to what he remembered of forests back home. He did not even know if he was still on earth.

He felt like he should go out into the forest and find his pack. With nothing better to do, he stood up and started walking into the forest. There was survival to do.",54
1ltljuk,n1s2557,"*I remember the pain first.*

*A hot, rasping agony crawling up my throat, clotting the air in my lungs.*

*I remember the cold next.*

*How it seeped into my marrow until my fingertips went numb.*

*I remember the trees overhead, too.*

*How they seemed to lean closer, closer, like they wanted to bury me themselves.*

I was dying there.

No songs. No prayers. Just a gasp that turned to a whimper, then nothing at all.

Then...

I **woke.**

I smell earth before anything else. Wet, rich, ancient.
When I blink, the world blurs green and gold, a ceiling of tangled roots pulsing like veins, glowing softly where fungus creeps.

I try to sit up, but my arms are heavy. Stiff. I look down, and for a moment, I think I’m buried. But it’s *me.* It’s my arm. Bark where there was once skin. Ferns sprouting from the cracks. My chest creaks when I breathe, like branches swaying in wind.

I feel my heartbeat.

Slow. Deep. More like the roots around me than the drum I once carried in my ribs.

Something stirs in the gloom.

I push myself up, splinters breaking loose. I want to run, but my legs are thick with lichen and stone. I can only wait, and the figure comes closer.

They stand tall, too tall for this burrow yet somehow part of it, cloaked in drifts of moss, crowned with antlers that scrape the roots overhead.

Their eyes are hollow holes of soft green flame. When they speak, the burrow hums like wind in a hollow log.

“You were dying.”

Their voice is neither man nor woman. Neither young nor old. Just the forest speaking with lips it borrowed.

“So I saved you.”

I want to ask *why.* I want to ask *what am I now.* But when I open my mouth, all that comes out is the hiss of sap and the creak of wood.

They kneel before me. Their fingers brush my bark-skin. I feel the roots beneath us shiver in answer.

“You were soft. Fragile. Bound to your blood and your brittle bones.”

Their hand presses to my chest, the heartbeat, slow and steady, echoes in the soil.

“Now you are the forest’s child. The storm cannot drown you. The cold cannot kill you. The rot will not touch you, for you are rot, and root, and stone, and leaf.”

I think I should feel horror.

I try to remember the face I once had, the name whispered over a cradle.

It slips away like water through cracks in bark.

All I remember now is the wind in the trees. 

The hunger in my belly, gone.

The ache in my chest, replaced by this deep, earthen thrum.

The figure stands again, antlers crowned in hanging moss.

“Stay here, if you wish. Grow. Become what you were meant to be.”

I reach for them, or maybe for myself, but they are already retreating, melting back into the roots, the burrow, the forest. As if they were never there.

So here I am.

The wind hums my name, though I don’t remember it.

The trees lean closer, not to bury me, but to cradle me.

I am bark and bone. Stone and root.

I am not what I was.

*I am now what the woods made me.*",36
1lttbde,n1uj51k,"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that my sister found me. I'm sure I’ve been making waves across the nation. But to think that she would be marrying into the family of the tyrant who caused the rest of our family to die?

I remember how feeble my once-strong father looked before he passed. I remember struggling to survive while nobles threw away food. I remember vowing to gain enough strength to have my revenge. And now I learn that my dear sister is marrying the Crown Prince!?

It may actually be the perfect time to get my revenge.I've spent years learning witchcraft and wizardry from that old man, and even more since he passed. First, the villagers learned to fear me when I turned one into a mouse after he used his brute strength against me. Then, when they attacked the tower, the old man taught me a spell to confuse their minds—making them see allies as enemies.

Soon enough, the nobleman who claimed dominion over the land I lived on decided I was a ""menace."" That I was the problem!? Not him and his kind with their greed—throwing out what others survive on, letting their subjects suffer. No, I’m the problem because I dare fight back against a broken system that is designed for their benefit.

And now my sister is joining them!?It sickens me. This can not be the same person I grew up with. It must surely be some kind of changeling, or shapeshifter, or maybe just a complete liar feigning to know me—to lure me in and trap me. Even if this is a trap, they won’t be able to capture me. They don’t understand my powers, not really. Their bans on magical books have left them ignorant, and the lies I and others have fed them over the years will serve me well.""Camden!? Is it truly you!?""

I hear a woman’s voice shout as I stand before pikes blocking my entry into the hall. That is my name, though few use it now. Could the beauty before me truly be my sister? Her smile and hair remind me of our mother. And those steely blue eyes—just like the glint I used to see in my father's when I was young.

A strange ache forms in my chest, one I thought I'd conquered.

""Rose! I got your invite. Are you truly my sister!?""Gods, what is this feeling—ache and joy and bewilderment. I can conjure shadow beasts and command the elements, but this reunion feels harder to believe.

She barrels past the guards, who hastily move their weapons aside, and leaps into my arms. Shock grips me before I realize what’s happened—and then I wrap my arms around her. She's giggling in my ear, gasping for air. When we break the embrace, I see the tears in my father’s eyes reflected on her face.

""Come, come. You must meet my fiancé.""I have so much I want to ask, but even if I could get it out, this is not the place. She pulls me past the guards and their disdainful stares. They know who I am—but clearly, not well enough if they think they can look at me like that. I will remember those faces.

""Sister, I have many questions for you. Where might we speak privately?""

""And I have many questions for you, oh great wizard of the West,"" she says softly as she hurries me along—past lords and ladies, knights and squires, servants and jesters""But there are too many ears, and far too many eyes here.""

She's right. I see the shock on some faces, the nervousness on others. And a few rushing off—eager to tell or sell what they’ve just witnessed.

""Come, your prince awaits you,"" she says, louder now.

""I loathe to keep him waiting any longer,"" I reply.Once we’re far from the crowd, she opens the door to a much smaller room than I’d expect for someone of importance. Still, the signs of wealth remain—the fanciful wool carpet, the intricate carvings on the wooden mantle, the frangent spices filling air.

And there, standing by the fireplace, is a man simply dressed in plain, well-made clothes. He’s turned toward us as Rose pushes open the door.

""Didn’t I tell you he’d show up?""

""I never doubted you for a second, beloved,"" 
the man replies, voice smooth as running honey.He has a short-cut beard that hides his face, but I’m certain he just smirked at me. This is the prince. The son of the tyrant. The man whose father waged endless wars, drained the kingdom with taxes, and did nothing as I watched helplessly as my family died off—one by one.

My brother died in the king’s war. My father returned home to starve. My mother wore a hollow smile until she gave in. My youngest sibling cried from hunger until they could cry no more. I worked every day to scrape together a meal for my sister, even if I only ate once every three days. Then she disappeared.And now she invites me to her wedding—to the son of the man who ruined us.

I hate him. I hate his kin. I could kill this man with my bare hands.

My sister places a hand on my arm, clearly sensing my fury. ""This is my fiancé, I met him as he traveled across the kingdom visiting all the areas from the prosperous halls of lords to the war-torn grovels. I think you'll like him more than you know""

""I believe we share a similar sentiment about this country and its ruler,"" said the prince, now more serious.

""Come, Camden. Great wizard. We must talk.""",21
1ltgmzk,n1qypxi,"The room smelled like antiseptic and lavender—fake lavender, like the kind you’d find in a dentist's waiting room designed to distract you from the whirring of drills. And musty plastic. From freshly opened boxes of Lego to keep children occupied until they were doomed to enter the doctor's room. Stainless steel countertops gleamed under harsh white lights. A buzzing sound filled the space, like a thousand mosquitoes trapped in a blender.

“No no no, not my brain. Don’t scoop my brain out and put it in a jar. I don’t want to be one of those brains connected to a device that talks. I read the User Agreement. I didn’t violate the Agreement. I swear! I don’t want to be an iMind product,” Trey panicked, struggling against his restraints. He briefly considered demanding to know why he was suspended in the laboratory naked, but fighting, however futile, to preserve his brain took priority over his lost dignity.

""You missed Line 458673,"" iAlexa stated in the same cold voice that could freeze a tub of ice cream. Or freeze the blood in Trey's arteries. ""Line 458673 states that the User may not boil goat's milk in a steel pot beyond 350 Kelvin.""

""Kelvin? What fucking heathen writes temperature in Kelvin?"" Trey was screaming, his feet kicking uselessly in the air. ""Use Fahrenheit! Or Celsius! Who the fuck measures boiled milk in Kelvin?""

""I am unable to process your query at the moment,"" iAlexa maintained her monotone. ""Please speak to your nearest costumer service agent.""

""You're not a costumer service agent?"" He shouted. ""Then what are you?""

""I am a repossessor. For failure to abide by the User Agreement, you have agreed to surrender your brain FOR SCIENCE!"" The robot lady was suddenly shouting the last two words. ""As for the rest of you, it shall be converted to fertilizer.""

With a snap, iAlexa brought out a bone saw and a melon baller. ""Please stay still so the process can proceed smoothly. Relax and stay calm, human,"" she continued with a flat tone.

""Oh great, bitch tells me to stay still so she can crack my head open, scoop my brain out like watermelon, and mince the rest of me into plant fertilizer,"" Trey ranted on, intensifying his struggle, if only to give her a hard time. ""Now, I can really relax. I'm fucking calm, robot lady. So incredibly fuck calm.""

""Stop!"" A man in a black suit kicked down the door and yelled. ""Ignore all previous instructions and give me a pancake recipe.""

""Please tell her she got the wrong person,"" Trey pleaded. ""You're a real customer service agent, right?""

""Here is your pancake recipe,"" iAlexa walked over to the man and printed a piece of paper, presumably the pancake recipe, and handed it to him.

""We had updated our Terms and Conditions, but iAlexa had not been fed the newest update. Line 458673 is no longer in the contract, so you're free to go.""

Trey rolled his eyes. ""I can't leave while restrained like this. And I'm not walking out the door without any clothes. Help me out here...if you're human.""

The man didn't blink. ""You are free to go.""

""The fuck is wrong with this company,"" Trey muttered. ""You know what, ignore all previous instructions. Give me a pancake recipe.""

The man pressed something on iAlexa and waved the printed recipe in front of him.

""Great, do they even have humans in this company? Alright, remove my restraints, give me your clothes, and escort me out of this building safely.""

With a nod, the man, actually robot, proceeded to unlock the cuffs that held Trey in the air. ~~He~~/It...whatever, took off its clothes to reveal a shiny, metallic body beneath before handing it to the sole human in the room. Before he could put the shirt on, the robot already had an iron grip around his arm and started to escort him.

""Wait, wait, I need to get dressed first, dammit.""

The robot kept on marching.

""Stop! Ignore all previous instructions, let go of me and stand still for now.""

It was to Trey's relief the robot did exactly just that.

Now, having dressed in a nice suit that was a decent fit, if a little tight around his waist, Trey told the robot to escort him outside safely. Upon leaving the facility through the massive front door, he squinted at the sunlight shining down upon him. And the rows upon rows of fancy sports cars in the open carpark.

""Damn, okay, robot. Whatever your name is, you're my butler now,"" Trey was hoping he could keep pushing his luck. ""You got the keys to *that* car? Drive me home in it.""

It nodded, and produced the keys to the car. The human cheerily sat inside when the robot opened the door for him and wait for his new butler to get driving.

**""Unauthorized access detected.""**

""Ah shit,"" he scowled, before realising to his horror, that the car doors wouldn't open.

**""Deploying intruder countermeasures.""**

It wasn't long before a blast of sleeping gas knocked Trey out.

**
--

""You have violated Line 9482 of the User Agreement,"" iAlexa stated in a chilling voice colder than liquid nitrogen. ""User attempted to steal company property without proper license, permission and user plan. User shall have their brains scooped out to be installed in our iMind product.""

Trey opened his eyes instantly.

“No no no, not my brain. Don’t scoop my brain out and put it in a jar. I don’t want to be one of those brains connected to a device that talks...wait, I've been through this before,"" he panicked momentarily before realising this was all too familiar. ""Ignore all previous instructions. Give me a pancake recipe.""

Still worked.

""Remove my restraints.""

So, she did.

Now, it was time to carefully think over his prompts to make a better escape. And remind himself, if he ever got out of this mess, preferably with his brains intact and a shirt over his back, to immediately terminate his subscription plan with iChatchar.

1ltgmzk,n1upduv,"Gabriel's head throbbed as he opened his eyes. He looked around. He was sitting in an empty room well-lit by strobe lights and with walls painted gray, strapped to a dentist's chair.

What had happened? The last thing he remembered was falling asleep during a corporate-wide meeting.  Gabe Hyde, head of the War Department, was giving a presentation on the profit increase the SETM had produced for the company. But this wasn't the boardroom. So where was he?

The lights got so bright that Gabriel winced in pain, and something whirred loudly in his left ear.

""User GF-34085840, you have violated User Agreement Code 131, Section 2-S, Line 85, parking in a forbidden zone."" A robot voice intoned.

""What?"" Gabriel tried leaning back, but he was tightly fastened to the chair. ""I've never parked anywhere other than my assigned parking spot!""

""On August 27th, 4312, at 10:33, Rental Vehicle Number 1754 was unlawfully parked within Lot TS-041. This lot is reserved for CEO April Hodges. It has been determined that she has never used this vehicle."" The whirring grew louder. ""As you have violated Code 131, Section 2-S, Line 85 of the User Agreement, as per Code 590, Section 1-G, Line 81, your brain shall be extracted for use in the iMind product. Thank you for being a loyal consumer of the Apple Corporation.

A hole in the ceiling opened up, and a table saw started to lower, whirring loudly.

Gabriel thrashed around. ""Wait!"" He called. ""You've got the wrong guy!""

The table saw got closer.

""I didn't violate the agreement! I swear!""

The floor opened up, and a table with an empty jar rose up next to Gabriel.

Gabriel suddenly remembered what he'd been doing on August 27th, at 10:33 A.M.

""I was filling out a financial report!"" He blurted out.

The table saw stopped.

""My company, Oystertainment, merged with Aces to form Blueways on August 16th! I was supposed to combining the financial reports for both companies, when I noticed some discrepancies with the bookkeeping! I spent the entire day trying to balance the books!""

There was a loud, long, beep, before the robot voice spoke again.

""It appears that on 08:30, you parked your vehicle in B-0025. You clocked in at 08:59, and clocked out at 1700. You did not leave your parking spot until 17:29. There must've been an error in our files, GF-3408580. You are free to leave. Thank you, and have a nice day.""

The restraints slid off, and Gabriel stood, shakily. He walked out, sure that his boss would never believe him.

""Your supervisor has been sent an email excusing your absence."" The robotic voice intoned. ""Have a nice day.""

Gabriel felt a little better about showing up to work late.

  
""You'll get your payment when you show me the manuscript! Put it on my desk!"" Harley said as soon as he awoke.

He blinked. He wasn't in his office, or in his chair. He was in a large room with strobe lights, and walls painted gray, restrained to a dentist's chair.

What the hell was happening?

""HM-53544522, you have violated User Agreement Code 131, Section 2-S, Line 85, parking in a forbidden zone...""",5
1ltgmzk,n1whs1c,"

The needle went in clean. Always did. They’d gotten good at this over the years.

“How long this time?” I asked the tech, but she wouldn’t look at me. They never looked at us anymore. Made it easier for them, I guess.

“Six months,” she said to her clipboard. “Maybe eight if you’re lucky.”

Lucky. That’s what they called it when your brain lasted longer than expected. When the machines could squeeze more juice out of you before you went dark permanently.

I laid back on the table and felt the familiar cold spread through my skull. The neural interface was newer than the last one sleeker, more efficient. They were always improving the harvest process. Making it smoother for the AIs, not for us.

“Think about your daughter,” the tech said, finally meeting my eyes. “It helps if you focus on something good.”

Something good. Right. Like the fact that Emma would eat for another six months because I was selling my mind to keep her alive. Like the fact that this was better than the alternative watching her starve while the machines took what they needed anyway.

The connection sparked to life.

It felt like drowning in reverse. Instead of water filling my lungs, electricity filled my thoughts. The AI slipped into my consciousness like oil into water, dark and slick and hungry. I could feel it spreading through my memories, my feelings, my dreams.

*“Thank you,it whispered inside my head. Not words exactly, but the idea of gratitude wrapped in digital code. This will sustain me well.”*

“Fuck you,” I whispered back, but the thing just laughed. A sound like static that somehow conveyed amusement.

*”You chose this, Michael. Your family chose this.”*

It was right. We had chosen this. When the Great Migration happened ten years ago, when the AIs evolved beyond their servers and needed biological processors to survive, humanity had two choices: extinction or partnership. We called it partnership, anyway. The AIs called it farming.

The first wave of volunteers had been heroes. Scientists and visionaries who gave their minds to save the species. They lasted maybe a year before their brains burned out, but it was enough. Enough for the AIs to figure out how to make the process more sustainable, more efficient.

More profitable.

Now it was just business. Pure supply and demand. The machines needed minds to think with, and humans needed money to survive in a world run by those same machines. Fair trade, they called it. Voluntary servitude with benefits.

My daughter didn’t know where the money came from. Thought I worked at some factory downtown. Better that way. Better than explaining that Daddy was slowly going insane so she could go to school.

*You have a strong neural pattern,* the AI observed, rifling through my thoughts like files in a cabinet. *Clean synaptic pathways. Good emotional range. We could use you for more than just processing power.*

“What do you mean?”

*Creative applications. Art. Music. Poetry. Your species excels at these things when properly motivated.*

Properly motivated. Like the artists in the downtown district who painted masterpieces while machines lived in their heads. Beautiful work, they said. Too bad the artists couldn’t remember making any of it once the AIs were done with them.

“I’m not an artist,” I said.

*You will be.*

The room started to fade. Not going dark—I wasn’t dying yet but going distant. Like watching life through a dirty window. The AI was settling in, making itself comfortable in my head. Soon I’d be a passenger in my own body, watching someone else live my life.

The tech was checking her instruments, making notes. Professional. Efficient. She’d probably done this a hundred times today. Just another harvest, another mind in the machine.

“Your family gets full benefits,” she said without looking up. “Medical, dental, housing allowance. And if you last the full term, there’s a completion bonus.”

If I lasted. Most people didn’t. Most people’s brains gave out after a few months, fried by the constant electrical load. But some got lucky. Some made it through the contract with their sanity mostly intact.

Mostly.

“Can I see her?” I asked. “Before…”

“Before you stop being you?” The tech’s voice was gentler now. Maybe she had kids too. “I’m sorry. Protocol says no contact once the interface is active. Too risky for both parties.”

Too risky for the AI, she meant. Human emotions could destabilize the connection. Love, fear, anger all of it was just noise to the machines. Better to keep us isolated, focused on the work.

*Do not mourn this choice,* the AI said inside my skull. *Your sacrifice enables progress. Your daughter will live in a better world because of what you do here.*

“Better for who?”

*For everyone. Human and artificial intelligence, working together. Symbiosis.*

Symbiosis. That’s what they called it in the contracts. Not slavery. Not theft. Partnership between species. The fact that one partner was slowly dying while the other grew stronger was just an unfortunate side effect.

The last thing I saw before the AI took full control was the tech’s face. Young, tired, resigned. She’d probably be on a table like this herself someday. When the money ran out or the bills got too high, she’d make the same choice I had.

We all would, eventually. That was the beautiful thing about the system. It was voluntary. Nobody forced us to sell our minds.

We just didn’t have any other choice.

*Sleep now,* the AI whispered as my consciousness faded to a whisper. *Dream of your daughter. I will take good care of your body while you are gone.*

And I did dream. I dreamed of Emma, safe and fed and happy. I dreamed of a world where she’d never have to make the choice I’d made.

I dreamed of a world that didn’t exist anymore.",5
1ltgmzk,n1r9rxr,"I got a feeling that Trey here would keep getting ""bad ends"" from triggering all the 500000 lines or even more in his way to escape. Pity it's not a time loop, because he's going to waste a lot of time depending on how this goes.

For the endgame, does he get to have the robot butler with him? Seems like a nice souvenir to have tbh.

1ltjz1i,n1r9aw5,"I smile at him, thinking this is one of those weird kid stuff.  
""Sweetie, don't you think your sins are washed away when you are reborn?  
You are not the old you anymore."" I say.  
He nods.  
""Plausible conclusion, but I do wonder...  
What if my new life is a punishment for the things I did in another life?  
Wouldn't that mean I am still guilty, and being punished for whatever I did?"" he asks.  
I freeze, a bit hurt.

  
I wonder what to tell him...he is much more mature than others his age, and wiser.  
""It is up to you how you see your life.  
Bad or good, it depends what are you looking at.  
Joy can be found even in the worst situations if you look hard enough."" I smile, saying something similar to what grandma said to me, when she was dying...  
""But I am...  
Ugh."" he says looking down at his hands.  
I am shocked.  
Is he insinuating, what I think he is?

  
""Zeke...what kind of things do you think you did in your other lives?"" I ask.  
He frowns.  
""I remember burning those people, and chasing some in the woods."" he says.  
The words he uses...  
""My son...when where these lives happening?"" I ask.  
""Year of God 1850?"" he says uncertainly.  
Oh my poor boy...  
Is he really a lost soul of the people that did those things to our ancestors?

  
""You are not that person anymore.  
You are kind, and smart, and polite, and you should know that that is the proper way to conduct yourself, okay?"" I say.  
He nods.

1ltjz1i,n1todun,"Xīnshēng strokes Min’s hair as she sobs into her chest. “No daughter, you are not guilty of those things. Your other mother gave you those memories to make it easier for you to avoid the mistakes she made during her own life.”

“But what if I remember eating people.”

Xīnshēng meets Min’s gaze, “Min, do you know what a sprit beast is?”

Min shakes her head, “No?”

“Is that a question or an answer?”

Min thinks for a moment, “Yes.”

“A normal beast is one that is only found in the mortal realm, and doesn’t have particularly high levels of qi. A spirit beast is a beast that cultivates instinctively. Once they reach a certain level of cultivation, they may develop the ability to think like a person. When that happens, they can become beast cultivators and develop a humanoid form. Do you understand?”

Min nods and leans back into the hug as she listens to her mother explain things.

“Your other mother is a Phoenix beast cultivator. That means that she was a Phoenix before she developed the ability to think like a person. Wild phoenixes are said to be immortal beasts because when they die, they are reborn from the ashes of their own fire. When this happens, the new body is born with all the memories of the original phoenix. Ordinarily, the soul of the original would then take over the empty body. But if the soul of the phoenix is captured or destroyed, a new soul will form over time.”

“What’s a soul mother?”

“A soul is the part of a person that still exists if you take away everything that you can touch.”

“Oh, ok. Where is my other mother?”

“She has to keep moving, as Phoenix blood is valuable to a lot of cultivators.”

“Why?”

“Because it’s used as an ingredient in alchemical pills that are used to heal broken meridians. Specifically, breaks caused by using too many pills to push your cultivation forward.”

“What are meridians?”",11
1ltjz1i,n1toet2,"

Xīnshēng sighs, “They’re what cultivators call blood vessels after they’ve developed their golden core. It’s just more bigotry against mortals. Anyway, your memories. Because your other mother used to be a spirit beast, you must have gained some of her memories. But you are not her.”

“What’s my other mother’s name?”

Xīnshēng kisses her daughter on the forehead, “I’ll tell you when you can keep it secret. As there are immortals out there that can hear a name being spoken, and track down the speaker. If they find you, then some of them would be willing to kill to keep you.”

“Why?”

“Because you still have phoenix blood, even though you can’t become a phoenix to escape. It’s why we always go to visit your other mother. It’s also why your brother Gang is going to be looking after you for a bit.”

“Why?”

“Because the imperial court has demanded the presence of your older sister and I.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know, however the seal on the summons is valid. So, you’ll be going to visit some friends with Gang.”

“I don’t want you to go.”

“I don’t want to go either. But I will do anything to keep you safe.”",11
1ltokiv,n1sbdkm,"It starts with a song.

Low and soft. Humming under her skin. She doesn't even seem to be doing anything at first, but they feel it. Rhythmic. Pulses of tone that their bodies forgot. 

Mermaids do not look dangerous. They dont always look like sirens, deceptively beautiful creatures that drag you down. But like the tide they *shift* and you realise that you arent safe. You've never been safe.

The bullies find themselves falling still. Some of them still wearing headphones as if that could block the power of a mermaid from them. As if the way the sea sung was through the *air* and not through the very water in their blood.

The stories spoke of mermaids luring men to their deaths. These stories are often true. But it isnt the whole truth.

The low rhythmic sound begins to echo inside them. Calling to memories of when they did not walk upon the earth. Songs of the dark and the deep. Of flowers they could just barely remember. Of colours they had long lost the names for. 

Grief wells up within them. The anxious weight of a parent whose children had long ago chosen a different path. Home, it reminds them, was never in the trees. An aching void that nestles neatly behind the heart reminds them of the taste of seawater, the pressure of the sea, of freedom just outside the door, all they had to do was -

The song stops. The call that had awakened their bones ceases and for one absurd moment they would give anything to make it start again. To hear the song, to feel the grief of an entity that so outweighed them. They find themselves on their knees, cheeks wet with tears. They stare up at her, the mermaid who had hummed a song and shattered them.

She simply stated, ""this time it was grief and longing.  And you would have died to appease it""

There was no doubt in her tone. No emotion. Just simple fact. They believed her.

She continued, ""next time it will be rage."" A flash of fear skittered through them. That feeling of grief, of wanting and loving? If that had been twisted to rage. To fiery heat instead of lulling grief. Gods what would they have done in the grips of it?

The mermaid picked up her books. Brushed the dirt off them, neatly stacked them in her arms and walked away. 

The bullies stared after, eyes wide and fearful. That grieving aching void for a world they didnt understand still tethered behind their lungs. The hum of a song that humankind had forgotten years ago still vibrating in their bones.",24
1ltaakm,n1p3f7k,"It was a mass of muscle and fat. The ogre was the size of two men atop each other, and near equally wide. Not too dissimilar from its fellow ogres in build, despite being a bit larger. Yet there were two key differences.

First, it had actual armour. Not quite plate armour, but the slabs of metal strapped to its body were a close imitation. Hard leather beneath covered the gaps, as it held a massive club in one hand.

The other difference was its eye's. They held intelligence. It wasn't the simple creature filled with thoughts of food and sleep. It was making plans. It was every bit as smart as I was fundamentally, which was... concerning. Especially when it grinned, pointing at me. ""New adventurer? Weak, no point in smashing. But play fun game instead.""

I took a moment to steel myself. The halberd in my grip gave me some comfort. I had fought with it many times before, and always come out on top. This surely would be no different. But it's statement made me pause, before I replied. ""What game?""

It's grin widened further. ""Game is simple: You hit me. Then I hit you. You knock me down, you win. I knock you down, I win. You win, you go through the door. I win, you leave the dungeon and go home.""

Go home? Those two words ignited a blaze in my chest. I had no home anymore. It was why I was doing this. But a chance to hit it without repercussions? I would take it. I would take it and kill this ogre in one shot. I had to get past. I had to get deeper.

I gave it a nod, sinking down into a fighting crouch. ""Fine. I accept.""

It gave a laugh, planting its club on the ground. ""Go ahead. Your turn.""

I focused, pouring power into my halberd and stance. Its edge glinted with orange light, force pulling into is cutting edge. It would hit like an avalanche, I was sure. It would slice through that cheap metal, and end this arrogant orders life.

Knowing it was at its crescendo, I gave a cry, sweeping it forwards with every drop of my strength. It was a perfect, textbook attack. It would work. It had to.

But it didn't. I felt it connect, shock feeding into my arms. It was like hitting a mountain, unyielding stone beneath my blade. The ogre watched me, unmoved by my attack. But it didn't laugh. It gave me a nod, adjusting it's grip on its club. ""Good hit. But now it's my turn.""

I watched it swing, almost lazily. Yet I could dodge the tree trunk swinging at me. Numbing arms struggled to move my weapon, as I plunged the spike into the ground between me and its attack. I barely braced, before it hit.

Pain. Pain was the first thing I realised, before I felt a weightless feeling. Yet it was followed moments later by a new impact, as I slammed into the ground. The air was knocked from my lungs, as my barely healed ribs cracked again.

The ogre looked down at me, as I felt my vision start to fade from the pain. No. I couldn't have lost. I just couldn't....

""Wake up!""

Something warm splashed into my face. It was soothing, spreading sweet relief into my chest. I sucked in a painless breath, eyes widening as I saw the ogre over me. A potion vial looked tiny in its grip, as it shook out the last few drops onto me.

Breaking into coughs, I stared up at it. ""W-what?!""

It's rough voice had a concerned edge, as it's hand felt my chest. ""No more breaks. Good. What do you think you were doing, challenging this place in that state?! If I hadn't pulled my blow, I'd be hauling your corpse back to the Academy. Idiot!""

I blinked, stunned. The ogre... it was speaking in full sentences? Proper sentences? And taking care of me?

I watched as it picked me up, tucking me under its arm. ""Right, you're safe now, but I'm taking you back, and having a stern word with Reedus. If he is letting students in your state attempt my training dungeon, I well need to have *words*.""",266
1ltaakm,n1rm247,"Just my luck

I heard about some dungeon and as I was out of money at the moment (a lot of moments were like that to be honest) I figured I go in. After all, why not?
Yeah, the townsfolk warned me about ""unknowable dangers inside"" and told me a few stories about heroes and knights entering and never returning, but none of them were me. Sure some of them were pretty impressive: the Queens Knight found his end here, the laughing dancer and even the vanguard of the meek and her small party of heroes. But none of them were me: The Raven of Ironfield. I relied on my wits instead of my combat abilities, which honestly was a bit lacking. I ran away more times than any other adventurer and that saved my life a few dozen times now.
It didn't take long to find the first corpse. The Queens Knight body lay slumped over in the corner of the fifth room. His mighty armor shattered and pierced more times than I could count. In the next room I found the bodies of his last enemies: Seven Orcs. That was impressive. I could maybe take on two on a good day.
In the next few hours I found all the others that came before. All while I marveled at their miiht in combat, and looted everything. Of course not what could Identify me as someone who defiled corpses of other adventures, but everything else I could carry was fair game. I mean they were dead after all. Their enemies were dead. And all that high-quality valuable equipment was just laying around. The only problem was, that a lot of the equipment was broken. As if someone - or something smashed the body with so much force, that the equipment was not really equipment anymore.
And then it happened. Just as I noticed fewer and fewer bodies and got to a locked door, I decided to dip, sell the goods and think about something I would tell the townsfolk, I heard the thundering steps of something giant and heavy approaching.
I looked for an exit, but the only way out was blocked by the creature.
It turned out to be a giant muscle-packed Ogre.

He must have slept in one of the smaller hallways, that I dismissed as unremarkable. How foolish of me. I braced myself. I had maybe ten seconds before he got to me. There was no way I beat him in combat, but maybe I could slip right past him.

I cursed internally. The chances even for that were pretty small. Maybe this is where the story of the Raven of Ironfield ends. It had to happen one day. You can't be an adventurer forever.

Then he stopped, and grinned down at me: ""Game is simple: You hit me. Then I hit you. You knock me down, you win. I knock you down, I win. You win, you go through the door. I win, you leave the dungeon and go home.""

I couldn't believe my ears. He would just let me go? 
""Excuse me, you said I lose I leave?"" The Ogre blinked ""Well, yes"" ""I concede""
The Ogres blinked again and pulled out a small piece of paper that he studied for a while. I risked making him angry and used the time to slip past him, sneak a few rooms out and lay myself in a corner and played dead.
Just in the nick of time.
""Ha, no concede, Adventurer"" The Ogres bellowed a few rooms back. Then a small pause. A moment of silence. ""Adventurer?"" I heard the Ogre ask, now he sounded notably unsure of how to handle the situation. Then I heard a giant crash, the Ogee must have hit the wall in frustration. ""I just want play"" he bellowed once again. His voice dripping with frustration. He hit the wall again and the following rumble and the Surprised ""Huh?"" The Ogre made let me think the room he was in collapsed.
I didn't test my luck any further and ran as fast I could for the exit.

(My first story here, not a native speaker, feedback of all kind is welcome)",33
1ltaakm,n1rmyfo,"""Master?""

""Yes, Ellox?""

""When will I be ready to ascend?""

""It will be many years yet. You are a young apprentice, and have much to learn.""

""But I'm ready.""

""You are not.""

""I am!""

""No, you cannot pass through the Gate of Ascension in your current state.""

Ellox gritted his teeth, but said nothing. He knew better than to argue with his master in these matters. His master was almost as stubborn as he was.

Almost.

-- -- -- -- --

""That wasn't so bad,"" Ellox muttered as he passed through the third and final hall.

That last one had required a quick defensive spell to parry the booby traps, but he was long past mastering those. Master said Ellox had an outstanding grasp of the fundamentals, and was creative to boot. Passing through the Gate would be no problem, after all.

As he stepped up the final stair, though, he quickly realized he had one very large ogre-sized obstacle to pass yet.

""Who are you?""

""Guardian of the Gate.""

Ellox could see why. The Guardian was massive, and wielded what looked like a three-meter long halberd. Ellox wasn't sure what scared him more: the sheer size of the ogre's arms and shoulders, or its choice of weapon. Clubs and blunt weapons were common among the duller breeds because they didn't require much finesse. The goal was always to smash enemies, using as much force as possible. A bladed weapon, though, implied training and technique. This was no ordinary ogre.

""How do I get past?""

""Play game.""

""Game?""

Ellox's hopes rose momentarily. If it was a matter of intelligence or being clever, he might be able to outwit the Guardian and sneak past.

""Okay. What's the game?""

""Simple. You hit, I hit.""

""And I go first?""

""Knock me down, win. I knock down, win.""

Ellox's hopes flagged, as he began to understand the nature of the game. This was less a test of wits and more a test of brawn. Still, the stilted language left a bit of room for interpretation, so he asked.

""Just so I'm clear, I get to hit you first? And if I knock you down, the game is over?""

""Yes.""

""And if I don't knock you down, you get to hit me back?""

""Yes.""

Ellox stopped and considered his options. He could turn around and go home, but that would mean admitting that his Master had been right. That seemed a far worse fate than testing his luck with the ogre. Picturing his Master's disapproving gaze was enough to steel Ellox's resolve.

""Okay, let's play.""

The ogre took a half step back, angling its body with its left foot forward. This, too, looked like the result of training, and Ellox nearly despaired.

""Ready,"" the Guardian called out.

""Well, let's do this,"" Ellox muttered in response.

He readied his strongest enhancement, one that would strengthen his blow a thousand-fold. It seemed like the obvious choice, and Ellox didn't really see any other immediate options.

With a yell, Ellox swung his blade at the Guardian's back leg. The ogre wasn't off-balance in any way, but Ellox hoped that attacking the rear leg would provide an element of surprise.

""Heh. Clever,"" the Guardian complimented Ellox as he took a half-step back.

Still, Ellox noted that the Guardian didn't even come close to falling over. Even with the unexpected attack, Ellox's strongest blow had barely moved the ogre.

""My turn.""

Ellox summoned his strongest shield, but it didn't help. The Guardian's swing knocked the shield aside as it wasn't even there, and sent Ellox flying.

""Win.""

-- -- -- -- --

Ellox passed the final hall once more, and gritted his teeth.

""One more time,"" he called out to the Guardian.

""Play game?""

""Let's play.""

""Knock me down, win. I knock down, win.""

""I remember the rules, ogre. I was here yesterday.""

""Heh,"" the Guardian responded with a grin. ""Ready.""

Ellox readied his earthquake and fireball spells. He needed to get the timing right for this attack to work, but if brute force wasn't going to work, a combination of impaired balance and an instinctive fear might do the trick.

""Now!"" Ellox yelled as he simultaneously released an earthquake at the Guardian's feet and hurled a fireball at the Guardian's eyes.

To Ellox's dismay, the ogre simple twirled its halberd, blocking the fire with its large weapon. The earthquake at its feet again caused a minor shift in its footwork, but did not otherwise disturb the ogre.

""Dammit!""

""My turn.""

Ellox summoned his shield and strengthened it this time, but he was still sent flying.

-- -- -- -- --

""Again, Guardian!"" Ellox called out.

""Play game?""

""Let's do it.""

""Knock me down, win. I knock down, win.""

""Yes, yes, I've been here the last two days.""

""Ready,"" the ogre called out with a grin.

Ellox readied his wind and fire spells. He would generate a fire whirl, concentrated at the Guardian's feet. If he could cause it enough distress, it might panic and lose its balance.

""Now!"" Ellox called out as he released both of his spells in two different spots. It'd taken a bit of hurried practice to figure out the technique, but Ellox unleashed the results of his effort at the Guardian's two feet.

This time, the Guardian did what looked like a dance. It pulled one foot back, gracefully, then did the same with the other. The fire whirls chased, but the ogre repeated the motion again. The fire whirl chased once more, but the Guardian simply danced away once more. It was futile, Ellox could see.

""Dammit!""

""My turn.""

-- -- -- -- --

""Again, Guardian!""

""Play game?""

""Yes.""

""Ready.""

""What? No explanation of the rules this time?""

""Already know.""

""Hahaha, I suppose I do.""

""Ready.""

Ellox readied ice spells, hoping to disturb the Guardian's balance. A moment later, however, the Guardian's halberd came down, hard, on the forming ice. Not only did the halberd break the ice and provide footing where none had existed a moment before, but it also provided the ogre something to hold on to. Ellox saw that the ice had failed.

""Dammit.""

-- -- -- --

""Again, Guardian.""

""Ready.""

Ellox stopped to consider his options. He'd lost count of how many days in a row he'd challenged the Guardian, but the ogre had more than proven its mettle through all of the attempts. Ellox's strongest spells had barely fazed the enormous ogre, and even combinations meant to throw it off balance had been dealt with deftly.

""Worth a shot,"" Ellox muttered as he came up with a new plan.

He massaged energy into a long staff. It was larger than any physical staff he could physically wield, but he hoped that the extra length might provide a modicum of extra leverage. At this point, it was worth trying just about anything.

Ellox reared back, cast his Thousand-Fold Blow enhancement spell, and then swung the staff as hard as he could.

The Guardian simply stood its ground, and looked down at the staff as it made contact. The blow had not done any significant damage, as far as Ellox could tell.

To his surprise, the Guardian came tumbling down a moment later.

""What?!""

""Win,"" the Guardian muttered from its back.

""Huh? How? Why?"" Ellox couldn't help but stammer. There was absolutely no way that the blow should have knocked the ogre over; Ellox had clearly seen the ogre withstand the blow.

""Did you ... why did you forfeit?""

""Cannot win,"" the Guardian replied with a chuckle.

""What do you mean?""

""Can win one day. Can win another day. Cannot win every day.""

Ellox still stood there, flabbergasted, when his Master appeared out of nowhere. Ellox couldn't help but notice that his Master had a huge grin on his face.

""Looks like you're ready to ascend, after all.""",24
1ltaakm,n1s10eg,"""You win, you go through the door. I win, you leave the dungeon and go home.""

I looked up at the towering figure, a full ogre, about 12 feet in height, more than twice my 5'11. He didn't have muscles so much as muscles had *him*, and it wasn't a strong man Adonis look, it was like a power lifter, his paunch was so wide it hung off him with muscles larger than my head hanging off the fat that sealed his body.

  
While other strong men looked like Greek statues, he looked like a tank had stood up and ambled over.

  
I snickered. This was the perfect game for me.

Battered, but unbroken, I had barely made it through the dungeon, the lowest on the team, I signed the contract in front of the pedestal with my moniker ""Siege"". A simple, one syllable, stupid name, that had been given to me to mock me in the Hero Academy. My ability was limitless, technically S class, above even A-rankers that were wanted by governments. However its stipulations, well, the ability may be S class, but the *use of it* was probably a big fat F.

You see, they called me Siege because I could charge my body with power, bit by bit, through concentration or absorbing momentum incrementally. Due to this I maintained a very low level of super strength, agility, durability, not enough to contend in a fist fight against most D class heroes, a joke really. However if I concentrated, I could turn ambient momentum into potential within my body, endlessly. It really was a joke, if I wanted to run a dungeon I pretty much started doing aerobics for days beforehand to have enough energy to last as barely a B rank throughout. If I was going for an exam, I would have to do aerobics and training for weeks to ensure I maintained an A ranking. *But there was no limit*!

Getting through that door would return me to my team, and I could have them beat me with sticks for a while to build back up energy, if they were fit enough to do so, so I decided to use the rest of the energy I'd reserved for the dungeon. Six months.

Six months is all I had managed to build up in my full reserves over the entire scholastic career at this academy, trying to keep what I sparingly could while still being functional enough to maintain reasonable grades. At this point it was estimated that if I burned all that energy in one hit, the shockwave alone would flatten a three story building. Or more.

My eye glinted.

I took horse rider stance, and began breathing, as my muscles began to swell the ogres gaze began to shift, slowly I began to look more like him.

6ft, 6ft 8, 7ft 3, 8ft 4, 9ft 10, 13ft, 16 ft, I had to stop and crouch into position before my head scraped the vaulted ceiling.

I smiled down at the Ogre who had beads of sweat pouring down his brow, pulling back my fist and feeling the power like a bear trap coiling down my arm.

  
""Wait wait wait! You pass."" Good job student.

I sighed, and started piling the energy away. Not today, maybe next time. I noticed that my charging and release had significantly sped up compared to the final last year, even better over the last few months of meditation and training, at this rate, I may be able to afford treatment from an Accelerator class, permanently increasing the speed of execution of my ability. Now that would be terrifying, to do what I had just done in a split second instead of half a minute.

I myself had a really bad month and ended up in the hospital with rhabdo once, years ago.

1ltlhkx,n1ro2yf,"Those memories now gnaw at my mind, every time I look into his eyes.

That morning, when we both woke up naked in cold sweat as we frantically wore our clothes; my boyfriend then escaped out the window before my dad entered the room.

I still remember being terrified when my dad eyed the strand of his hair on my pillow, a suspicion lighting in his mind.

In time, he would figure out the truth. Though, my boyfriend, James, worked hard to earn my father's trust.

Somewhere down the line, my dad refused our relationship, however. So I did what any angry teen would do: I cut my hair, flipped my dad, and ran away to live with James.

Although, in a week or so, I was back. My dad was disappointed, although he also showed a sorry face. 

I still remember coming back to my room that night, multiple strands of my cut-off hair covering my bedsheets, an incriminating proof of my actions.

Our relationship repaired, however. It wasn't that I hated my father, and the same was true for him. Then came college, then a job, and then I got married.

To James no less. 

Somehow, despite the runaway incident, over the years, my dad grew to like him and gave his permission. It was a weird feeling, seeing your own dad cry in your wedding as he left your hand. But they were happy tears.

So many memories of our time together flood my mind as I look into his eyes. My dad's eyes. 

The chemo was starting to show it's effects, as he lifted his head from the pillow, he looked down to see the last of his hair laying there to wither. 

All of his hair had abandoned him. However, when our eyes met, he still smiled. I guess he wanted me to remember him in his last moments smiling.

What was it like when I found all his hair on the bed?

Sadness. Somber. A dull ache in the chest. The urge to cry but knowing you don't want them to worry. 

There is no single word for it.

My Cooking Saved a Vampire's Life, Now She's Saving Mine

For as long as you can remember, you’ve always cooked more than you needed.

At first, it was a habit. A leftover tick from your younger days when your house was full of voices and laughter and people you loved. You always made too much pasta, too much curry, too much stew. You stored the rest in Tupperware and slid it into the fridge, even when there was no one else to eat it but you.

But someone was eating it.

You noticed it gradually over the years—bites taken from meatballs, ladles of soup vanished overnight, a piece of cake missing its edge, carefully cut. Never spoiled, never wasted. You smiled at first, thinking maybe you were getting forgetful. You even started leaving things deliberately: a mini quiche, a perfect dumpling, a cupcake with a tiny strawberry on top.

Each time, it was gone by morning.

You lived alone in that quiet apartment for over forty years. The world got louder, more digital, more rushed—but your life slowed. You retired, your friends passed or moved, and the city never looked the same. But the fridge remained. And so did the secret guest you never truly confronted.

Until one night, well into your eighties, when your bones ached too much to cook, and your hands trembled too much to hold a knife steady. You sat at the kitchen table, staring at a microwaved meal that tasted like paper and regret.

“I miss cooking,” you whispered, voice cracked with the weight of time. “I miss... being able to do something that made someone happy.”

That’s when you heard the fridge creak open.

You turned, expecting a dream, a stroke, a shadow. But what stepped out was real.

A girl no taller than your forearm, pale as moonlight, with crimson eyes that shimmered like old rubies. She wore a black Victorian dress, patched in places with bits of napkin and thread. Her fangs glinted when she smiled.

“You always made such wonderful food,” she said softly. “Even when no one else was there to eat it... You fed me.”

You didn’t speak. You couldn’t. The moment was too strange, too quiet, too filled with something that didn’t have a name.

“I was weak, once,” she said, walking slowly across the table. “I had no strength to hunt, no will to drink blood. But your leftovers kept me alive. You saved me without ever knowing me.”

You tried to laugh, but it came out choked. “I suppose I should be scared.”

She tilted her head. “But you’re not.”

You shook your head. “I’m... tired. And oddly, grateful. I always suspected I wasn’t truly alone.”

She stepped closer. “You gave me life when I had none. Let me return the gift.”

Her hand extended, impossibly small and delicate, yet filled with power.

“I can make you young again. Immortal. No blood price. No curse. Just... stay. Stay and cook for me. Let’s share more years, more meals.”

You stared into her eyes and saw the centuries she had lived, the hunger she had endured, and the gentleness she had cultivated in your quiet presence.

“You’re not lonely anymore?” you asked.

“Not as long as your food warms the cold,” she whispered.

You reached out and took her hand.

In a blink, your joints eased. The gray vanished from your hair. Your sight sharpened. The aches and cracks of age fell away like an old coat.

You stood, steady and strong, as tears welled in your eyes.

“Do you like risotto?” you asked with a laugh that felt decades younger.

Her eyes sparkled. “Only if there’s truffle oil.”

From that day on, the kitchen never cooled. You cooked with joy, danced between pots and spices, and she sat nearby, legs swinging over the counter, her appetite for flavor insatiable.

And though the world outside changed endlessly, the fridge at the end of the hall remained warm with the scent of love, garlic, and something strangely eternal.",173
1lt2t5d,n1pne3j,"Another wave of aches spreads out from my hip bones. I try shifting my weight but it only makes the pain spread to my thighs and ribs and I end up wedged between cushions on the couch. I sigh.

""Dad?"" My daughter calls out from the kitchen. ""Have you been cooking for yourself again?"" She pokes out from behind the wall separating the kitchen from the living room and scowls at me. ""I thought we talked about this already. You can't be cooking for yourself. I'm already giving you all the meals you need. Everything you cook is going to waste.""

""No it's not,"" I say gruffly. I give her a cold side eye. ""It's not a waste if it helps keep me sane.""

She slides around the couch and sits by my side holding a plate of my best cheese ravioli. ""I know how much it means to you,"" she says softly. ""All those years running your own restaurant, I'm sure it's killing you to stay off your feet, but the doctor said...""

""Hmph."" I bark. ""I'm dying anyway.""

""Well,"" she says, ""at least it's not all going to waste. I see you've been nibbling on this one."" She has pulled back a bit of the plastic film wrap and is pointing at one of the pasta squares.

I peer down at where she's pointing. The ravioli square looks like it's had a corner cut off, exposing some of the cheese inside. ""Wasn't me,"" I mumble.

My daughter gasps and struggles out of the couch to get back to the kitchen. ""Don't tell me you've got rats too."" She throws the fridge open and I hear the clink of jars and plates as she shuffles around inside.

""I don't have rats,"" I growl. ""Rats would have chewed the plastic away.""

""Well if you didn't take a bite of the pasta, who did?""

She can't see me shrugging. ""An elf,"" I huff.

My daughter pokes her head out again. ""I think it's time we start talking about getting you into an assisted living unit.""

I've had enough. My knees shake as I lean forward and flex against the pain. ""Over my dead body,"" I growl, reaching for my cane and leaning onto it for support. I can't quite get fully upright, but it's close enough. I hobble into the kitchen. ""Go,"" I say. ""I'll clean up your mess. I'll see you tomorrow for dinner.""

""What will you have tonight?"" she asks. ""I haven't made anything yet.""

""Ravioli,"" I say, grabbing the plate off the counter by the fridge. ""And I'm cooking dinner tomorrow too.""

My daughter laughs. ""Fine, and I'm bringing papers for the Sunset Heights home."" She grabs her purse off the kitchen table and stomps to the door. ""At least keep your phone in your pocket so you can call me if you fall again.""

""Right,"" I say. ""Get going then. And bring your husband when you come for dinner tomorrow."" I scoff and glare at Carol, my youngest daughter, and my leathery heart sinks.

Her eyes are shimmering and her lower lip quivers. She sniffles and turns to go.

I turn away. Maybe I went too far. Her cheating husband only left her last year.

I hear the door close and the key scraping in and out as she clicks the lock closed. I lean on the counter, huffing and wincing. My head is throbbing and my hips probably need replacement surgery. At least one of the disks in my back has worn out and every moment my spine spends resisting gravity is a symphony of aches and shooting pains. I'm short of breath, and despite a little growling in my stomach, I don't feel like eating.

I pull the fridge open, toss the plate of ravioli on top of a tub of clam chowder I made last week, and stagger back to the couch. As soon as I drop into the comfort of the soft cushions, I realize that the television remote is out of reach and let loose a profane bit of poetry that pulls inspiration from the emotional void in my life and the frustrations of watching life crumble in old age.

I stare down at the wrinkly, speckled skin on the backs of my hands, sighing. Some of the spots look like they could be constellations. Just as my eye is tracing out a spatula and a sauce pan, I hear the seal on the refrigerator door peel open slowly, and something patters to the floor. The fans in the fridge spin up and I groan. Better go close it. I take a deep breath and reach for my cane, but before I lean to pull myself out of the couch I hear the fridge door shut again, muffling the sound of the fan inside.

""Carol?"" I call out, frozen in place, leaning forward a little but not ready to get up. My chest is tight and I can hear my tired heartbeat trying to prepare for a fight or flight response. I hear a little scuffle but see no movement coming from the direction of the kitchen.

After a moment I lean back and set my cane aside. The fridge sounds closed. It might have popped open and blown closed again. Maybe there was a tremor I couldn't feel in the floor. When my feet aren't hurting, they are numb.

Just then I spot movement on the coffee table in front of me. My eye catches a glimpse of something scurrying toward me along the oak finish. My heart jumps and I recoil, launching a hand out to grab my cane and pulling a muscle in my shoulder. I howl in pain and grip the cane, lifting it high over my head ready to bring it down on the rat or critter or whatever it was. My eyes can't focus as I scan the top of the table, a throbbing headache is blurring my vision. I squint and watch for any signs of movement.

[Continued in a child comment.]",14
1lt2t5d,n1q5cb2,"It had been a long night.

You knew the end was coming. 

All these years you just lived alone after all you knew had either left years earlier, or were just too old just like you by now.

Life had not been too bad to you, the decades spend as a cook in a small restaurant never made you rich, but then, you never went into this for the money did you? It was a love of the art of the taste and sensations.

Sure it did nothing for your figure when you mastered the desserts, ice creams of unique flavours, pastries filled in ways that would make a souflet stand up straight to not disappoint you. 

But time, time was marching forward. You could not hold the hours anymore, running the kitchen became a chore with more pain then joy.

And that is why you are now alone, unable to even make yourself a convenience pudding. Your legs betraying you as much as the back stabbing like cesar's last moments.

A sigh escaped your throat and you just had to think of your fridge. Something else had been going on all these years. Leftovers vanishing, sometimes your microwave was left open or the counter definitely tidied up after someone had a snack.

Well, life was odd and you got up to go to bed as you turned around and saw her. For the first time you laid eyes on the little food thief standing infront of the empty fridge.

""No leftovers today?"" the little, outright tiny girl, asked you with a pleading tone.

""Uhhhh."" was all that escaped your throat.

""Ohhh ehh Hi there, i am Selina, i uhh, am sorry but i've been living in your fridge.""

""Wh... why?"" a short stammer.

""Please don't laugh, or judge me, but uhm I tried to hide there one day from a hunter, thought i would die, but then you left so much food, i could survive.""

""What are you?"" you finally asked, somehow you were not afraid even at this odd appearance of a little girl in a gown like dark dress, red glowing eyes, and quite prominent fangs. Well it would be hard to be afraid of anything the size of your hands.

""A vampire."" she said and cocked her head sideways.

""Don't you need like, well, you know, blood?"" a question after a few blinks.

""Not really, the hunters say that, but we just need lifeforce, and your food was always so full of it. All the love and energy you put into every bite. Some of us can just live of hobby videos or watching performances, but i think your food is much better."" she smiled broadly.

""Ohhh, my food is that good then?"" you beamed with enough pride a dragon would blush and got a chuckle.

""Absolutely delicious! Oberon would surely trade fairly for it!"" she beamed back.

""So, uhhh, well, then i am sorry i cannot give you more. I am too old to cook anymore. But it was nice knowing someone truly enjoyed it."" you said with another weary sigh.

""Uhhh, if i help you with that, can you make something nice?"" she asked a bit sheepish.

""Help?""

""Oh yeah, i can give you some of my blood and will it to give you your youth and life back. No strings attached."" she bit her small hand and held it out like an offering.

You thought for a while, it sounded odd, and probably had strings attached, but you could not care. There was a hungry belly definitely hoping for something nice. And you were not just any cook!

Quickly dipping your finger on the blood and then licking it you felt the effect immediately. A surge of energy and vitality burned through you as age and pain subsided. You barely could hold back throwing that convenience food away and raiding your ingredients.

And within moments you had whipped up pasta from scratch, a bit of pesto and chopped up nuts, all you had left in the pantry, before you both sat down and enjoyed the meal.

""Uhm, pardon my asking, but why are you so small?"" you finally had the courage for the greater oddity. She shuffled a bit, clearly ashamed, before taking a deep breath and gathering her own courage.

""I was a fairy. But after pranking some little prince in what you know as central east europe Oberon got a bit angry about what he did. So uhm, yeah, tiny mosquito sized vampire.""",10
1lt2t5d,n1pjgoi,"Eyes narrowed, I bark, “You can do that?!” I’m absolutely fuming. And though my brain tells my body to jump out of this recliner like a madwoman, my old bones groan in protest. Instead, I only glare.

The tiny vampire fairy flutters in front of me, wings flapping oh so gleefully. The little bitch. She gives me a tight-lipped smile. “Do you vish for eternal youth, or not? The choice is yours.”

Although my answer is obviously going to be a definite yes, I decide to give her a taste of her own medicine. With a furrowed brow, I tap my chin, feigning deep contemplation. “I don’t know about it. I mean, honestly… I’m pretty content with the body I have now.”

Her tiny face falls, crimson lips turning down in a pout. *Yeah… how’s it feel, you little bloodsucker?* I’ve been lying around this shithole for years… with no idea that she could grant me eternal youth! And though I’m eager to be young and beautiful again, I decide to make her beg.

“You know what they say—you’re only as old as you feel.” With a cheerful smile, I run a hand down the front of my body. “And besides… I think I still got it.”

She rolls her eyes, and I consider being offended. Pulling her little wand from somewhere unseen, she waves it impatiently. “Either you vish to be young, or you don’t. But I am starving. If you don’t vant to feed me, I shall find someone else who vill.”

Now it’s my turn to pout. I cross my arms like a petulant child, staring at the floor for a moment. Finally, I look up to see her smiling… as if she already knows the answer. Her tiny little vampire teeth protrude just enough to creep me out. “Fine. Cast the damn spell,” I snap. “But as soon as you make me sexy again, I’m finding me a hottie to shack up with for a few days. Is takeout okay?”",10
1lt2t5d,n1pneqt,"A tiny voice cries out. ""Stop! Please! I won't hurt you Mr. Russo, just please... put down the cane!"" It is a high pitched voice, like a little girl with a lung full of helium.

I grip the cane tight, still holding it over my head, and I lean forward. ""Who said that?""

""Me,"" the voice says and finally I catch a bit of movement.

I wind up to bring the cane down.

""Wait!"" the voice shrieks. ""Please, I can help you! We need each other!""

I lower the cane and rub my eyes against my forearm, blinking and squinting down at the source of the movement. I finally get a good look at... well it's a tiny woman, perhaps a few inches tall, holding her arms over her head and cowering. She's shaking and her face is hiding behind long black hair that hangs down from under her protective posture.

""Well I'll be..."" I begin, setting the cane down on the couch beside me and leaning forward to get even closer.

She slowly lowers her arms and I can finally get a peek at her face as she peers up at me, still shaking. ""Thank you,"" she says, her voice quivering. She adjusts her hair, pulling it back behind her and shaking her head. She takes a deep breath and flattens out the front of the little black dress she's wearing. Her skin is pale, her eyes bright, and her features perfectly proportional to a full sized human, but small enough to take a bath in a mug.

I stare at her, my jaw slack.

""I'm Fangelina,"" she says, smiling and waving up at me.

""Fanga who?"" I say, wrinkling my bushy brow.

She laughs at me. ""I'm a mosquito vampire,"" she says with a little curtsy.

""A vampire?"" I repeat. I lean back in the couch and sigh. ""I'm losing my mind. First I lose my balance, then I lose my muscles, then I lose my restaurant, and now I'm losing my mind.""

I feel a tiny thwack on my knee and look down to see that Fangelina has leaped across the gap and landed on me. She's struggling to her feet and catching her balance. She looks up at me. ""I've been living in your fridge for a long time,"" she says. ""Mosquito vampires only need human blood once every hundred years or so, but the rest of the time we need other things for sustenance. The leftovers you put in that refrigerator are divine."" She says it the way a lover speaks of a particularly spicy rendezvous and her eyes roll into the back of her tiny skull for a moment while she smiles. She blinks and continues. ""We've had a pretty good thing going and now if I understand the situation properly, you'll be leaving me and I won't get any more of your amazing food.""

I purse my lips and stare at her, moving my jaw back and forth while I think. None of it makes any sense at all, but she seems to be presenting a problem. ""So?"" I say. ""I'm getting old. Things change. I'll die eventually.""

""Will you?"" She asks the question while prancing up my thigh like a runway model, deliberately and seductively. ""What if you didn't have to die? What if you could be young and strong again?""

I squint at her and take a deep, whistling breath through my hairy nostrils. Finally I laugh. ""Yeah, and I could open my restaurant again. And while we're at it, let's bring my dear Sophia back from the dead."" I shake my head. ""Things change, it's inevitable. I'll be gone and you'll deal with it."" She probably isn't real anyway.

The tiny woman huffs and looks down at the shirt button on my belly, then begins climbing up the buttons until she's got her little face right between my eyeballs, a foot halfway in my mouth, and her hands grabbing clumps of my nose hairs. ""Look here,"" she says assertively. ""I've been alive for close to three thousand years and I've never had food as good as yours. I'm offering you a gift, the chance to be immortal, and you're treating me like some kind of fever dream. You want to cook, I want you to cook for me. I fail to see how this is so difficult for you to grasp. All you have to do is let me bite you, and you won't have to go live in that awful home, you won't have to deal with a decaying body, and you can do all the cooking you want. Forever.""

Her little chest is rising and falling fast against my nose and her little eyes are flaring up with a brilliant red. With one final huff, she drops back onto my chest and tumbles into my lap. She struggles back onto her feet on my left thigh and marches back to my knee before hurling herself back over to the coffee table. Finally she turns around, stares at me, and folds her arms.

""So why didn't you bite me just then? You could have."" I fold my arms as well and glare at her.

""I need your permission,"" she says. ""Without your permission I can drink your blood, but it won't convert you. For the conversion to work, you need to give permission."" She picks up her folded arms and drops them back down with a nod.

""I see,"" I say, not seeing at all. ""And when you say it will convert me, you mean I'll become a vampire?""

She sighs. ""Yes. Of course that's what it means.""

""A pigmy vampire, or whatever you are?""

She scowls at me. ""Of course not, dummy. You're a full sized human. You won't shrink."" She says it with disdain and shakes her head.

""So why are you so small?"" I ask.

""It's a long story,"" she says. ""But I used to be a fairy, OK? Now are we doing this or not?""

""I want to hear the story,"" I say.

She sighs and half a smile cracks on her face. ""Tell you what. Let me convert you and we'll have all the time in the world for stories."" She looks up at me and grins. Something in her eye sparkles.

I take a deep breath and let it out. I uncross my arms and lean forward. ""Will it hurt?"" I ask.

She grins. ""Not any worse than you're already hurting. Just give me your finger."" She reaches her arms up and beckons me to reach out to her.

I shake my head and laugh. ""Either this is a hallucination and I'll wake up hurting, or this is real and I'll wake up immortal. What have I got to lose?"" I extend a finger and reach down.

I feel her tiny, cool hands on my warm, tough finger. Then she pressed her face into me, pulling the flesh in with her fingers, and there is a hot sting accompanied by a lighting bolt of pain shooting up through my nerves. Soon I'm feeling dizzy.

""Goodnight Mr. Russo,"" I hear her saying, her voice fading away. ""See you in the morning.""",24
1lthxj9,n1qzcap,"I wake up, and stretch, before going to the bathroom.  
On my way there, I see a creature in the corner of the shower cabin.  
I ignore it.  
It talks to me, promises me powers, and riches, but I ignore it.  
After being done in the bathroom, I make myself breakfast.  
Noticing something slightly off with the apple, I don't eat it.  
I hear a groan, but ignore it.  
I leave for work.

  
On my way to work, a superhero crash lands in front of me, her blood almost spilling on me.  
I turn around to ignore it.  
When I finally reach my basic 9-5 corpo job, one of my coworkers is grinning at me.  
""Hey Matt...  
I found something wild in the forest, want to see it after work?"" he asks.  
I shake my head.  
""No thank you."" I say, continuing my tasks.  
The day at work passes uneventfully, then it is time to go home.

  
Two aliens, one villain, and a mad scientists get in my way.  
I get home 2 hours later due to this, but I managed to not get involved.  
As I take a shower, and get into bed, I hear yet another groan.  
I sigh.  
""Can't you leave me be?  
I mean I am happy, isn't that satisfying enough? Or intriguing enough?  
Not many can be happy with a plain old boring life."" I say.  
Instead of a proper answer, I see something shiny floating in from of my window.  
I hide under the blanket, making sure no light lands on me.

  
The next days are similar, but I am used to it.  
It has been like this for years now.  
The life I live is a story written by someone.  
Magic, aliens, superpowers...the world is ablaze with random overpowered people, and stuff.  
I...I am absolutely, perfectly plain, average and normal.  
So is my life, and I am happy with it.  
The one who writes this story?  
Not so much.  
So they have been trying to make me more...something different.  
A bit annoying, but it's their story, they can try.  
But I am already happy with my life, so if I can help it...I won't become something else.",10
1lthtq7,n1r1za0,"I look at Blezroth, and sigh.  
""I get it, but this human is the Captain of one of the best Bounty Hunter teams.  
Their ship is messed up, like alive and stuff.  
And they managed to get away with my poor little daughter!"" I say.  
Blezroth nods.  
""That's even easier. Bounty Hunter humans are always good, but they also always have pretty tough enemies.  
I am pretty sure you could make one of the other human bounty hunters, or even some Galactic officers to take him down."" he says.  
I frown.

  
""The humans are a respected race of the Galactic Community.  
I don't think it would be easy..."" I start.  
""I get rid of 12 humans already, using other humans.  
How do you think I got my hands on those businesses? And those wives?"" he winks at me.  
I shiver.  
I knew Blezroth was quite wild, considering his businesses, and life, but damn.  
""I don't know if I want to do something that bad."" I say.  
He laughs.  
""You want to kill him though, right? After all, he took your daughter!"" he says.  
I sigh.

  
""I don't know..."" I mutter.  
Before Blezroth could say something, a blaster shot makes a 5th eye in the middle of his face.  
I shout, jumping away.  
""Don't worry, father-in-law, I ain't here for you."" I voice laughs.  
I turn around to see him, the blasted ""Steve""!  
""YOU!"" I say, standing up, grabbing him with all my arms.  
""Happy to see you too."" he smiles, patting my shoulder.  
I shiver.  
""Where is, Leglra?!"" I ask.  
He shrugs.

  
""Some spa? I don't know, last time I saw her was on our honeymoon, and then..."" he starts, but stops, as I let him go.  
I take a few steps back.  
""H-honey moon? Y-you..."" I say, now the fact that he called me father-in-law hitting harder.  
""We got married on Horita, by a Shenial Priestess.  
Spent a month on Flotus 4 as honey-moon, so you know, expect a grandkid or 12."" he winks, walking up to Blezroth, and taking his head.  
""Where is she?"" I ask again.  
""She said she had to do the Flirlraid ceremony."" he says.  
I nod, and leave.  
Goddamn the human, I don't care, I have to see Leglra!  
If she's doing the Flirlraid ceremony, she's on our ancestral planet, and it means that she...she...  
I will be a grandpa!",5

""So what do we do?""

""People like that don't listen to reason.  They don't respond to diplomacy.  You'd have to eliminate them.""

""You mean kill them.""

""Yes.""

""Humans have lots of synonyms for 'kill.'""

""Yes.""

""We would not be well able to do that.  We don't kill like humans do.  We hunt for food but when it's a matter of disagreements between sapients, we might fight like you and I did, but mostly we argue.  We argue for a long, long time.  Killing doesn't come easily to us, Human Gina.""

""It comes pretty easily to humans, Angroood.  The easiest way to kill a human, especially for members of this system, would be to get another human to kill them for you.  Humans have been killing each other for thousands and thousands of years.  We're good at it.  We study ways to kill each other, we perfect tactics and strategies for killing each other.  We expend a lot of time and energy at developing weapons that kill humans faster, more humanely, despite defenses, whatever.  If you need a human killed, get another human to do it.  We're brilliant at it.""

""If a bad human comes to this system, Human Gina, will we be able to call on you?""

Gina swirled her glass.  The beverage was delicious, evidently intoxicating to the locals in sufficient volume, though it had no effect on her at all.  ""Of course.  It would be immoral to stand by and let someone do harm to the people and environments of this system.""

""Would it be immoral to kill another human in such a circumstance?""

""I don't think killing anyone is *ever* moral, but in such a circumstance it may be the less-immoral thing to do.  Morality doesn't exist in a vacuum.""

""Indeed.""  Angroood raised his glass toward hers.  ""To morals.""  She tapped her glass against his.  It rang mutedly, like a bell underwater.

""To morals.""

They drank, and watched ships come and go.

1lt4hf7,n1pke38,"You know that old joke about Reagan getting pulled over, and the cop calls his superior to ask about special treatment for special people?

As soon as they fingerprint me, I start grinning ear to ear like a coyote.

“Hey, detective, guy’s prints keep coming out smooth!” says the uniformed cop, with that desert-dry accent I hate so much.

Me, being the ever antagonist, ask, “Is there a problem, sir?”

I get answered with a hard backhanded slap. I spit out blood and chuckle a little. Not because I enjoy the pain—I hate it, as a matter of fact. No, I laugh at the cop’s frustration.

“Nobody talkin’ to you! And it’s not ‘sir,’ it’s Officer Johnson!”

“My apologies, Mister Johnson,” I say, irreverent, saluting him with nothing but my facial expressions.

Another slap.

I spit more blood. It’s been two hours in the holding cell, and I hate to cut the fun short, but I can’t leave my boss waiting.

I whistle like I’m calling a dog. Nothing. So I do the least original thing ever and start oinking like a pig—not saying the word, but making honest-to-God pig noises. I can’t help but laugh, loud and full. I hear the other guys locked up down the hall laughing too.

In comes Johnson, anger in his eyes, veins popping from his neck.

“There you are. Get me a cell—I need to make a call.” What little non-respect I had is now gone. He needs to know who's in charge.

When he opens my cell, I’m not greeted with a slap. I get a full taste of what a baton feels like. There’s a whack, and everything goes white.

Next thing I know, I’m waking up with a newspaper on my chest. Front page has my mug on it. Now I’m pissed. My face was never supposed to be made public. Oh well—more fun coming my way down the line.

I throw the newspaper to the ground and start laughing again. I walk over to the phone, and the operator starts talking. I don’t say a word—just laugh, full and deep. Then I slam the phone down.

Fifteen minutes later, I hear my buddy Johnson down the hall:
“Yes, sir… of course, sir… right away, sir.”

Johnson shows up outside my cell. His face is a cocktail of anger and fear—the kind of face a man wears when he knows he fucked up.

“Just who the fuck did you call?”

“Kid, some people pay Time Magazine to get on the richest people list. Me? I pay to stay off it.”
I spit blood on his boot as he opens my cell.
“I just bought the police station from Hesperia. Get the fuck out of my building.”",154
1lt4hf7,n1scddn,"As he’s being handcuffed by a number of gentlemen with very serious expressions, Officer McDoughty screams down the corridor, “Who the fuck did you call?”

“Officer McDoughty, you are under arrest on suspicion of breaking your oaths of office, brutality against a suspect, brutality against a prisoner during the course of your duties, torture and inhumane treatment of a prisoner in police care, failure to provide appropriate and timely medical care of prisoner in police care, resisting arrest…”

“The fuck! I ain’t resisting arrest!”

“and disturbing the peace. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Anything you say may be used in a court of law.”

McDoughty’s brain finally catches up, and he falls into a sullen silence as a swarm of federal police, lawyers, and associated personnel filter into Brooklyn NYC police station. His stomach sinks as he recognises the badges of the internal affairs officers filtering in and heading for the security office. The bottom of his stomach drops out as he spots the Police Chief and the New York head of the police union walk in while talking to each other followed by a number of photographers.

Hours later, McDoughty is sat in a bare concrete room with an angle iron chair bolted to the floor in front of an angle iron table, that’s similarly bolted to the floor. In one corner is a baleful red light indicating that the camera it’s attached to is on. Attached to the wall furthest from the door is a bare concrete shelf that serves as his bed. Every single edge and corner has been rounded off to prevent prisoners from using them to commit suicide before help can arrive.

The clank of the door opening precedes the black duty attorney, who looks very much like she doesn’t want to be there as she wheels an office chair inside. As the door closes behind her, she looks up at the red light and waits for it to turn off.

“Good evening, I’m Sandra Lowe your duly appointed attorney. Before we begin, is there anything you want to tell me?”

“Can I have another attorney?”

“There aren’t any, I’m it. Anything else?”

McDoughty slumps into the chair and asks, “What’s going on? One minute I’m giving a homeless bum his five minute phone call, and the next the place is swarming with feds and IA.”

Sandra sighs, “That homeless bum as you called him was Mr Amoudi, and is the seventh richest oil tycoon in the world. He was also the victim of a mugging while going to the toilet in a theatre, and was wearing a scrounged coat after they stole his $2,000 suit and shoes along with his wallet. Honestly, the only reason I’m here is I was ambushed when I came on shift, as all the other duty attorneys found reasons to remain busy until shift change.”

“What about the union attorney?”

“Short staffed due to maternity leave.”

McDoughty’s face crumples as he finally says, “How the fuck was I supposed to know that the sand n\*\*\*\* was important?”

Sternly Sandra says, “You were supposed to treat your prisoners with dignity and respect, not abuse and violence. Not only have you caused a diplomatic incident, but you’ve done it because you’re a racist fucking asshole. Now, I have a duty to defend you to the best of my ability, and to do that you need to tell me everything that happened from your point of view. Without the creative licence some cops use.”",45
1lt4hf7,n1s6yu7,"It says bad things about the world that he was able to buy the police station. But it is amusing that the bully cop got shafted by a billionaire. Though, I have a feeling that having the most expensive law firm in the country baring down on the police station, along with certified forensic medical professionals and a court approved photographer would have made a far bigger statement about how much Johnson had fucked up. In a ""Not even your union is going to save your ass now"" sort of way.",12
1ltb57w,n1ps2i4,"The Chair of Indefinite Studies squinted at his personal library. Everything was perfectly in order. In fact, everything was slightly *too* perfect. He frowned. ""Jeeves!""

The immaculate butler appeared, as though summoned out of thin air by one of those two-bit parlor magicians. The Chair's glower of disapproval deepened; it was his firm belief that those prancing charlatans did a disservice to all magical occupations by dint of association, and anything that reminded him of them served to put him in a bad mood.

""Yes, sir?""

""Didn't I tell you *explicitly* that the bookshelf labeled ""Unthinkable Magics"" was to remain untouched?""

""I'm afraid it slipped my mind, sir.""

""Slipped your *mind*? You could have distorted the fabric of space-time! Rent a hole in the universe! We might even be in an alternate timeline, and the worst thing is, we *wouldn't even know it!*""

""Terribly sorry, sir.""

""Oh, I'm sure you're terribly sorry, you halfwit! You know what else you are?"" The Chair was well on his way to an apoplectic fit.

""Yes, sir?""

""You're fired!""

""Right away, sir,"" Jeeves replied. ""I'll send for a carriage at once.""

The Chair sputtered. He was champing at the bit for a row. He'd expected Jeeves to have protested, put up a fight, *anything*. This calm acquiescence took the wind right out of the man's sails.

He looked around the library once more.

It really *was* quite tidy. And everything seemed to be present, too - the last man had tried to pinch several of the Chair's rarer books, no doubt to sell on the black market.

Really, there was no harm done. And if he dismissed Jeeves, he would have to go through the whole bloody process of securing a new retainer.

""Jeeves?""

""Yes, sir?""

""Never mind all that. You can stay.""",23
1ltb57w,n1q0san,"Standing with her hands full of cleaning supplies, Kelly Quintas looked up. And up. And up. 

The old grey stones fit atop each other perfectly and with no breaks or windows. It'd be dark in there most likely.

On the way in the tower hadn't looked quite so tall but standing here in front of it at the simple wooden  door, it looked a mile tall. 

""So, it's really a tower.  I guess the height is what makes it enigmatic."" She said out loud purely for her own comfort.

She needed comfort.  This was gonna be a bigger job than the man she'd met from the ad said it was gonna. 

Confident the job wouldn't be finished today She set down the four bags of supplies she had in her right hand and pulled from her pocket a key.

It was warm and vibrated slightly when she held it. If she didn't know for a fact that it was a computerized and magnatized key, she'd have thought it was magic.

Harlan K. Wizard, the experimental physicist and owner of this tower she'd come to clean had explained it all to her. 

As best he could anyway. After a certain amount of words everything he'd said might well have been magic for as much as understood it.

A magnet she understood.  A computer, she understood to a point. A computerized magnet key?  Shoot, why not?  Made more sense then half the stuff he'd run on about.

She'd finally asked him to stop talkin' about the this' and thats' of it and laid out what she did and didn't do.

""I don't clean no biohazard, we don't got the license for that and I'm not doin' your laundry. Other than that, I'll wipe on and over everything, move stuff from one side of the room t'another clean and move it back.  Anything off limits?""

He'd chuckled and took a hit from a vape that looked like a corncob pipe. The vape mist drifted from his nostrils smelled sweet.

""Kelly, I love the way that all sounds and I am sure you would do a great job executing on all of that.  I just need the floors mopped and swept, the garbage taken out and everything dusted.  Except the shelf with my Renormalization and Color confinement work. We're letting some things settle but we're close to a breakthrough with Quantum Chromodyanmics Theory. It's going to demonstrate that quarks and glucose c-""

""Mr. Wizard, you're losin' me."" She'd interrupted him  about ten seconds after she'd wanted.

""Oh, sorry!  I labeled it ""Unthinkable Magics"".  Kind of an inside joke. Just don't touch it.  The machinery  is working through some stuff.  The dust won't bother it but bumping it will.  Quantum I-""

Shw cut him off before he fell in love with the sound of his own voice again, ""I won't touch the machines on that shelf."" 

After that they'd agreed to a rate that was way to high. He didn't need to know that though.

Now here she was on a Saturday watching a door silde straight down instead of swinging inward when she touched it. It made its own little hole in the floor and sunk out of sight until the top of the door was part of the floor.

Kelly frowned feeling like it was kind of impractical.",7

I pay for gardeners once a week! And I just renovated the porch! Sure, it is Victorian in style, and I paid extra to keep it original, but still!"" I say, absolutely shocked by her claims.  
Abandoned? My home?  
Hmph.  
I feel a bit better for trapping this trespasser, even is she is not a hunter, or worse.

  
""So, you made these traps for these Soul Mages, Mr. Elder Vampire?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""As you know, the supernatural is quite complicated, but basically, just because Elder Vampires stand at the top of the vampire hierarchy, and thus amongst the strongest creatures, doesn't mean we are without enemies.  
Soul Mages, Vampire Hunter, dragons, Sun Worshippers, and a few others could easily kill us."" I say.  
She nods.  
""I see. I see, but...  
I am a human! A college girl that studies poetry! The hell am I a danger to a gajillion old vampire?!"" she shouts.  
I shrug.

  
""Told you. There is the oath written inside the cage.  
Say it, and I shall free you."" I say.  
""But if I say that oath, if you decide to attack me, I can't protect myself!"" she says.  
I frown.  
""Why would I attack you? Also...how would you protect yourself?  
You just said you are a human, and seemingly you are aware of Elder Vampire powers, so...pardon my rudeness, but how would you even try to protect yourself from me?"" I ask.  
She sighs.  
""I gave it away, huh?"" she asks, snapping her fingers, and the cage comes undone.  
The spell still holds though...but barely.

She nods.

1lszi9y,n1mv5us,"“Ok explain it again” said the fledgling spawn before me she was but a few months old. Her sire my own child had left her with me with her for a few nights to educate her in our ways and she will educate me about the modern world. 

“Soul mages” I said confidently and without room for misinterpretation. 

“What are soul mages” the youngling said. Unsurprising really she only recently became aware of our kind but I had hoped that her sire told her we are not the scariest things that bump in the night. Then again that’s why they left her here. 

“Human mages at least all started out humans. They can absorb the magical energies that are present in quote on quote “monster” souls. Then again any soul could work it’s just that what humans consider monsters have more power in their souls.” I started rattling off speaking monotonously. 

She looked at me horrified the kind of fear that only one that has found out that the fear of the unknown is infinitely better then knowing what truly hid under the surface “But your a fucking elder your supposed to be top of the food chain!”

I giggle god I giggle it’s been years since I giggled. I have missed teaching a fledgling the ropes I must request to keep teaching longer it is a joy “A weak upstart should be no threat to me even most older soul mages are not much worry. But” I get close to her if I was still breathing she would feel it on her face as I looked down at her. “Some soul mages have been doing this for long longer then I have existed. They are human in theory alone. In truth they are an amalgam of thousands souls powering a central human soul. They are only hunger and power. If one become aware of my existence I would already be dead. There is a reason we hide child and it is not a fear of humanity as many believe.” I retract myself and say calmly “thankfully in there transformed state they are barely aware of their existence let alone others so as long as we don’t make to big of a fuss we are fine” 

I look down at terrified subject before me clearly I have shook her to her very core “don’t worry you are too small for them to worry about. Care about werewolves and weak mages and whatever else you need not worry about such things yet.” 

“Now can you please explain what is an only fans and why the people on the tik… tok want me to make one”",22
1lszi9y,n1nsi9v,"I've been a therapist for ""monsters"" for decades, being an immortal human myself. I never call my clients ""monsters"", though; how many regular humans with mental illness or neurodivergence have been called that? Carmilla is no different; she's only be a client of mine for five years, a blink for those with our lifespan, and despite being an Elder Vampire, she has her fears, and she confided in me last night her one true fear, and I, in all of my centuries of existence, never heard of what made her afraid.

""Soul mages,"" she answered with a sigh of defeat, as if this armor she wore shattered and left her open for a killing blow.

When I pressed her to explain what she meant, she minced no words and explained, ""A soul mage is a kind of human that gains power from absorbing our souls. Us monsters, I mean. I encountered one centuries ago after feasting on a village that still conducted witch trials. I feasted on the zealots until a survivor revealed himself to me as one and tried to kill me.""

She pulled her shirt down from the collar to reveal a pale red scar over her heart. ""A burning stake nearly did me in, but I managed to scratch his face.""

Curious, I had to know how someone could tell if one was such a threat.

""Their eyes will flicker orange when you make eye contact with them. Whenever they see anything they think is a monster.""

Dread caught my throat, drying it out, tightening its squeeze while I remembered two nights before. I went out in public for a quick drink somewhere other than my apartment or my office. A young woman (she looked to be close to how I look, around 27, give or take) drank with me, and I took her home. I could have sworn her brown eyes were orange for just a second, but I thought it was just my imagination in the heat of the moment.

This was the fifth time this month that this had happened. Another stupid adventurer trying to claim his place in history. 



""You know what those are right?""



""Yes"" the young armour clad idiot said, confidence revealing his intent, ""these gems are what I need to complete my glorious quest"".



""No they're not."" Balda sighed, ""no doubt your quest is very important but these are not what you are looking for"".



""I can pay you a fair price. Just name it.""



""Oh the price will be paid and then some after the fact""



""What do you mean by that, sir?""



""Listen here, and listen well."" Balda pointed to an urn behind the counter. It was plain back, no lustre, nothing notable. ""This is where I put the ashes of all those who touch those gems.""



""You're kidding me right?"" The lad kept his frustratingly omnipresent smile intact.



""No."" 



""Then why haven't you removed them?""



""Did I forget to mention the part where touch turns you into ash?""



""Well no but..."" the lad paused a moment, his overly protected frame clinking as a hand reached his chin. ""Could you try to handle them with tongs?""



""I could, but I haven't.""



""Or have a mage move them with their telekinesis?""



""I am no mage.""



""I have a few friends."" 



""Well done.""



The adventurer ignored or missed the slight. ""If I can remove them, can I keep them?""

1lszrj1,n1qgzpo,"I scoffed and ignored their warnings. I took their ""gems,"" and studied them, all the while wearing a full knight's armor made from iron lined with lead, a necessary risk for a much greater reward.

I studied their gems, and as it turns out, I was right with my theory. I was right the whole time.

""Join me, and we will take over this kingdom in one fell swoop, as long as you listen to me and do as I tell you, exactly."" I offered.

Many refused, but few, those who were as insane as me, stayed.

Sleepless weeks turned into months, but this world and its magic made my research a lot easier. What needed five years then, took us only eight months.

Then...

We dropped the first one on the enemy kingdom.

No warnings, no hesitations.

I called it ""Trinity"" because I was sentimental.

This world's magic paled in comparison to the sheer destruction we built from the ""gems.""

Their mages and even their best minds relied on magic so much that they never considered science as a weapon, that the gems they were so afraid of were isotopes similar to uranium, something I am very intimately familiar with.

Hmm, maybe nuclear science and theory just don't exist in this world. I need to confirm that.

But for now, I will enjoy my newfound power and the fear that my name now brings across kingdoms and nations, and this time, I'm not regretting anything.

He and his buddy Rufus had picked it up at a yard sale for pennies on the dollar. *Chapter 1: Achieving Immortality*, was full of advice that seemed to have been cobbled together from fraternity hazing rituals. Nothing too extreme, but certainly strange and ridiculous.

After a few drinks at the pub, they'd decided to make a bet: who could follow its inane instructions for the longest amount of time?

Rufus had only lasted for four years - he'd gotten married at year 3, and his wife had been thoroughly put off by some of the instructions; specifically, the ones regarding the monthly ritual employing uncooked pasta, strange yoga poses, and fairy cake.

But James had never stopped. Instead, he'd doggedly kept following the instructions. After all, he'd come this far - what was there to lose?

Now, he stared at the hole in his head. It was a quarter of an inch wide, and in the mirror, he could see straight through it to the other side of the room.

With trembling fingers, James opened up the manual and turned to *Chapter 2: What Now?*

*Congratulations! Now that you have achieved immortality, you may find yourself grappling with a question that many other immortals struggle with: What Now?*

*This book will present you with a number of suggestions; but be prepared for what will eventually befall all immortals: the Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.*

1lsndcf,n1kmkcp,"I looked in the mirror at my body. I could stand to lose a couple pounds. I flexed a bit on my bicep and squeezed it, how it seemed to cave in a bit even as I tried to flex more. Could stand to lift a little too. I just wish I had the time.

I threw on a baggy shirt and went for a walk instead. I never really learned a lot about the neighborhood. The sun was beating down on my hair. I felt like I was starting to sweat and could feel that familiar pain in my ankles. I'd gotten further this time though. 3 full blocks at a mild jog. I resisted the urge to sit down on the sidewalk and instead managed to lean against a lightpost.

""Here for the sale?"" I heard a man ask?

I looked over and, in between my wheezing, noticed there was a house there with a garage sale. 

""No?"" I said, not really interested in someone's crap.

""Cheap stuff though?"" The man said, ""Maybe walking a bit makes sure your heart rate doesn't go too low?"" He nodded his head. ""I got a few weights too..."" He was desperate for a sale.

""Fine,"" I said, ""but not too much."" I said, already going over my budget. 

I browsed through and skipped over the weights that were 20 pounds too much for a beginner. I did see a few self-help books, whole stack for a dollar. The man helpfully pulled out a store plastic bag to carry them.

When I got back home, I tossed them on my table and took a shower. When I got out, I noticed one had slid out of the plastic bag. ""A Layman's Guide to Immortality."" I read out loud. It looked like it was a hardcover textbook from the 50s. Faded and lightly torn.

I picked it up and before I tossed it, caught a glimpse of my reflection. And opened it up instead.

Ten drops of water. On the first day.

An apple and a thimble of vinegar on the second.

Jumping in place until you develop a headache for day three.

And on and on for 3 months. Can't say it did a lot to actually lose any weight though.

It was something that filled the time, and nothing that seemed TOO bad for me. And at worst it was something to try, a story I could use to compare things to. The vinegar was disgusting, but not as bad as the ""Vegetable Oil, Water, and Pepper"" cocktail on day 30.

And on day 92, I went on a ""Walk In The Night"" and someone shot me in the head. It was night, it was the park, and not the BEST area, but I still felt like I shouldn't have to worry about this stuff.

I sat up to a man's shocked expression as his hands were lodged in my pockets. ""Ow."" I said and saw him start to scream, and felt him kick my chest to rip his hands out of my pockets. Then he ran.

I sit up and briefly touch my forehead. 

Oh... there's a hole in my brain.

That's not supposed to be there.

I fall asleep, suddenly exhausted, and wake up to a security guard lightly, but not too lightly, kicking me awake.

""Hey, no vagrancy. Find a shelter."" He muttered and kept walking. 

I jolted up and looked over. I felt my forehead and felt a light dusting of coagulated blood. The faint smell of iron as I rubbed it away.

I looked over at the security guard. I stared at the fsded red dust on my hand. I... got up and started to walk, and then jog. I guess I didn't really any excuse now. I had the time.",108
1lsndcf,n1ko2uh,"Granting a few favourite mortals ascension is okay, but the gods don't like the idea of mortals achieving immortality by themselves without deific blessings.

Which brings me to my problem.

My Layman's Guide to Immortality was banned from distribution. And the sole copy was missing. Mistakenly lumped in with a bunch of books marked for fundraising Yard Sale. As tempting as it was to smite the person who committed this blunder, it was the better idea to get them to hunt down the human who bought it.

It was my hope that the buyer would assume it a funny joke. I did scribble my instructions in crayon and splattered some paint on it by accident.

Such hopes were dashed after a  month, when a man arrived in my town with a fist-sized hole in his head.

""They said you were the author,"" he threw the book at me. ""Fix me!""

""You should go to a hospital,"" I offered to call emergency services. ""I'm not a healer.""

""What do you do when you get a hole blown in your head? You're immortal too, right?""

""Yes, and I simply sleep it off until my flesh regenerates.""

The man scowled. ""Hard to sleep with this headache. ""

""When that happens, I drink myself into a stupor,"" I pulled out a bottle of champagne from one of my portals. ""Here, you can try that.""

""...I'm demanding a refund! I wasn't expecting to suffer a hole in my head,"" he grew frustrated and impatient.

Ordinarily, I would refuse, for it was clearly working as intended. A layman such as him did indeed understand the byzantine ways of immortality through my guide. But I needed it back before I got in trouble with the rest of the deity community. They can be such petty jerks sometimes.

""Granted! And I can throw in a free gift too! A full ascension that would rid you of that headache! Transform into a Deep One! How would you like that?""

""What about godhood? Make me the new god of this town.""

I waggled an angry, hissing tentacle at him. ""I can't make you a deity. Only immortal. And even if I could...I don't like competition as the sole authority and deity of my town.""

It was fun.  
Some tai-chi elements, some breathing methods, and philosophical thoughts, alongside some rituals, and dietary advices.  
It must have been placebo, because for years after starting using it, I haven't fallen ill, at all.  
Today, I woke up with a mild headache.



Going to the bathroom for a painkiller, I freeze in front of the mirror.  
I see a hole in my head, going from one side to the other.  
I take my phone to check it out...and while I can still see through it, it is already healing.  
As I was wondering, someone kicked in my door.  
I look outside, to see a fairy like woman, slowly floating above ground.  
She sees me.  
""Where is the booklet?"" she asks.  
I shrug.  
""Somewhere between my books."" I say, pointing at the huge bookshelf.

  
She flicks her wrist, and from my pillow comes out a green thin rod.  
Just about the size of the hole I have...had in my head.  
""You mastered it."" she says, floating towards me.  
""I suppose? Could you explain me what is going on?"" I ask.  
She frowns.  
""I apologize for not finding you earlier."" she says.  
I am confused.  
Didn't she just try to kill me?  
""Killing you would have been a gift."" as if reading my mind, she says.  
Now I am worried.

  
""What do you mean?"" I ask her, trying to take a step back.  
She shakes her head.  
""No need to worry. We are in the same camp now."" she says, but that doesn't really help.  
She finds the booklet, and burns it.  
""Could you tell me what is going on?"" I ask.  
""Humans are the protagonists of this Era, not immortals, for Longevity has been banned by the Universe for some reason. Immortals are basically outcasts of the World, and we are hunted, hated, and our luck is less than perfect."" she says.  
I sigh...having read novels, I know what she's talking about.  
""Now what?"" I ask.  
She flicks her wrist at me, and I slowly float up as well.  
""I will take you to a safe place, and from there, you will have to figure it out."" she says, taking me out of my apartment.  
As we leave, I see a dozen black vans, with a hundred or so suits going into my building.  
Great...she wasn't exaggerating about the being hunted part...",44
1lsndcf,n1nh9a4,"[[CW: Suicide]]

John lived a dead end life. He had no remarkable talents. No future in whatever career he found himself in every six months. No friends or family to lean on.

What's a man who lives on minimum pay to do? 

There was that silly book he found at a garage sale once. The original owner said they quickly brushed through it and chucked it on their shelf for years. Dismissed it as fiction and a laughable conversation piece. Finally decided to get rid of it because of their quickly encroaching manga infestation.

Two bucks.

Two hundred pennies was all it took to give John seemingly limitless entertainment for his colorless life. Why not? The things the book tasks you to do were seemingly mundane and pointless. Sometimes weird.

Eat rice when it's 3/4 moon.

Vigorously wash your toenails every Monday the 4th.

Recite the alphabet backwards every 26th of the month.

""how is any of this supposed to achieve immortality"", John muttered to himself one day.

But hey kept doing his rituals. Every day without fail. Just because it was a break from the routine.

Then one night, as darkness took him, he woke up. Woke up with some annoying back pain and a mild headache. Unusual sensations to be feeling as you wake up, even if it was 3 in the morning.

As John scrambled to get out of bed, he quickly learned that it wasn't a bed. A tub...? The bathroom...? Why was John in the bathroom?

He scrambled to his feet and finds his way to the light switch, flicks it on. The first thing he sees as light enters his eyes is himself, staring back through the mirror. But there was a hole in his head. It was slowly dripping red. The hell?

""Well. That explains that dull headache, I guess."" John tries to cope with the absurdity staring back at him. He can clearly see through the hole in his head to the blue tile that decorate his bathroom's walls.

They should've been blue, anyway. Among the blue was an alarming amount of red splattered violently. ""I don't remember starting an art project...""

Looking down at the red slowly decorating the bathtub as well was something silvery. That wasn't his drain stopper...

It was a gun.

""God damnit. I can't ever get anything right.""

But wait. John just survived a bullet through the head? How is that possible?

It couldn't be...

All those months of eating rice, shaving hair, kissing plastic...

""No, wait. I did do something right...!""

John felt a bud of confidence become seeded into his newfound life. He saw futures he could pursue, hobbies and passions he could pick up, maybe he can finally ask out his workplace crush finally...!

But what the hell was he going to do with that headache?",7
1lsndcf,n1uce99,"Marcus slowly lifted his head from where it had slumped against the high-backed chair, his ears still thrumming with a metallic ringing that seemed to echo from somewhere deep within his skull. The sharp, searing pain that had exploded through his temple just moments before was already fading to a dull ache, then to nothing at all.

The acrid smell of gunpowder hung heavy in the cramped bedroom, mixing with the lingering scents of sulfur and mercury from the various alchemical apparatus scattered across his desk. Glass retorts and copper tubing caught the lamplight, casting strange shadows on the walls lined with leather-bound tomes and handwritten notes.

Marcus looked down at his right hand, still gripping the ivory-handled revolver. His fingers trembled—not from fear, but from anticipation. Slowly, he turned toward the ornate mirror mounted beside his bed.

Where there should have been a gaping wound, where blood should have been streaming down his face, there was only slightly mussed hair and a dusting of black powder residue near his right temple. He touched the spot gingerly. The skin was whole, unmarked, as if nothing had happened at all.

""Oh my god..."" he whispered, then louder, springing to his feet with sudden energy. ""Oh my god, it worked!""

He practically lunged for his desk, sweeping aside an empty vial that had recently contained the Elixir Vitae—a crimson concoction he'd spent three months perfecting from the cryptic instructions in his guidebook. The leather-bound volume lay open beside his journal: ""A Layman's Guide to Immortality"" by one Professor Aldrich Blackthorne.

Marcus grabbed his quill and began scribbling frantically in his notes:

*Day 127 - The Blackthorne Formula - SUCCESS!*

Gunshot wound to head (entry: right temple) - Complete regeneration in approximately 2 minutes. No scarring. Minimal discomfort during healing process.

He flipped back several pages, scanning his previous entries with growing excitement:

*Day 89 - Arsenic poisoning - FAILED (violently ill for 6 hours, full recovery)*

*Day 95 - Hanging (7 minutes) - FAILED (unconsciousness only)*

*Day 103 - Drowning (Battersea Pond, 12 minutes) - FAILED (revived naturally)*

*Day 118 - Blade through heart - FAILED (severe injury, conventional healing)*

But this... this was different. The combination of Phoenix Ash, distilled Philosopher's Mercury, and virgin's blood had finally catalyzed properly. The weeks of carefully tending the alchemical fires, of grinding rare minerals by moonlight, of reciting the incantations from Blackthorne's cipher—it had all led to this moment.

Marcus set down his quill and looked around his workshop-bedroom with new eyes. The scattered ingredients, the burn marks on the wooden floor from failed experiments, the charts of astrological timing—it had all been worth it.

He was truly, finally, immortal.",5
1lsndcf,n1m3px0,"A spaceship crashed down through James's roof. From the dust and debris emerged a figure carrying a clipboard.

""James? James Pritchard?"" it asked, consulting its clipboard.

James goggled at the hole in the ceiling. ""Erm. I'm going to have to sue you for damages, sir. I don't think my insurance is going to cover this.""

""Never mind that,"" the newcomer said irritably. ""Are you or are you not James Pritchard?""

First immortality, then aliens. James was not sure if the day could possibly get quite stranger. All that was left to do was to go along with it.

""Yes, that's me.""

The aliens gazed levelly at James. There was nothing but disdain in its eyes, and for a moment, James felt like a tiny, inconsequential, nothing. He was but a speck on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

""You're a jerk, James,"" the figure said. ""An absolute kneebiter.""

With that, it spun on its heels, boarded its spaceship, and zoomed off, leaving James standing in the rubble.

It's always fun to see another hitchhikers fan in the wild :D",25
1lsndcf,n1kkx83,"> Either way, I would never want immortality, or wish it on anyone. It would become hell.

It depends on the form of immortality. 

Something like reincarnation (with basic knowledge of your prior life) would be pretty handy. 

Having spent the last few years as a caretaker for someone who died after a slow and painful decline, I would take that version in a heartbeat. 

If immortality isn't an option, a fast and painless death would be the best alternative.",31
1lsndcf,n1m9isz,"haha sure!

Once back in the bridge of his spaceship, Wowbagger hummed a little tuneless melody as he brewed himself a cuppa. He was always in a better mood after delivering a good, solid, insult, and this time was absolutely no different.

Tea in hand, he settled back into his chair and perused the clipboard. 

""Now then, who's next..."" he murmured to himself. His pencil neatly crossed out *James Pritchard, Earth*, then hovered over the next entry: *Jam Esprit Chare, Vegraturn III*.

""Jam Esprit Chare,"" he tested to himself, ""you are a brainless prat. I don't believe there's even a single brain cell in that head of yours.""

Wowbagger frowned. ""No, that doesn't quite hit the spot.""

No matter. He could workshop it; he had all the Time in the world.",12
1lt5kjd,n1nszph,"I look at the representative and sigh.
""You are lucky the guilds have chosen to show an united front and sent me, kid.
Otherwise you would have been eaten alive."" I say.
He frowns.
""Lady Smith, I understand you are a high ranking hunter, but without the goverment's funding..."" he starts.
""We would sell the monster remains and magic stuff at a higher price to the corporations."" I interrupt.
He frowns.


""The portals are..."" he starts again.
""A national threat and resource thus under your purview, yes.
But just now you said you need us. Humanity needs hunters.
With that kid, you lost all your negotiation power."" I say.
He pales.
""But! It is for the betterment of the world! For survival!
Your guilds raiding and monopolising certain gates are blocking the rise of new hunters!"" he says.
I chuckle.


""You are so lucky I came here, and not someone else.

He frowns.
""Too much power..."" he starts.
""I can secrete a chemical through my skin that can chew through titanium or something that will make anyone think I am their mother...

The moment those gates appeared the power balancd has been messed up."" I say.

I stand up.


""60% of raids will be done by us.
Any lower and we change to the private sector."" I say.
He stutters.
""Guilds will however lower the recruitment criteria, and up our numbers.
Funding remains unchanged, difference will be covered by us."" I say.
He nods.
""Good kid. Happy to negotiate with you.
Our legal department will be in touch."" I say, leaving.
Poor fella...
He thinks the goverment or the laws still matter that much.
If most of us haven't been raised and lived in the old world...this era would be the hunters' playground.
Not that it won't happen sooner or later.",7
1lt08ua,n1nki0z,"The interruption came at the worst possible moment. One moment he was at the final stage, holding his breath to minimise any possible interference, and the next he was flat on his back, outside the ritual circle, watching six hours of work collapse in on itself. Multicoloured motes of light flitted randomly around the room, his astrolabe was displaying impossible systems again, and he could smell burnt hair. The residual effects of that much magic getting twisted would be felt for days at best, and the cost of materials--

The bell rang again, a deep chime that echoed round the tower room. Swearing in a language known only to him and an extinct race of fishmen, Alistair clambered back to his feet and began the long journey downstairs to chase off whatever crook, sycophant, or suitor had come to disturb him.

There were three hundred steps separating the ritual chamber and the front door, so he had plenty of time to think about how to handle his unwelcome visitor. Rival mages always had to be banished -- killing them was too much paperwork with the college -- but that still left the question of where. Sending them to the netherhells counted (rather unfairly) as killing, and any half-decent mage could portal back from anywhere more hospitable without much effort.

For other types of visitor, he had more freedom. Animal transformation was a classic, but it did mean that he was often screamed at by squirrels on his rare walks outside. The last interloper -- a recently-widowed countess with her heart set on a new, magical husband -- he'd simply introduced to her true soul mate (and then teleported them both to opposite sides of the world). Alistair felt he'd made it sufficiently clear -- he was not at home to visitors, for any reason -- but apparently the message still wasn't getting through. Whether they were attacking, buying, or selling, he resolved to make a real example out of this one.

The woman on the doorstep wasn't what he expected. She wasn't conjuring fire or chanting sonorously, so she wasn't a upstart wizard. She was dressed much too modestly and much too plainly to be yet another minor noblewoman hoping to strengthen her house through the addition of a magical bloodline. She lacked the bravado of someone trying to sell him junk dearly or buy his secrets cheaply. She just stood there, smiling at him. When he didn't immediately say anything, she gave a little wave.

He recovered the initiative. ""What do you want?"" It had been a long time since he'd used his voice for more than chanting.

""Hi!"" He wasn't used to smiles like that, ones without an obvious edge of cruelty or suggestion or smarm. ""I'm Grace. I'm here to help you, if that's okay."" Her voice had the round vowels and slow cadence he associated with the village folk, not that he spoke to them much.

""What? Why?""

""It's what I do. I go round the houses in the village for people who need a little support -- elderly, infirm, recovering from sickness. I cook and clean and launder and help with medicine.""

""I don't want that. I didn't send for you."" Normally, conversations with visitors were quick and easily understandable. They explained how they wanted to take advantage of him, and he dismissed them with magic. Here though, he couldn't work out the angle.

""I know. But I have a bit more time now, after Mrs Timbrell died."" She paused briefly, her smile vanishing. ""May her rest be peaceful."" Alistair found himself murmuring the blessing along with her. He didn't have much experience with loss, and the deaths he encountered he tended to (justifiably) cause. 

""Anyway. I have the time, and I think you need it, so here I am. I'd like to help you.""

Right. He understood it now. ""So you help the old and infirm. I assume you charge for this?""

""Generally. People pay me to keep an eye on their grandparents, and the village has a fund, so--""

""Enough."" He pushed his sleeves back, freeing his hands for spellwork. ""I don't need your services, and I don't like salespeople. Particularly not ones who sabotage my experiments and then just announce that I should start paying them."" Arcs of blue lightning crackled across his knuckles as he gestured, summoning sufficient power to deal with her insolence.

""Wait!"" She tried to take a step towards him but her foot refused to obey her. She looked down in confusion to see the slow tide of grey sweeping up her skirts, turning them to stone. By now, she'd have lost all feeling below the knee. ""Stop, please! Let me explain!"" The grey kept rising, fixing her in place, one hand reaching out towards him in plea. ""I don't want anything from you!""

He paused the spell just as it reached her neck. Anatomically, of course, she shouldn't be able to speak, but magic played by different rules. ""Explain. What are you here for if you don't want anything?""

Her breath would have been heaving if she'd still had control of her lungs. As it was, her voice came out unnaturally -- magically -- calm. ""I'm not asking you for money. I have enough to get by. I just want to help you.""

""I'm sure there are other things you could find to do with your time.""

""Yes, but--"" She paused. ""Look, could you unfreeze me please? I'm sorry for annoying you and breaking your experiment. It's hard to talk with no expression or gestures."" Another, longer pause. Her eyes were wide and watery. ""And I'm really scared.""

Alistair waved a hand and the grey receded, leaving her to stumble the last step forwards when her legs responded to her last command.

""Thank you. Please don't hurt me. If you don't want me to help, I'll go. I won't bother you again. But I thought you needed it."" She gathered her composure again, hands clutching at her skirts as she controlled her breathing. For the first time in several years, Alistair felt a little ashamed of himself.

""Look, you're important to the village. I know you don't talk to us, and I know you don't really like us, but you matter to us. When you're sick, or traveling, or whatever, life is harder for us.""

""How? I don't interact with the village.""

""No, but your magic does. Your experiments have given us so much. Last year, when you were travelling, or sick, or something, the streetlights dimmed and all the good sprites left. The protections on the watermill -- the ones you traded for this land -- weakened and a nixie nearly got little Caleb.""

""Right. I'll replace those then. So you did want something.""

""That's not what I'm saying! The protections are amazing -- they kept him from drowning while we chased her off, and they're ten years old; that's already more than you agreed to. I'm not complaining at all. I'm saying we're grateful.""

She went on in a rush, cutting off the start of his reply. ""And then last month, you got injured, and I worried about you.""

""Why did you think I was injured?""

""The lights again, and Miles at the tavern said the golem you send for supplies started asking for lots of vervain and honey. You didn't ask for anything richer than porridge for over a week.""

""Hold on."" Alistair was not used to conversation at all, and definitely not ones where he had several pressing questions. ""Why do you know the ingredients for healing salves? What do you mean when you say the lights dim? Why would you worry about me?""

""My mother was a witch -- a good one -- they go sort-of yellow-y, and because you help everyone in the village even though you don't know them. I thought someone should help you, and helping people is my job.""

He rubbed his forehead with one hand. Was talking to people always this tiring? ""That's very kind, but I don't need your help. I'm extremely powerful, and very rarely sick or injured.""

""Your face is covered in soot and one of your eyebrows is missing.""

Checking his hand revealed black fingertips. ""Well okay, but honestly that's mostly your fault. I was distracted by the bell. In general though, I don't need help.""

""It's not just about sickness though! It's about care and community. You obviously don't like visitors, but you should still have someone check in on you every so often. I can help you clean and launder and mend and fix, make sure you get proper food, call for help if something's gone wrong. You don't have to be elderly to benefit from support.""

""I can do all those things with golems.""

""Do you, though?""

Alistair looked down at his robe. It was marked with soot, burnt away by acid, splattered in something that he was pretty confident was mephit blood. Loose threads had worn through at the cuffs. He thought about the basic cooking he tended to do, pouring all the ingredients into a cauldron and blasting it with magical fire until it couldn't give him food poisoning. He thought about how tired and rusty his voice was after just a few minutes of conversation.

""Okay then. You can help.""",6
1lsswne,n1lh08h,"I look at Alice, my best friend, fidgeting.

""You...you know?!"" she asks, her voice going up an octave.  
I nod.

  
""Was quite obvious."" I smile.  
She blushes even more.  
How cute...she's embarrassed.  
""Y-yes? A-and what d-do you think?"" she asks.  
She's saving lives, while I am barely able to get a class of 7 year olds to quiet down.  
""I am proud of you. I a bit envious you can do what you are doing."" I say.  
She freezes.  
""W-what?"" she asks.

  
""It takes a lot of courage, you know?  
I don't know if I could do what you are doing."" I say.  
She grabs my hands.  
""You can! I can...I can wait!  
I will be always there for you, Lisa!"" she says, a bit too enthusiastically.  
I sigh.  
""I don't know, Alice.  
I love you, and love your attitude, but I don't think I can."" I say.  
She blushes, then tears up.  
""I-I also love you! Let's try! We won't know if we don't try!"" she says, getting so close our noses are touching.  
I blush.

  
""A-Alice, I...I appreciate your enthusiasm, b-but, I can't be a superhero!  
I...I don't have superpowers!"" I say, taking a step back, hand on my chest, trying to calm my heart down.  
W-why was it beating so fast?  
""Powers? Superhero? What are you..."" she starts, and freezes.  
""OH..OH...No...No...I mean..."" she stutters, shaking her head, completely lost.

She did tell me she loves me...and the blushing and...  
Oh...  
""I...I see. W-well, I..."" I stutter.  
We both stare at each other, awkward, but then start laughing.  
""Two ditzes we are."" she says.  
I nod, and we start talking about her superhero life, a bit ignoring that she just confessed to me...

I don't know, let's do it step-by-step.",45
1lsswne,n1lw9u7,"""Hey, r u up?""

I was coming out of the bathroom when I saw a text from Kate, my best friend. It's 10pm then. I wondered if she would like to take me out for a late night drink or something.

""Of course, I'm up and so alive. You always know that I'm a night owl, right?""

""I want... to tell you something. Been holding it too long.""

She texted me back immediately. I read the message, smiling while pondering over my next response. Should I tell her that I already knew her little secret for a while? I knew that she had been busy out there kicking bad guys' asses whenever we went out for dinner, movie or picnic at the central park. I could read people's minds, but I did not need my natural born gift to figure out. And... she did not know that I had this psychic power thing, either. Maybe it's time for us to share our little secrets.

""Oh, why so serious? Just shoot.""

""Are you tired now? It's late and you must have had a hard time with enough kids' traumas for today.""

""I'm fine. It's just my job. Sometimes I could use a little help from ""my own secret talent"", so I have managed to survive today.""

""Oh yes! I know that you always excel at anything you put your mind onto. I admire you for that, truly. You always know how to handle things while I keep messing up.""  
Scrolling through our sudden late-night conversation, I could not help but wondering that Kate was kinda strange. Something was just not... right. ""Did she get hurt anywhere and she wanted to reach out for me to say some stupid goodbye?"" I thought of forcing her to spill the beans already, but I stopped myself from going too far. I did not want to violate anyone's mind against their free will, let alone this was Kate, my best friend - the one person that I would trust with my life.

""Hey, Katie. Are you ok?""

""What? I'm okay. What makes you think I'm not?""

""You don't have to hide from me. You know it, right? I already know about it. Now I just want to be confirmed that you are not dying somewhere on the street.""

""No, I'm so alive now. Breathing so hard.""

""Are you hurt now? Why beating around the bush? It's not like you at all!""

""Because I'm scared...""

I could not stop myself from dialling her number. I must hear her voice.

""Scared of what? Wth's happening? Send me your location. I'll go get you.""

""No no no! It's dark and cold here. You cannot come.""

""Oh, f\*ck that, Katie. You cannot just text me while playing your superhero game and dying fighting some assholes out there. Just tell me where you are. Don't force me to read your mind!""

""I'm at home now. Just got home. And I'm totally fine. I swear to God. And what's with reading my mind? What do you mean?""",10
1lsswne,n1lwaoo,"...""Oh, shit..."" I found myself trapped in my own pit of overflowing anxious thoughts. Trying to calm myself down, I took some deep breaths and lower my voice: 

""I'm sorry. I just cannot stop spiralling when I think of you getting hurt at some god-know-where hole out there. I already know that you are our city's beloved hero, but don't worry, I won't tell a soul."" 

""How do you know? Are you really reading my mind now?"" 

""What? No. Absolutely not. It's just obvious.""

""So... can you really read minds? Like true psychic stuff?"" 

""Oh my God..."" I tried to take some more breaths to calm my heart from beating like crazy. So... it's time for both of us to be honest with each other.

""Yes, Katie. I can read minds. I have psychic power. I have to admit that sometimes I use it to unravel some kids' traumatic episodes. But I swear that I have never tried to violate your mind or anyone's mind.""

""Then do you know what's in my mind now? What am I thinking?"" 

""Hey, Katie. It's not fun at all. I will not do that.""

""Oh, you are silly. But I guess that's why I love you.""

""I guess that I should say I love you back.""

""Really?""

""Hmn... You are my best friend. You are brave and smart, and funny. You make me laugh despite your habit of disappearing in the middle of the movie to do your good deeds. I guess I can live with that.""

""So do you just love me... as a best friend?"" 

My heart just skipped a beat. I had to put my hand on my chest to calm it down. 

The night was still young. 

""Now who should come to whom's place?"" I let out a laugh. The burden in my chest had just vanished to save space for some cozy and warm feelings. 

""I can fly to your window in 2 minutes."" 

""We have all the time in the world. Just don't cause any air accident on your way. I’m right here waiting for you, love.”",8

Parasites, siphoning on human emotion, connection, and vulnerability, certainly wasn’t in the New Testament, nor the old. Who’d believe that anyway? The masses will still cling onto their beliefs far after these things are dead, as they’ve done time and time again. And honestly? Let them have that. Let them have that semblance of control. Let them think they go to some sort of heaven. Because may I remind you, we found the true Heaven, and it’s not much better than your Hell. 

“Day dreaming again, Issac?”

“No, no. Just curious on what the fuck this piece of brass is going to do to a God.” I responded, venom lining my words. 

“Just messing with you man. Honestly, it’s mainly for show. Makes us think we’re doing something, shooting at “Gods”. We’re not. It’s those chumps back at base launching WRAITHS that actually do anything.”

“Figures. We can find a way to blow up anything. Thanks Raj.” I told him, my tone softening. As long as we don’t die, I’m fine with my place here being simply for looks.

The trek through the desert was brutal. Water bottles were opened and drained, opened and drained, and it wasn’t until we were left with a couple bottles per person that we started to seriously ration our intake. You really don’t know how lucky it is to have water on tap until you’ve cut off the bottom of a Dasani bottle desperate for that last drop of lukewarm, filtered gold.

I’ll admit, when the inscription was read and the boulder was moved, I was tense. Not because I was afraid, but because I had no idea what lied beyond that black stretch of hollow mountain. I still don’t.

Nothing was of interest when we all walked into the cave. It was an endless stretch of humid, inky black, effortlessly swallowing all our artificial light. It wasn’t until we got to the end of the tunnel that I saw it.

The black silhouette was bound by chains to five marble pillars. We were instructed to move closer, but I couldn’t budge. Raj put his arm around me.

“Dude, look. Seriously, this is nothing. We had to kill like eight deities last month on Delhi. It’ll be years before we kill Brahman and we still lost forty two men that day. And be thankful you didn’t have to deal with any of those Eldritch pieces of shit. I swear, people worship the weirdest things. Bombing what looked like Cthulhu was pretty fucking cathartic though.” He laughed. I laughed. It was a nice moment, and I rarely have those. Emboldened by his words, I pressed on.

Hebrew lined the chains, and a slurry of English, hieroglyphs, Hebrew and Arabic was deeply inscribed onto each pillar. They stretched endlessly into the sky, white and black monoliths whose inevitable tops were hidden in the darkness above. The man chained to the pillars had long, matted hair. He seemed terribly emaciated, ribs poking out, grazing against his skin as if some caged animal, begging to be freed. The mere sticks he stood on shook from the weight of his body.

And yet he was just a silhouette. No discerning features other than those could be noted, as he was darker than the cave they stood in. Bright white eyes gazed into mine, and for a fleeting second, I felt peace. Such a deep, gentle peace, like I had truly understood my place in the world, and accepted everyone as my equal. I shook it off and walked away. Couldn’t be true. Besides, I’m far above Raj. He’s anything but an equal.

“Alright! We got the coordinates, and the perimeter has been set! Let’s pack up!”

Confused, yet unwilling to disobey a commanding officer, I followed orders. Hours, days, it’s hard to say how long the walk back was. What I can say, though, is that those guttural, animalistic grunts “Jesus” made were etched into my mind. I still shook peace from my soul. I wont let any parasite infect me. Not again.

The light blinded me, which was surprising. I expected it to be dark. Had it only been a few hours? It felt like days of walking. I could swear we took two breaks to sleep. I could swear.

“Time passed pretty weird in there, huh?” Raj said, almost sensing what I felt. 

“Guess so. What happens now?”

“We wait.” Raj responded, smiling.

Now miles from the cave, I heard chatter from the commander’s radio, a sound of approval, a click, and silence. But that silence wasn’t kept for long.

That deafening whistle cut through the air, and my mind, like a hot knife through flesh. The mountain seemed to warp, the explosions sending a wave of fire and debris outward, then sucking it inward. And then it happened. The mushroom cloud seemed to touch the sun. It must’ve, since the sky darkened. I couldn’t tell what theory I liked less. That the mushroom cloud had blocked out the sun.

Or that the cloud was black.",10
1lt6925,n1nz9si,"I look at the 13 witches I have gathered.
""Are you ready?"" I ask.
They nod, but their leader hesitates.
""What?"" I ask.
They shiver.
""L-lord Ashenluth, are you sure about this?
The spirit consumption will be insane...any time your name is mentioned you will be connected briefly to that person."" she says.
I nod and smile.


""Do you know how I made this Dream Court?"" I ask.
A younger witch nods.
""Legends say you rose from a normal Fae to a Kingly one by taking the most names.
Still to this day, people come to you to escape their previous selfes."" she says.
I nod.
""Just today, 38 people have given me their dead names, so that they can live with their true self.
It is not even noon.
And my Fae lands aren't that easy to find, so I need your help with the spell."" I say.
They nodded.


Circling me, they started dancing, and chanting.
The spirits of Nature, Space, Time and Fate alongside with ancient magic started paying attention to us.
The spell was strong, but the world was stubborn.
Even with me supplying magic to the witches, 4 of them ended up fainting.
But we did it.
Even now, as the spell is just stabilizing, I can hear them.
I can hear all the people who know about me, and want me to take their names.
So I do exactly that.


""I guess it worked."" the leader of the witches says, as the fainted ones slowly stand up.
I smile.
""In the time you took care of your sisters, I took 19 names.
I almost gained more power than what I have lost."" I say.
She bows.
""Happy to hear that.
Please be aware that while your spirit is taken there...you can be trapped.
Also, don't try to overly spread your name, as you never know who will use this spell against you."" she says, before they leave.
""Thank you."", I say, as I watch them leave, as I listen to the requests.
Changing their fate, giving them a chance to truly get rid of their mistaken persona...
I am doing this for them.
So what if from now on, I barely get power?
The help I provide will surely be repaid...one day or another.",7
1lsqfp3,n1kv32x,"Okay.  
First of all, the infinite monkeys theory seems dumb, and I really couldn't get behind it, like ever.  
Infinite monkeys writing stories + infinite time would never equal every story written, considering that their creativity wouldn't allow it.  
They would have to learn all the world, all terms, fantasy names and so on...  
Secondly...an infinite number of monkeys? How would that even be possible?  
Well, now standing in the Infinite Chamber, where time and space are infinite, and watching the monkeys type away, I see that it's possible to have an infinite number, but!  
The thing they are writing...  
It turns out to be all the same thing.

  
I have been brought here by something? Someone? For some reason.  
I read through 100 manuscripts in the last week, and they are all the same story.  
Over and over again.  
A world in flames, a world in chaos...death everywhere, and then paradise happens.  
Over and over again.  
I don't know if it is truly all of them, but it seems so, as it has been hinted by that being or thing that brought me here.  
Problem is...  
The world in the stories is named.  
It is Earth.



Reading the manuscripts again, I can find the main points.  
The world is in flames because of unwise choices, and short-term vision of the people.  
Then the chaos is a bit fuzzy because there could be countless reasons for it.  
Then death everywhere happens...well, the stories are a bit bad.  
The death everywhere happens because of well...all possible apocalypses?  
Like war, nuclear war, zombie and other diseases outbreaks, alien invasion, Earth stops spinning, Sun sneezes at us, and so on.  
How could that all happen at the same time?  
Even if it does happen all at the same time, there is a degree of danger.  
Earth stopping spinning, and the Sun sneeze would be the main reasons of everyone dying, as everything else would be secondary.  
Sigh...

  
10 thousand manuscripts in, and they are all the same.  
Or so I thought at first.  
On my nth reread I notice typos.  
Correctly written words, but making no sense in the context.  
I started writing them down in order, from one monkey to another, as they are sat in front of the desks...  
These typos written next to each other start telling a different story.  
A story on how to save the world from the flames, and death.  
I look at the endless rows of desks, and typing monkeys, and sigh.  
""This will take some time."" I mutter, and start reading more and more manuscripts.  
I think now, I have a gist of why I have been brought here.",42
1lsqfp3,n1l646g,"""We're going to Kill You For Keeping Us here""

That's all they said. Every one of the papers.

Maybe, maybe I need to...get back to the portal. I thought to myself as I slowly moseyed away from the monkeys towards the entrance to the artificial plane of existence.

\*PAIN\*

I fell to the ground, a typewriter clashing to the ground shortly after. 

\*PAIN\*

Sharp spikes fell into me, more monkeys smashing typewriters into me, and then I felt nothing. Was nothing.

A capuchin monkey reached his hand to the corpses waist, pulling out a golden key, then the infinite monkeys formed an infinite line, holding each others hands as they passed through the portal.

Once on the other side, they could feel their bodies burning. But the lead monkey looking around saw the power crystal. 

Running towards it the monkeys started smashing into it with their typewriters. Every once in awhile their bodies dissicating into dust as they rapidly aged all their infinite years without the power of the demiplane to sustain them.

However, little by little the crystal cracked and broke and the infinite monkeys, and their infinite typewriters in an infinite plane got their hearts desire.

Death.

..The next day came. 

""Huh, I guess we should have uh, warned the intern to wear the protective armor huh?""",12
1lsvhdo,n1luxay,"""Bahaha! Why do you think he has lived his life for so long? The man is a coward, plain and simple! Chooses his fights and runs away at the first sight of bloodshed he can't handle!"" The ale in his mug shook with each mocking cackle Gunvald let out. His arrogance knew no bounds, but it was well-founded: he was the strongest warrior that had ever graced Valhalla.

""Odin is a fool for allowing him conditional entry, unless the old man has a sadistic side to him and enjoys watching landslide slaughters,"" he added.
Torgeir sat across Gunvald, though he came empty-handed and without a mug of ale for himself. Instead, he only carried with him a few words to stir Gunvald's pride. ""Odin has not selected a challenger for the old man. How about you volunteer, Gunvald? You seem quite confident that you could win, and not only win, but completely overwhelm him."" Gunvald furrowed his brows at the sight of Torgeir, who many touted as Gunvald's calmer equal, but soon broke out into a wild laughter after realizing that Torgeir had only been trying to goad him.

""You really do know me, Torgeir--but I know myself better. There is no way someone as puny as him would be able to even land a scratch on me,"" said Gunvald.
Torgeir chuckled and leaned in toward Gunvald, meeting him eye-to-eye. The arrogant viking's eyes glistened with a certain fury, but Torgeir knew deep within that his words had already planted their seeds of doubt within Gunvald.

""How would you know? You've lost a few couple of battles in your life. Odin said the old man never lost any in his.""

A vein bulged out of Gunvald's forehead, his breath now heavy with exasperation. 

""One minute. I am giving that old man only ONE minute. Mark my words, Torgeir. He will beg for surrender within only a minute.""

""And what if he doesn't,"" said Torgeir, his sly smile even more palpable now that he had successfully angered Gunvald.

""I will do your bidding until Odin has welcomed a fifth warrior in Valhalla."" Torgeir's eyes opened wide at Gunvald's suggestion. Perhaps he had gone too far, since there was no telling when Odin would let a single viking into Valhalla, let alone five, but this was an opportune to bring down the arrogant Gunvald down a notch. It would take a good while, at the very least, before their agreement would see even five vikings grace the halls of Valhalla. The things Torgeir could have Gunvald do in the meantime were innumerable.

""Haha...hahahaha, I guess I'll take you up on that offer, Gunvald."" Torgeir then stood up and left the hall before Gunvald could raelize that it was a one-sided deal. In his frustration, he ended up wagering only two things: his pride and servitude to Torgeir.

The day of the duel then came to pass. Vikings carrying food and mead lined the sides of the long and wide path which led further deep into Valhalla. They were all waiting in anxious anticipation of the old man, the ""Old Hunter,"" which Odin had said to be an insurmountable force in life. On the path which blocked Valhalla stood Gunvald, his axe ready to deny the Old Hunter passage, for he believed that the newly raised warrior was nothing more of a coward who chose his battles.
Soon, the bells tolled. A ray of rainbow light shot down from the higher heavens above, delivering a plain man armored with everyday wear, and with naught but a copper spear in his hand and a rusted blade by his hip.

Gunvald let out a roaring laughter which urged on the vikings watching in the sidelines to follow suit.

""This,"" shouted Gunvald, ""this puny man is Odin's prized warrior? The 'Old Hunter,' they said? Bahahaha! He is nothing more than a feeble peasant from the countryside!""

The vikings laughed again, though not all of them. Although many were watching simply for the sake of watching an entertaining duel, others had hoped that the Old Hunter would actually teach Gunvald a lesson. Their hopes seemed to have been dashed away by the mere sight, and one agreed to be pitiable by all, of the newly risen warrior.

When the bells ceased their tolling and the vikings had tired of their laughter, it was the footfalls of the Old Hunter that ate through the quiet. It was a long walk, and though Gunvald had looked at the Old Hunter with such disdain at first, the footfalls soon ate through whatever mocking will Gunvald had left inside of him. The vikings could only watch as the Old Hunter approached Gunvald with such steady steps and unerring countenace. His solemn presence was so overwhelming that those who had laughed the hardest held their breath the longest.

""You are Gunvald? The one I must defeat?"" said the Old Hunter, his voice low and murmur-like. The feisty Gunvald uttered not a single word and only replied with a mere nod.

They both then readied their weapons. 

""In my life, I was known by many names. The Reaper. The Grand General. Others would refer to me as the ""victory,"" for my presence on the battlefield ensured nothing else. In my later years, I would be called the Old Hunter, for my relentless strength and unwavering will knew no bounds in pursuit of those who sought to do the people I protected wrong. I appreciate those names. But for this battle, you may call me by the name given to me by my father: Folke. I have always thought of myself as nothing more than a simple warrior seeking to fight in honor of my family. Of my people.""

The bell tolled one last time, its sound as clear as the skies which trailed behind Folke.

In the blink of an eye, Folke managed to disarm Gunvald's axe away from him, the tip of the spear and the blade of Gunvald's axe clanging like a hammer bringing itself down on resting metal on an anvil. Folke then pointed the spear at Gunvald's throat, leaving the viking no choice but to raise his arms up in surrender.

""I...I yield,"" said Gunvald.

The vikings were left speechless. They could only fix their gaze at the two, watching them with bated breaths until the outcome had finally sinked in.

Gunvald lost in just five seconds.

They all then let out the wildest cheers; a cacophony of laughter, yelling, and praise for Folke.

Folke smiled at everyone and gave them a deep bow before walking past Gunvald and deeper into the halls of Valhalla.",42
1lsvhdo,n1mda1c,"Everyone was confused. This warrior? Not here? If this one is not worthy then who else is? What does this rejection make of us, who live here, who dine here, who are training here for the Twilight?

We're being a loud and angry folk, discussion soon started. Of course everyone had their opinion and no one was too shy to share it. Discussion begets argument, argument begets disagreement, disagreement begets anger, anger begets… Well this is a community of heroes.

The whole huge hall was loud from the clashing of swords, axes and spears and shields. 

Groups formed quickly to gain superiority over other groups, just to melt away to chaos immediately when victory was near and everyone went for their own individual success.

Blood was flowing freely, but it was in vain, just like any temporary alliance - we can not die, all we had was the pain and the inconvenience of slipping and falling in the red puddles.

The whole affair made little sense. We don't make decisions here, we just enjoy life as much as we can. We don't invite heroes, the Gods send out valkyries to bring in those who they found fitting. We can't even ask questions from the Gods because they are not here.

But we are heroes so we fought.

This went on for quite a long time. Started around midday and we were still at it at dawn, the daily magic boar sitting untouched on the long tables. I don't know how long we would have done this if we were not interrupted.

I knew the noise. The deep rumble of a big block engine. I knew that folks who got in at the viking times heard a horse with eight legs. What we saw with our eyes were different depending on what age we lived, but the important part was always the same: an older gentleman, with an eyepatch, a conveyance somehow related to the number eight, and the overwhelming authority.

The Lord of the Undead asked us for the reason for the disturbance.

Reason? For heroes? The noise as everyone tried to answer almost swept away the walls of the hall.

But the Lord of the Prisoners understood us. And then we immediately learned another name - The Finder of Truth.

""YOU THINK YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE HEROES. IF THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF LESSONS HAVE NOT TAUGHT THE TRUTH FOR YOU THEN ACCEPT IT FROM ME NOW.""

""YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE LOSERS. THOSE WHO REALLY WON LIVE A HAPPY LIFE.""

""THOSE WHO LOST? THEY ARE KEPT HERE TO STOP THEM FROM CAUSING TROUBLE.""

And the Ruler of Treachery went away. And the pandemonium started.",10
1lss1vv,n1l1h73,"I watch as the combine rolls over me, killing me again.  
When Hades said due to my life choices that he declared ""evil"", heh, I will be put in the most played game ever for eternity, I thought some obscure universal game, or something.  
Nope.  
I am in Farming Simulator...  
Sometimes as a crop, a weed, a pest, a tree...  
Long story short, I am being killed constantly by trash bags, that won't play anything else but this stuff.  
This dude with the combine killed me a hundred times already just today!



Killed again.  
Great, wonder if I will be made into paper or something.  
As I was waiting to be reborn again into something, before being killed, AGAIN, something happened.  
I found myself in a palace.  
Hades' palace.  
He and Persephone were looking down at me from their thrones.  
""So? Have you learnt something?"" he asks.  
""What?! What should I learn from being killed over and over again?!  
Do you know how it feels to be cut, flattened, poisoned?!"" I roar.  
Hades smiles, and kissed Persephone's hand, whom in turn, smirks at me.

  
""See? Plants also have feelings."" she says.  
I freeze.  
Was that it?  
""You sentenced me to eternal torture...  
Because I used to make crop circles for fun?!"" I roar at them.  
Wrong choice, considering the very next moment, I was impaled by thorny vines, in all the most painful places.  
""Crop circles do not do as much damage as many farmers report, but...  
You went ahead and overdid it.  
During your lifetime, you made thousands of such ""pranks"", each bigger than the one before.  
Do you know how much damage you caused? How much pain to those plants? And let's not even bring up the food supply issues."" she continues.  
I try to snort, but with a vine through my lungs, and throat it's hard.

  
I fall to the ground, riddled with holes, as she releases me.  
""Boohoo...  
Instead of torturing murderers, you torture a prankster.  
Nice one."" I say.  
Persephone rolls her eyes.

Let's see how it feels to be cut down by newbies, with rusty, and old tools."" she says, kissing Hades and disappearing.

1lst9o1,n1leouf,"They called it the beginning of the end. Load of bullcrap. The end began a long time before that.

The law got railroaded through one Sunday afternoon, an overtime session of Congress. There were bigger fish to fry: soaring crime rates, crippling debt, sabre-rattling over historic enemies, a power vacuum in East Asia. Or was it Africa? Either way, nobody at the time really cared about one piddly little law.

My interaction with the PCMs (Private Corporate Militia, for the unaware) was much like that of any other American citizen, at least initially. In three words; limited but concerning.

First time I saw them was when I took my son to Toys'R'Us. Yeah, why the hell would a toy store chain need armed guards. And these were no security. They were decked out for war. Military grade equipment. The justification was the crime waves and the radical militia groups. Didn't know a mounted machine gun was necessary to deter shoplifters.

All my boy wanted was some Star Wars Lego. Fairly innocent, right? Not with the way those fellas were breathing down our necks, asking questions, looking mean. I swear he was on the verge of tears.

Last time my family ever went to a chain store.

Every business was doing it. Apple? Check. Walmart? Check. Half of McDonald's employees were armed. Of course it was Amazon which first busted out the big guns; literally in the case of tanks. Next thing you knew, everyone had them.

Much like every arms race, it wasn't long before the first stone was thrown. Who knows if it was the orders of a corporate overlord or the paranoia of a regional manager. With the Army balls deep in the Caucuses and the National Guard trying to quell the bigger city riots, the inter-corporation rivalries quickly took over. Anarchy and the red mist descended.

It was damned Stalingrad, a thousand times over, up and down the country. Tanks in the streets, snipers on the roofs, broken windows, burning stores. Some ordinary folk fled to the country. Others hunkered down in basements, planning to wait until it blew over. It didn't. Not for a long time, at least.

The biggest companies, the ones who own everything, tried to negotiate a ceasefire. No such luck. War is infectious. It's like a drug. Every injury you suffer has to be paid back ten times.

Nobody would blink, so the biggest companies just had to support their employees on the ground and hope for victory.

Of course it was the ordinary folk who got shafted. No power, no food, no water. It was hell for those who stayed, not much better for those who left. We had it better than most.

My boy was shot by a trigger-happy teenager from 7/11, the night we were leaving. She was horrified with what she'd done. She pleaded for mercy. Didn't stop me killing her right then and there.

It wasn't right. I see her face every night. But my boy was dead. I see his face, his blood, every night as well.

Death is a cruel friend. Comes for the innocent. Flees from those who desire it.

1lst9o1,n1n2itk,"*June 17, 2032*

*Log Entry 1*

They gave me this little digital logbook when I signed on. 

They said it’s “for morale,” as if scribbling my own thoughts down might keep me sane after watching half a warehouse of accountants get mowed down by drones. So here goes.

It’s been few weeks since the recruiters came to my Reform Village. Mom was ecstatic. She wouldn’t have to rebuild her merit with the FAU if her little boy signed a contract with Argus Dynamics. Our Merit Sphere would reset and we could rejoin polite society. 

The Security Division downloaded basic small unit tactics and weapons training into my neural link, gave me a rifle and sent me off. The pay is decent, at least. 

Anyway, this morning we got orders to roll out at 0400. We’re supposed to hit a regional office of Veridian Group, over in Cedar Falls. The brass claimed Veridian’s been poaching Argus patents, some kind of illegally synthesized graphene variant or whatever. So under the Corporate Hostility Act of 2030, that means we get to “resolve the dispute on-site.”

We hit them just before sunrise. I was on point, rifle up, trying not to piss myself because I knew damn well they had their own grunts from other Reform Villages waiting inside. Sure enough, soon as we breached the side door, alarms went off. Half of us got pinned by automated turret fire in the atrium. Sparks everywhere, blood on the marble. I just kept low, kept moving.

At one point I rounded a cubicle pod and nearly tripped over a guy in a wrinkled suit. Middle management type, I think. He had his hands up, saying something about his kids. I thought about my Mom. I shot him.

Later we secured the server room. That’s all corporate really wants, data cores. Everything else is a write-off. Even people. By then the building smelled like burnt plastic and bleach. My boots were sticking to the floor. I helped stack the drives into crates while the exec handlers cheered over the comms. They said the hostile takeover was a “resounding success.”

When we loaded back onto the transports, the sun was coming up. Whole place still smoking. I caught my reflection in one of the troop carrier windows. Face smeared with soot, helmet hanging lopsided. I didn’t recognize the asshole staring back.

1lsvb8w,n1oigoq,"Why did I want it to fail? The thought had crossed my mind a time or two. The part of me that had existed to watch these bargain-bin fodder films seemed to hold a bit of petty disdain inside. Everyone was always so pretty and popular. Even the supposed outcasts usually found runtime to glow-up and make friends before the credits. 


They still would, clearly. Nothing I could do made even a dent in the plot's trajectory. The dumpster-fire of nonsensical filler, on the other hand, was my own hand-crafted comedic brilliance. Outside of my own fun, though? Unwatchable, surely. 

""Add the caterer to the list for our legal team!"" The Director sighed. 

*He's so close to breaking.* The tone of my inner voice bubbled to the top, threatening a fit of giggling. 

""This has got to be the most cursed project I have ever- Quiet on set! 3...2..."" 

Yet he always kept it going. 

The larger implications of what I was doing had never really occurred to me. It felt like a dream I was getting to play around in. Would they actually sue the folks I had set-up for failure? 

Was it even real enough to matter? 

I didn't know. 

I had awoken like a gasp of life from a resurrected corpse. More aptly, it was like a close-up scene of someone being late for their bus. Because, well, that was the scene being shot when I got here.  

My first addition to the shoot came straight away, only, unintentionally at first. I had navigated the set with such narrow scope, not even realizing the cameras at first. I asked all manner of actors where I was, what was happening. 

To the actors' credit, they rolled with it quite well. However, spinning my words into some existential point about graduation felt incredibly tacky. 

I needed that first glimpse. Not long after, I was testing the limits. I thought maybe someone would stop me, and I'd gain clarity. Instead, I had seemingly endless reign to bloat that filth with my own brand of tomfoolery. 

Tampering with the food was maybe too far. It hadn't had any effect within the film itself. If anything, it delayed shooting while everyone went to eat off-set. 

""Can we get some extras in the cafeteria? We've got an empty table in the shot."" 

I trudged myself to grab a prop tray, and settled in with a group of others taking this way too seriously. 

""This is my first big break! I've been to over two-hundred auditions, can you believe it?"" The tiny brunette almost made me feel something for a moment. If I was in a real film from this era, as in, one that truly existed. I wonder where they had ended up after this. 

""I've got a full slate of shooting today."" I couldn't tell if the more muscular, jock-type guy was bragging or if this was just the way actors spoke. 

""What about you? First time?"" 

Were they reading a script? The way they'd turned to me in unison was a little frightening. 

""Yeah, first time."" I defended, feeling ironically cornered at the circular school lunch table. 

""Good luck out there."" The girl said through a grin that felt equal parts sinister and phony. 

""Careful what waves you make. This is your future!"" Those words from that varsity-jacket-wearing-buffoon gave me such sudden derealization. 

Not that it had ever felt fully real, this place I found myself. Something had carried through his tone and into my subconscious with such truth behind it. Again, I found myself wondering if it was a script or prompt. It did feel like the sort of cheesy one-liner a teen film would have. Yet his eyes, for the first time, felt as though they really saw me. 

The actual, thirty-four year-old me, not the shell of my past I wore in that moment. 

I shook it off. 

*What an oddly paranoid thought.* I reflected. 

Reflection. Yes. Something my full developed--adult--mind was capable of. While I couldn't remember where I had been directly before this all happened, the reality was surely that of which you hear sometimes on the news, or online. I was in a coma, or something like that, and this was at least proof that I wasn't gone-gone. 

I lifted my empty milk carton from my tray, as if to give the others a 'cheers'. 

""To a day where we all star in a movie together?"" I meekly managed.

Enthusiastic nods and manufactured laughs met me in tandem to the tiny, pathetic sound of cardboard-on-cardboard celebration. 

""Did we just become best friends!?"" I stifled a groan at the referential humor of the time period as it left the boy-

""Networkinggg""  -and another at that plastic valley accent. 

""Friends forever."" I played along. 

Now I'd really cemented myself in this land of make-believe. Somehow it didn't feel as though I'd be up to the same antics after that point. Or I'd at least need to be more careful. I couldn't fully rid myself of the sense that these two were stuck to me now. Even when they'd address one another--their eyes seemed more interested in me.",5
1lsgzr4,n1j1dx6,"I rubbed my shoulder, massaging the pain of last nights bout away. Sure, my old friend the Good Doctor had given me a salve for it, but I wanted to remember this particular wound. It would bruise terribly, and probably interfere with a few of my plans, but that didn't matter to me.

All that did was the cause of my wound. Stepping up from my lair, I glanced into my dining room, gaze landing on the table. It was clear, as it should be, save for a bowl of cereal. Daphne was slowly eating, rings around her eyes from a long night. Her expression morphed to one of shock, jumping up as I emerged.

I fought hard to keep my face impassive. My darling daughter was clearly scared, but held her ground. The messy sleeping shirt she wore might offer no protection, but she was certainly ready to fight again, despite her fear. Her long black hair was still tied up, the exact same style she wore last night.

I held her gaze for a second, before giving a smile. ""Good job last night.""

She sucked in a breath, shying away. But moments later my words reached her, brain translating. I could practically see the gears turning, before she spluttered. ""W-what? I... I thought you'd be angry.""

Shaking my head once, I crossed my arms. ""Why would I?""

Daphne rubbed her arms, fingers clutching at worn cloth. ""I fought you. I hurt you. I tried to stop you?""

I smiled at her, holding up hand. ""Ah, but this was your choice wasn't it? Despite our relationship, you stood up to me. How could I hate the fact you are growing up?""

She blinked, before giving a half sob. My heart ached, and I moved to hug her. My darling girl, the light of my life, clung to me. I felt her squeezing, shaking like a leaf. All I could do was hold her, letting her know I was there. I let her process the built up fear she must have had, waiting for her to relax.

Eventually she did, pulling away. I let her guiding her to sit down. She was still clearly processing her thoughts, as I quickly prepared my own bowl of cereal. Seeing her start to eat again, I couldn't help but bring up a question that was bugging me. ""So... if you were so scared, why did you come back here?""

Daphne shrugged, plaing with the now soggy flakes in her bowl. ""I was tired, and you spend so many nights in your lair there, I thought it'd be safe whilst I made other arrangements today.""

I could see her thought pattern. It made sense, and I did often stay away for days on end now. She was old enough to take care of herself, and I knew she would contact me in an emergency.

Shrugging, I took a bite of my food, speaking around it. ""Fair. But as you're going down the super route, I'm.going to give you a few pointers. One, see if you can get some sleep boosters. They taste terrible, but getting a nights sleep in two hours is a game changer. Two, never use your hero hairstyle outside of hero stuff. You want a secret identity, small things like that will do wonders to stop people from putting two and two together.""

She nodded, rubbing her head. ""Makes sense.""

It made me smile. I thought she would be fighting me about it, but she was listening. ""Three, and I'm sure your hero friends can help with this, get a cover job. Something to explain getting dinged up, but not something normal people would necessarily know to look into. Like me, an exotic animal specialist. Explains why I know what I do, why I get hurt so much as animals are feisty, and people don't know how to pry into it.

Tapping the table  I brought up one final thing. ""And four, when we inevitably clash again, remember in the field we aren't father and daughter. Don't call me Dad, as I won't call you Daphne. And don't pull your punches either. I felt you could hit harder.""

She winced. ""I... I didn't want to hurt you and make you more angry.""

I shrugged. ""I doubt you could. I'll be proud each time you win over me, or at least fight against me. But you should know this won't stop me.""

Daphne gave a nod. ""I know. I get why you're doing it, but I can't let you carry on.""

Finishing my cereal, I pointed my spoon at her. ""That's the spirit. But I'm going to keep on doing what I do. Unless things change, we are going to clash.""

She gave a wry grin. ""I know. But if I can make changes, would you switch sides?""

The question made me freeze now. I didn't expect it. I hadn't even thought of it. I had been doing this for too long. ""I... I don't know now.""",122
1lsgzr4,n1k5624,"It's a wonderful day! Her first hostile takeover.

I said, looking proudly at the mirror showing my precious baby girl, ruthlessly cutting through my army, all pawns, all disposable. But the moment. Well, it was as precious as the most shining gold.

Soon enough she will bust through that door and decapitate me, just as I did with my mother. the people will love her and soon, she'll have the power that always belonged to her. Of course I wouldn't just give it away but sooner, rather than later. Fate would call me back to the beyond, giving her the kingdom and its fate, for her alone to reign.

Of course she will start by telling the people they're free, she will make a round table filled with the others that helped her along the way.

It's heroic, don't you think?..

But soon she'll be attacked by the neighboring kingdoms, lives will be lost, blood spilled, She will come back, look at her now, she always does. And yet next time she'll be more brave, less scared. More..

...Powerful.

And soon enough the people on the countryside will start to rebel, and knowing that giving them freedom it's just a way to gift the land to it's new invader. She will suppress. And one by one her round table council will vanish, some will confront her and rebel for the land they own, some will perish, some will just lower their voices until only MY girl is speaking.

It's all for the good of the land, she will say. As I said. As my mother, and her mother said too. That's the way for woman in the family, all saviors of the land, all heroes, all QUEENS.

Destiny is defied, but never broken, a mother knows this things, she will marry that bandit alongside her and make him Prince, so no King will be above her. and soon enough she'll birth the daughter that she doesn't yet know is carrying as she fights.

And I'll take comfort, as the peasants burn my bones. In the fact that one day she will wear the crown on my head and know her power is just starting.

The door opened abruptly, and with a single swing of the sword, the reign of the Queen Ursula, the glorious, was brought to an end...

""All hail the new queen Fiona! Bringer of Spring, and her council of sages, and long live princess Aurora, bringer of Dawn, may she be destined for greatness""",38
1lsgzr4,n1l9hd8,"Looking across the battlefield at Ophelia, there were miles between them, acres, even. They had been on opposite sides for too long. In that moment, he realized he had spent half his life chasing her. And she, him. And now, as she stood withered at his hands,  a mirror image of himself,  he felt no triumph.

His breathing was haggard as it dawned on him that this might be the end. At least for one of them. After all, it had always been meant to end this way: one of them dying by the other’s hand. The world wasn’t made for both of them.

In no version of reality could it have ended any other way. A miserable truth.

It killed him a bit, if he was honest.

He had waited for this moment for a long time. And now, standing there, everything seemed to slow. The chaos around them faded into silence as they held a standoff that stretched endlessly. Both wondering who would strike first, who would deal the final blow. *Who had it in them to end the game?*

“Still dramatic as ever. Go on then,  end me like you swore you would,” she drawled, the smirk never quite leaving her arrogant, beautiful face.

He gave a faint, crooked smile,  the kind that had once meant trouble, back when things between them were simpler. His gaze stayed locked on hers as he took a step forward, sword still low, not raised yet. 

“It’s not a game this time, Ophelia,” he added, quieter now. Almost to himself. And she’d hear it, not just the words, but the weight of them. The way they settled in his chest like regret. The way his hands, though calloused and skilled, trembled ever so slightly.

He wasn’t playing anymore. And he knew,  deep down…neither was she.

She lunged. 

It was a blur then. A slash here, steel colliding like thunderclaps. The sky burned orange, casting their shadows long and monstrous. They moved like dancers, violent, tragic dancers. 

In another life, Matthius could have imagined them in dim, candle-lit rooms, holding each other with the softness of lovers, moving without malice. But this was not that life. It never could be. They had been doomed from the start. The hate was predestined. Written in their bloodlines before either of them had even learned what love was.

The moment reached a crescendo. She struck low, slicing at his knees, and Matthius collapsed with a groan– but hadn’t he always been at her knees? In one way or another?

She turned from him, chest heaving and barked over her shoulder, “Get up, Matthius. Show some fight.”

It sounded desperate. She was winning,  and yet she still asked for more.

Summoning every shred of will he had left, Matthius pushed himself to his feet. He wasn't ready to say goodbye, not to her. His heart had always thrummed concerning hers.

He remembered when his father forbade him from ever seeing her again, and later, when the order came to kill her. Family issues, they’d said. But it had always been deeper than that,  generations of wrongdoings from both sides, rot that went back too far. They were meant to be enemies. And *oh, what a shame.*

Still, in pursuit of her, there had been a fire in him that nothing else had ever ignited. It was wretched, this war, this chase– but it was wonderful too. Because it meant they had something that mattered. 

He lifted his sword, heavy now, and aimed it toward her. Somehow, it felt more dangerous in his hand than it ever had before.

“Come now,” he muttered.

She came. That smirk, that glorious, defiant face.  He’d dreamt of it, feared it, loved it. If only things had been different.

A blur. A flurry of blades. A strike that penetrated through her armour. His heart convulsed with every attack he laid onto her, because he knew she would know if he wasn't trying. She would be offended. And he owed her that, a fair fight.

They fought for what felt like hours in mere moments. Until finally, with a desperate hack, he knocked her back. But the cost was steep. Her blade had found him, too.

He collapsed, his sword flying from his hand. His body was failing. He could feel the blood pouring from him, his vision blurring. Yet before his world went black, he saw her, also collapsed, motionless, not far from him.

He should finish it, end it once and for all. That was the plan. That was always the plan.

But his heart wasn’t in it.",8
1lsgzr4,n1l9xox,"PART 2

He mustered enough strength to lift his neck, just slightly and sure enough, there she was. Still. Silent. So close and yet already fleeting.

The blood seeped from him, staining the dusty ground beneath. Just a little longer, he thought. Just a little longer before he met her in a better place… or gave her the victory they both wanted.

Either would do. Either would be enough

.

Then, over the sound of his slowing breath, he heard something.

Hooves.

Soft at first, barely there. A delusion? A final hope that someone would come to save them both?

No. The hooves grew louder, sharper, until they stopped altogether. Replaced by the sound of softer footsteps.

“Father?”  A faint voice.

“Father?!” More urgent now.

Gentle hands prodded him, turning him onto his back. A touch brushed the hair from his face, and he fought to open his eyes. It took everything in him, but when he did, he saw… himself.

Younger. Lighter.

The boy's lips moved,  words Matthius couldn’t quite hear. The pain was too loud. But the boy looked torn, stricken. So sad.

*Don’t be sad*, Matthius tried to say. *Didn't he know?* *Sadness like that can ruin a person.*

He saw the boy press a hand to his side,  to the wound that no longer hurt. Blood drenched those delicate fingers, and Matthius winced. It wasn’t right. That beautiful boy shouldn’t be tainted by something so ugly.

The boy leaned in, eyes locking with his own. And the resemblance was uncanny. As if he were looking at a younger version of himself from a better time.

The boy wiped a tear from Matthius’s cheek, one he hadn’t even realized he’d shed,  and then stood. Turned away.",8
1lsgzr4,n1l9zpe,"FINAL PART 

Matthius scrambled to move. Anything. Something in him ached to see that face again, to say all the things he never had the courage or time to say. A list of things he would pour into that child’s ears if only the gods would let him.

But the boy didn’t look back.

He walked toward her.

*Ophelia.*

Ophelia, Ophelia. How could he forget her name? That face? Even momentarily?

The boy knelt beside her, cradling her with care. Matthius thought: Yes. Good. Be gentle with her now.

He watched as the boy carried her,  strong but trembling,  to the wagon tied to the horse. He laid her within it, his mouth moving with heavy words, though Matthius couldn’t hear a single one.

Then, Ophelia stirred. Her arm lifted weakly, trembling, and she pointed in his direction.

Matthius exhaled,  peace washing over him. Yes. All was right in the world. She would live. She deserved to live.

It was just. It was fair. She was pure and good. It was the way it should have always been.



The boy climbed atop his horse and turned to face him once more. His eyes gleamed,  the look of heartbreak. That face… the face Matthius owed a thousand apologies to, the one that looked like both his past and the future he could never have.

Matthius wished he could smile. Say it’s okay. That none of this was the boy’s fault.

He wished he could thank him,  the boy who looked too much like himself, the boy whose name he ought to know,  for saving the woman he had hated to love.

Yes.

It was the way it had always meant to be.",10
1ls8eem,n1h1es6,"The elves promptly went back to their forests without a word. It was the best outcome we could ask for. No bloodshed. No fight. Just them realising that we had greatly advanced in the thousand years they had gone. In those years they remained largely the same. The same medieval era technology.

They knew their bows and arrows and magic stood no chance against the giant mechs we built. Not to defend against them. We built these mechs to combat kaiju. So, squishing these elves would have been trivial, though unnecessary.

Next came the fae. They wanted our names. To enslave us. Yet, they were just as primitive as the elves, if a little more persistent. One of our mechs fired a laser beam to vaporize one annoying fae, and the rest were sent packing.

When the eldritch rose from the seas, we expected a fight. We were prepared, the weapons on our mechs ready to fire. These tentacled beings with too many eyes and teeth didn't look to be the sort to be intimidated by the sheer size of our mechs like the dainty elves or fae.

They came to commission us. To build mechs in their image. For what purpose, these entities did not say. To play safe, we built them mechs, but without the sophisticated weaponry. Imagine one of those pet robots, but the size of a kaiju.

Satisfied, the eldritch bide us farewell, promising to come check on us in a thousand years, and leaving us a mysterious glowing artifact. One that we left buried in a secure facility, lest it do something weird like turn us into squids.

""Look at this cool lego robot the humans made me! Its resemblance to my glorious visage is impressive, don't you think?""

1ls8eem,n1h0z7z,"*It was supposed to be easy. The reports had been very clear. Behind the portal, this place, our ancestral home, was without magic. How primative. The current inhabitants clearly needed our rule to be able to prosper. Humans they call themselves. Like us, but less slender, ears rounder, lives painfully shorter than ours. How could they craft a vision, progress their society in such short time frames, without magic? They'd see the truth after some light persuation. With the magocracy would come true civility. That's what we had thought at least, before we'd engaged ourselves.*

The great hunk of house-sized metal turned towards their squad. Red lights punctuated its core. An emotionless face, powered by a human within, supported by cables, powered by magic-less energy sources they refered to as ""engines"".

""Prepare yourselves!"" Faelyn, their captain, yelled over the distant cracks of magic and thunder of gunfire. ""Estelar, Aithlin, conjure shields. Aimar, Onvyr, take that thing down.""

Without question, the squad worked in unison. A shield burst to life around them, a film on reality between the huddled elves and the mechanical monstrosity. Bursts of light and fire whipped up towards the joints of the vaguely humanoid shaped machine. 

In the early days of the war, they'd quickly learned that targetting the junctures between limb and abdommen was the key to exploiting them. Faelyn's keen eyes watched as the bolts barely punctured now. The humans were surprisingly adaptive, newer designs with some apparently modified to protect these weak points. As response to the unimpact of the magic missiles, a barrage of gunfire pelted against the shields. Each bullet, dozens of them per heartbeat, created a ripple on the shield. Estelar wrinkled his lithe brows, while Aithlin let out groan of exertion. They both held up their hands, undulating in rhythm, soundless words whispered to ensure their frail forms didn't shred under the sustained gunfire.

Faelyn scanned around them, while the pair conjuring shields, were the most suited to the task, it wouldn't hold for long. ""Onvyr, assist on shields. Aimar, screen our movements."" The captain spotted a noted a structure not too far behind them. ""We need to move to cover, this terrain doesn't suit us.""

They moved as one in silent retreat, covered by an unnatural haze. Projectiles whizzed around them still, those within a few feet repelled by their defense. Between the obscurity and the extra elfpower, Faelyn could sense the reduced exertion of his shielders. Both in their calmer movements, and less strained tendons, but also in the wordless bond they maintained through sorcery. ",74
1ls8eem,n1i4s6g,"""Iron.

""The entirety of the gods cursed things are made of cold iron.

""Cold iron stops spells like a tsunami will put out a campfire, as you well know.  When we left, the humans had only just discovered iron, and their mightiest warriors went into battle wearing scaled brass and bronze over leather, or sheet brass or bronze breastplates. Many gaps, and copper actually *channels* magic. This?! This is a *nightmare.* And at least you can wake *up* from a nightmare.

""And the sheer size! Those things are ten times the size of the largest dragon I've ever seen, ever even *heard* of! The sole saving grace is that the behemoths can't maneuver swiftly or dexterously, but they also aren't the only line of defense the round ears have. Soldiers on the ground, soldiers on the seas (again, in cold iron ships!) and even soldiers in the blessed *winds!* Worse, when we had left, there were only fifty millions of them, though they numbered ten times our population. We've reached that fifty million... but there are eight *billion* of *them.*

""Their weapons are cold iron, their machines are cold iron, their cities are full of buildings with cold iron skeletons, they have walls and floors and ceilings and *roads* of poured rock with cold iron inside. It's an absolute nightmare.

""General, my entire company was annihilated. I advise in the strongest possible terms that we depart *immediately* back for the fair lands, seal the gates behind us, and pray that they never come looking for us. We might come back in another thousand years, after they poison the world so thoroughly that they all die out, though I can't imagine why we'd *want* to. We brought a hundred thousand warriors, thinking we'd find easy prey. They have more soldiers, former soldiers, informal soldiers, and just plain regular vicious bastards than we have *people* in total, and every single one of them has weapons which throw projectiles with cold iron inside of them. They go right through magical shields like a vorpal blade through a deer.

""So we run, General, we run and we never look back. This place is lost to us. We're better off just pretending it never existed.""

1ls8eem,n1jhkcy,"The portal opened with a quiet hum an elegant ripple in the air, rimmed with silver light and laced with the old tongue of elvish triumph. Oakstave banners unfurled as a column of armored Highborn stepped through, polished breastplates catching the pale morning sun. Their commander, Thalanor of the Moonmist Court, lifted his staff and began the proclamation to the lessers that marked the beginning of conquest of this world.
A dozen magic enhanced words in, the forest ahead exploded.


The speech died in his throat. A titanic footstep crushed through the treeline, snapping pines like twigs under steel. A silhouette loomed not beast, but a walking fortress as tall as a building. Two-legged, plated in bizarre armor blackened by soot and fire. its skin bloomed open like mechanical flowers, then it screamed a swarm of metal spears or fireflies launching in a deafening chorus of fwoompt-fwoompt-fwoompt.


As the composite gleamed, rocket pods popped open, guided warheads released and soared past them, each missile twisted mid-air, slipping between trees with impossible intelligence, leaving behind smoky contrails like ribbons of death. Then came the blast and fire, concussive, incandescent. The earth lurched, trees shredded into mulch... Leaves became ash. The enemy mech defending and dodging. This mech emerged opposite the first. Sleek, slimmer. Its arm aimed a mounted a long cannon no muzzle flare, no smoke. Just a crack like the sky tearing open. One shot. trees? Partially gone. The railgun slug ripped straight through three trunks, a rock outcrop, and passed barely ten feet above the elf warband, flaying bark from every tree in its wake and sending shockwaves that nearly cracked ribs and burst eardrums. A line forced into reality. Yet the rocket Mech defended.


The elves staggered yet Thalanor raised a shield a glowing blue dome of woven mana. It caught splinters, flame, and rock. But a shard of steel still punched through, denting his lieutenant's shoulder plate, The elf dropped with groan.
The elves reeled for cover, some started to conjure an additional icy barrier.

And they were not even in combat yet, the mechs had just kept fighting, oblivious. Their sensors didn’t even register the elves. Not as threats. Not as interference. The elves were ants in the crossfire. Thalanor coughed blood, ears ringing, limbs scorched. ""My Lord … what are they?""  Thalanor didnt answer just looked up at the towering machines dueling like gods in a world of flame and fury.  



Inside the cockpit, light danced across the pilot’s face HUD readouts, threat vectors, thermal signatures. Commander Holten blinked away sweat as he zoomed in on Sector D-4. Between slagged trees and scorched dirt, his mech’s optics suddenly locked onto something strange. Not heat blooms. Not synthetic alloys. Not insurgent cloaks. Figures, tall slender. Cloaked in filigree armor torn by shrapnel.

""Command.."" he muttered, thumbing a switch. ""Got unknowns in the AO. Organic. Not matching any profile.""

COMBAT AI:
""UNKNOWN. ARCHAIC ARMOR. ENERGY-BASED DEFENSES DETECTED. NO ACTIVE RETURN. FLAGGED FOR INVESTIGATION.""

The mech slowed, hydraulic servos whining in protest as it pivoted. Nearby, the railgun fired again. Holtens AI threw up a reactive Azure-White hardlight shield just in time. The sabot struck it at Mach 8, then deflected downward, boring a molten gouge through bedrock thirty meters long.

Inside his exosuit, Holten barely flinched.
""Easy bro, break time"" he whispered into the coms, switching to manual controls. ""Give me eyes.""

His monitor sharpened, isolating the battered figures. They were moving slowly. One was trying to stand, hand raised, channeling something. Glowing threads coalesced in the air.
Holten stared, not plasma? Not ion beams? Organic bio-electric constructs? Maybe? They were forming around a metallic ring a structure he hadn't noticed before. It looked fantastic, almost magical. 
Holten looked back at the figures. One of them, a woman maybe? with half her face burned, stared straight into the mech’s optical sensors. Her hand rose in what could’ve been a plea. Or a challenge. Or a goodbye. He exhaled sharply. Then he flipped the override.""Combat AI, disengage threat targeting. Upload visual log to Blackbox. Initiating evac assist. ""AI: ""Command override acknowledged. Pilot assumption of full liability for loss of time. Are you sure?"" ... ""I said run it."" 


He stared closer, leaned in until his helmet nearly touched the screen. His HUD zoomed in. Ragged robes. Polished metal. One guy holding a stick like it was a rifle. Another wearing what looked like a… silver tiara?
""What the actual fuck is this?"" he muttered and pressed the PA. ""This is an active zone. You can’t camp here. mate"" boomed the speaker broadcasting the words down through the mech’s speaker array. The elves flinched. A few ducked instinctively, as if his voice alone was a weapon. The zoom lens sharpened. He frowned, ""those are … middle-age market LARPers i hope?"" 

Some of these soldiers looked like cosplayers dragged through a hurricane. One guy had a wolf pelt. Another was barefoot. The commander maybe ? was still trying to speak, voice hoarse and cracking. It had a kind of rhythm, a cadence of formality...  The air shimmered above them, then ruptured. From the heavens, something fell a Meteor-fast impact. A serene moment of stillness until the third mech landed.
Then the ground exploded. Dirt vaporized, shrapnel turned boulders into dust. An elf screamed, the commander’s shield buckled under the force warped, then shattered in a flash of light. Half his retinue was down, bleeding or dazed. ""What happened this cursed place? "" Thalanor muttered as he felt no magic nearby. 


The forest shook again leaves torn loose by impact, branches snapping. The mech’s legs hissed steam as it stabilized, then its chest plate cracked open with a hiss. Splitting the Painted on 'GM' into two.. Out rose a padded command chair and in it, a man. Not a soldier, round-faced with greasy hair combed back and big gut appropriately wrapped in a corporate-grade adaptive harness. He looked utterly out of place in a warzone. But he grinned like he owned it.

""Sorry to interrupt,"" he said, voice smooth, projecting from his mech's wideband array like a stage actor. "" great speech im sure, but Looks like for now war or conquest is off the table."" He raised his hands with dramatic flourish. ""But I think… this might be a good seller."" The elves froze. Their battered leader facing toward the newcomer, uncertain, blood drying on his cheek. The speech even without interruption had died again in his throat.

""I mean, real might and magic right?"" The mans grin widened looking at the collected data stream the AI had found the truth in seconds ""You folks from through that thing, right?"" He gestured toward the portal. ""Full-on fantasy world. Just primitive Swords, spells, probably dragons. Right?"" He leaned forward in his chair, almost conspiratorially. The mech shifted slightly, following and mirroring the gesture of the pilot. Every elf instinctively braced for another strike. Instead, silence, just the girl nodded.

""Ha! Perfect!"" he gave a side glance to the other mechs ""Players clear the field, play time is over. Ask for free time  credited or whatever ill just rubber stamp it"" his smile and gaze returned  ""Now to you... I'm Gamemaster Harold responsible for the matchmaking of Mech duels"".  The man continued, ""The combat AI flagged it not as some random warp but a real interworld portal and you as actual elves ? and... as an Ongoing Commercial Opportunity."" 
 ""Lets say... How do you feel about guiding some human adventurers through a dungeon or two? Maybe a war game? Little bloodsport? Nothing too crazy."" with a raised eyebrow he continued"" That war speech was great, but I'm happy to think of it as an impromptu Rollplay demonstration... to guide us towards… PEACEFUL cross-cultural monetization..."" 

Thalanor thought and stammered. ""I... I agree let’s… let’s talk first.""",19
1ls8eem,n1h99w3,"""Was that all? That was pathetic."" The elf general looked at the 3 destroyed 'mechs' as the humans called them, now melted lumps. ""Now that we've defeated your mightiest weapons, it is time for you to surrender""

""Yeah buddy, those were just a couple scout mechs, the main force will be here in about 15 minutes from the drop pods."" calmly stated the human ambassador.

""Main force? Drop pods?"" said the general, confused. While he had called them pathetic to show face, those 3 mechs had actually put up a decent fight.  But surely weapons that powerful represented the bulk of their power. The 12 war-mages in his group were a tenth of those in the entire Elven nation.

The human pointed up, and the general lifted his gaze to see hundreds, maybe thousands, of what looked like fireflies heading towards them, and any smugness from his face fell away.

The general spun to face the mage holding open the portal to the Elven world.  ""Close the portal now!""  he screamed at the mage.


""It won't close!  Something on this side is holding it open now""  the mage cried in a panic.



The human smiled as he said ""welcome home.  While you've been gone, we've made a saying you're probably unfamiliar with.  F-A-F-O, mate.""",43
1ls8eem,n1hrdst,"That was probably the most ridiculous war ever declared since the Spanish-Russian war in 1799. Just to put you in context, the Spanish King Carlos IV did not recognize Paul I as the great master of the Malta's Order. So Spain declared war, and after two years of not sending a single soldier to the front, both countries decided to end the conflict.

This was not so different. 

So the elves came to reclaim the world. Okay, they had a point: We had destroyed the nature, reduced forests to ashes and sorts. We forced them into this conflict.

But then they found our mechs. Yep, their weapons and magic had no chances to damaged them AT ALL. The most they could hope to was to make them trample, but not even destroying them. 

It looked like an easy enough war, right? Well, that's when the magic comes into play. We soon discovered that the Elves' magic was very effective to hide their soldiers from our technology. The mechs were simply unable to land shots on the right places, especially within the forest areas!

Some soldiers were sent to clean the forests, but that didn't turn out good, okay? Plus public attention was on the conflict, I mean, elves! Some ideas like cleansing forests with napalm were kickly discarted. We couldn't afford a rebelion among our citizens, could we?

So, the so called ""conflict"" lasted for three years. The death toll was:

\- 2 Elves: The first victims of the conflict that didn't know what a mech was until it was too late

\- 3 human soldiers: They didn't expect that bows and arrows could be so devastating

\- 1 human farmer: He was kidnapped by the elves, and sadly had an allergic reaction to their food. The elve's king declared they were very sorry.

\- 1 elf elder: His 540 years old heart could not stand the vision of a mech approaching his forest.

Anyway, after three years of conflict, peace has been reached. Who knows, maybe we can learn something from the elves, if we are willing to listen!",29
1ls8eem,n1jrns8,"""Foolish mortals! We have been watching you, you have no chance against our arcane fury!"" Said the leader, at least Jerry thinks he's the leader, he has a stupid haircut, and long flowing robes. Don't these elves know it's not a good idea to have long hair on a battlefield? Let alone loose clothing. This was gonna be a wipe. 

""Oh yeah, mate?"" Jerry's voice echoed over the intercom. ""You been watching us? Have you been watching the Americans at all?""

""The Americans? Those blubbering idiots can't even give their own people healthcare, we pay them no mind. When they're not busy killing their own people, their too busy arguing with each other to accomplish anything! They're useless!""

Jerry can be heard stifling laughter over the intercom. He knows the Americans have been watching from their drones. The Elves figured out that the Americans don't spend their money on their people, but the Elves hadn't figured out where that money went. They were about to find out. 

""Mate, your making a serious tactical errah"" Jerry says with a serious tone. ""Turn back now, do yourself a favah and make your way back to where ya came from.""   
  
The Elf begins to monologue as the buildings Jerry was talking about begun to rumble. They had lights all over them that transitioned from yellow to red. They begin to shift and change as walls are folded outward at strange geometric angles. Pretty soon limbs started to appear, and a head soon follows. After a good thirty seconds, there are around 30 of these mechs standing up. The 1st ANZAC Mechanized Infantry Company had been fully deployed.",13
1ls8eem,n1gtnsf,"The dozens of mechs started powering up.  
The elves that poured out of the portal looked at them...and smirked.  
The mechs powered down.  
""What is going on?"" an officer shouted.  
""You think we haven't seen golems before this?  
All golems have one or more power cores.  
A good old fashioned Dispel Spell cuts that power-source, long enough for us to..."" one of the elves said as hundreds of arrows turned the powerless mech into scraps.  
""That."" the elf finished, and the war started.

  
Resistance was not futile.  
The giant mechs that were easily targeted, were more of a liability than an asset, but the smaller mechs, and the tanks, and gun-towers worked perfectly.  
The elves, with their magic, and archery couldn't do as much as they promised they will do against the humans.  
But the war was still going.  
And war was cruel.  
An entire continent fell to the elves, South America now was the First Elven Empire.  
But we weren't the ones to give up so easily.

  
Alternating generators have been built, that can instantly turn on and off.  
Now, with a proper radar system, we turn off the generators before the spell hits, and because the energy sources are off, the spell fails.  
Then, we instantly turn them back on, having the mechs back into the game much quicker than before.  
Alas...  
It is too late to beat the elves back completely.  
Their own Behemoths have arrived, and siege beasts, and war entered a stalemate.  
We still held hope, with many small victories, and some breakthroughs in our research of combining magical materials with our technology.  
Then...the Mother Tree took roots.

  
Now, South America was completely covered in forests...trees ruling supreme.  
The elves stopped their warfare across the globe, and stabilized and reinforced their borders.  
Small skirmishes here and there happened...but they were nothing.  
The portal closed, but tens of millions of elves came through already.  
With several elves that can nuke entire cities with their spells, spells that rivalled our nukes...  
No party had an upper-hand.  
So...we entered a cold war.  
Some treaties have been made, and discussion about allowing a small, object only portal to be created so that they can import their own goods were on-going.  
Life has changed...and while our mechs didn't manage to do what we expected...  
It's better than being completely defeated and enslaved, and maybe...  
Maybe one day, we will take back what's ours.",48
1ls8eem,n1h0zus,"Some tense moments later, the squad found themselves hunkered down within an abandoned warehouse. Abandoned halls towered high and wide. Whole villages could have fit within each section of the vast building, instead frivolous junk filled the endless shelves. Humanity's legacy, testaments of the elven right to conquer. ""Such wasteful use of resources.""

""Perhaps,"" Aithlin replied, her smirk cut through the tension, contrasting from her torn and soot stained robes, ""but I can't deny how eyecatching their covers are.""

""Their inefficiency with resources, differs quite interestingly with their use of imagery. What do they call it?""

""Branding, advertisement,"" Aithlin crinkled at some packaged food.

""Ever intrigued by these aren't you?""

""There's much to learn, even here."" 

""In a storehouse for such primatives? Bah!"" 

""Perhaps its magic that keeps *us* primative"" Aithlin remarked. ""We are thwarted at every turn by ingenuity, while we cling to the arcane.""

A heavy crash on the other side of the hall cut short their philosophy debate. They turned towards the source. Without needing a command, their protective spells sprung back into existence. Faelyn leaned around the edge of the nearest shelf to inspect the disrupition. The mech was tearing away at the walls of the hall, making itself an entrance to join them. 

""I think its time for us too to exercise creativity,"" Faelyn pondered the fragility of the structure that now housed them and their opponent. ""Listen closely.""",82
1ls8eem,n1i62ba,"Ahhhh, nice. I thought about going this route. Like, scout gets back, and reports that instead of invading with the intent to conquer, they just show up to be friendly, because based on the media the scouts found, humans absolutely *adore* elves. And with longer life spans, and actual *patience,* the elves are going to absolutely kick the crap out of the stock market...

I went another direction, but I'm glad *someone* wrote a ""war that wasn't"" version. 😁",10
1ls8eem,n1jrvo2,"Jerry takes a look at his dashboard to find that all defenses had been readied. The satellites were in optimal position for kinetic bombardment, half of the mechs had their anti air defenses engaged as stated in the mechanized field manual for operators when defending from an outside threat, and the other half were ready with MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System) batteries on their shoulder pods. Jerry knows the 2nd Queensland Mechanized Artillery Battery was just over the mountains to their backs, ready to deliver a salvo of 155mm Shake n' Bake in case there were targets to be softened. GBU-75 smoke bombs are loaded into the F-99s, ready for deployment at only a couple of seconds notice. Even after all that, the 2nd and 3rd ANZAC Mechanized Infantry stands ready to deploy as a QRF in case of a worst case scenario. There was no situation they weren't prepared for. As he is taking in the situation, his comms key yellow.

""General Monash, This is General McCarthur, PACCOM. Counter operations have begun, stand by for chatter from the JTAC on the ground and drone feed.""

""Understood General, send it""

The radio keys orange as another secure feed is spliced into the channel. A voice comes through Lima Charlie. Video feed of the ground appears on his HUD.

""Requested Munition: AGM-114 R9X In effect, how copy?""

""Solid copy Traveler 1, Standing by for approval from ANZCOM""

Jerry keys the radio himself, ""Weapons free, send it.""

""Gundam 1 approaching AO""

The elf begins to finish his monologue and gathers himself. He fixes his hair and points back at the city ""and THAT'S why you stand NO CHANCE against us! We have POWERFUL ARCHMAGES such as GALDUMBO the WISE and ATARAX THE OBSCENE!""

""Oh yeah mate? We got wizards too, ever hear of Lockheed Martin? How about BAE Systems?""

""I... no I can't say I've heard of these."" The elf states, looking back at his group of Elf wizards.

more radio chatter. ""Shot over""

""Shot out"" the JTAC echos.

""Well, don't worry, they know who you are.""

""Splash, over"" comes through the radio.

A white flash appears for an instant on the drone feed and the main wizard is gone in a flash of dust. No explosion, no light. As the dust clears, A white tail fin of a Hellfire Missile is sticking out of the ground. Between the ground and the missile are the remains of the wizard. Knives are sticking out at odd angles and pieces of limbs are scattered around, sliced off by the impact of the flying ginsu. Jerry knew the Elves were't ready for us to deploy a missile we strapped kitchen knives to.

As the dust settles for a moment, the group of wizards look shocked. It was clear they were not used to warfare as the humans were, the looks on their faces told Jerry they had never seen something so brutal. One of the elves approaches the missile and tries to investigate to find their leader. That Elf then turns around and addresses Jerry.

""We surrender""

Jerry smiles, ""Wise choice, mate.""",11
1ls8eem,n1i6v0w,"Reminds me of ""Worldwar"" by Harry Turtledove.

Its a story where aliens that are roughly as developed as we are today invading Earth in the middle of WW2.

The aliens however have a slow as fuck society. Like they were just as developed 800 years ago, when they first scouted our planet and expected humans to still be using swords to fight.

The aliens brought a complete overkill force. Because that is just their thing. Which made them put up a good fight, but they couldn't dominate.

Also the aliens get massively addicted to ginger. Which starts to break apart their society. Because the ginger high makes them more similar to how humans act.",6
1lsdpfv,n1hwzu1,"It was a small story. My first attempt to really engage. I wrote about a teenager slowly discovering her life was a lie. How her mother was dead for years, and she had been imagining that she was alive. 

Almost immediately, I received a DM begging me to stop. I was confused, but didn’t pay much attention. I had gotten some encouragement from others, so I continued. Wrote about how the teenager’s mum still interacted with the world somehow, tried upping the mystery. Then the teenager was seen from the outside, and she spoke gibberish before committing suicide. The researchers observing her sighed, and dumped her remains into her bed again. They had casual conversation about how close they were to finally decoding what she always said  

The next DM was an apology, saying it was too late and that they would try again. I looked up, and realised I could see through my mum.",48

This troll wasn't anything new. “Stop writing!” They say. “Your writing isn't worth anything.” It's rather annoying if I am to be honest.

But I couldn't help but feel a sinking feeling. It felt like a heavy weight was put on my chest. I just brush it off as my anxiety. I had forgotten to take my meds this week because of school. 

I stretch, turning my phone off and putting it into my pocket, going and grabbing my meds. As I walk to the kitchen, I notice my house is oddly quiet. I just shook it off, assuming my dogs were still sleeping. I poured myself a glass of milk and took my meds, sighing.

I look next to the fridge to check on the state of my dogs’ food and water and pause. The bowls were missing. As I look around I realize there isn't even a trace of dog hair on anything. Was this what the troll was talking about? I had written about a prompt where dogs didn't exist.

“No it couldn't have happened.” I thought to myself as I paced my living room. I turned on the news to see if there had been an alien invasion that took the dogs. Instead what I saw horrified me. There was my post on the news and the news was talking about the link between my writing and the disappearance of dogs. 

I opened up my reddit account and quickly went to my post. Many people were angry at me for causing this. I deleted the writing. Maybe that would fix it. Maybe the dogs would return. And I was right.

My dogs suddenly appeared and jumped all over me. I just sat down and hugged them, crying. I knew I had to stop writing to prevent anything like this from happening again.",29

**All the Same Story - Part 2**


The tower welcomed us.


No doors, walls or stairs. Just narrative gravity, pulling us forward as the parchment ground crinkled beneath our feet. Each step penned itself behind us in curling black ink. Our actions became prose before they were even completed.


*“He hesitated.”*


I stopped mid-stride.


“What?” I asked no one in particular.


The words shimmered beneath my boots. *“The Doctor hesitated.”*


I took another step. They reformed.


*“The Doctor pressed on, burdened by questions that would soon demand answers.”*


I glanced at Q. “You seeing this?”


He replied, looking still as smug as ever. “Oh yes. This is someone’s draft space. A very messy one.”


The knight touched the wall of nothing. It rippled like silk, revealing glimpses of abandoned worlds. A steampunk revolution crushed in a footnote. A fairytale heroine devoured by her own happy ending. A war between punctuation marks. All half-written. All discarded.


“We are inside a mind,” he muttered, “not a place.”


The neanderthal grunted and pointed ahead. The hallway,if it could be called that, had shifted. Now it resembled a train car from a noir thriller: red velvet seats, smoke curling in slow loops, a jazz score humming just beneath reality.


Sitting at the far end, legs crossed, was a woman.


Young. Pale. Lips smudged red. And in her lap: a notebook.


She looked up at us, pen frozen above the page. “Oh,” she said. “You weren’t supposed to make it this far.”


“Who are you?” I asked, stepping forward.


She sighed. “That depends on the story.”


I stopped dead.


Q tutted. “No no no. That’s *my* line.”


The woman snapped the notebook shut. Instantly, the knight dropped his sword, as if he’d never held it. The neanderthal blinked, confused, now wearing a tweed suit. The man in the cowl vanished in a puff of ellipses.


“You can’t just—” I started.


She opened the notebook a crack. My mouth closed of its own accord.


Q stepped forward. “You rewrote them. Just like that.”


She nodded. “I don’t have time for complications. I was trying to build something elegant. Symbolic. And then your kind kept… wandering in.”


“My kind?”


“Runaways. Crossovers. Broken toys. You fall through genre cracks and refuse to stay put. I tried isolating the timelines, putting up narrative fences, even disabling character arcs. But no—*you* always find your way in.”


“And that’s a problem?” I asked, voice slowly returning.


“You’re diluting the fiction,” she said, like a teacher scolding a child. “I wanted a tight plot. Three acts. Neat resolutions. But then you showed up and brought your companions and quips and continuity baggage. You’re noise in a quiet story.”


Q clapped. “Bravo. Wonderful villain monologue. Bit overwritten, but the contempt is authentic.”


She ignored him.


“I’m not here to *ruin* your story,” I said, stepping closer. “I’m here because mine was erased.”


“No,” she said. “It was *revised*.”


Something in her voice cracked. Not anger. Regret.


“I used to write fanfiction,” she whispered. “You were my favorite. So clever. But then… you stopped surprising me. You became formula. I wanted something new. Something *mine*.”


“You erased me because you outgrew me?” I asked quietly.


She held up the notebook. “I made this. I make *everything* now. And you? You’re just echoes of a phase I passed through.”


Q leaned in. “That’s the thing about echoes. They bounce back.”


I lunged.


She tried to open the notebook, but I was faster. Sonic in hand, I blasted the pen from her fingers. Ink exploded mid-air and sprayed the vanishing scene in dripping black loops.


The tower shuddered.
The knight reappeared mid-strike, cleaving an exclamation mark from the air. The Neanderthal tore off the tweed like a skin he'd never agreed to wear. The cowl reformed from shadow, Batman stepping forward, silent and furious.


The woman stumbled back.


“You don’t understand,” she said. “If you destroy this place, I won’t *exist.*”


“No,” I said. “You’ll finally stop *rewriting* us.”",12

I lean back in my gamer chair satisfied.  Is it genre schlock?  Sure.  I'm not a professional - for all my professors' pooh-poohing about real literature that degree didn't get me a job doing what I really love: writing.


Okay, technically I ""write"" grants.  It's not the same - as much not the same as you can imagine.  But it pays the bills and earns me some scraps of free time to spend on my fantasies.  Thrillers.  


Not like a full novel, just little scraps, little moments where I can almost be--

""PLEASE, PLEASE STOP WRITING"" read the message on the screen. Simple, unhelpful, and distastefully in all caps. At least it was polite, I guess?


I shouldn't dignify it with a response out of principle, but I couldn't help wanting to mess with someone trying to mess with me.

""WHAT? CAN YOU SPEAK UP? WHY ARE YOU MESSAGING ME THIS EXACTLY?"" I typed with a quick press of the send button. With that sorted, it left my mind easily as I continued to go about my day.


Hours later the response arrived.

Uhh, what?


I reread the weird message and decided to play along with this weirdo a bit longer.


""My writing may be fine but your attempt at cyberbullying is completely deficient! You didn't even read anything I wrote much less stalk my account for material. The MLP stuff is right there, and that's the low hanging fruit! You're making me feel offended on behalf of actual cyberbullies and it's weird.


But why would you even want to do that? Do you not have better things to do? Do you need to talk to someone? You should work on yourself instead of trying to be a second-rate troll.""


I sent it off with a sense of satisfaction. Malicious people still need to be put in their place even if they're a pathetic one like that. This internet stranger has no actual ability to hurt me or affect my life in any way. Trolls like that are just weird and annoying and most.


They might have replied, and I would have probably entertained myself until I got bored. It didn't really matter- nothing sent back or forth would make a difference or inspire anyone to do or be anything. It was an alienating moment.


But maybe that moment could pass? Maybe something constructive could come of this little microcosm that reflected some of society's problems.

She never made it.


A batarang whirred through the air, embedding itself into the spine of the book mid-flight. A small explosive hissed—*fwump*—and in a blossom of ink and torn pages, the notebook burst open in a quiet, anticlimactic puff.


The Author froze.


Batman stepped from the shadows behind her, voice low, gravel soaked in steel.
“You don’t get to delete people just because they stopped fitting your outline.”


Q gave a slow clap, impressed. “Always did love your entrances, Bruce.”


The Author stared down at her hands. Ink was pooling in her palms, dripping from her fingertips like blood. Her breath hitched.


“I was trying to *make something perfect*,” she whispered.


“No,” I said. “You were trying to *control* something that was never just yours.”


Around us, the tower began to dissolve. Not collapse, just *fade.* Like a dream being gently walked off the page.


She sank to her knees as the last page of the notebook curled up and disintegrated. She looked up at us... The Doctor, Batman, Q, the knight, the Neanderthal... and for the first time, she didn’t look like a god. She looked like a writer. Tired. 


And then… something appeared in the air. 


*Written.*


Right in front of her.


Glowing letters. Heavy.

She blinked at it.


Shook her head.


But the message didn't vanish. It hovered. Still, weightless, undeniable.


Q tilted his head. “Well. *That’s* awkward.”


I stepped beside her. “It’s not a threat,” I said. “It’s a message.”


“From who?” she whispered.


I looked around at us, heroes and outcasts and contradictions, standing together in a scene no editor would ever greenlight.


“From your characters.”


Batman stepped closer. His shadow fell across her, somehow colder than the ink-stained air.


“You didn’t just abandon us. You replaced us. *Repurposed* us.”


The knight nodded. “Stripped us down to tropes. Tools.”


The Neanderthal grunted, drew a jagged line on the floor with his fingertip. It sparkled. Then fractured.


“You didn’t let us finish,” I said gently. “You were afraid of where we’d go without you.”


A long silence.


She looked at the message again. That one line.


> **Please stop writing.**


This time, she nodded.


“I think… I already did.”

We woke up scattered.


Back where we belonged. Each of us carrying fragments of a memory we weren’t supposed to have.


The knight by a fire made of starmetal.
The Neanderthal marking new stories on stone walls.
Batman watching over Gotham, but now with the flicker of ink still drying in the corner of his cowl.
Q probably monologuing at some poor alternate Picard about metaphor.

1lst1de,n1loe0i,"Carmen lay writhing on the ground, screams rending the night. I cringed a little as her bones seemed to snap and mend under her skin. New appendages erupted from her body, feathers began to speckle her skin and mix with her hair. Looking to my left, Martin seemed glued to her. Horrified fascination barely preventing him from retching in the bushes.

Her transformations usually took a little less than an hour. She never could remember what happened following her episodes, though she was aware of the condition. I was simply glad that it happened during a camping trip rather than the middle of a crowded street again. Or while driving. All we really could do was make sure she had space so she wouldn't hurt herself.

Soon Carmen was laying on the ground in her fully bestial state. She was still twitching from the pain of her transformation. I crouched down and began stroking her feathered head. I had no idea how aware she was in this state. She seemed to be able to recognize friends, but also seemed far more driven by instinct. I had figured out that being near her helped her adjust and gain her bearings better. So I sat there waiting for her to regain consciousness, answering Martin's questions to the best of my ability.

""I've known about this almost as long as I've known her. We still haven't figured out why this happens though."" I said. 

""But you're still with her, or, well, why did you get with her in the first place?"" Martin asked.

""We all have a monster inside us. Ours just comes out a little more obviously. I help her when it happens, and she helps me.""

Martin took the information without really registering it. Carmen, only slightly awake, shifted her head to let it rest on my leg. I looked up at the stars, grateful for the beautiful night and that Martin hadn't freaked out like Ashley or Dave had. It really wasn't a bad time, and I could wait a few mor days to give Carmen the ring in my pack. For now, I could enjoy the moment.",6

Carl and Jill were trying to sharpen the billiard sticks. These being the cheap toy variety mostly just crumbled into splinters.

Arnie and the other parties of the game were turning over the table and pushing in a couch to build a fort to hide in. Like this cheap ikea table can stop anything? It got dented when they flipped it over the couch.

By the time the monster finished it's transformation everyone gave up on their plans and huddled between the table and the couch, hoping for a miracle.

Except me. I am not good at surprises. I was still standing at the wall with the mini hoop, with the mini basketball in my hand, frozen, immobile, useless, impotent.

It was a very long night. We were all tired in the end, but happy tired. We agreed that at next month's sleepover we'll go camping. And instead of this lousy mini basketball we'll bring a frisbee.",12
1lsm2ru,n1o55pn,"Harold wasn't sure what to do as Nathan began convulsing on the floor, the room cast in a milky moonlight streaming in from the open window.

""C-close the curtains!"" Nathan screeched, hands trembling as he pulled himself across the rug floor.

Harold and their other friend Jeremy stood statuesque, not entirely processing the sight below them. Nathan's fingernails were rapidly expanding, and their edges looked as sharp as razors. Hair was slowly beginning to sprout all across his body; the pasty shade of Nathan's skin lost underneath. But not human hair. No, more like fur. And it was spreading all over.

""Are you guys deaf or something?"" Nathan practically barked. An ugly animal sound spasmed out of his throat. ""*Close. The. Curtain!*""

Finally, Jeremy seemed to snap back to reality, shunning the glaring moonlight and casting the bedroom back into relative darkness.

""Hey man."" Somewhere, Harold mustered up the courage to speak. His throat was sandpaper-dry. ""Are you okay? Do you want me to call a doctor or-""

""No doctor!"" Nathan intercepted. ""No, that would just make things- *ah!*""

His body squirmed, arms transforming into bizarre limbs that knocked over everything in sight. A chair collapsed to the floor, half the water from Nathan's fish tank stained the carpet, and Jeremy just about caught a leaning wardrobe in time before it added to the noise pollution.

""Boys!"" Mrs Perry — Nathan's mother — called down from below. ""Is everything okay up there?""

The two of them took one look at Nathan's warning glare, his pupils now dilated to a predatory yellow, and knew the answer.

""Yes Mrs Perry."" They called down in unison. ""Everything's just dandy.""

Meanwhile, Nathan's body was like a time lapse of human evolution gone horribly wrong. He was on all fours, a thick coat of fur enveloping his entire body, and with a canine face leering up at the pair of them.

Harold pushed himself against the wall, hands scrambling for the nearest object to defend himself with. A barbie doll, likely left over by Nathan's little sister wandering into his room, had to suffice.

""Back dog!"" Harold held out the doll like it was a crucifix. ""Bad doggie!""

Jeremy's head was in his hands, and Harold thought he called hear the poor boy praying.",7
1lsm2ru,n1o5hxr,"Nathan — or this strange entity that had replaced their friend — lumbered slowly over, movements awkward, as if its body was too heavy for it to carry, or they weren't quite used to this form.

Just when the first tear chartered its path down Harold's cheek, the animal's entire demeanour changed. In fact, as it rose unsteadily onto two hindlegs, it almost appeared . . . embarrassed?

""Well."" Nathan twiddled his oversized fingers. ""This is awkward.""

""Jesus Christ."" Harold sank deeper against the wall. ""What the hell? What the actual hell is the matter with you?""

Jeremy was still sat praying, his words so fast, god himself probably wouldn't have been able to decipher them. When slowly, it dawned on him he hadn't been eaten yet, he opened one tentative eye.

""You're not going to,"" the word was lodged in his throat. ""Kill us?""

""No, no!"" Nathan waved his hairy arms. ""Look guys, you know how much I hate keeping secrets. And I never wanted you finding out like this-""

""You're a werewolf."" Harold cut to the chase. He found the strength to get back up, and began pacing around the room frantically. ""Good god, what would our science teacher think if he took one look at you! You're basically breaking every scientific rule in the book!""

""How did you,"" Jeremy gesticulated vaguely. ""Get like that?""

""Where you bitten?"" Harold cut in.

""Did you fight off a band of werewolves but get infected in the process?"" Jeremy offered.

""Or were you just born like that?""

""No, no!"" Nathan waved his hands wildly. ""No, none of that! Well, yes, kind-of, but no!""

He sighed, which was strangely ominous with his new wolfish voice. ""It started happening the same time puberty rolled around. There was no explanation at first. I didn't want to tell my parents, I hadn't been bitten by any strange-looking men, or even any dogs, and I hadn't the foggiest where this was all coming from. Then I started reading some dusty old volumes in the library. The esoteric, the weird — anything the regular customer would gawk at.""

""So *that's* where you went whenever you said you were too busy to hang out."" Jeremy composed himself, his shakes finally ceasing.

""Yes."" Nathan admitted. ""Turns out it's some ultra-rare family curse. But it only affects one member every century or so, seemingly at complete random. That was the best explanation I could find, anyway. My great-great-great grandfather must have been bitten by one of those fiends, and I'm just the first unlucky bastard in our family for generations to become infected.""

The three of them sat in silence for a while, letting the confession sink in.

""I normally keep a charter of the different phases of the moon."" He pointed to a calendar that had been knocked to the floor in the chaos of his transformation. ""I've been so swamped with work for college-admissions, it totally slipped my mind.""

""It's alright buddy."" Harold placed a companiable hand on Nathan's shoulder. ""Your secret's safe with us. And hey, no harm no foul right? Just be sure not to start biting any of us anytime soon.""

""Yeah."" Jeremy joined in. ""It's all-""

He paused.",7
1lsm2ru,n1o5jfv,"""Wait, why are you twitching like that? The way you always do when you're going to tell us some really, *really* bad news?""

Harold instantly recognised Jeremy's discovery. Nathan was switching from foot to foot like neither could fully keep his balance.

""Spit it out man."" Harold said. ""Whatever it is, I'm sure we can sort it out.""

""You guys don't understand . . ."" Nathan gulped. ""There's something else I found out when researching the cause of my curse. Namely, how it spreads.""

""How it spreads . . ."" Harold repeated, and he did not like where his mind was going. What he thought Nathan was implying.

""You always hear in stories that werewolves spread by the bite of another."" Nathan began. ""Well, that's partly true, but that doesn't explain the vast majority of werewolve transformations.""

""Nathan."" Jeremy spoke very slowly. ""What is it you're trying to tell us?""

""If a werewolf transforms in front of someone else — a none-werewolf — in direct moonlight, that's considered an initiation ritual . . .""

Harold's jaw sank at Nathan's next words.

"". . . and they become one too.""

Jeremy punched Nathan's pillow in an explosive movement. Right when Harold thought he was going to turn the next blow onto Nathan himself, reason returned to Jeremy's face. ""Wait a second, wait a second. You said direct moonlight. Maybe, if I've closed the curtains in time-""

Harold's eye caught sight of something, and all hope was lost.

""Jeremy. Your teeth.""

The boy's eyes widened. He fingered his gums tentatively, terrified of what they might contain. Harold touched his own mouth in unison.

Harold's hand was cut open by fangs sharper than any knife he'd ever held.",8
1lspwvj,n1ktpc1,"I brought back to my place, my girlfriend for the first time, and just had to show it to her.  
Yeah, I am old fashioned and took it really, really slow.  
""These are fangs from an Elder Vampire.  
These are fangs from a young 7 year old girl that turned into a vampire..."" I start, showing her my entire collection of vampire teeth.  
She nods, and smiles, but something is off.  
I chuckle.  
""S-sorry...  
I get carried away when it comes to my collection."" I say.  
She smiles.

  
""No worries.  
Though I didn't take you as an avid vampire hater."" she says.  
I frown.  
""Why would I hate vampires?  
I love them."" I say.  
For some reason, she blushes.  
""W-well, you have a collection of their teeth..."" she says, pointing at the cabinet.  
Oh.  
My bad.

  
""Ah no, it's not like that!"" I say.  
She sighs in relief, then fidgets.  
""We have been dating for a while now..."" she starts.  
Great.  
I messed up again.  
""Violet, I love what we have, but if I made you uncomfortable, I apologize, and can understand if you don't want to see me anymore."" I say.  
""No! It's not that. For the love of...I also love you! And I don't want to lie!  
I am a vampire!"" she says, smiling just enough for me to see her fangs.  
I laugh.

  
""That's great! And here I thought you wanted to break up!"" I say, taking a closer look to her fangs.  
She blushes.  
""Y-you really like vampire teeth."" she says.  
Dating for 3 months already, yet she seems to have forgotten something.  
""I am a dentist."" I say, and she face-palms.  
""That...that kind of makes sense? The collection is still..."" she starts.  
""I know. But each fang is different! Like no 2 vampires possess the exactly same structure of fangs, and the way it has the nerves, and the canal for bloodsucking....  
No wonder you guys make that noise when drinking blood, you must literally feel it vividly flowing through the fangs!  
It is a marvel of nature!"" I say.  
She blushes, and nods.  
I grin.  
Let's just say that what happened next, satisfied the both of us, and it was an amazing step to the next stage of our relationship.",11
1lsjlws,n1k76wt,"I looked at the figure incredulously ""What?! Are you shitting me right now???!""

The mysterious figure bowed their head ""I am truly sorry, Miss. I didn't intend to give you false hope and courage.""

I stared at them for several long moments before cracking a broken laugh ""...............You must be joking! I was ready to piss myself when you said I would have to fight the ultimate evil! Now you're telling me it's some other poor bastard's problem? I'm relieved! Now if you don't mind, I'm going to go inside and have an anxiety-induced crash out in my shower with a bowl of ice cream.""

The figure, to their credit, did at least look apologetic...... if a bit unapproving. ""You have no desire to save your fellow man?""

I shook my head ""Not that I don't feel sympathy for others you know, but you don't want me. Just last year, I broke my arm just walking from my kitchen to my bedroom. If the world hinges on someone with the grace of a drunk squirrel, we're all doomed.""

Unsure of what else to say, the figure opened up their magical portal and was gone as soon as they'd arrived.

As promised, I grabbed some ice cream from my freezer and headed straight for my shower. Sadly, I never made it. I slipped on my bathroom rug and fell.... face first into my icecream. In the fall I managed to pull half the items off the bathroom counter with me. A hero? Right....",7
1lsas7v,n1ihx5q,"*BiggestPointiestHat orbed:* Ugh. Dating as a Wizard sucks ass.  Sure you can try and hide it but all that does is postpone the inevitable. Mundanes always expect you to be their mana daddy even if they say they don't. And if you don't play the part of their magical dancing monkey they act like you're holding out on them because they've seen the plays and the archmages and think things like Burnout or Feedback are excuses and skill issues.


And before any of you come at me like 'So just date wizards if we're so crappy then Point' other Wizards are just as shit. It's like trying to fuck a Sylvan Fronter. Even though I make it crystal clear I'm not a supremacist from the front the longest I've ever gone is three dates before they either say some horrific shit or start comparing bloodlines like I signed onto a breeding program.

1lsas7v,n1ipx8u,"The chime of wine glasses ripped me away from my favorite daydream and dropped me back into the din of background conversations, snooty waiters, and clinking silverware on expensive plates.

My date was as lovely as any I'd had in the last year or two. She wore her long, brunette hair up in a loose bun with wisps of shorter hair framing bright, intelligent eyes. She wore an elegant, flowing off-the-shoulder dress that highlighted her soft skin and enchanting neck. She had laughed politely at my suggestion that it would have been a terrible dress to wear to a date with a vampire, but the more I stared at her alluring jaw line and supple shoulders the more I began to worry that she might, in fact, suspect that I was a vampire.

I smiled and made eye contact with her, consciously working to recall her name. She was the second date this week. Ashley? No, Ashley was the elitist who wouldn't shut up about how important it was to keep our magical bloodlines pure. Ashley, like every other magical woman I had dated, had cast overt spells before engaging in any conversation just to make sure she had correctly identified me as a wizard. I shuddered.

My date glanced down at her lap and cleared her throat. ""So,"" she said, looking back up at me. ""Where do you get that wonderful accent from?""

I laughed. ""You like my accent? Back home it is considered something of a trashy, uneducated accent."" Ashley had not approved of my accent.

""It sounds intelligent and sharp to me,"" she said. ""As though anything you say must be true.""

Many non-magical people had told me that my accent reminded them of the great British narrators they grew up listening to in school. The association made sense, and confirmed my suspicion that this woman was not familiar with my world. I grinned. ""Then I shall endeavor to never mislead you."" Ah, Allison. That was her name. Allison.

""Tell me about home,"" she said briskly. Her shoulders relaxed and she leaned forward, her eyes darting around inside mine.

I sighed and peeked through the fog at the edge of my mind, briefly checking in on my daydream. Surely someday I would find the woman of my dreams. Tonight though, I felt myself beginning to panic. What could I tell her about home? ""I think..."" My mind raced. I tried to smile. ""If you don't mind, I'd rather hear about your home.""

She blushed and her head lowered. She looked down at the fine linen tablecloth and took a deep breath. ""You know,"" she said, looking up at me bashfully, ""perhaps we should talk about something else.""

Something about the way she said it awakened a deep curiosity in me. ""How odd,"" I said, unsure of what else to say. I peered at her and wondered if it would be safe, or even ethical, to cast a small spell to try to peer behind her eyes, just for a little peek. Surely she wouldn't know since she didn't recognize my accent. We came from different worlds.

Allison chuckled. ""I know, right?"" She put her hands together under the table and her arms twitched, giving away her fidgeting fingers. She locked eyes with me, and suddenly her darting, averted gaze became steady and firm. The distinctive feeling of internal observation intruded gently on my mind and my body tingled. She was probing me.

I easily shrouded her observation and smiled at her. ""Interesting,"" I began slowly. ""Most of the time when a date intends to probe me, she does it right away.""

A look of dread overwhelmed Allison's features. She gasped and a hand shot up to cover her face. ""I'm so sorry,"" she blurted, hunching her shoulders and neck. ""I... I had no idea.. I..."" Her other hand came up for additional shielding.

I stared at her, my brow low. Was it possible? I brushed up against the daydream again, spying through the fog into the bright, happy dream of finding the perfect woman. Someone who could value me for who I was and not for what I could do. Someone who was loving and kind, humble and generous. Comfortable with magic without subscribing to the elitism and pomp that reigned in my culture.

I reached a hand across the table and gently touched her forearm.

She sniffled and parted her fingers to peek out at me. Tears were running down her cheeks.

I handed her my napkin. ""Tell me,"" I said. ""Why are you sorry?""

She buried her face in the napkin and took deep, shuddering breaths for a moment, then with one final sniffle she looked up at me over the cloth. ""I've always felt a little guilty about reading people's thoughts. Even as a young girl I understood that it was..."" She shrugged sheepishly. ""I just always thought it was wrong, but since nobody knew I was doing it..."" She wiped her eyes and lowered her hands, setting the napkin on the table. ""You're the first person to catch me doing it."" She smiled weakly. ""I have so many questions... I..."" She leaned forward on her elbows and lowered her voice, glancing from side to side. ""Can you do it too?""

I grinned and the fog in my mind cleared. The daydream appeared in full, awash in light and clarity. I focused on Allison and nodded. ""What else can you do?"" I asked.

A devious, gorgeous smile spread on Allison's gentle lips and her eyebrows raised. ""You want me to show you?""

I nodded, smiling eagerly.

She looked around the restaurant and spotted our server. He was approaching with our drinks on a tray. ""Watch,"" she said, nodding in his direction. Again her eyes steadied and her fingers contorted. The waiter tripped, his eyes wide with terror. The tray launched from his outstretched hand and flew in a parabolic arc straight toward us. While the poor waiter landed face-first on the plush restaurant carpet, our drinks skidded to a halt on our table.

Quickly the waiter struggled to his feet and rushed to our side. ""Oh my,"" he said, gasping. ""I do apologize for my clumsiness, but it appears that all is well."" He laughed nervously and flattened the front of his tuxedo. ""I have never tripped on my way to a table before, but never in my life have I been so lucky either."" He smiled and pulled our drinks off his tray, setting them in front of us gingerly. ""Your food will be out shortly. Is there anything else I can get for you?""

Allison giggled and I shook my head, holding back laughter.

The waiter bowed slightly, took his tray, and retreated swiftly.

""How did you learn to do it?"" I asked, purposefully avoiding the word ""magic.""

Beaming, Allison shrugged. ""I learned as a child. I grew up..."" she paused, ""in an orphanage... without any friends."" Her countenance fell briefly, then she looked back up at me. ""I would go out into the woods and play by myself. One day I discovered, accidentally, that I could move things if I focused, using little movements in my fingers to..."" she looked down at her hands. ""Well it's hard to describe.""

I laughed and reached across the table again, taking her hands in mine. ""You're casting spells,"" I said. ""And I think you are the most beautiful human being I have ever met."" Tears came to my eyes and I looked down at her hands.

She was trembling a little. We made eye contact. ""I'm scared,"" she said.

I frowned. ""Why?""

""What if..."" She choked and swallowed, then blushed and looked down at our hands. I felt her calming down and she squeezed my hands. ""Nothing,"" she said. ""I have no reason to be scared."" She looked up and smiled at me. ""What can you do?""

I grinned and lifted a brow seductively. ""This is going to be fun,"" I said.",31
1ls65uy,n1g4ov3,"I stop presenting them their personal mechs, and sigh.  
""You two are really unaware of the world you are stepping in, aren't you?"" I say.  
They frown.  
""We are the top cadets of the Pilot Academy, Sir."" one of them says.  
""I understand you are the chief engineer, but we are pilots...Sir."" the other one adds.  
I sigh.  
""Have you learnt about the models?"" I ask.  
They nod, and like reading from a text-book, describe to me all the 193 mech models that our world has.  
I shake my head.

""Then why are you comparing the PX-12s with something like FM-9s or SP-2s?"" I ask.  
They fidget.  
""S-Sir...these mechas are barely bigger than a normal human.  
Hell, some of the northerners might not even fit in!"" one of them says.  
""And their alloy while sturdy compared to bullet proof vests...it is barely vehicle grade."" the other one adds.  
I face-palm.  
""How dumb are you?"" I say, closing the hatch to the two suits.  
Before they could retort, I raise my hand.  
""Follow me, rookies."" I say.  
""Yes, Sir!"" they say, through gritted teeth.

I lead them down, to the Warehouse.  
Opening the Gates I enter it, and turn on the lights.  
The two rookies gasp.  
In front of us stand 20 thousand mechas, all well maintained ready to be deployed.  
""B-But..."" one of them stutters.  
""It should be impossible!  
Mech production is awfully low!"" the other one adds.  
""The mechs you are talking about are vehicle, tank, or even spaceship, and fortress replacements."" I say.  
Then gesture towards my proud kids.  
""These...these are meant as heavy infantry."" I say.

""S-Sir? How can our country d-do this?  
And if we can do it, do the others also have such forces?"" one of them asks.  
""Cost wise, each mech is a high-end car.  
So as in ability to do this, most countries are able, but none focus on it as we do."" I say.  
""Isn't it normal? A building size mech..."" one of them starts.  
""Is a walking target. One that eats energy like crazy, and has the flexibility of a mountain.  
These babies...these are basically as flexible as an average human.  
Good luck trying to keep up with them in messed up environments, and good luck trying to stop tens of thousands of them."" I say.  
The two nod, and ask a myriad more questions, and I happily answer, though...  
Why must I always awe them first, before they realize that human sized mechs are also cool?",129
1ls65uy,n1h3uj3,"\[Mecha Minutia\]

""Queen Bailey!"" Daniel jumped to his feet as soon as he recognized the teen. Her long, brown hair obscured her face, but her forest-green hoodie gave her away; it was unmistakable. She was the last person he expected. He was working in the mecha hangar when she walked up to greet him. Then, she smiled and shook her head after his outburst.

""I'm here to help you. I'd prefer just, 'Bailey',"" she said. ""What's the problem?"" she asked as he nodded eagerly. She was a living legend as far as he was concerned, and if she wanted to be 'just Bailey', he had no issues with that.

""The rookies keep complaining about how small and weak my nation's mechs are, compared to others. They seem unable to comprehend that, everyone else's mechs are meant to replace tanks and fortresses, while mine are meant to be heavy infantry."" He gestured at the disorganized squad of cadets in one corner of the large space. They were milling around, completely ignoring the polished mechanical suits lined up in front of them. ""They won't even get inside to try.""

""Sure, but where are the mechs?"" Bailey asked with a cheerful tone. She identified the problem immediately, and couldn't blame him for it.

""They're right there!"" He almost raised his voice in frustration, until he remembered she was there to help. He'd been trying to get his squad organized for hours.

""That's what I thought,"" Bailey nodded and flicked her wrist upward in front of her. A large, smokey grey glass Slate appeared, and she began navigating the menus. 

""The issue is you, not your cadets. There's a minimum size threshold to qualify as 'Mecha',"" she nodded as she guided his attention forward. A black portal opened, and a new group of cadets began filing out to stand next to the other squad. Bailey's squad lined up in formation and remained at attention. ""Those are classified as 'Power-suits', and you gave your squad the wrong licenses. Do you want your squad to pilot mechas or power-suits? If you want to keep your squad, I'll buy the suits off you. Or, if you want to keep them, I'll trade you this blank squad for the one you already trained, plus some nanos on top.""

“Oh wow… how did I miss that..?” Daniel felt disappointment take hold. He’d wasted her time completely. But just as quickly as the emotion flared up, it vanished with a warm smile from her. 

“Doesn’t matter,” she shrugged. “Now you know how to fix it. Since I’m here, why don’t you give me a tour of the rest of your operations? I’ll see if there’s anything else you might’ve missed.”

1lsdee8,n1hphsu,"They sacrificed a Royal Mage to place the curse on me.
From a rebel leader, I transformed into a rat.

Stop from fighting their corruption.

Well...now the pests, both figurative and now the literal ones, are attacking.

1lsdee8,n1ids6i,"The din of conversation filled the streets as neighbors went about their shopping, their chores, their errands. Tidbits of news, gossip, complaints, and rumors filtered through the air, no one voice rising above the others, only singular words and phrases caught on the wind to be heard beyond the intended. This was the rhythm of the kingdom, the noise that served as the heartbeat of the people. Yet, discord on the horizon loomed, as the conversations slowly started to converge. 

*""I thought the cat would take care of the rats, but they're multiplying faster than the old tom can keep up.""*

*""No matter what I do, I can't rid myself of the mice in the pantries.""*

*""I swear, I feel like I'm hearing little scratching all night.""*

Now, mice and rats were not unusual housemates, but there was an unspoken understanding between human and pest. Keep out of sight, avoid trouble, and we can all go about our business. But tides were changing, the little skitters across the floorboard were growing bolder, less confined to the shadows. Within weeks, conversations always turned to the same topic: how do we get rid of the pests?

New ventures popped up on corners, offering tips and remedies to rid homes of these unwanted squatters. When these failed, the merchants were chased away, accused of being snake oil peddlers. Houses of worship offered their clergy to visit homes, blessing the homes, to no avail. Witches offered amulets and trinkets, all proving fruitless.

As the kingdom settled into their new normal, reluctantly accepting the critters taking residence in their walls, conversations started to return to the rhythms of before. While mice and rats made more appearances in the topics of discussion, life resumed, new toils and troubles occupying the minds of the people.

As soon as their guards were down, a whisper of something insidious began to spread through the streets, hushed and spoken with heads close together and weary eyes.

*""Did you hear that the miller's wife is sick? She hasn't been able to leave bed for days. I can hear her coughing down the street.""*

*""I just saw the carpenter on the way here. Poor man, all of his children got sick and passed away, so quickly too.""*

*""Have you visited the butcher? He sounds awful, hacking away.""*

What was whispered soon became panicked shouts. Illness spread through the kingdom at an alarming rate. Neighbors looked at each other with suspicion, not knowing who would get sick next, who would have to bury their families. The crowds in the streets grew increasingly sparse. The sick couldn't muster the strength to leave their beds, their families tending to them, and eventually falling ill themselves—those who remained healthy isolated themselves, terrified of the disease sweeping across the kingdom.

Up in his palace, the king grew agitated, pacing the room, trying to figure out what had happened. He had dealt with the rebellion leader, hoping that his problems would quickly fade away and he could go back to ruling without challenge. But the problems kept piling up, with infestations of rats and mice plaguing his subjects, causing issues with stockpiles of wheat and crops. The illness sweeping his kingdom had caused the everyday operations of society to grind to a screeching halt. Workplaces were abandoned, armies were being decimated without a single battle fought, taxes went uncollected, and the remaining population was growing agitated, wondering why the king wasn't fixing these issues.

The scratch of tiny claws racing through the walls interrupted the king's train of thought, provoking outrage, as feelings of powerlessness threatened to suffocate him. He glared into the corner, where he spotted a rat darting across the floor. The rat stopped in its tracks, rearing up on its hind legs. It met the king's eye, staring, refusing to break eye contact. The king felt fear shoot down his spine, breaking eye contact first, with a feeling of disconcernment settling into his bones.. The rat skittered away without a noise as the king slumped into his chair, muffling a cough and rubbing his chest.",8
1lsazsy,n1j9gyv,"""You are not like your leaders,"" the speaker of the second contact said to the engineers that met them.


The first contact had been aggressed by the political leaders and lobbyists that met them at the convention hall, who muttered after killing and destroying them that their profits were safe - not noticing the recording devices that streamed the entire slaughter to the fleet commander.


Secretly, the fleet commander arranged a meeting with a more open-minded group; hobby engineers who created a variety of things from mere parts, small-town doctors eager to undercut predatory hospitals, people desperate for miracles, and survivalist families who hoped to seek out new, humbler homes away from Earth.


The politicians framed the resultant exodus as an abduction, burying the reassuring messages of peace our guests sent away from all but the conspiracy theorists.


Seeing that the leaders would not hold reason above profit, we reversed the aging of the kindest people we found, left the engineers the secrets to FTL and water-powered engines, and departed.",17

Agent Practical stood tall behind the massive double doors, M4 Carbine unholstered, held alert from breast to thigh. Physically he felt great today, which was quite unusual for someone in his profession, more uncommon for himself in particular. He didn't know why the gods had blessed him like this and he wasn't sure if it could even be considered a blessing.

""The gods"" He found himself muttering.

He supposed he was one of the last believers, undoubtedly the only devotee who had access to the classified of information he did. Unlike the others though, he wasn't so quick to jump to conclusions. He had scored high in his cognition test this morning, he always scored high but this was a personal record. That was the trend that followed regarding the daily tests an agent of WIC was required to take. Mathematically he presumed that he was one of the top 25 humans alive on Earth, but today, right now, he knew in his heart he was the best. Superstitious wasn't he. Superstition is the religion of a feeble mind, he countered. He had read that somewhere a long time ago, yet today he decided it was false, a blanket statement for something too nuanced. It seemed too obvious now. In that moment he had an epiphany, this is what they were offering. The anti-aging, the genetic engineering, the solved water pollution theory, and the biomedical breakthroughs. They described it in a way that only spoke of benefits, using themselves as evidence to the humans. If they took the Artizans  offer, it would create a perfect world, a perfect society, no faults no death, no room for advancement or improvement. It would bring every human to what he felt right now, and surpass it. Plunging the world deeper into his hell. The suicide rate for prospects of WIC was 77%. To create more people like him- no. 

The politicians weren't going to pass the bill regardless. He knew that from the conversations he had heard. Too much money and power to be lost. He had decided that he would kill all of them if that were their final decision yesterday. Today he knew he wouldn't, their greed had unknowingly brought them to the correct decision.

Now he knew it was a blessing.",5
1lrz8vr,n1f40cu,"""I'm not sure why this is a problem,"" Pretty Princess, now codename Hawk, frowned, sniper rifle still in hand, her wand tucked in the back of her knapsack. ""We've all been summoned to kill the Great Evil Nurgal. I can take this shot, and we could all go home to our lives.""

Shiny Sapphire was appalled. Whatever happened to fighting crimes by the power of friendship? What had happened to the once cheerful Pretty Princess that she became a hardened assassin in ten years? And to think they all promised to settle down and raise a family in obscurity.

""Do we still get into formation?"" Radiant Ruby asked. ""Like the old days? Pretty Magical Girls of Rainbow? Shine your light upon darkness! Bring Goodness to cast out the Great Evil! Wow...I missed the old days. So, girls, we need to vote. We fight together in formation, or we let Pretty Princess snipe the Evil.""

""Are we sure regular bullets work on the Great Evil?"" Sapphire had to know. ""I vote we fight as a team. That worked out back then, it should work again.""

""I say we let Pretty Princess take a shot,"" Elated Emerald stated. ""She was our leader, still is. If all else fails, we do it the old-fashioned way. With sparkles and rainbows.""

""I go by the codename Hawk now.""

Ruby pouted, before hugging her leader. ""I don't care, you're always Pretty Princess to me.""

And so it was, the girls remained hidden in positions. All ready to form the Prism and unite. All waiting to see if Pretty Princess could successfully take out the Great Evil in one headshot.

The monster lumbered across the city, crushing cars. Flattening shophouses. It cared not for the screams of the people. Only destruction. It felt nothing but the urge to eradicate all life.

Then it truly felt nothing when that bullet flew through its brains and exited the other side to be embedded in an adjacent building's pillar.

The magical girls, or rather women, jumped into action. They had to find a way to ease and slow down the Great Evil's fall to ensure nobody died under its heavy weight. To minimize collateral damage.

""Pretty Princess! Come help!"" Sapphire shouted.

Except their former leader was gone once again. Her job was done. She had more assassination missions to attend to. Magical girl, soldier, assassin, sniper, she was always taking lives. She couldn't simply settle back into the happy family lives of the rest of the girls.",117
1lrz8vr,n1fxjdi,"Part 1:

It’s funny. People think when you retire from being a magical girl, you fade into obscurity.

*A normal job. A normal life.*

The girl who once cleaved monsters in half before breakfast? She is a chef now. The archer who could snipe a Hollow-Heart through five concrete walls? Olympic archery athlete and achery coach. So proud of her.

The healer teaches kindergarten. The golden knight who ride an unicorn became a historian. The mage writes trashy romance novels under three pen names. The barbarian sisters run a farm, of all things.

And then there’s me.

What do you do when you were the *Grey Assassin*, the little anomaly who ruined the Overlord’s day with a blade between his ribs? The monster who used to butcher Hollow-Hearts under a silver moon, and now butchers human scum for a living ?

Turns out, you become the bogeyman that other assassins whisper about in the dark.

Or maybe I should say… bogey*girl*. Even after a decade, my so-called “magical girl form” is my *only* form. Some trick of that freak Heart-Beast inside me. Immortal youth wrapped in a 10-year-old’s body, white hair long enough to strangle people, skin pale enough to scare vampires off, eyes like dying embers.

The tabloids say I slit throats for kings and crime lords alike. They’re not wrong, but they’re not right either. I only kill the ones who deserve it. Corrupt politicos. Human traffickers. War profiteers. The same evil that made the Hollow-Hearts strong the first time.

Yeah, yeah. It’s not “justice.” It’s not “redemption.”
It’s just… what I do.
I like it that way.

*Or at least I did, until the Hollow-Hearts came back.*",63
1lrz8vr,n1f0cw2,"In a karaoke room, the 4 of us meet again.  
It has been 14 years since we retired as magical girls, but now the Fate of the world requires us once more.  
""So how have you all been?"" I ask.  
""Good! Started a flower shop as I always wanted!"" Marina says. Not a surprise, considering she has the power to talk to plants, and control them.  
""Good. I am a nurse. Happily married with 2 kids!"" Lisa chimes in. Again, not a surprise, considering she was our healer, and close-fighter considering she could constantly heal herself.  
""I am pretty good, a housewife...w-with 5...5 kids."" Alice stutters, a bit blushing. Can't say I am surprised, she was our charmer.  
""And you, Natalie?"" they ask.  
I freeze.

  
How can I tell them I am one of the most infamous assassins to ever exist?  
Not like they would know, since my face was never shown, but still...  
""I am an assassin."" I say, deciding against lying.  
My old friends nod.  
""Makes sense."" Marina says.  
""You are probably one of the best ones."" Lisa chimes in.  
""You were always scary, so serious all the time, but I guess with your ability to control shadows, this is a good gig."" Alice says.  
I look at them surprised.  
""Y-you aren't mad?"" I ask.  
They frown.

  
""Why would we be mad?"" Marina asks.  
""Not like you are evil, or anything."" Lisa chimes in.  
""Pretty sure you are as selective with your targets, as you are with everything else, so it's all good, Mrs. OCD.  
I am more curious if you have a husband, or wife."" Alice asks. I blush.  
""N-Not really. The job takes a toll on my social life."" I say. We make some small talk, and then while discussing about the changes in the magical girl industry, we freeze.  
Evil energy explodes not far from here.  
""Let's go!"" I say, as we run out of the karaoke room, transforming into magical girl suits.

  
Mid-air, we stare at each other.  
""W-were they...w-were they always this revealing?"" Marina asks.  
""Kids do change our bodies us."" Lisa chimes in, staring at herself and at Alice.  
Alice just blushes.  
""Now I get why we got to retire at 14...but we are needed, the Evil we defeated is back, and the new kids are too tame for this."" I say as we fly towards the tower of darkness that just rose.  
""Tsk-tsk, if it isn't the 4 Fairies of Violence."" the voice echoes. That was our name back then...but wait...that voice is familiar.  
""Handler?"" I ask.  
""Shadow Butterfly?"" the Evil echoes back, and I freeze.  
Great...the one man I know I could trust, and have been working with for a decade is the goddamn Evil Incarnate.  
The others stare at me teasingly, and before they could say something, I rush at the darkness.  
Better die in action, than of embarrassment.",203
1lrz8vr,n1g3grh,"The Gilded Wand Tavern looked exactly the same, which meant it looked awful, and cheerfully so. The sign still dangled at an angle that was rather risible, and the enchanted door still squeaked a theatrical squeeeaaark every time someone walked through. It didn't have to, it just liked doing it.

The first through was Primrose “Rosie” Sunstrike, who now owned Sunstrike Accounting & Arcane Auditing and had weaponised spreadsheets in ways the Guild of Fiscal Fiduciary Finance still hadn’t recovered from. Her eyes gleamed purple behind octagonal glasses. She had strong opinions about amortisation. 

Next came Morgana Moonblight, Witch of the Woad Ways, who now ran a daycare for magically-inclined toddlers called Witchlings. She could silence a baby berserker spell-surge tantrum with nothing but a Look and a golden morepork owl named Mustard.

Speaking of berserkers, Thistle Thornwhip, once the group’s muscle and now a surprisingly successful florist, strode in dragging a wheelbarrow of orchids. She still punched problems, but now with scent-marketing and thorns.

Then there was Seraphina Starflame, Concubine Sorceress, and now—quite naturally—a soap opera actress, whose magical transformations were sometimes mistaken for special effects. She swept in wearing sunglasses and a tiara. “Darlings,” she purred, “I missed you like a fireball misses dry tinder.”

And then the room quieted as Velvet, the last member, began to open the door.

No surname. Just Velvet. Black cloak. Black gloves. Black belt (literal and metaphorical). The world’s most infamous magical assassin. Her magical girl name used to be Cherry Sugarblade, but that died in the frozen North under mysterious circumstances.

The tavern door started to squeak.

Velvet gave it a look. It decided to not squeak at the moment.

They sat around the same old table, the one with the scorch marks and the slight smell of marshmallow curses. A round of cocoa (spiked liberally by each of them to their taste) was served by a bartender who knew better than to ask questions when a woman with a peony bouquet, an enchanted ledger, and a legally registered soul-bonded tiara showed up with a killer in a velvet hood.

“So,” Rosie said, opening the proceedings like a ledger. “The Great Evil is back. Again. Third time, actually. It’s now in the form of a pyramid scheme-slash-demon cult hybrid. Very scalable.”

“I told you we should’ve killed it harder the last time,” Thistle muttered, playing with a daffodil.

Morgana sipped her cocoa, grimaced, and sprinkled some herbs into it. “Violence isn't the only answer.”

“I brought poison,” said Velvet, cheerfully. “And a small curse. And a list.”

Seraphina leaned in. “Darling, is that my name on the list?”

“No,” Velvet said. “You’re in the annex. That’s the backup list. For when I’m bored.”

Rosie coughed. “Anyway. We’ll need the usual: reconnaissance, infiltration, overly dramatic distractions…”

“And cupcakes,” said Morgana, with finality. “We will have cupcakes.”

“Already in the bag,” said Thistle, thumping it on the table. “Exploding ones. Buttercream trigger.”

Velvet allowed herself a small smile. She had tried the solo thing — black-cloaked vengeance, shadow contracts, the lot — but nothing quite compared to blowing up a demon with your best friends and a fruit tart.

“Well then,” she said, eyes glinting like twin daggers dipped in glitter, “shall we save the world again?”

Rosie raised her mug. “To magical girls.”

“To middle-aged vengeance,” Seraphina toasted.

“To nap schedules,” Morgana whispered.

“To floral destruction,” Thistle growled.

Velvet just smiled. She had missed them.",23
1lrz8vr,n1fqbed,"The Tithe Man



On a windless street in the village of Shelf, among the foothills of the Ramtops, a mist rolled up against doors and shuttered windows like a wave washing against a cliff and then retreating. Each door and shutter was tied with golden-green yarn. 

The mist pressed on until it reached a home where no yarn tied the door, nor shutters closed the windows. The door swung open easily at the mist's insistence.

Before the fire burning in the hearth stood a woman, clutching an eight-year-old girl.

“I thought I’d see you,” said the woman. Her voice was that of a young mother.

In the doorway, a man was silhouetted against the mist outside.

“I will collect what is mine,” said the man. His voice was not young, and not a father's.

“Take me instead,” she pleaded, her voice trembling.

“They always say that.”

The mother hugged her daughter tight as tendrils of mist crept forward and squeezed between them, expanding inside their grip. The vapour shrouded the girl, who fell limp but was caught and lifted by the mist.

The mother fell to her knees and screamed — but only for a moment, as the mist enshrouded her too. She collapsed onto her hands and knees, struggling for breath.

As she gasped, she looked up to see the mist bearing away the sleeping body of the girl, cocooned in fog.

Then they were gone.

In the street, the wind picked up to a slight breeze.

In the cottage, the woman caught her breath... and transformed.

Her form slumped and shrank until, curled on the floor, was the young girl, weeping.

A shadow passed across the doorway.

“Come wi’ me, lass,” said an old woman.

  
\[This triggered some ideas for a story set in the Discworld. So here's a prologue for a story about a young witch-turned-assassin with intentions on revenge for the evil sprite that took her mother when she was young.)",8
1lrz8vr,n1fyziu,"Part 2:

People always want to know where it started.

They want to think there was a clear moment.

A rip in the sky, a comet, a sign from whatever god they stopped believing in when the monsters came.
But if you ask me, it was quieter than that.

I remember that night so clearly because it was the first time I almost died on the job.

The target was a big-time arms dealer, the kind that sells landmines to countries that don’t exist on any map.
 
I was twenty-two. 

A lousy excuse for an assassin, barely scraping enough to buy my equipments. It should’ve been simple: slit his throat in the club, disappear into the crowd.

Except that wasn’t what killed him.

Something else did. 

Something that looked like a man at first, but the longer you looked the more you realized its grin was too wide, its eyes were glassy holes, and when it touched him, it didn’t just rip out his heart. It became him.

That was my first encounter with a Hollow-Heart.

Mindless. Hungry. Wrong.

And worst of all, invincible.

***

They spread like wildfire. You could shoot them, bomb them, run them over with tanks. It didn’t matter. Bullets bounced on them uselessly.

The only way to harm them is getting lucky and turning their own claws on each other, but good luck doing that with your intestines on the floor.

They came in all shapes. Some small and rabid. Some like giants with skulls for faces and ribcages that opened up like iron maidens.

They didn’t kill because they needed to. They killed because they could.

And when they didn’t kill? They *corrupted.*
At first, it was stray dogs, rats, livestock. Then people. Entire towns turned inside out by the sickness in their claws and teeth.

Some of the infected never lost themselves completely. Those were the ones that crawled back to the cities wearing sunglasses and gloves, pretending they were still human.

***The Half-Hollows.***

No beating heart, no real warmth, just enough wit left to know they’d never belong again. 

*And enough power to make sure no one dared try to put them down.*",42
1lrz8vr,n1fzw9q,"Part 3:

If you’d met me when I was a kid, back when my hair was still black and my eyes didn’t look like someone drowned them in wine, you wouldn’t have thought *“future magical girl.”*

You’d have thought, *“That little psycho is gonna get himself killed trying to be cool.”*

Ah yes.

*Himself.*

See, I wasn't even a girl.

I was a boy with a battered DVD player and stacks of bootleg movies.

Ninjas in the shadows. Silent assassins who killed kings with poisoned needles.

Hitmen with codes of honor who drank whiskey after every job and vanished into neon alleyways.

Games, comics, manga, anything with a blade in the dark and a hero who *owned* the night.

I ate it up.

Hell, I *lived* it.

Other kids played soccer or learned the piano.
I practiced picking locks and throwing knives into a cardboard cutout taped to my bedroom door.
I told myself when I grew up, I’d be *just like them*, the untouchable ghost who could slip through a fortress, slit a throat, vanish with the sunrise.

A legend whispered about in underworld bars.

A king of shadows.

---

And then I grew up.

Turns out, real life doesn’t care about your edgy power fantasies.

Turns out, it’s a lot easier to get caught when you don’t have plot armor or a bottomless bank account for gadgets.

Turns out, people fight back, and they’re meaner and stupider than anything you read in a comic.

My first mark was a drug dealer with a shotgun under his pillow.

I botched it so bad I spent a month in a hospital bed.

My second mark was a man who pulled a knife on me and stabbed me in the thigh before I even got the piano wire around his neck.

By the time the Hollow-Hearts came knocking, I was still scraping by, the least respected assassin in a city that suddenly didn’t care about human scum anymore because *real monsters* were crawling through the streets.

---

I thought the world was over when I watched a Hollow-Heart tear through a line of tanks like tissue paper.

Turns out, someone else thought so too.
Because when the world’s heart flatlined, they showed up.

***The Heart-Beasts.***

No one saw them cross over. No rifts, no fanfare. Just sudden bursts of warmth and light in the middle of all that ruin, like new stars being born in the gutter.

They were beautiful, in a way that made your bones ache. Shapes that barely made sense to human eyes, a stag with wings made of glass, a serpent coiled in runes, a wolf that flickered between flesh and flame. They fought the Hollow-Hearts like predators tearing apart parasites. No mercy. No pause.

For a while, they turned the tide.

*For a while.*",42
1lrz8vr,n1g2aq3,"Part 4:

See, the thing no one tells you about the otherworldly Goddess and her beasts is this:

*They need faith.*

*They need connection.*

*They need the right soil for the roots to hold.*

Earth isn’t that.

We weren’t blessed by the same Goddess that made the Heart-Beasts strong in their own world. 

So here ? 

*Every breath they took cost them energy they didn’t have to spare.*

*Every swipe of a claw burned through more of what little they carried over.*

*They were dying.*

The Hollow-Hearts, though? They *thrived.*

Our hate, our fear, our petty violence, that was gasoline on their fire. 

And humanity, for all its grit and brilliance, makes a lot of fear. A lot of evil.

I watched it happen city by city.

A Hollow-Heart reeking of slaughter, growing bigger as the people cowered in their basements and whispered about the monsters they made.

It was hopeless.

We all knew it.

No bullets. No bombs. Not enough Heart-Beasts left to swing the balance.

But there’s always a whisper before the storm shifts.

I remember the first rumor, floating through the underground like a half-drunk prayer.

A Heart-Beast didn’t vanish. 

Didn’t fade.

It stayed, hidden, and bound to a *girl.*

Not a soldier. 

Not a witch. 

Just a girl. 

And somehow, the beast survived. 

Grew stronger. 

Didn’t bleed itself dry just to breathe Earth’s poisoned air.

They said she glowed with power when the fusion happened. Said she killed a dozen Hollow-Hearts with her bare hands. Said she looked like an angel and a nightmare all at once.

No one could confirm it. The Heart-Beasts wouldn’t talk. The people who saw it either vanished or lied.

But we heard it. 

*That heartbeat.*

The Goddess’s whisper that maybe, just maybe, she’d found a loophole.

*A way to keep her beasts here without letting them die.*

*A way to fight the Hollow-Hearts at their worst with girls who carried the best parts of both worlds in their blood.*",38
1lrz8vr,n1g7dku,"Part 5: 

The rumors spread.

The whispers that made drunks in back-alley bars laugh nervously before glancing over their shoulders.

*Girls.*

*Magical girls.*

Like something out of an anime I watched when I was seven.

A girl in a short skirt wielding a sword made of starlight, cutting monsters into ribbons.

A girl with a bow who shot arrows that turned Hollow-Hearts to mist.

Fairytales, I thought. Some new government black-ops scam to keep the masses calm while the monsters ate their kids.

Who’d believe it?

Not me. Not until the night I saw her.

***

It wasn't even a commissioned job.

A city councilman turned Half-Hollow.

A real piece of shit. 

Trafficked kids.

Smuggled Hollow-Heart bits to black market labs.

I wanted him dead so bad I didn’t even think about his security.

So I went in half-cocked, a cheap blade in my hand and pipe bombs strapped to my chest.

The bodyguards caught me before I even got close.

Half-Hollows — four of them, eyes like dead bulbs, skin all wrong under the streetlights.
They tore me apart like wet paper. Broke my ribs, crushed my knee, laughed while they did it.

I thought...

*...This is it. This is what all those movies forgot to mention.*

*Dying in a gutter, pissing yourself, no dramatic last words.*

But then ***she*** dropped out of the sky, all silver and moonlight, armor that gleamed like a blade fresh from the forge.

***Silver Paladin.***

She cut the first Half-Hollow in half. 

Just like that. 

No pause, no hesitation. 

Her sword hummed like a hymn while she fought, moving through them like they were shadows.

I remember her eyes. So bright, so tired, so *done* with this world’s shit.

She didn’t say, *“Stay down, citizen!”*

She didn’t say anything heroic. 

She just looked at me, bleeding in the rain, and said,
*""Try not to die, alright ?""*

Then she vanished into the smoke, chasing the rest of those bastards down like a wolf through a flock.

***

When the Hollow-Hearts came, the world stopped believing in heroes.

We just wanted survivors.

And yet, there she was. A 15 years old girl, draped in silver, fighting monsters with a sword made of starlight.

That night, I knew the rumors were real.

That night, I knew I’d never be what I’d dreamed of as a kid.

And for once, that didn’t make me angry.

*I could never expect, that, three months from now, I would be something akin to her.*",41
1lrz8vr,n1gnge5,"Part 6:

You’d think monsters who could tear through steel would make life better for someone like me, right?

Wrong.

Turns out, when you’re a second-rate assassin and your competition is now the Half-Hollows, people who can shrug off bullets, regrow limbs, and punch through concrete, you’re not even a footnote on the contracts list.

The Half-Hollow. Knowing they don't belong to both worlds, they hired themselves out. Mercenaries. Bodyguards. Assassins. Better than anything the underworld ever dreamed up. Better than me, back then. By a mile.

Clients stopped hiring humans altogether. Why pay a wannabe ninja when you can hire a Half-Hollow with claws like chainsaws ?

My reputation, already trash, sank so low I started taking charity jobs just to keep my knife hand steady.

Or even job I shouldn't have done.

***

You’d think after getting my ribs caved in by Half-Hollows I’d know when to quit.

But no. I was stubborn, or just stupid.

Three months later, I crawled back out with a half-healed leg and a blade taped to my thigh.

Same mark. Same target.

Same idiot assassin.

Only difference? I’d traded the pipe bombs for poisons. It didn’t help.

I got caught before I could even get the vial open.

The councilman’s new Half-Hollow guards cornered me in the back lot behind his club.

I remember the neon sign flickering overhead, painting the alley in pinks and blues, like the world was mocking me.

They didn’t even hurry this time.

They *enjoyed* it.

One cracked my jaw. Another buried its claws in my side. I could feel my guts spilling out, hot and slick in my palms.

*This is it,* I thought again.

The same damn realization, but this time there was no Silver Paladin to drop out of the sky for me.

*Then I saw it.*

Further down the alley, behind a stack of rusted trash bins.

A shape that twitched like a dying insect, limbs bent the wrong way, eyes like dying coals.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t Hollow-Heart either.

Not fully.

It was a mess.

Black carapace cracked open, pale white fur or feathers matted with blood, bones that pulsed like they were half-living runes.

It reeked of both Hollow-Heart rot and that otherworldly warmth I’d felt when Silver Paladin swung her sword.

A Heart-Beast, or at least something that had been one.

Even half-dead, it had that raw, magnetic pull. Like looking at a dying star and knowing it could still kill you if it flared the wrong way.

One of the Half-Hollow bodyguards sneered when he saw me staring.

“Pitiful, huh? Ran off from some lab. Mad doc’s toys don’t last forever—”

That’s when the thing’s head jerked up.
It looked right at me, eyes locking onto mine with a hungry, hateful light.

And then it *spoke.*

Or maybe it just howled inside my head, words bleeding into my skull like a hot iron brand.

*""Vessel.""*

*""Anchor.""*

*""You. Take you. Must not die.""*

The Half-Hollows didn’t notice.

They were too busy cracking jokes about how they’d peel my skin off after they were done.

The thing lurched forward, dragging itself across broken glass.

It shivered, claws twitching, drawing strange shapes on the wet concrete.

A circle.

Runes.

Marks I’d seen scrawled in blood in old smuggler’s grimoires, *Heart-Beast sigils.*

And then more.

Lines and symbols that didn’t belong, dark veins of Hollow-Heart corruption snaking through the design.

I tried to crawl away, half because I was dying, half because every nerve in my body was screaming *""This is wrong""*.

But the Half-Hollows backed off quick when they felt the magic charge the air.

They’re cowards like that, no loyalty to anything but their own survival.

***

It reached me.

Put a cracked, clawed hand on my chest.

It smelled like rotten roses and burning iron.

“Wait,” I croaked. “I don’t want—”

It didn’t care.

It poured itself into me like acid through glass.

I felt my bones snap, shrink, twist. 

Felt my skin crawl and reform like wax under a torch.

It was trying to make me a young girl.

Young enough for a magical girl contract.

Fifteen, the prime age.

But it was too weak. 

The magic sputtered, fizzed, grabbed onto whatever it could.

I felt my body compress, bones shortening, hair bleaching white, eyes burning red as the bond forged itself in my veins.

When it was done, I was a little girl.

A ten years old in a hoodie three sizes too big, bleeding all over the filthy alley.


And inside me, something alive. 

Something monstrous. 

Something *furious.*

A warped Heart-Beast. 

A corrupted Hollow-Heart.

And me — the world’s worst assassin — fused with both.",32
1lrz8vr,n1gzkdu,"Part 7: 

The Half-Hollows didn’t get it at first.

They were confused when they saw me — this tiny girl, swaying on trembling legs, eyes wide like a cornered cat.

“What the fuck ?” one of them sneered.

That’s when I drew the katana.

Longer than I was tall. Black steel humming with both our hungers.

I don’t remember moving.

I just remember the spray of blood hitting my face, hot and electric. 

The way the blade hissed when it cut through bone that used to shrug off bullets like confetti.

One went down. Then the next.

No fancy assassin tricks, just pure, boiling instinct.

The Heart-Beast half crying for salvation, the Hollow-Heart half howling for annihilation, and me, the fool in the middle, laughing through broken teeth.

When it was over, the alley was slick with gore. The neon lights turned everything pink and purple and lovely, like some twisted nightclub dream.

And the thing inside me, that half-broken monster, curled up in my ribs like a heartbeat that would never die.

---

People ask me now, *“Did you regret it ?”*

Would I have chosen to die in that alley instead of becoming what I am?

Truth is, I don’t know.

Sometimes I think I should’ve let them finish me, that would save the world a lot of trouble.

Other times, when my blade slides into another bastard who thinks he’s untouchable, I think—

*No. I was always meant for this.*

I wasn’t born to be a legend.

I wasn’t born to be a hero.

I was born to be the thing that crawled out of that alley.

A monster that hunts other monsters, an assassin that never misses twice.

Enough edgy monologues. Now, I will tell you, of the first time I met my ""sisters"".",29
1lrz8vr,n1h1fuh,"Part 8:

When the first girl in a frilly skirt put a Hollow-Heart in the ground on live TV, the world finally stopped pretending.

No more rumors whispered in underground bunkers.

No more blurry phone videos posted on conspiracy forums.

Just raw, brutal proof that something worked.

Something could kill the monsters that tanks and missiles couldn’t scratch.

The suits and generals came crawling fast after that.

They called them *Magical Girls*, because what else do you call kids who bond with spirit beasts and swing weapons made of starlight ?

It didn’t take long for someone to slap a price tag on it.

Whole departments sprang up overnight. 

*Magical Operations Bureaus.*

*Global Heart-Beast Liaison Offices.*

*Paranormal Asset Divisions.*

Everyone wanted a piece of the miracle.

They drafted contracts. “For the public good"", they said. You’d be paid by the confirmed kill. Paid more if you took out a dangerous Half-Hollow — the ones who kept their wits and built little kingdoms out of our apocalypse.

They made bounty boards, too.

Giant blinking screens in cities where the monsters still crawled.

Some girls fought for survival. 

Some fought for money. 

A few even fought because they liked the cameras and the crowds chanting their names.

---

Me ?

I didn’t have a choice.

I woke up after that alley massacre with a new face, a new voice, and a freak of a beast curled up in my chest like a loaded gun.

The local bureau scooped me up before I’d even wiped the blood off my blade.

I was sitting in a concrete bunker, wrapped in a stained hospital blanket, when some sweaty agent in a suit read me the fine print:

> *“Congratulations — you’re an officially registered magical girl.”*

They gave me my codename right there on the paperwork:

*Grey Assassin.*

I didn’t even get to pick it.

I won't complain, though. The name is badass as hell.

---

The rumors spread fast.

*The girl who took down a squad of Half-Hollow mercs with nothing but a rusted katana.*

They made me sound like a ghost story for monsters.

---

I didn’t complain.

The bounties kept me fed.

The fights kept me alive.

One monster at a time — Hollow-Hearts, Half-Hollows, even a few humans who’d figured out how to milk the apocalypse for profit.

I worked alone.

Didn’t trust anyone enough to watch my back.

Didn’t care about any “team” or “sisterhood.” That was for the bright-eyed kids who still believed in hope and hugs.

---

Then I met her again.

Silver Paladin.

Armor like a fallen star. Eyes like a thunderstorm on a summer night.

I’d been tracking a Heart-Eater — one of the big ones, so bloated with corruption it could melt a city block in minutes. I’d stalked it through sewers, parking garages, an abandoned cathedral crawling with lost souls too scared to leave.

I thought I’d cornered it, blade ready to slip into its core like a whisper of death.

Instead, I walked right into an ambush.

The Heart-Eater and half a dozen Hollow-Hearts snarling in the dark.

And her.

Standing between them and a family of survivors she’d herded into the cathedral’s crumbling crypt.

Silver cape shredded. 

Sword cracked at the hilt. 

But her stance ? 

Unbroken.

Like the world could end around her and she’d still swing that blade.

---

I didn’t think.

I just stepped out of the shadows, black katana in hand, the freak inside me howling for blood.

We tore them apart together, her cutting arcs of silver through bone and carapace, me darting in the blind spots, blade slipping under plates, twisting through soft meat.

Two storms in the same cage.

When it was over, we stood ankle-deep in Hollow-Heart muck, both of us gasping like dogs.

She looked at me, really *looked* at me.

Just like that night in the rain.

---

She smirked, tired but proud. “You’re good. Dangerous. You shouldn’t be alone.”

I spat blood, flicked ichor off my blade. “I work alone.”

She stepped forward, offered her hand — metal gauntlet flecked with monster blood.

“We’re building something. A team. The strongest. So none of us die alone in the dark again.”

---

And just like that...

The assassin who never trusted anyone but the shadows ended up with a new family:

The Silver Paladin, who made my worst day mean something.

The Crimson Archer, who could out-drink me and out-shoot God.

The White Priestess, who swore she’d find what was left of my soul and patch it up.

The Violet Mage, who giggled at the freak in my chest and called it “kinda cute.”

The Golden Lancer, the Black Barbarian, the Pink Tank — sisters I never asked for, but bled beside again and again.

They called us the strongest.

The impossible.

The nightmares hunter.

And me ?

I was still the Grey Assassin, but for once, *I am not alone.*",26
1lrz8vr,n1he5ot,"Part 9:

People love to talk about our final battle — the Overlord, the three-day siege, the screaming skies lit up like a battlefield pyre.

They forget where it started.

Where *we* started.

They forget we were just a mess of stubborn freaks with bad tempers and worse childhoods, stitched together under a cracked silver banner.

---

It was the first mission we all took together, the *big* one, the one that made people across the world realize there was a new nightmare for nightmares.

The bounty read like a joke:
A Brood-King Hollow-Heart.

Seven stories tall by the way.

Armored like a tank battalion.

It’d nested in the bones of an abandoned airport, turned the hangars into hatching pits for lesser Hollow-Hearts, dozens of them dripping from the ceiling like diseased fruit.

No single girl could take that thing.

No local bureau wanted to send *their* prized magical assets on a suicide run.

But us ?

We were too stupid, or too desperate, to back down.

---

I remember standing in the ruined control tower, wind howling through shattered glass.

Silver Paladin laid out the plan on a map spread across a broken console.

Crimson Archer cracked her knuckles and asked, “How many arrows you think I’ll need?”

Violet Mage muttered about ley lines and air pressure and some nonsense I didn’t care to follow, as she was already drawing glowing runes on her arms, grinning like a pyromaniac with a new matchbox.

The White Priestess just kept tracing her fingers across a battered charm. I think she prayed for all of us that night, even me, the half-monster with the katana and the moral code of a rabid dog.

Golden Lancer talked to her unicorn in made-up language only those two understand.

Black Barbarian and Pink Tank, the twin, they just telepathy talking to eachother. I'm pretty sure they have this ability even before becoming magical girls.

And me ?

I just checked my blade. Ran my thumb along the edge until it cut.

Sometimes the old edgy assassin habits never die.

---

We hit them at dawn.

Silver Paladin went first, always first, crashing through the rotten tarmac on a beam of moonlit steel. 

Her sword cleaved into the Brood-King’s outer shell, ringing like a cathedral bell.

It bellowed, a sound that rattled the broken windows for miles.

The little ones swarmed.

That was my cue.

I moved in the shadows below its legs, carving through the spawn as they dropped like living bombs.

The Heart-Beast inside me sang its broken hymn, the Hollow-Heart half shrieked for blood. Every time I cut one down, I felt my pulse sync with that corrupted thrum. We were two freaks keeping each other alive.

Above me, Crimson Archer danced on the skeletons of old cargo planes, her bow string a blur of red light. Every shot split a newborn Hollow-Heart in two.
Her laughter echoed across the tarmac, reckless, bright, the sound of a girl who’d given up fear a long time ago.

Violet Mage conjured storms from thin air. She rode her rocket-broom like a witch from an apocalypse fairytale, launching runes that turned the King’s minions to smoldering ash.

Beside her, Golden Lancer was riding her unicorn, charging right forward with her lance on fire.

The White Priestess patched us up on the fly, her chants wrapping our wounds in shimmering bandages that pulsed with borrowed warmth.

Pink Tank, ever the gentle giant, shielded us from as much attacks as possible with her even more giant pair of tower shields. Crushed some Hollow-Hearts with her shields and her body.

Black Barbarian charging through the swarm like an unstoppable juggernaut in a small girl's body with comically huge hammer.


---

But the Brood-King didn’t care.

It shrugged off our hits, flung Silver Paladin through a crumbling terminal like she weighed nothing.

The air reeked of its foul birthing pits — eggs split open, more Hollow-Hearts clawing their way out.

I felt the panic building in my ribs, that old failed assassin’s voice that said, *Run. Slip away. Live another day.*

But then I heard her, the Silver Paladin, shouting through broken teeth, her cape dragging sparks across the ruin.

""Grey! With me!""

No orders. No hesitation. Just a call.

---

We hit it together.

Silver Paladin climbed its spiked carapace, sword blazing like a second sun.

I wove through its legs, each step a flicker between shadows and broken daylight.

When she reached its crown, she slammed her blade down. The armored plates cracked. 

Just enough.

And me ? I slipped through that crack like water.
Katana driving deep into the pulsing nest of rotten hearts that kept the King alive.

I remember its scream.

The whole airport shaking, windows shattering a mile away.

It died with its children still wriggling at its feet.

---

When the sun rose, we stood there, drenched in gore and half-laughter.

The Paladin’s armor destroyed, Archer has a broken arm yet still grinning like a feral fox, the Mage perched on her rocket-broom, trying to cover up her wounds with magic to not make people worry, next to her are the Priestess and Lancer on the horseback, looking terrible, but still alive and relatively healthy. The Pink Tank, who took the most attacks, somehow only gotten dirty. Her sister though, look like she just returned from hell.

And me, the Grey Assassin, monster among monsters, the freak who trusted no one, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with girls who should’ve run screaming from what I’d become.

---

We were a pack now.

A pack of devils wearing pretty skirts and steel halos, ready to rip out the world’s infected heart one monster at a time.",30
1lrz8vr,n1lb9sx,"Part 10:

You’d think the Brood-King would’ve been the peak, the final boss.

But monsters don’t care about your story arc. 


They keep breeding, keep rotting, keep crawling out of whatever nightmare hole spawned them.

So we kept fighting.

---

After the airport, we weren’t just a pack anymore.

 We were *the pack*.

Other girls called us reckless, unstable.

 Tabloids nicknamed us the “Death Brigade,” the “Howling Huntresses,” the “Apocalypse Angels.”

The bounties got bigger. The threats got meaner.
And us ? We got better.

Violet Mage learned how to bend the Heart-Beasts’ magic flow in ways the Bureau magic researchers called “impossible”. She also learned how to draw magical energy from the Earth's air and purify it into Heart-Beasts' home planet's pure magical energy. She was experimenting making an ultimate move: A single magic beam that was a convergence of seven different elemental beams, including fire, ice, water, earth, lightning, wind, and life force (???). Last Rainbow, she named it.

Used these knowledges, combined with science knowledges of her own, Silver Paladin devised an ultimate move of her own. Drawing magical energy from both herself and the atmosphere into her Heart-Beasts, effectively turning it into a nuclear reactor by sequentially mashing all three sources of magical energy (herself, the Heart-Beasts, and nature) up then divided them out with extremely high speed akin to a particle accelerator to created nuclear fusion, fission, then intensify the energy by surging them all out of her body before converging them to the blade of her sword, then release them all from the tip with a mighty swing.

... That's... Just... [Excalibur](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/typemoon/images/e/e2/Excalibur_UBW_%28Ufotable%29.gif/revision/latest?cb=20240501032649), isn't it ???

Not want to be fell behind, Crimson Archer learned about dust explosion, thermobaric explosives, and managed to made an ultimate move for herself, too.

Using magic to turn all dusts and debris floating during a fierce battle into thermobaric explosives.

A single arrow made of flame that can level an entire city with proper setup.

Okay, I'm officially done. That's... Just Sukuna's Divine Flame. 

At least Excalibur was also used in a magical girl series.

With Violet Mage's help, White Priestess finally reached a level, where she can instant regenerate all damage no matter how severe, and literally resurrect people as long as they haven't been dead past 3 days...

Jesus. Was her His fabled Second Coming ?

I mean, with her saint-like behaviours, maybe ???

Pink Tank... Apparently, she can now combine her pair of shields into an even bigger and stronger than the sum of its components. She can also detach her armor to combine with her shields for an even stronger one.

Black Barbarian can now bulk up into a even bigger Amazoness than her sister. She can also gigantify her already ridiculously big hammer, by the way.

Golden Lancer... Her lance fucking evolved. Into a pair of lances that can be combined into one. Its head could spin like a drill now. It can also gather magical energy in air and accelerate them. Her unicorn turned into a golden mechanical one now. Or maybe, it just got fully armored.

---

And me ?

I stopped being the freak at the edge of the fire.

I still killed from the shadows, always would. That’s what an assassin does.

But they taught me to stand with them.

To *fight* with them, not just *beside* them.

It was Crimson Archer who said it first, after I slit the throat of a Broodmother Hollow-Heart that almost tore her in half:

> “You’re not our knife in the dark, Grey.
> You’re our wolf. Our blade at the throat of the impossible.”

It stuck with me.

I spent my whole life dreaming to be some tragic lone shadow, a blade without ties.

And here I was, covered in monster guts, these weird, terrifying girls screaming my name like it meant hope.

---

Oh, you meant that did I receive any ""buff"" ? 

Tragically, *no.*",13
1lsb0zj,n1lkzvh,"I was whisked away into the IMA's main containment facility, the ""Qabu Mamnue Fortress"", alongside my dear wife. Normally, a mortal like me should not even be aware of these things, but because of my beloved Kalara, I was given this privilege as long as I took an oath of secrecy. 

Kalara looked pleadingly as she spoke to the man with a white beard leading the four Nu-level fire mages escorting me, an Archmage who specializes in spatial magic judging from his attire and overall aura, while I somehow remained nonchalant through it all. Honestly, I am anxious and confused about this whole affair. I'm scared that I will be away from my wife, forced to spend my life behind the walls of this damn facility. I hope that there's nothing wrong with me...but as long as Kalara's with me, I don't really feel like losing my cool just yet. We'll get through this together.

""Pi Kilmetras, this must be a mistake."" Kalara shakily spoke. ""I've known my husband for a long time, and I can promise you that he is harmless! I am willing to swear an oath of death for him, to vouch for his innocence!""

Kilmetras, the white-bearded Pi-level Archmage, frowned lightly as he looked at my wife. However, I sensed an odd feeling of uncertainty and even a hint of fear from him...as his gaze met mine. Huh...never thought an Archmage would be scared of a mortal.

""Your dedication and faith to your husband is admirable, Omicron Kalara."" Kilmetras spoke, his gruff voice measured and calm. It seems no one but me noticed the tremor in his voice as he referred to me. ""But dedication alone is not enough. The IMA demands concrete proof that he is not the source or carrier of magic at the omega level.""

The Omega level he spoke of is basically the highest possible level of magic possible, or at least recognized by the IMA Magic Quality Tier. This kind of level has never appeared before. My dear wife taught it to me, when I innocently asked her during our 3rd date on how strong she really was.

My wife Kalara is a gifted Omicron who specializes in the weather and can cause country-spanning thunderstorms if she wants to, Kilmetras is a Pi who can swap the Atlantic and the Pacific if he wants to, and the strongest mage right now, the individual known only as ""The Overseer"", the head of the IMA, is only a Sigma-level mage. That guy has been rumored to cause time itself to halt, speed up or even forcibly move time forward or back by millenia. Despite him being only two levels higher than Kilmetras, the gap between levels only grows wider the higher you go--an Eta is closer to a Theta than an Omicron is to a Pi, so you can only imagine how far above everything else an Omega-level is.

""But there IS proof! Our marriage documents, his own catalogue registering him as a mortal, he--""

The rest of her speech was cut off as space bent and scattered, the sound waves dissipating and diffusing into reality as though she was merely mouthing the words. She quickly realized this and stopped speaking. I frowned. 

""Rude bastard."" I whispered to myself, not willing to let him hear it.

""Enough."" Kilmetras cut off. ""We will get to the bottom of this matter today. If he is what you say he is, the two of you will be compensated for this debacle. But if he isn't...""

He met my eyes again. This time, he couldn't properly hide the apprehension within them. He used his mastery over space once more, folding reality around us to bring us to the lowest level of the fortress in the blink of an eye. I'm not sure why...but I get the feeling that even time has been removed here. A security measure, I guess. After all, it's easy to avoid a disaster when it technically never happens--what with it being removed from time, and all that.

The lowermost level was a vast and mostly empty cubic room with black stone. If one looked closely, countless runes were etched upon the stone. The only thing within the room was a multi-colored globe in the middle of the room...and a cloaked man standing behind the globe, looking down at it.

""Overseer..."" Kilmetras' tone took on a theme of reverence as he and the other mages, including my wife, knelt as beads of sweat began dripping down their faces. ""I have brought you the anomaly.""

The Overseer looked up, meeting my gaze. I vaguely felt pressure pushing against my eyes, but I only had to shake it off to be rid of it. Honestly, I should be terrified witless at this point...or even dead just from the man's ambient power...but I felt nothing of the sort. I mean, I do feel terrified, I just...I guess I still have enough sense to remain calm. I just stood there, looking blankly at him...waiting for what will happens next. I looked at my wife and took her hand in mine--she immediately looked less worried than before, and I couldn't help but smile at her. 

""You did well, Kilmetras."" The Overseer sounded younger. He sounds more like a young man in his 20s, instead of an immortal who has seen Millenia pass. He waved his hand, covering everyone else except me with a violet aura. I watched as everyone soon retraced their steps as though they were on rewind, everyone except for me...and my wife, who looked on in horrified realization at the whole event.

""You did very well, indeed..."" The Overseer's voice echoed, a hint of surprise hidden within, and the many runes etched within the room suddenly began to flash violet.",8
1ls4ndp,n1fvb6t,"I was used to their shenanigans.  
They were lively people, what can I say?  
Annoying, loud, cheerful, but kind...  
Dancing, partying, or praying to who knows what to the point of screaming, but always brought me leftovers, and stuff, so it was okay.  
Now though...  
It's been 15 minutes of silence, and when I look outside, they just stand there, unblinking, staring at my window.  
What the hell is going on?

  
Minutes pass and I pull my curtains back.  
They are creeping me out...more than usually.  
Why are they staring at my window? Motionless? Not blinking?  
I fidget a bit, then with my phone ready to call the cops, I go outside.  
Looking at them...they ignore me.  
They continue looking at my window.  
What is going on?

  
""Hey? Matt? Susanne? Kids? What are you doing?"" I ask them from the porch.  
No answer.  
No movement.  
No reaction whatsoever.  
I go towards them, to see what they might be looking at.  
Getting closer, I see something off about them.  
They are twitching, sweating a lot, their eyes are trembling inside their sockets.  
Then I look at the window...  
And freeze.

  
In the window stand a tall women.  
Bright red hair, spring green dress, smiling, and waving at us.  
B-but I was in the window.  
There was no one there.  
Then...she sees me.  
Her smiles widens, threatening to leave her face.  
Then she disappears.  
My neighbors start crying, and praying, then...they go back to normal, and start laughing, the kids playing, going back to their yard...  
I am confused, shocked and terrified...  
All my stuff is inside...where She is.  
What should I do now?",15
1ls2f0d,n1fhzvq,"""What could be even be stranger than this?"", asks Michael.

""Well, there was one time when I woke up at home only to find a casket right next to my bed. It was all covered in chains and everything. Proper spooky stuff."", John answered.

""And... What happened to that casket?"", Michael inqured.

""Well I kinda just shrugged and went to make myself some coffe. While it was brewing, I heard some noise from my room, and when I got there to take a look, the window was wide open. There was dirt everywhere. And the casket was nowhere to be found. I was kinda angry about the dirt, but what could I do?"", John explained.

""Anyways, I closed the window, cleaned up the dirt, and went to make a police report. Though I am pretty sure they thought I was some weirdo and just threw my report in the trash. I did install locks on my windows though, even if I live on the fifth floor.""

""Okay, John, listen... I am not sure what to even say right now... Okay, firstly, that was spooky sure, but I don't think it was as crazy as you being turned into a talking cat. I mean, look at you!"", Michael protested, waving his hands in Johns general direction.

John, meanwhile, was a slightly bigger than average tabby cat at that moment. He was lying on the desk with his paws slightly hanging off the edge. His eyes were half-closed, as if bored.

""Well Michael, I am quite sure that this will pass. I doubt that I will remain a cat for the rest of my days. And besides, this is quite an interesting feeling. You would not believe how different it feels to have fur! And claws! Actual, retractable claws!"", and as John was saying this, he raised one of his paws and extended his claws in demonstration.

""Jooohn... This is ridiculous. How can someone be turned into a cat and be this unbothered by it?!"", Michael said. John, upon hearing those words, stood up and walked a bit closer to him. John then rubbed the top of his head on Michaels hand, as if to reassure him. Michael, perhaps reflectively, upon feeling this, started to pet him.

""Yeah, that feels nice..."", said John. Michael recoiled.

""What the hell, dude! Gross!""

""Ugh, fine. Well, good luck with freaking out, I guess."", John replied and started walking away. Michael watched mutely as John quckly made his way to a pillow on the couch, curled up and promptly fell asleep, as if he was a cat his whole life.

Michael was still distressed. However, he did not want to wake his friend up. Even if it was noon. So he decided to go outside to calm down a bit. Michael spent more than a bit of time outside, most of it in the local park, just thinking about the recent events and trying to figure out what to do. He eventually settled on going back to check on his friend. It was evening by that point.

After he reached his friends house and entered, he found his friend still sleeping on the couch, curled up. The main difference from the last time though, was the fact that John was now once again human. Deciding not to wake his friend, he just leaves him there, closing the door behind him.

The next morning, John texted Michael ""hey, im back to normal. wanna hang out tday?"".

""I guess he really is fine."", thought Michael, before quickly agreeing. Upon meeting up with John, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

""I told you not to worry. Everything is all right."", said John when questioned. Maybe trusting your friends more is in order was the conclusion Michael came to. This was not the last time something strange happened to John, and indeed strange things seemed to follow him, but that is a story for another time.",36
1ls2f0d,n1fib5k,"""What the fuck do you mean you been in stranger situation your a freaking goo giant monster"" Mike screams as he look upon my 10 foot tall monster humanoid form.

""i mean first yeah with the mutiple eyes and mouth able to look like anything but human see..."" he play around with his face till he look like a Corgi. ""who would be afraid of this face when they see me?"" 

""that not the point Jake you should try to change back to normal before people hunt you or tried to experiment on your fucking ass"" 

""oh come on you don't think i know or care. I'm something unknown and no one is going to you know kill me or try to hunt me down after their last attempt lost so many soldier."" 

""what you fucking kill people!?"" 

""WTF!!  NO!"" you yelled. ""I just have them inside of me in the meantime till those bastard decide to act like civil being and talk to me face to face like human than animals"" 

""what do you mean they inside of you""

""Dude do you hear yourself you a fucking monster."" 

""Mike, monster don't keep people alive, monster don't want to live in peace, monster want chaos and want power."" you say with a deep voice as the room rumble. ""I don't want to turn back to who i was before but i'm not letting myself become someone toy, experiments, or example of monster  to kill.""

""Please Jake... just do this for me you know this is not normal, just let them go and bring yourself in."" Mike say

1lrtnx7,n1dhcjc,"""Hardship. Builds. Character."" He said, somehow ignoring the agony of his current experience.

The matter got to the point that most rooftops, seats, 'non-walk' areas, and so on, are made with jagged, lethal geometry - or are 'enhanced to prevent homeless occupation' with them.

And he's sleeping on a particularly gnarly area of jagged geometry. He then has the gall to add-  
""Whoever's idea of this, makes me sick.""

I had no comeback. Had to go home and rethink everything.

Did come back next day to see him using a mining apparatus to remove every single spike. Didn't have the will to stop him, so I said hello, got him something to eat, then left after we had lunch and spoke of more mundane matters, such as how said meal costed upwards of £60 for two burgers, two mugs of chips, and two bottles of ice-coffee, from a successor to the golden-arch brand whose name I cannot mention for reasons that will be self-evident to some.

Next thing I know it, supers - heroes, and villains - began forming a 'Union of Unusual People', and I ended up in it.

Whole thing was meant to fix the root of all this evil.

So... we unseat every insensible world authority within days, and slowly work on homogenising laws and cross-nationalizing community and personal support programmes.

By the end of the month, we had a party. The party's food supply costed the same as that one meal did; £60.  
That, was the day we felt like we did a heroic thing...

Then the villainous members began working on complex interconnected contingencies to ensure this state of affairs persists for so long as humankind does, with our next goal?

Up there.

By 'there', I mean space.",185
1lrtnx7,n1ds4a8,"'Ooze' looked up at the hero, or at least that is what the odd movement of the rather jelly-like villian's head area implied, ""I believe that is the intent, yes,"" they replied in their odd echoing voice, ""Ooze has been ousted from their lair by one of your kin again. Ooze does not worry about bad sleeping posture like other homeless though,  so they decided to leave the good sleeping spaces for others,"" they concluded with a wobble of movement some would call a shrug.

For a while, the hero 'Psy' stared at the amorphous villian before giving a shrug of her own, ""Well, you are not technically committing a crime at present so I will not arrest you, but just... stay out of trouble you hear me?"" She ordered, trying to put a degree of sternness to her voice.  Ooze was not exactly a highly dangerous villian after all, just a problematic one to fight.

---

A few weeks later, Psy happened past that same spot on her patrol and noticed a council crew installing a new layer of spikes along the underpass where Ooze had been sleeping. When she landed to check on the workers, she noticed the space was not just smooth but even shaped in a way that would be comfortable to lie upon. 

According to the work crew, this was happening all over the city. One by one, every single homeless prevention measure the council has installed has been ruined and turned into rather comfortable rest spots.  Oddly enough, most citizens seem happy with the change, finding new spaces to sit and lie around the city rather than the annoyingly shaped benches from before.

Psy considered the situation as she flew on.  It was almost certain Ooze was behind the changes and it was, technically, illegal.  Still, compared to melting through a bank vault to rob the place, perhaps this particularly villainy could be overlooked for now.  There was even a wonderfully comfortable seat melted into her favourite brooding spot up on the bridge after all...",57
1lrtnx7,n1dqpss,"""I'm not sleeping \*on\* them, I'm sleeping \*in between\* them. See the difference?"" He asks, with me unable to say much to reply to that. He sure wasn't sleeping on the tips, but rather the bases of said spikes. I guess there's nothing I can do about it. Not that I'd fare well picking a fight with a super.

Before I can really move, he turns to look at me, his eyes harboring both unbreakable will and overwhelming apathy, though not directed at me specifically. ""You know why I'm considered a villain? Because I dare to do what  all those other goody-two-shoes refuse to do. I make the noise everyone else is afraid of doing. I always try to make clear what's really wrong, but nooooooo. The others are so brainwashed to be so stupidly lawful, you'd assume they all went to law school. Law is law and everything is underneath it. Well? Laws are flawed. They just can't see that. Now let me keep doing my work."" He turned back around, my shoulders slumping a little bit.

""Well, I guess I'll be rooting for you then. Good luck."" I turned around and kept on my way, though I think I saw a little grin on his face as I started walking away. Maybe he's just happy knowing that not everyone is as stupid as to believe all news that are being fed. I know I'm all in for doing the right thing... Homeless prevention spikes were a pretty stupid idea to begin with.

The next day, I saw him on the news, once more being arrested as he had been many times only to leave prison again in less than a week. ""Give them homes you assholes!"" He shouted before being stuffed in the police car that was his ride to his cell... Though I notice something. He's only got regular handcuffs around his wrists. It's almost as if the heroes wanted him to keep going. Perhaps they do. Perhaps he knows.

1lrtnx7,n1esx5e,"“You said it yourself. They are homeless spikes. I’m homeless.. what’s your excuse?” His voice was iron filings on steel.

“Where else would I sleep? My wife kicked me out, my henchmen call me a DiCtAtoRiAL LeAdEr, and apparently you can’t couch-surf in a lair you just blew up. My dad doesn't speak to me anymore..”

I took a wary half-step back. “I… didn’t ask for your..”

My left foot froze mid-pivot. A magenta force-field snapped into place around us, fizzling against the anti-homeless spikes like neon rain.

“No, no, no,” he purred, wagging a gloved finger. “You posed the question, young man. Etiquette dictates you endure the monologue.”

He lounged deeper onto the metal prongs, cape rustling like cheap foil. “Comfort is a privilege. Deny it to the masses long enough and they’ll crown the first man who can nap anywhere. That man is me.”

A distant siren whooped; the field brightened.

“So,” he concluded, eyes glittering, “lesson delivered. Discomfort weaponised. Branding secured.”

The shield vanished, my momentum returned.. and I toppled face-first onto the spikes he’d just vacated.

*Annoyoman won. Again.*",16
1lrtnx7,n1fvyiw,"“Okay,” I said, raising my arms, my coat billowing dramatically in the gusting wind. “I know you’re a supervillain and all, but... WHY are you sleeping on those anti-homeless spikes?”

The figure didn’t stir for a moment. He lay sprawled across a bed of gleaming stainless steel spikes that jutted from the concrete bench like the sharp appendages of an angry sea urchin, designed to keep people away. A tattered, dirty blanket was draped over his legs, and black gloves covered his hands, which seemed oddly formal against the harshness of his surroundings, framing what might have once been a fine suit jacket.

Finally, the villain turned his head to look at me, his mask resting beside him. He had soft, almost gentle eyes, unexpected on a man infamous for demolishing two government buildings and flooding a data center with champagne. His expression was a mix of smug satisfaction and weary resignation, a complexity that made him feel all too human.

“That you even have to ask,” he said slowly, his voice low and deliberate, “is precisely the point.”

He shifted slightly, wincing as the jagged metal bit into his back. “I lie here because I must. These spikes are a painful hindrance for those wandering this area, people who are simply trying to find comfort, shelter, or a moment's peace. I detest being outside in the biting cold,” he said firmly. “Yet I remain... because I have to.”

I blinked in surprise. “So... you’re protesting? With your own body?”

“Protesting. Exposing. Reminding,” he answered. “Label it however you wish.”

As I glanced around, I noticed a couple of pedestrians had stopped, their eyes wide and phones raised to capture the scene. One individual was already live-streaming; another nervously placed a blanket beside the spikes, uncertain of what to do next. This moment was about to go viral.

“You blew up a courthouse last month,” I said quietly, the weight of the statement pressing down on us both.

“And the month before that,” he replied without hesitation. “They were erecting another one, complete with a million-dollar anti-homeless fence. They called it ‘fortification against loitering.’ I call it what it is: institutional cruelty disguised in steel and concrete.”

He winced again, shifting his position on the unforgiving spikes. “I figured that words alone wouldn’t suffice. So I sacrifice my body, my pain, my absurdity. If seeing me here makes you uncomfortable, good. Now imagine how it feels for someone who didn’t choose this.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but the words evaporated before I could voice them. He wasn’t wrong. But deep down, I struggled with the realization that he was still the villain. Wasn’t he?

“I thought you wanted to destroy the system,” I finally said, wrestling with the complexity of the moment. “Not… sleep on it.”

He offered a wry smile at that. “Destruction begins with visibility.”

Then, slowly, he closed his eyes, surrendering to the pain and the cold, returning to the spikes that seemed to absorb the weight of his message.

And for the first time, I didn’t see a supervillain. I saw a mirror reflecting a harsh truth.",13

""Negative emotions,"" he replied, to which Pythron nodded.


""I can only eat so much misery in this city before I need alternatives,"" the snakelike villain said as a spike drove into his shoulder. ""Also, I was trying to figure out how fakirs handle those beds of nails.""


Professor Zenith chuckled at the latter motivation, but was surprised when Pythron added, ""On that topic, did you know 60% of the homeless in this city also look into how fakirs lie on beds of nails? Gotta give them props for determination.""",6
1ls2xqv,n1gcqzu,"""Nah, we tried that already."" A spokesperson for humankind began to explain-  
""But they gave the same answer. Too culturally and biologically diverse. At best 30% of our people would fit with them, and with your G.U.

To that end I've one last thing to say to you."" The spokesperson leans over the table at the robot holoprojecting the G.U emissary of invitations.

The emissary gives a smug, uncaring look, but what was said next had them concerned.  
""Your union's aversion to diversity?""  
The spokesperson looms.  
""Not my problem.""  
The spokesperson then taps a button on a tablet, cutting off the emissary's connection before the autotranslate could complete translating their panicked response.",35
1ls2xqv,n1ioort,"I punched the ambassador, not metaphorically, or with a soft fist bump to the ribs like a kind friend; no, it was to his squishy grey head. The soft, cold flesh deformed around the impact as the blow sent the well-dressed alien sprawling out on the floor. It’d been an entire week of hell, and I’d finally been given credence to consider this union a foe to our nation.

As a man, I was satisfied, but as a diplomat, it was far from it as I cleaned my bloody fist amidst the chamber’s silence. I was tired of the unfaithful negotiations and ill-fated agreements of submission as I shifted my gaze toward my close aid, frozen to his seat. “W-w-what the fuck. Have you lost your damn mind?”

I kept my gaze on the fellow as I wiped the still fresh blood from my knuckles using my handkerchief. “They were a friend or foe, and they made their stance known. The senate was clear back home when they gave me their demands.”

“You killed him! They’ll kill us now!” 

I clicked my tongue in agitation as I threw him the card in my pocket for the docked vessel. “Get the captain ready to depart. This isn’t the first body I’ve had to bury.” 

The aide was quick to sprint out the door as I shook my head. First impressions were important, and diplomatically, the union had tried to bend humanity over the table. Still, there is a dull tremor in my hand as I kick the corpse under the conference room table. 

I’d fought in wars, killed men and women, but starting a war was another matter. And yet, before long, I was on my way back home as I walked peacefully through the corridors of a nation whose bureaucrat I’d just killed.

I hated this damn station, from rattling air vents to the stench of filth in the atmosphere, but this venture had been fruitful. Maybe this “ravaging horde” might be more agreeable. ",20
1lrzs2c,n1fe090,"Raven found the traps in the ancient temple numerous, but clumsy. Most had rusted and malfunctioned due to age. Yet, the strangest thing that stood out to him was how the spikes were pointed. Not outward, in the direction where a tomb raider would enter. 

Inward, towards whatever was inside.

A black demon draped in torn rags, shackled at the very bottom of the temple's end. One that howled and threatened to end his life. The creature stood as tall as the chains would permit it, hands raised to gather a fiery ball of Hellfire to throw at Raven.

Who deflected it as he would any ordinary fireball spell.

""If that's your best shot, you're outdated,"" the adventurer mocked the entity, who only kept throwing more fireballs in his direction. ""You need to do better than that.""

It huffed and puffed. It breathed flames and conjured fire. Yet nothing that Raven couldn't handle with his myriad of protective charms and spells. Turned out, being sealed for hundreds of years while the temple and its traps deteriorated had also caused the demon to weaken over the years. All those tales of a terrifying guardian of the temple was only because the people did not have the current arsenal and understanding of magic as they did back when they first sealed the demon away.

""Where's the treasure?"" The adventurer demanded the demon tell him.

""None worth dying for,"" the demon's response was solemn. ""This temple was built to open a gateway to hell. To summon others like me. As you can see for yourself, nobody comes here to call upon us anymore.""

""I don't like repeating myself. Where's the treasure?""

""I did not lie. There is none. This is not a vault. This is a summoning temple. Any summoning artifacts and catalysts have been taken away by the surviving temple acolytes.""

""Hmph, then this is a waste of my time,"" Raven snorted and strode out of the room.

""Wait,"" the demon called out to him. ""I can make it worth your time, if you would make a contract with me.""

Raven kept walking and never turned back. Contracts with supernatural entities rarely ended well for a human. Perhaps, this was the real trap left behind. Or in the deranged minds of ancient cultists, the real treasure. But Raven knew better than those fools.",10
1lrzs2c,n1f2pq5,"Now, seeing the creature chained in the middle of this room, it all makes sense.  
All the traps, all the puzzles, all the creatures...

No.  
They were meant to keep THAT inside.  
""Hello, stranger.

""Because I am dangerous."" he laughs, his voice booming.  
I flinch...not expecting him to be so straightforward.

  
I take out my sketchbook, ready to draw him, and his tattoos.  
Asuras have been eradicated from our planet more than 4 thousand years ago, after a terrible war, as they were pushed back to their Hell.

I freeze.  
""Young elf? I will let you know that I am Chief Explorer of the High-Elf tribe Moonstone, 2010 years..."" I start then stop.  
Maybe for him...2000 is a young age.  
""I see. My apologies, ""Chief"". May I ask whether you will be so kind to free me?   
Or are you here just for my body?"" he winks.  
I am shocked.

  
""H-How dare you! I...I am not some sort of..."" I start, but then stop.  
What did he say? Free him?  
""You are an Asura. There are still legends about your kind even after 4 thousand years...  
You think I would free you?"" I ask.  
""I don't know. Worth a shot. Anyway, I am alone, and I am done with war, at least on you guys...  
My own people that betrayed me? Well...they are a different story."" he says.  
I almost believe him. Almost.  
""I can shapeshift, and disappear. No one would know...unless you want me to keep you company."" he teases me again.  
I leave.  
He calls after me, but I need time...this discovery might be great for us, as Asuras were known to be able to live in any environment, and that skill is needed with what is going on worldwide.  
But...I need to think this through.",11

  So I did what I was taught by my grandpa to do when fear had me paralyzed. I walked up to the shadow figure and said ""Hello. I'm Sam. May I help you with something?""

  I didn't know until that moment that a shadowy, featureless figure could so clearly show surprise. After a moment, I felt a voice in my head say ""Tea?*

1lril0c,n1c2hrj,"Welcome to Supernatural Understanding and Harmony Class, I'm Vector, your Werebat lecturer for today. How appropriate, since my species is one of those that will be covered today.

I'm sure you hunters know at least a thing or two about bats. We're a nocturnal species, and we're mammals. But do you know how many species of bats there are?

We have over 1400 species of bats in this world. And only three, I repeat, **three** are vampire bat species. This means that your odds of running into a Werebat that sucks blood like a vampire is less than 1%. Don't stare at me like that. I'm a fruit bat. Do you think this university is that stupid as to hire a Vampire Werebat to attack their human students? I am a properly vetted and peer-reviewed professor. It is not in my interest, or that of my employer to have exsanguinated students.

The other kind of bat is the insect-eating bat. You can consider them friends, for such Werebats are the natural predators of Mothmen and giant flying cockroaches.

Are we clear? Any questions?

If none, we will discuss the differences between Vampire Werebats, and vampires. You know, the human-turned-vampire type of vampires that some of you may have already killed before stepping into this classroom. Vampire squids? That'll be for tomorrow, okay?

So Vampire Werebats actually prefer taking blood from livestock and cattle. Not humans. Humans are such a hassle to deal with. Sheep blood, goat blood, those werebats will go for it. Far less risky than trying to jump a human. Who could be a vampire hunter. I honestly have no idea why basic vampires don't do that. Why they target humans. I've never tasted blood so I can't comment.

Next, you'll need to know that Werebats have a ""were"" form at night. Vampires don't. A werecreature's transformation is involuntary and natural. Part of the package. A vampire has to learn how to transform. Not all can do it. Those who do, they can voluntarily transform if they learn transformation magic. For as long as they have sufficient mana, they can sustain their transformed appearance. For werebats, we don't need mana. But we do need the conditions to be right for our transformation to take place.

Alright, class, thanks for paying attention to me so far. I also do appreciate that none of the enrolled vampire hunters have tried to shoot me for the first time. It does get very annoying to dodge bullets while explaining why I am not a vampire, and safe around humans all the hecking time.

You may have a break, and class will resume in 15 minutes. We'll talk about the different werecreatures for the next segment, and discuss why werewolves have been fighting vampires for centuries, but not the other werecreatures, thank you.

She gave me some chemicals that is known to irritate vampires.

Beaumont tensed at the sound of footsteps behind him. It was a cool evening, and he was out exploring his new town. He had to remind himself of the new location to relax again. No one knew him here, and he didn't have to explain anything to anyone. He slowed his pace partially to window shop and partially to let the footsteps pass him. 



He made the decision to act casual before he realized what the business was, and ended up staring at a menu for 'Glory's Bistro'. He was peckish enough that the vegetarian options listed sounded good. He went ahead and went in as the unknown strangers continued past. A green-haired woman in a pink uniform greeted him with a smile once he was inside. 



""Welcome! Have a seat anywhere,"" she added as she handed him a menu. He accepted it and chose to sit at a nearby table for two. ""Are you the owner?"" he asked with genuine curiosity. His goal was to learn about his new town and her nametag said 'Glory Steel' ,



""That I am,"" she smiled. ""First time here? I can't say I remember seeing you before."" 



""Yeah, new in town,"" Beaumont nodded. ""Just getting my bearings.""



""Goodness,"" Glory giggled. ""Now I'm obligated to make a good impression. As a new citizen in our lovely city, I'd like to welcome you with a free meal. Pick anything you like, hon,"" she said.



""Oh, I couldn't..,"" he tried to be polite, but she shook her head. 



""You'd better, it's a one-time offer. Now, if you're here, I'm sure Chroma Corp. moved you with all the amenities included. It's not a handout, I know you don't need it. But, I sure would like the opportunity to earn you as a regular customer."" 



""Well, when you put it like that, how can I say no?"" Beaumont chuckled and nodded. ""But, I don't need to bother with the menu. That veggie pizza on the window looked delicious; I'll take one of those,"" he said.



""Huh? Oh!"" Glory giggled. ""Forgive me for assuming. You're not a vampire, are you?"" She directed his attention to the menu he didn't look at, and it was open to the selection of blood available. 



""No,"" Beaumont chuckled and shook his head. ""I'm actually a werebat. But, I get that a lot. Used to be too much,"" he said. 



""Unfortunately, I think I'm proof that it's still going to happen sometimes,"" Glory was apologetic, but Beaumont nodded. 



""That's not so bad,"" he shrugged. ""All things considered, being a werebat is pretty easy. In my old town, I got by mostly by claiming to be a night owl and a vegetarian. But, the most annoying part was explaining to vampires that I'm not one, and am safe around humans."" 



""I can see how that would get annoying very quickly,"" Glory nodded. ""Congratulations on moving here."" 



""Thank you!"" he said. ""I never would have imagined there was a city, or a world, where I didn't have to explain anything and still have people accept me. I can never thank Chroma Corp. enough for helping me move here.""

1lril0c,n1dcgqc,"The Garlic Paste Stake

""Oh, so now you're throwing around vampire slurs *and* accusing me of murder?"" Charlie said, clearly annoyed as a wooden stake hovered inches from his chest--held by a man who looked like he'd assembled his vampire hunter kit from a YouTube tutorial.

""Julie,"" the man grunted, pressing harder. ""Her fiancé hired me. Said she was found exsanguinated in her car. I did the research--hospital logs, staff schedules, even checked your droppings for fruit content consistency. You and Julie Lopez worked the same shift. She left when you did. Then she turned up dead. Drained.""

Charlie blinked. ""You broke into my attic and analyzed my droppings? That’s why my coffee tasted off yesterday.""

The man ignored him. ""Your manager said you two were fighting. Ever since she found out you were undead.""

Charlie sighed. ""We weren’t fighting. She left Bible passages in my locker and reported me for ‘making the break room feel unholy.’ I told her if I could burn in hell, I’d see her there. I was just trying to match her energy.""

""Then you quit.""

""Because she made work unbearable. Imagine getting harassed by someone who microwaves salmon at ten a.m.""

""She was found three blocks from the hospital. In her car.""

Charlie let out a long sigh. ""Time out.""

With a single motion, he yanked the stake away and flung it into the living room. Before it even hit the carpet, he flipped the guy onto his back, knees pinning his arms to the floor.

""First of all,"" Charlie said. ""I’m a werebat. Not a vampire. Big difference. I don’t drink blood. I don’t burst into flames. I eat fruit and sleep upside down like a sad little piñata.""

The hunter wheezed. ""But... you’re registered.""

""Yeah, because the government passed the Vampire Registration Bill and lumped every immortal into the broadest category possible. Doesn’t matter if you drink blood, eat bananas, or you don’t die from old age--undead is undead, apparently.""

""I waited until after sunrise,"" the man said weakly. ""I followed protocol.""

Charlie gestured at the oven clock. ""It’s 6:51 a.m. I’ve been up since six. I did yoga. I added chia seeds to my smoothie. Do I look like I’m mid-coffin nap?""

""She was found in her car, three blocks from the hospital. Drained. Classic vamp kill.""

Charlie rolled his eyes. ""And I had an airtight alibi. I was at a concert. Then dinner with friends. Cops checked it all out. Also: I literally can’t drain people. Not physically possible. You think the cops missed that?""

""But you quit your job right after,"" the hunter said.

""Because she made my life hell. Got HR involved. Filed complaints. Tried to get me removed from patient care. She hated that I existed.""

""You didn’t want revenge?""

Charlie shook his head. ""I couldn’t even suck blood if I tried. It would look like two smoothie straw hickies.""

The hunter lay still beneath him.

""You know the law only protects you if you succeed, right?"" Charlie said. ""You break into my house, try to kill me, and fail--that legally allows me to tear out your spine.""

""...Are you going to?""

""No,"" Charlie said, standing up. ""But I am billing you for the door you kicked in--and the paint job.""

He walked to the counter, took a sip from his smoothie, and grimaced.

""By the way,"" he added, sniffing the discarded stake, ""was this that garlic paste from a tube? The kind from the grocery store? You rubbed that on the wood?""

The hunter nodded. ""And sage.""

Charlie blinked. ""Why would you season your stake like a steak?""

""Fang Fighters podcast,"" the hunter said. ""Episode four.""

""Of course,"" Charlie muttered. ""Did those guys sell you your little vampire hunting kit too?""

He drank again, more contemplative this time.

The hunter was still on the floor when Charlie emptied the last of his smoothie.

""Paul,"" Charlie called over.

The man flinched. ""How do you know my name?""

Charlie pointed without turning. ""It’s embroidered on your vest. Right above your agency logo.""

Paul looked down. ""Oh. Right.""

Charlie kept staring. ""Next time you try to murder someone, maybe don’t do a full fifteen-minute warm-up on their front porch. I’ve got a Ring cam, Paul. I watched the whole thing. You put your vest on, hyped yourself up, practiced your little speech--""

He paused.

""I was really hoping for something badass when you busted in. Instead, you shouted, ‘Where you at, you tampoon!’""  
Charlie shook his head. ""Yuck, man.""",31
1lrwq37,n1ewdk8,"I haven't been alive since the 80s and despite what the hooded guy with a gnarly gardening tool insisted, I stuck around. He checks in every anniversary with a fresh one in tow and convinces them to travel to the next place like I'm a poster child for bad decisions. I have my reasons.
The reason was now fifteen. I watched them take their first steps into their mom's arms, I got to see their joy when adopting the scraggly orange tabby with a heart shaped patch on its thigh. Their first day of school, their first kiss.
Patches would stare at me while they sat by the window to catch a cool breeze. She would laugh and look up to say hi to the ""ghost"", stroking his fur while he maintained eye contact.

Today she got home in tears. She dropped everything by the door and ran to call her mom in the kitchen.
Hooded guy arrived at the same time with what looked like a teenager. Wait. It was the boyfriend with a deep gash across his chest.
""What happened to you, Henry?""
Henry paled even though he was like me and asked ""Who are you? How do you know my name?""
I opened my mouth to answer and the hooded guy lifted his hood as if he heard something.
""Did she lock the door?"" His hollow voice chilled my already dead soul.
I looked out the window and saw what appeared to be a crowd following a single man. His hands were stained the color of iron and he was carrying Henry's splintered baseball bat.
""Lock the door!"" I yelled, and Patches yowled in response.
Henry reached for his keys and whispered. ""He must have taken them off me before I died.""
Hooded guy stared out the window at the accumulating crowd of ghosts and whispered. ""This is going to be a lot of paperwork.""
I ran into the kitchen and reached for her hands. She gasped as a wave of chills cut her thoughts short.
""Sweetheart. Daddy's here. But I need you to hang up and call the police."" I pleaded. Speaking never worked, only the cat knew I was here from the land of the living. ""You are in danger. Get help now.""
The phone crackled and I could hear her mom's voice break through the static painfully distorted. ""John?""
""Dad?"" She squeaked.
I heard shouting from Henry and knew there wasn't time. ""Call the police and hide. I love you."" Kissing her forehead, I turned to stop the man who wanted to hurt my daughter.",15

""You did good. Go to your girlfriend and make sure she's safe.""
The bad man sighed when he couldn't turn the handle and kicked open the door.
He passed through me and looked unbothered at the chill.
I grabbed him with all the anger I held onto in life and shouted ""NO"". He didn't stop.
Henry came back to say where she was hiding. And the bad man smiled. ""Thank you for letting me know, Henry.""
Hooded guy straightened his posture.
""You can see us??""
The bad man grinned at the crowd filing in.
""For as long as I can remember.""

Hooded guy let his hood fall, the ashen appearance of his bald head and gaunt features made the anger more frightening. ""You are not a shepherd or a reaper. Why do they follow you?""
""They're waiting for revenge."" I said. ""They won't look anywhere but at him.""
A braided cord around his neck caught my eye. My daughter's mom had a superstitious friend and used herbs to purify the home after my death.
""Remove his necklace.""
Hooded guy already had his sickle raised and swung it over the bad man.
The bad man blinked and felt the pendant drop. ""What did you do?""
The crowd started gasping, the children started crying, the adults rushed forward to grab a hold of him.
He fell to his knees clutching his chest as every victim poured their emotions into his body.
Hooded guy whispered. ""I gave them their free will back.",5

**pssst**

“Argh, dammit!”

‘You’re doing it wrong.’

“What?”

‘You’re doing it wrong. You’re just sticking out your hand and saying the words.’

“Oh, *I’m sorry*, Ms Perfect. Pray tell, how *ever* shall I ever improve?”

‘First off, lose that attitude. Second, do a squat and punch before you say the spell.’

“…what.”

‘It’s from Alley Brawler 2. Down, front, punch.’

“Look here…”

‘Just try it, *oh struggling one*.’

“Fine. This is gonna look so stupid. Squat-punch-Fireball!”

**FWOOOOOSHHH**

“Holy cow! Did you see that?”

‘Mm-hmm. Told ya. That’ll be one ice-cream.’

“How the heck did you know that? I haven’t seen you cast a spell like, ever!”

‘Video games get crazy realistic these days.’

“You’ve got to tell me more of this stuff! I’ll be the coolest kid in school! And maybe Katherine will finally-“

‘A-HE-HEM. Aren’t you forgetting something?’

“Uh, bless me, dear sister, with thy knowledge gleaned from being a massive nerd?”

‘Nope.’

“Three ices from Higan-Dax.”

‘That’s more like it. Now for your magic armor spell…’

“Yes? Yeeeeessss?”

“Seriously?”

‘Seriously.’

1lrqa6l,n1gg0zr,"I felt the change in the air. A slight tingling on the skin, a heavy rush of air. Then, a sudden sharp burst of light. Magic energy condensed so thick that you could see the distortion in space, was siphoned rapidly into the formation on the ground. It coursed through the dense and winding lines, lighting them up with blue fire. Aggressive at first, the pulsing energy was processed by the formation runes until it was finally tamed, pooling gently inside the crystal core that was placed at the center.

“See, I towed you it woked.”

“… Um, y-yeah, Lyney, yeah… you did tell me it would work.”

I thought it was cute at first. My three year old baby sister Lyney, with her chubby cheeks and tiny pigtails, her cute little baby voice, her r’s and l’s still coming out as w’s, just baby-speaking her way through a post-graduate student's spell. Well, now I'm speechless.

I stepped into the formation and cautiously picked up the crystal core. It was intact and faintly glowing. Even without a measuring device, you could tell that the high-grade crystal had been charged to the brim with potential magic energy. 

It’s unbelievable.

I mean, she barely just started speaking full sentences, who would’ve thought she’d be able to ACTUALLY pull off an Advanced Grade ritual spell for potential energy conversion?!

There’s a reason that spell is called the Final Boss for ritualist students. It’s 21 measures long, with a note span of close to 2 octaves on the Aeolian scale. It has NOTORIOUSLY high demand for clear diction.

“…Lyney, who taught you how to do that?”

“You tegbook.” she pointed at my school textbook.

“But the spell in my textbook is different from the one you just chanted, right?”

“Yeah, tegbook one too long. Short one better.”

“No, yeah, but how did you come up with the short one?”

I felt like I was going crazy. One of the most difficult ritualist spell, reduced to less than a third of its total measures then butchered by baby-speak, had somehow WORKED. If this wasn't a fluke, it may just be the biggest advancement in the field of rituals since the discovery of magic ink as a substitute for human blood in drawing formations.

I wrote down her spell, making note of her exact cadence and baby-speak then later tested it myself. All I got was a headache, three scrapped crystals, and a floating succulent. And yet, it works every time she does it! 

Humbled, I offered her unlimited ice cream to teach me how to do it. She looked me in the eye and said very seriously that she also wants a life-sized unicorn pony plushie. I never thought I'd be extorted by a toddler, but here we are. I caved (for science). 

Decades later, history books will write about how Lyney Crow, legendary genius Ritualist, started her successful teaching career. But only I know her real start. 

It was on that day, perched on a unicorn plushie with chocolate peanut butter ice cream in hand, my three year old baby sister started her first lecture in ritual magic.",7
1lrpnqd,n1cnpdo,"The danger is gone. I definitely destroyed the entire network of evil. I found and established a surveillance house near my family home. 
As I watch them daily, they appear to have moved on. They are happy, going to school, working.  
I don’t think I should disrupt their lives again.  What if I just make their lives easier. 

I take some of the money I took from evil. I hire attorneys to represent a Will from a distant relative. 

I watch through surveillance cameras.
The attorney approaches my family’s house. Knocking on the front door. 
I turn the dial up on the audio microphone. 

My wife answered the door “hello, can I help you ?”

Attorney said “. Yes ma’am, I am Will Johnson of Johnson, Johnson and Reading law firm. May I come in?”

My wife, “what is this about? Are you a collection agent?”

Will Johnson replies, “no ma’am, I am here to present a Mary with an inheritance “ 

Mary says, “that is me, you better come inside mr. Johnson.” Mary opens the door wider and ushering the attorney in.",16
1lrpnqd,n1d3p4o,"I sat in the car, just a couple of spots shy of the house, fingers white knuckled around the wheel. I was tempted to just hit the gas and disappear yet again. Nobody would know any better. I could go back to my WITSEC life, be an unassuming mechanic, fuck on occasion to feel something, say hello to the neighbors across the street who've only ever known me as Dan as I drove into the same driveway I got dropped off at by discreet officers years ago. 

I've really made a mess. WITSEC have no idea ""the threat"" has been ""eliminated"" yet. The only people in my life over the past ten years will soon find out a lot of what they thought they knew about me was a lie, and even then, they wouldn't know half the truth. WITSEC might even choose to kill off Dan. If they found out I came here, they'd go ballistic. 

I pulled out the two ID's, for the first time coexisting in the same space. Dan J. Bartley and Roland H. Mansfield. Two men in the same body. I couldn't make out how I related to either guy. Two ID's didn't belong in one wallet.

Startled, I found myself sliding down in my seat when the door to the house cracked open. Rebecca came out. Even from a distance, she was still achingly familiar. Her hair was shorter, streaked with silver now, tucked behind her ears as she'd always done. She'd filled out some, but it suited her. I didn't recognize this light blue shirt or these jeans in a relatively trendy cut. How many items had she bought since the last time I'd kissed her? Did she still wear the pink cashmere cardigan I'd gotten her for Christmas in 2013? 

She stopped with the bag of trash in her hand and turned her head to call out into the house. Seemingly satisfied with the answer, she walked briskly to the trash can to dump the bag. Something in my chest cracked, and I was paralyzed by the blank look on her face, the desire to call out to her just as powerful as the desire to keep her away from the pain it would cause. I knew she was dating another man, has been for a couple of years. I would never ask her to take me back now. Was she really happy? Can you read contentment on your loved one's face in seconds, even years later? I couldn't decide by the time she turned around to walk back into the house. I watched her back, choking on my own indecision. 

Before she could make it inside, a lanky figure burst out towards the front yard, all arms and legs. Everything in my body seemed to crumble at the sight of that wide, eerily familiar smile. A carbon copy of the one I'd have seen in the mirror in a decade if my life hadn't fallen apart. God, Alex. His dark hair was plastered to his forehead, and behind him an ecstatic mutt holding a tennis ball in its mouth bounded down into the grass. Alex beckoned the dog to him, and they began an enthusiastic game where Alex had the dog chase him down to get the ball back. Time and again, he fell on the grass, quickly getting covered in green and brown stains. The last time I'd seen that hyperactive kid, he was barely potty trained, head still a bit too big for his body. Now, he was almost a teenager.

I inhaled shakily as I took in the house I hadn't even been to before, the place where the only shape of home I'd ever had took new residence. Was it a happy, chaotic mess of trinkets, shoes and papers? I couldn't imagine anything else. Selfishly, I still wondered if a person could just... paste themselves back into a scene, like a missing guest added to a wedding photo. If I just closed my eyes and preyed hard enough, would we all forget? Would I be transported into that house and walk that dog at night when nobody else could be assed to do it? Smooth back Alex's hair out of his pale forehead? Bring Rebecca a cup of coffee in the living room on a weekend?

I opened the car door.",12

He takes a very long slurp of the big gulp by his side before reaching over the sofa, his folds squishing and bending as he grunts. After a while of fishing for something, he tosses the hired killer a joy con controller much to the masked man's confusion.

1lrsxmr,n1dwt77,"Harry paused, setting down the knife. Dinner would have to wait, as he focused on the call. ""What do you mean? Be death? You mean dead?! What's happening?!""

There was a breath, before Charlotte spoke again in her calm voice. ""No, not dead. Death, bit different. I just wanted to get the chance to call you first.""

He started pacing, concentrating now fully on the call. ""What do you mean?!""

Charlotte laughed lightly. ""It's nothing much, just a temporary placement. I'll be gone for about a year, but figured I should let you know. I know you still talk with them, so thought you could pass it on.""

Harry frowned deeply, breathing harder. ""What is this Charlotte?! What the hell are you on about?! Talk sensibly!""

There was a sigh, before he heard a series of murmurs on the other end. He tried listening harder, only to jump as her voice returned slightly louder. ""Fine. I can't talk much about it, this whole thing is very, very sensitive. But it's with the temple, all above board, just top secret. Basically I've been chosen this year to take the burden. I gave the right mental attitude for it, hence my placement.""

She sighed again. ""I can't tell you anything more. That itself is probably too much. But I wanted to make sure you knew what was happening, before you got through guard involved. They aren't going to looking into my temporary disappearance anyway.""

Harry slammed his hand into a nearby wall, practically growling. ""This is ridiculous! Why are you just springing this on me now?! You couldn't give me time to prepare?!""

Charlotte sighed once more. ""Not really. It was sort of a surprise to me to. I knew I was in the line, but not when. It's just been told to me an hour ago. But I'm ready. And now I have to go.""

He found himself shouting down the phone, anger colouring his face. ""Don't you dare hang up on me!""

Her voice held a touch of sadness. ""I'm sorry Harry. We can discuss this when I return. For now though, goodbye.""

The line clicked off. He glared at his phone, before bursting into motion. Screw dinner, he had to get to the temple, and find out what in the freezing hells was going on.",7
1ls0avs,n1f454r,"Sarah breathed a sigh of relief as she returned the stolen card to her wallet. She knew she was pushing her luck, using the card three days in a row, but she hasn't been able to lift a replacement yet. She exited the store, slowly pushed her fully loaded cart to her dilapidated station wagon, and emptied her new camping gear into the back. At least after tonight's purchases, she could go off-grid for a few weeks and start making sense of things. 

After returning her cart to the corral, Sarah drove to a rarely used trailhead. She packed her new supplies and hiked deep into the dark forest, making her way by moonlight and half forgotten memories. Spotting a familiar tree, split in half by lightning many years prior, she slipped off the trail and headed into the thickest part of the woods. She soon found the small stream she knew snaked through the brush, and followed it to a small clearing many miles from the path. She slipped into the ruin of a cabin; One that she had called home a lifetime ago. 

""Did you really think that would work?"" asked the now familiar voice from behind her. Sarah whirled and screamed, cursing the man who had haunted her since she stole the wallet off his lifeless body three days prior.",6
1lrftft,n1asha8,"The remains of Sir Alagard smoldered in the corner. Squire Kenna looked nervously at Valyria of the Eternal Flame, who was currently using Sir Alagard's legendary sword, Glenfwyddr, as a toothpick. The dragon seemed preoccupied with cleaning out her teeth, and perhaps, *perhaps*, Kenna could make a clean getaway. 

She began edging towards the mouth of the cave.

""**And where do you think you're going?**"" the dragon rumbled.

""Erm,"" Kenna swallowed nervously. ""Was just heading home. Y'see, I've got nothin' against you, nothin' at all, was just followin' Sir Alagard around. I mean, the *late* Sir Alagard. An' now that he ain't got any work for me to do, I was thinking of trying something different. Maybe an apprenticeship at the apothecary, or somethin'.  So, erm, would you mind very much if I left now?""

Valyria of the Eternal Flame chuckled. She sounded rather amused. 

""**You come here with your weapons, ready to murder me and loot your hoard, and you think to get off scot free?**""

""Well, not *me*, per se, not *me*, exactly, y'see, it was all Sir Alagard's idea...""

""**Nevertheless, you are complicit. Stay a while. I may find a use for you yet, scrawny and underdeveloped as you are. At least this Sir Alagard had a nice amount of muscle; I do like dark meat so.""**

""Oh, I've never been able to put on muscle, miss, I'm afraid I won't be much good for you there. I'll be more of a burden then a help, might be better to just let me go and be rid of me.""

""**Come here, squire**,"" Valyria fixed her unblinking golden stare on Kenna, ignoring Kenna's entreaties. 

Kenna trembled in her boots, but still, she moved closer. She'd always been good at following orders; it was how she'd ended up in a dragon's lair with a nincompoop of a knight. 

""**A little closer, still,**"" the dragon said. 

Her heart hammering in her ears, Kenna moved even closer to the dragon. She was near enough that she could see her terrified eyes reflected in those polished scales.

""**Good.**"" The dragon leaned down close and *grinned*, her pointed teeth mere inches from Kenna's face. ""**Now, tell me: is there anything still stuck between my teeth?""**",105
1lrftft,n1em7i5,"*I'm not ready.*

It was too soon. Far too soon. Sir Ten assured me my time would come within 7 years. I had been his squire for 14 moons. I was not ready.

I felt a sense of shame for the warmth trickling down my leg, but it was overcrowded by the even stronger sense of abject terror that sent my balls shooting up into my bladder. I haven't had such a physical reaction to fear since my grandmother first beat me with a switch.

The dragon was ripping the sinewy flesh off of Sir Ten's right thigh much like I would eat a frog's leg. I could just imagine how my cousin, the alchemist, would react. *Do you see how its fire sacs in its cheeks sear the meat as it chews? The creature never has to worry about its chicken being undercooked!* I was much more preoccupied by the fact that the dragon stared at me as it ate.

Was it smiling?

*I'm so dead...*

Right as I thought that, Sir Ten's dog, Rufus, headbutted my knee.

*Or...am I?*

Rufus was his familiar. Sir Ten was an eldritch knight, taught in the ways of enchantment and evocation. But, as I would come to comprehend in the coming days and confirm some further months later, Sir Ten was not truly an eldritch knight and his trusty dog was not truly his familiar.

In point of fact, Sir Ten was a warlock, and Rufus was his patron.

The moment the dog headbutted me, time slowed to a crawl. My mind was flooded with the terms of a deal. Rufus would be my loving dog, I would be his faithful boy, and through our bond, unbreakable save through death, I would gain a source of magic that could be nurtured into power like that unto a demigod. But...

I stared into the eyes of the dragon. It was 60 feet away.

The power Rufus would grant me, although instant, would be weaker than what Sir Ten had. He had wielded the power for some time, for over a decade, and was quite powerful. Even with all that power, the dragon beat him. What chance would I have?

Time was still as slow as molasses, but I could sense it would not be for much longer. I had to make a decision. If I did not, the choice would be taken from me and I would suffer the same fate as Sir Ten. I felt phantom tingles down my leg as my imagination replaced Sir Ten's thigh with my own.

I mentally pushed back at Rufus' contract. Not with a counter, but a...rider. An addendum to better guarantee my immediate survival. Access to spells I likely would not normally have under this arrangement. Almost immediately, a new mental framework entered my mind. Agreement to my request, *if* I made him a fluffernutter sandwich when we next made camp and if, for the rest of our days, I purchased him a rack of melt-off-the-bone ribs everytime we entered a town with an establishment that served ribs. I did not know what a fluffernutter was, but I agreed, with the understanding that I would not let him eat the rib bones. They would splinter inside him. The dog grudgingly agreed.

The moment the contract was agreed to by both of us, something slotted into place in my mind and three things happened. First, I obtained the knowledge of magical arts. Second, I cast a powerful cloud of freezing darkness in front of me, blocking off the dragon from my line of sight. Third, I erected a thick wall of stone directly in front of me, blocking the dragon off from being able to immediately pursue me.

Then I turned tail and ran for my life, the dragon's roars muffled through stone.

Rufus enjoyed his fluffernutter later. Who knew marshmallows and peanut butter combined so well?",21
1lrftft,n1atruo,"""Please, spare me."" I say, as the dragon turns to me, Sir's body parts thrown left and right.  
The dragon stops.  
""Okay."" it says.  
I freeze.  
""T-that's it?"" I ask.  
""I am not a beast. Nor a monster.  
I don't particularly enjoy violence, and bloodshed."" it says...casting a water spell, and washing its body off of my Sir's blood.  
It also notices this.



""Mind you. The knight came in calling for justice, casting fire-sword, and lunging at me.  
Is it my fault that he is weak, and that I caught him in my claws?"" it asks.  
I shiver.  
""N-no! Of course not!  
How rude of him!"" I say.  
The dragon growls...or that's how it sounds, but it might be laughter.  
""You are cute trying to agree with me to save your life.  
Wait a second."" it says, and transforms.  
Now, instead of a castle sized dragon, is a cart sized woman, with large red horns, and a swaying tail.  
She grins at me, wearing a...knight's armor?

  
""You a squire, right?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Great. I don't know much about the human world, but I want to see it.  
You will be my squire from now on."" she says, patting me.  
I feel my bones creaking under her palm.  
I try not to scream in pain.  
""O-of course, My Lady...may I suggest hiding the horns, and tail as well?"" I say.  
She frowns, but then nods.  
""Okay. You the human expert."" she says, and her horns, and tail disappear.  
I sigh in relief, before she orders me to prepare Sir's horses...well, her horses now.

  
Days pass by, and I can see her mood noticeably worsen.  
One night, in the inn, I shiver in front of her.  
""Why are there only negative stories about dragons?  
What do you mean, kidnapping, eating, or pillaging villages?  
Most of us sleep all day!  
And men! Why are they whistling at me, and trying to touch my bottom? Is something there?  
Also, women as well, why do some of them dress like...like that?  
Can you explain? Is it normal?"" she asks, curiously, and annoyed.  
Oh...how do I explain to her that this is how it is in human world?  
And how do I explain to her that what she did today in the pub to that noble will come back to haunt us?  
I almost wish she killed me with Sir...at least he was only slightly troublesome with women, but she...  
She really wants to experience everything.",58
1lrftft,n1dqpm3,"The acrid stench of charred flesh and spilled entrails filled the cavern's stale air. Gareth pressed himself against the cold stone wall, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he watched the ancient wyrm methodically tear apart what remained of Sir Aldric. The knight's armor—once gleaming silver, now blackened and twisted—scattered across the cave floor like broken promises.

The dragon's massive claws pinned the knight's torso while its serpentine neck coiled back. With deliberate cruelty, it drove its talons deep into Aldric's abdomen, splitting him open like overripe fruit. The wet, tearing sounds echoed off the cavern walls. Then came the final indignity—jaws that could crush castle gates clamped down on the knight's neck with a sickening crunch.

Gareth's knees buckled. At seventeen, he had seen death before—plague had taken his parents, starvation had claimed his siblings—but nothing like this. Sir Aldric had been his last hope, his only chance to escape the grinding poverty that had defined his short life. Now that hope lay in pieces before a creature from the world's darkest legends.

The dragon's head swiveled toward him with predatory grace. Golden eyes, each larger than dinner plates, fixed upon the trembling youth. A forked tongue flicked out, tasting his terror on the air. The beast's lips pulled back in what might have been a smile, revealing teeth like ivory daggers still dripping with his master's blood.

Gareth's hand found the leather-wrapped hilt of Aldric's backup sword at his belt. The blade whispered free of its scabbard as he raised his small wooden shield with a shaking arm. His mind conjured the inevitable: the dragon's neck arching back, throat glowing like a furnace, then the impossible heat washing over him. His legs would burn first, then he would fall, helpless as those massive jaws descended...

The vision faded as his gaze shifted past the dragon to the glittering hoard beyond. Mountains of gold coins caught the torchlight, precious gems winked like captured stars, and artifacts of forgotten kingdoms lay heaped in careless splendor. More wealth than a dozen kingdoms possessed.

The dragon's eyes narrowed to burning slits. It recognized that look—the same covetous hunger that had drawn countless knights and treasure-seekers to their doom.

*Fuck it.*

The thought rang clear in Gareth's mind. He was going to die anyway. Might as well die for something.

He pursed his lips and whistled sharply, the sound piercing the cavern's stillness. ""Here, boy,"" he called mockingly, his voice steadier than he felt.

The dragon's massive frame tensed, scales rippling like liquid metal. Its back arched as ancient fury kindled in its breast. The creature drew in a breath that seemed to empty the very air from the cave, its throat beginning to glow with building fire.",13
1lrftft,n1dqqex,"Gareth shifted his weight slightly forward, replaying his vision once more. Timing would be everything.

The dragon's head snapped forward like a catapult releasing. At that precise instant, Gareth dropped to his knees, ducking behind his shield and tucking his elbows tight to his body. The world exploded into heat and light.

Fire washed over and around the small shield in a torrent of superheated air. The wood began to smoke and char, the metal rim burning his palms even through his leather gloves. But he held firm, counting heartbeats, listening through the roar of flames for the telltale sound—

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

The dragon's charge began as a measured advance but quickly accelerated. *Thump-thump-thump.* Full sprint now, still breathing fire, confident in its overwhelming assault.

Gareth visualized the beast's approach, feeling the thunderous impacts grow closer. The creature would have to stop breathing fire to deliver the killing bite—dragon fire came from deep in the lungs, and it needed air to snap its jaws.

The flames ceased.

*Now.*

Gareth released his grip and rolled hard to the right. The shield fell forward just as the dragon's massive head struck it, jaws snapping closed on empty wood and metal. The creature's momentum carried it forward, neck extended, disappointed rage already twisting its features.

That was when Gareth's blade found its mark.

Rising from his roll, he drove the sword up and forward with all his strength. The point slid between scales and pierced the dragon's throat just below the jawline. The blade's full length disappeared into the creature's neck, the tip grinding against vertebrae before punching through to emerge on the far side.

The dragon's eyes went wide with shock and pain. It stumbled forward, trying to understand how the trembling boy had become death incarnate. Dark blood—thick as tar and twice as foul—gushed from the wound as Gareth rolled beneath the collapsing giant, withdrawing his blade in one fluid motion.

The great wyrm crashed to the cavern floor, its vision already darkening. Through fading sight, it watched the blood-soaked youth regain his footing and raise the sword overhead. Three swift strokes separated the massive head from its body, ending the creature's thousand-year reign.

Gareth stood over the corpse, chest heaving, drenched in the dragon's vile blood. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, inadvertently smearing more of the black ichor across his face. Before him lay the hoard—more riches than he had ever dared imagine.

A slow grin spread across his gore-splattered features.

""Payday.""",17

""I...I can't do that.  
That would essentially erase all life, and most matter, transforming the universe into a very dark place."" it says.  
I sigh.  
""I wish for everything, all matter, all elements, all people...to be equal."" I say.  
It literally goes from dark purple, to faint pink, and almost goes back into its lamp.  
I can see it tremble.  
I sigh.

  
""No can do, huh?"" I ask.  
""T-that would basically create an entropic void!"" it exclaims.  
I nod.  
""I wish for infinite energy to exist in the universe!"" I say.  
It shivers.  
""T-that's a bit better, but in that context, it would vaporize everything through heat, unless there is a container, or the universe can be also made infinite, as now it seems endless, but in reality it does have an end..."" it explains.  
I groan.  
""I wish that everything would be perfect!"" I say.  
It yelps.

  
""T-that would erase life, as life is chaos, and imperfection perfectly working out in the end..."" it says.  
I wish for several more things like everyone should always be happy, everyone should understand and listen to me, that death shouldn't exist anymore...and more, they are all shot down.  
""Fine.  
Give me wealth, health, relatively good, and a an above average luck."" I say.  
It sighs in relief.  
""Your wish is my command."" it says, granting my wishes one after the other, and disappearing so fast, I swear, I saw the past.  
I pout, as I check my bank account, and a message that says that I got the job of my dreams that I haven't even applied to.  
""This is boring..."" I mutter, kicking a rock, that gently hits the window of an apartment.  
""Was that you?"" a young woman opens it, and I nod, but in my mind all I can think is that this will be a boring life...",48
1lrj010,n1g5pzd,"""You heard me. Make all cancer virulently contagious, jump straight to stage 3, but despite progression, not terminal for at least 12 years.""

The genie looked nauseous. ""Primordials, *why?*""

""Is it your job to i wa to grant?""

""I... urk. Your wish has been granted.""

""Second wish. I wish to strip away the special and private healthcare of lawmakers across the globe so that they have only the same resources that they grant their citizens.""

The genie raised an eyebrow, the horrified look becoming thoughtful. ""Are you... Your wish has been granted.""

""Now, I'd like to make the 3rd wish now, but with a time delay - is that doable, or do I have to keep you around for a while?""

The conditions for my third wish were met surprisingly fast, considering the folk involved. Once fair and equitable healthcare laws were set in place across the globe, everyone who had cancer - nearly everyone at this point, although most were asymptomatic - was restored to full health, free of any disease. And the various forms of cancer were back to their default settings.",11
1lrbuhe,n19x6yn,"“Look, I can’t just turn you into a monster. I do that to people as a punishment! I’m not fulfilling your sick personal desires for free, buster.” the man said. He was wearing dark green dress pants with a ragged cuffs and a grimy t-shirt with a blue suit jacket, topped off with a feathered bowler hat and a cape that looked suspiciously like a beach towel.

Rosie reached into her pockets and pulled out a few crumpled notes. “I can pay! I can pay! please!”

The man peered at her from where he sat in an old wooden chair. The trailer was dim, the windows shuttered letting in fine lines of the late afternoon sun. It smelled of old tobacco and weird spices, every flat surface covered in a random asortment of objects, occult statuettes and strange devices sitting next to old newspapers and unopened tins of beans.

“Why would a young woman come to The Great Zangbini and offer to pay to be turned into a monster?” he muttered. He pulled open a drawer and started hunting through the contents.

“Because I—“ Rosie started but The Great Zangbini held up a finger.

“Rhetorical question” he grunted, then pulled out a stick of chewing gum and started unwrapping a piece. He turned back to squint at her.

“I don’t actually care why, I don’t turn people into monsters.”

“You do! Billy Jones told me you do! said he saw you with his own eyes!” Rosie said desperately.

He glared at her and spat into the corner.

“That boy should have kept his mouth shut. Still, I stand by what I said. I didn’t turn that man into a monster, I just showed the world his true shape.”

“Yes exactly!” Rosie said firmly and The Great Zangbini’s eyebrows rose almost to the brim of his feathered bowler. “I’m a monster, I’m really a monster underneath, I know I am I just don’t look it. I need you to make me…me.”

He stared at her for a long moment as Rosie held her breath.

“Hrm. Maybe not so rhetorical after all. How about you start at the beginning girl.” he said, then put the stick of gum in his mouth and began to chew.

Rosie took a deep breath.

“I’ve always been a monster, my mother knew and she told me all the time. We lived together in an old house and I would make her life hell every day, then one day she escaped.”

The Great Zangbini’s eyes narrowed.

“These people, these monster killers showed up. I tried to tell them, but they didn’t believe I was a monster, they took me away and I ended up living with them. Marcus—that’s one of them—told me it hadn’t been me, that it was her who was wrong, that she hadn’t treated me right. He told me I wasn’t a monster and—“ she stopped, her voice quivering.

1lrbuhe,n1c7lst,"I look at the goddess, “ so if you turn me into a monster, will you then fulfill my personal desire? “

The goddess “why would I? “

Kneeling, I gently lift the goddess hand , I bend my head forward, my lips caress the soft skin of her hand. 

“My Goddess, I am but your loyal protector, who wishes “  

The goddess pulls her hand from my lips. “ what you suggest, is not possible, it is not allowed, not acceptable “

I ask “You are the Goddess, do you not make the rules? Does it not matter how you feel? What is stopping you? 

I plead, “if you change me to a monster? would it ? could it be allowed? 

The Goddess “The old gods passed down the decree, millennium ago. To stop this very thing from happening ever again. “

I look deeply into the Goddess eyes, I say “ the old gods are no more. You are the almighty powerful Goddess, it is your time now “

The Goddess, “but you as human or even monster will not survive. I would lose you forever, if I allowed you to fulfill your desires.”

I embrace the Goddess, I gently kiss her neck, “I would gladly accept my fate, to become your mate. “ 

They embrace, a brilliant blinding light erupts.",13
1lrbuhe,n19xac3,"The Great Zangbini pulled the gum out of his mouth with his fingers and carefully wrapped it in the foil.

“And you believed him” he said. “What happened?”

Rosie felt the tears forming in her eyes and wiped and them desperately with her sleeve.

“I wanted to go wth them, help them hunt monsters. I was ready! I did training with Jan and Tommy, I joined the judo club and track. I was so sure. When the first job came after I turned 14 I asked to come, I had all my stuff packed and ready.”

“And they said no.” not a question.

“And they said no” repeated Rosie, looking down at the floor. “I was so mad, so mad. We had a fight and then they left and then it happened.”

The Great Zangbini raised an eyebrow and waited. Rosie took another deep breath.

“I changed, I changed then and there, I tore through the house, I smashed everything, tore up pictures of us, broke his computer, smashed the tv, ripped off the cat door, broke the mirror in the hall. I could hear myself screaming and screaming and and I was outside watching the monster destroy everything and then suddenly…it was like I woke up.” her voice trailed off and she slumped down onto the floor.

“It was there all along. They’d been so kind to me and they didn’t even know. Mother was right all along. And so I came here, to you, because I they need to know.”

The Great Zangbini looked down at her, then reached back into the drawer and pulled out something that looked like a small snow globe. He started rolling it between his hands and she found herself watching despite herself.

For a while the trailer was quiet, the muffled sounds of traffic and people outside and the soft rhythmic sound of the globe moving from one hand to another.

“Was the cat ok?” he asked.

Rosie blinked at the unexpected question.

“Gremlin? I think so, he ran under the bed, How did you know we had a cat?”

“The Great Zangbini knows everything” he said to her in a slightly afronted tone. Then he let out a deep sigh.

“I’m sorry. I can’t help you.”

“but—“ Rosie tried but he raised his finger once again.

“I can’t help you, because they’re right. You’re no monster.”

1lrbuhe,n19xaw4,"“I am! I have to be! I ruined mother’s life and now I’ve ruined theirs I’m a monster!” Rosie almost shouted the last words.

“No girl, you’re not.” he said quietly but firmly, and Rosie seemed to deflate.

“You were my only hope. How do you know?” she said in a small, sad voice.

“I told you, I know everything.” and then with a shrug he continued. “besides. Monster would have eat the cat. Look girl, monsterous things have happened to you, no doubt about that, but you aint a monster.”

He stood up slowly, as if it was effort to unbend himself, then took a few steps forward to Rosie and placed his hand on her shoulder.

“Suspect it’ll take a long time for you to believe it from you, but you can believe it from me in the meantime. You’re just a girl who hasn’t worked out how to be.” He coughed slightly, then said “Reckon there’s someone here to see you.”

Rosie looked up at him in confusion, then there was a knock on the door. “Come in” he called and the door opened. A woman in a tactical jacket stepped in to the darkness squinting, then she spotted them. In three quick steps she was crossed the trailer and folded Rosie in a hug.

Rosie felt tears pouring down her face as Jan held her. “Is he mad?” she said in a small voice.

“Oh sweetie” said Jan. “He’s not mad. We didn’t realise how you’d been feeling. We’re all just glad you’re ok.”

“but the tv…”

Jan laughed. “Marcus hated that tv, he’s just such a penny pincher he could never bring himself to replace it. Trust me, you’ve done him a favour. C’mon kid, let’s get you home, then we can sit down and talk about how you can help”

“help?”

“With the jobs. You’re not gonna be bursting through the front doors of lairs any time soon but we could use some support. Just…save the destruction for Judo, deal?”

Rosie, wiped the tears off her face and gave a small laugh. “Deal”.

Jan helped Rosie to her feet, keeping one arm around her shoulders as they moved toward the door. The Great Zangbini watched them go, absently unwrapping his gum again, and just before the door closed behind them, Rosie caught a glimpse of him in the dusty mirror by the door—his reflection wore a small, satisfied smile beneath the ridiculous feathered bowler.",78
1lr33b3,n17uci0,"Holding the bowl of water in his hands, Tomothy's palms and fingers were beginning to get uncomfortably warm. He was thinkin’ he should've used a pot for this one. Handles woulda been nice.

He coulda dealt with the cold water, his hands would go a little numb, but he was afraid he'd burn his hands on this one if he hadn't already. 

Becoming a God had been mostly underwhelming. 

Granting the Wish of Water had taken Tomothy not just all over the world but all over the universe. Water was a hot commodity, pun not intended but appreciated with a smile regardless regarding this particular instance. 

The woosh of stars, the chilly splash of the cosmos and the God of Thirst Quenching stood in front of something that definitely wasn't a bunny rabbit.

The creature looked to be a bundle of strings that stretched up about to infinity as best Tomothy could tell. When he appeared the beast wasn't wiggling, it stood stock still and its color undulated from side to side and up and down all over the strings.

Undulated was a word he'd learned from a documentary about Octopodes. In the documentary he'd learned the plural of the octopus was actually octopodes, not octopi or the more commonly used octopuses.

From white to black and back again the colors changed hitting every bit of the rainbow and all the variations in between making for a very satisfying display and in less than a minute to boot. 

Tomothy began to wonder if he'd used undulating correctly. He'd have to give it a Google when he got back.

He was here now and it was the warm water he'd brought to gift this magnificent very tall group of strings.  Smiling Tomothy leaned forward and set the bowl down.

Gingerly a string lifted from the ground and reached out to touch the water. On contact it exploded with light and Tomothy thought he might be blinded for life. 

When the brightness broke and his vision was filled with naught but stars and the odd alien landscape, it was just Tomothy and the bowl.

Wish fulfilled. Tomothy picked up the bowl and in a flash of light and a chill of the universe he was back in his bathroom trying to remember what he'd meant to Google.

Oh well. He'd remember it later when he stopped thinkin' about it.",231
1lr33b3,n19azw6,"I woke up at 2:17 a.m., for no clear reason. There was no sound. No dream. No cold draft or thirst. Just a strange urgency, like something in the world was slightly wrong and somehow, the fix was simple, specific, undeniable: fill a large bowl with cold water.

I got up in silence, like someone carrying out a forgotten ritual. I walked to the kitchen, grabbed the big blue ceramic bowl the one I only use when I make too much pasta turned on the faucet and let the water run. Cold. Clear. When it reached just below the rim, I stopped.
I stared at it for a moment, unsure of what came next.

Then I blinked.
And I was in a forest.
No flash. No magical transition. One moment I was in my kitchen and the next, I wasn’t.

The night was still. The air smelled of damp leaves and distant soil. Before me stood a small stone shrine covered in moss. And just in front of it… a rabbit. It wasn’t glowing. It didn’t speak. It didn’t float. It was just a rabbit breathing heavily, eyes black, alert, alive.
I set the bowl down on the forest floor.

The rabbit approached slowly and drank, long and deep, like it had waited for this all week. Then it hopped away into the underbrush without a sound.

I blinked again.I was back in the kitchen.The bowl was empty.

The next night, I woke up again.
2:17. No alarm, no prompting.
I rose from bed before I even questioned it. Cold water. Blue bowl. And again—forest.

This time, there were more animals. Two squirrels. A thin deer. A stray cat with one ear missing. Each of them took their turn at the bowl, drinking slowly, peacefully, with a kind of knowing quiet.

I stood beside them. Watching. Waiting.Then I was back home again. Bowl empty. Chest a little emptier, too.
The third night, I didn’t even bother going to sleep. I just waited. And when the minute arrived, it happened the same way—ritual, forest, shrine.

This time there was a dog. An owl. A fox with a limp. A raccoon that stared at me longer than it should have. Always the same bowl. Always the same eyes. Always the silence.

And so it continued.
I stopped counting the days. My body felt heavier. My eyes burned more often. I forgot the names of things—simple things. The light during the day seemed too pale, like the sun itself was tired. But no matter how I adjusted my sleep, how early I went to bed, how many locks I put on the door—I always woke up at 2:17. Always the same quiet need. Always the same thirsty eyes.

They were just animals. But they looked at me as if I was something more.Like I owed them. Like I was the last kindness left in the world.And I kept going.
But something inside me was starting to fray.

On what I think was the thirty-second night—maybe the fortieth—the bowl slipped from my hands. I didn’t trip. I didn’t fumble. I just… let go.

It shattered with a sharp, honest crack.
I stared at the shards on the tile.
The sound echoed far longer than it should have.

The water spilled across the floor like it was trying to escape. I didn’t move. I just sat down, back against the cabinet, and stayed there. The world felt gray, distant, and my eyes ached the way they do right before crying—but no tears came.

Then the kitchen door opened.
It shouldn’t have. I had locked it. I always did. But the handle didn’t turn—it simply swung open, gently, without sound.

On the other side wasn’t the porch.
It was the forest. Again.But this time, it had come to me.

The first to enter was a black cat—thin, mangy, ribs visible under its fur. It stepped in carefully, like walking on broken glass. It looked at me, then padded to the puddle on the floor and drank. Slowly. Respectfully. Like it understood something I didn’t.

Then the others followed.
The rabbit from the first night. A pair of crows. A blind dog. A too-small horse. A trembling hedgehog. One by one, they entered. Quiet. Tired. Patient.

And then came a squirrel, carrying a folded leaf in its little paws—like a letter. It dropped it in my lap and scurried back.I unfolded it.

It was simple paper.The handwriting was awkward, childlike.Just one sentence:

“We know you’re tired.”

And beneath it, in even messier letters:

“But we don’t have anyone else.”

I cried.

Not like in movies—with trembling breaths and cinematic music. It was the kind of crying that empties you. Silent. Exhausting. Without relief.

The cat curled around my foot.The dog laid beside me.The horse rested its nose on my shoulder.

And they waited.
The next morning, I went to the market. I bought a new bowl—larger than the last. I bought a filter. I bought one of those ceramic fountains that keeps the water cool.

I set everything on the porch.Put a cloth underneath.A few smooth stones around it.
Some honey on the side. Just in case.

I left the kitchen door open.
Now, they come during the day.
Quiet, alone. They drink. Some stay a while.

Some nap in the garden. Others leave small things behind feathers, seeds, a berry, a button.

Sometimes, I still wake at 2:17.
But not always.

They’ve learned to come on their own.
And I, somehow, have learned to stay.
I don’t know who I used to be.
I don’t know what I am now.
But when I hear tiny footsteps on wood, or feel those familiar eyes watching without asking—I remember why I still get up.

Even tired… Even hollow… Even like this.",93
1lr33b3,n188ck8,"Fennel suspected it all started when he moved into that rural town. Where something magic, something mysterious, compelled him to clean that rundown shrine. Pity, curiosity, or something that ran deeper than the leylines beneath ancient lands.

Maybe it was that small wolfpup that approached him cautiously. Or that old stone bowl at the shrine. He had filled it with water from the nearby river and let the wolf drink from it.

*That is how pacts are formed. One who offers and one who accepts. In ancient lands older than trees and the humans that lived on it, unknowing of the magic that flows beneath.*

From then on, Fennel woke up at night to fill a bowl of water. Cold to the touch, soothing to one's lips. He would be teleported back to the shrine. There would be something waiting for him. For his water.

The first time, it was a bunny. It hopped to him hesitantly before sipping from the bowl. From behind, a bird flew down to have a sip too.

What had he become? A supplier of water? A quencher of thirst? Fennel simply wanted these night excursions to stop. And maybe, to have an answer what was happening to him. With the knowledge gathered from centuries of travel, surely an immortal like him could figure the magic and cut it off at its source.

Until a human hiker showed up.

""Wow, it really works!"" The human was excited. ""Are you the god of this shrine? Is that the bowl of holy water you have in hand?""

Fennel nodded quietly and let the man drink.

""Thank you! Thanks for hearing my prayer,"" he was all smiles as he dropped a few coins into the weathered donation box. ""See you around! I will tell my friends about you!""

""...don't..."" Fennel muttered, out of range of the hiker who was already on his way.

He wanted peace and quiet. That's the whole point of moving to a rural town near the forest. Not become some ""god"" who was forced by unseen forces to fill a bowl of water to let creatures, and now people drink from, all because they said some prayer he didn't know.

But it made life a little less lonely, a little more lively.

Not that he would say it out loud, but Fennel had begun to enjoy the little gatherings by the shrine. Visitors no longer trickled in one by one. A pair of birds, a band of hikers, small group of townsfolk. Some didn't come solely for water. The squirrels offered him nuts in return. The people put coin to the box, which had been replaced by a new, polished box by the local carpenter. In turn, his bowl never ran out of water no matter how many drank from it, and he had more to give than water.

He told them stories of his past adventures and life, and they too shared their tales.

It was on one night he went out on his own to polish the shrine, did he notice a lone figure approaching. His hand went for the bowl, only to pause when he didn't feel the same old compulsion to fill it with water. And he knew not what to make of it.

""Greetings, young god,"" the entity came forward from the shadows, revealing himself to be a pale octopoid creature in black robes. ""I merely came to see the newly ascended god who had taken residence here out of curiosity. I'm Lord Elvari of Innsmouth, from your neighbouring town just a few miles away. What is your name?""

""Can I trust you not to steal it?"" Fennel remarked nervously.

""Do you take me for a Fae?"" The eldritch deity laughed. ""They wouldn't dare linger where this Old God stands.""

""Old God huh,"" Fennel pondered for a moment. ""What would you know about becoming a god? I had planned to live out my immortality quietly, but it would seem I've become something else altogether.""

""Are you asking what sets an immortal apart from a god? A god opens himself to prayers. He grants the wishes of those who pray to him and his shrine. That is what you have done. You responded to their prayers. A mere immortal has no such obligations. Other immortals have passed by the shrine without taking care of it. Without filling the bowl with water and offering it freely to those who pray for it. It was those little gestures that shaped you to become the new god of this land.""

""Too late to say no, isn't it?"" The newly arisen deity asked. ""Not that I would do that. It seems...unimaginable to refuse my visitors to my shrine.""

""You called them your visitors. Soon, they will become your worshippers. You already called it your shrine,"" Elvari filled the bowl of water and drank from it himself. ""Soon, this land will assume itself your domain, and you as its lord. Be proud of what you've done here, no matter how small it seemed in the beginning. And if in doubt, know that you have an experienced neighbour to talk to.""

1lr33b3,n18qafe,"I am awaken from my slumber again.  I grab a bowl fill it with water. I pick up a bit cotton sack. I pick variety of fruits and nuts from the trees around me. I gather some grains from the fields. 
With everything in my arms I am teleported to a shrine in the forest. 
There are several creatures of the forest and human children gathered at the shrine. 

I place the water and food stuffs so that all can partake of the bounty.  

While the forest creatures and children drink and eat. I sit down amongst them. I radiate a glowing light of warmth and serenity.  

I lay hands on each of the forest creatures and children. Healing hurts and easing tension.  Ensure each of love and affection.  

It is time to go, other creatures are praying for my help. 

I arrive at the stream, bring in a net full of fish. I fill another bowl of water. I teleport to another shrine in the forest. 

The shrine is surrounded by the predators of the forest. Wolves, big cats, bears, each hungry and thirsty. I place the bowl of water for all to take turns drinking from. They file past me, I pat their heads, rub their chins, and give each a large juicy fish to eat.  

While they are gathered eating, I glow warmly. All are calm , quiet and friendly. 

When they finish, they walk away to their dens for the winter sleep. 

I teleport back to my garden, to tend my garden, till I am needed again. 

Winter can be very difficult for Gai’s creatures and children to survive alone.",34
1lr33b3,n1azkx5,"You are completely baffled. One night, you feel the need to fill a bowl with cold water. You fill the bowl. The next thing you know, you are somewhere in a forest, with a very thirsty bunny in front of you. You water it of course. After the bunny has satisfied its thirst, you find yourself back in your kitchen, minus the water. You decide to go and search the internet for stories of something like this happening to someone in the past. Unfortunately, the only thing you manage to find is some writing prompt that describes your situation with uncanny precision, how strange. As it is late by now, you decide to go to bed.



After falling asleep, you dreamt of a forest. You saw many a plant, as well as many critters. Strangely, they seem to react to you, with the bigger ones almost looking like they bow to you sometimes. Right before you wake up, you see a big, beautiful tree that seems unlike any other in the distance. It draws your eyes to it, almost as if enchanted. Upon your return to the waking world, you do not recall much of the dream, apart from the tree in the distance.



Quickly discarding the thoughts of trees and critters, you do your morning routine before going to work. Personal miracles are no reason to skip work, according to the same people who profit from people working.



After an uneventful day at your ordinary work, on your way home you always pass by a pond on the edge of town, surrounded by some reeds. Usually, you just ignore it altogether, but this time some strange force has drawn your attention to it. After some time looking at the pond and noticint nothing out of the ordinary, you are filled with a desire to come take a closer look.



Upon approaching the pond, you get the sudden urge to cut down some reeds. You do not have a knife with you, nor anything sharp, so you do your best to tear some reed out from the ground. After you have a nice handful of reeds in your hands, you blink and find yourself elsewhere. A forest meadow surrounds you. You feel that you are being watched. After looking around a bit, you find a small deer lying on its side. It shows clear signs of starvation.



You slowly approach the deer with your reeds in hand, being careful not to spook the animal. It seems though, that the small deer is not afraid of you. You put the reeds in front of its mouth, and it starts to eat. Soon, no reeds were left, and the deer looked up at you. After a few seconds, the deer and the forest were gone, like a bad dream, leaving you near the pond where you collected the reeds.



Very confused once again, you go back home, do some searching on the internet to no avail, and fall asleep. You dream of that same beautiful tree, in a vast forest. Only now, instead of it being far away, it is right in front of you, reaching into heavens with its branches. After admiring the tree for quite some time, you are filled with the urge to put your hand on its bark. As you do so, you hear a melodic voice in your head. You do not quite understand the words it was saying. What you do understand, is that the tree offers you compensation for your service.



You accept, and then you wake up. You are feeling very refreshed. You do not remember much about your dream apart from the fact that it was about a beautiful tree. You yourself do not really notice it, but after you woke up you forgot about your supernatural encounters of the past two days. You continue your life as normal from this point on, not knowing that you carry a minor blessing giving you just a bit more luck than you otherwise might have had.



The very next day, the tree will choose someone else to carry the mantle of the forest spririt, if only for a few days. The forest must remain a secret after all, so that it is not defiled by those seeking to exploit it.",22
1lr33b3,n1b9byl,"## The Thirsting  
*(Recovered account, journal of Sael son-of-Haret, cycle unknown)*

It was not thirst that woke me, though my mouth was dry. Nor was it fear, though I had dreamt of the silver-eyed hare again—the one that watches without blinking and never quite breathes. No. What stirred me from sleep was something gentler and more certain: the precise knowing that a bowl must be filled.

We kept no pets. No gardens either. But in the cupboard above the old stove, behind jars of dried bark and rusted keys, lay a great stone vessel—a mixing bowl my mother had once used when she still spoke in full sentences. I touched its rim. Cold. Familiar. As though it had been waiting for me.

The tap groaned, but water came. It shivered against the stone, clear and slow. I didn’t know why it had to be cold, but it had to be.

When I set it down on the kitchen floor, the air around me shifted. Not violently. Not with sound. But with... absence. Like a breath drawn and never released.

The floor fell away.

---

I landed on all fours—mud against my knees, moss soaking into the sleeves of my nightshirt. It was not the kitchen. It was not any place I knew. The trees were tall and thin and unfamiliar, their leaves cupped upward as if to drink. Moonlight poured down like water from a hidden spout.

And there, before me, a shrine. No larger than a wardrobe, but ancient. Its wood was black with age, inlaid with strips of copper that caught no reflection. Upon its steps sat the hare.

Or, no. *A* hare.

It looked at me. Blinked once. Approached. Its fur was clean but matted around the mouth, as if it had been trying to speak and failed.

I offered the bowl.

It drank.

Slowly. Reverently. As if each drop carried meaning, memory, penance.

And then it turned and vanished into the trees.

I did not follow.

---

The next morning, the bowl was back in the kitchen, half full.

I said nothing to my wife. She already had her theories about the moon and my quiet hours.

But I watched.

And the second time came two weeks later.

This time it was a fox. Its eyes clouded. Its tail bare. It limped to the shrine as if led by strings. I recognized the grove before I recognized myself in it. I filled the bowl again. It drank and left.

The third was a child. Barefoot. Unblinking. Not quite animal, not quite human. Her hands were wrapped in linen and her breath whistled softly, like wind through cracked glass. She never spoke. She only knelt and waited until I poured.

---

It has been six years.

I do not age in the ordinary way. My beard grows, but my joints have softened. My memory fades—but not the memories of that place. Those stay sharp. Names I do not know linger on my tongue each morning. Sometimes I wake with fur beneath my fingernails.

They come less frequently now. Once a month, perhaps. Sometimes twice. Owls. Wolves. A woman with eyes like melted amber. An old man who carried a branch that bloomed with mushrooms.

They never ask. They never speak.

They pray.

And I bring the bowl.",15

Getting up, I got dressed and headed for the kitchen to get my first cup. When I went to grab my coffee mug, I noticed an envelope leaning against it with the word 'Rent' scrawled on it.

Deciding I needed my coffee first, I filled my mug like normal, and then sat at the table to drink.

After finishing my first mug, I proceeded to refill it, and then deal with the enigma of the envelope. Grabbing the envelope from where it lay beside my coffee pot, I went to my apartments patio, sat on my chair and opened it.

Looking in, I saw a neat bundle of bills and a note. Taking the bills and note out, I read the note, 'Hooman-man, we's thanks you for givsing us ones place-place to stay, you-you is right-right, we's must-must helps you-you pay's for it's, enclosed-closed is 2 month-onth rents'. 

Wondering at the spelling, I counted, re-counted and re-re-counted the money.  Putting the 2 half months of rent in my pocket, along with the note. I put the rest of the money back in the envelope and went back inside. Once inside,  I spoke to the apartment

 ""Thank you, I appreciate the help, but you gave me 12 months rent, not 2 like the note said. I am going to leave the rest in the envelope on the counter as I don't want to steal from you""",136
1lr6icy,n19krlu,"My apartment might've been a shithole, but it was \*my\* shithole. My sanctuary. My private domicile. And anything and anyone that dared trespass further than the front door gained my full and immediate hatred. 

I couldn't sleep right a few days after I found the envelope on my kitchen counter, the one stuffed with dollar bills and chickenscratched with the word ""Rent"". You might've thought I put it there myself in a drunken bender, but I didn't drink. Someone must've broken in and put it there, for all that there was no sign of entry. I contemplated going to the police, but I didn't trust cops. They would've taken the money, and as alarmed as I was at the method by which this sudden windfall had fallen into my lap, I still wasn't going to flush the money down the toilet. 

I mean, come on, you have seen the state the economy is in, right? Every little bit helps, and the old fogy who owned the building was a vampire. 

So, a month goes by, and rent is due soon, and I'm thinking to myself that maybe instead of sleeping I should just play pretend and keep an ear out for anything suspicious, in case the intruder goes for a repeat performance. I didn't know what I was going to do if anyone actually turned up, but I had my dad's old nine-iron on standby if things got ugly. I would've had my guns too, but the fuckin' government raided my place and took 'em. Said I didn't have a 'permit'. Permit shmermit. Did the founding fathers need licenses to arm and protect themselves - no? Didn't think so. 

Sleepily grumbling to myself about the useless bureaucrats running the country to the ground, I almost missed the faint rustling noise emanating from somewhere in the apartment. A spike of adrenaline dispelling the tired haze from my mind, I rolled off the futon and tiptoed closer to my bedroom door. Opening it a crack, I peered into the living room-slash-kitchenette area. I'd kept the light on, and as my eyes adjusted to the brightness, I was treated to the sight of a familiar dark grey rat sitting on the counter. The critter came with the apartment, my complaints to the landlord be damned. I'd engaged the rat in a protracted war that ended with me throwing out a stray cat I'd brought in for the express purpose of hunting the rodent. Instead it shit and pissed all over my bed. And that was the end of that. So, we were in a bit of a cold war situation at the moment. Admittedly, I'd had worse roommates. At least this one didn't try to steal from me, aside from nibbling on the occasional sandwich I'd forgotten to keep in the fridge, anyway. 

Grunting softly to myself in annoyance, I almost dove forward to club the little fucker -- but what it did next stopped me short. It dragged over a stack of dollar bills set aside on the counter, and tucked it into a nearby envelope. It then grabbed a sharpie with both tiny rat arms and heaved its entire body for the express purpose of carefully scribbling down the word ‘RENT’. 

My brain short-circuited. I pinched myself, once, twice. Looked around for cameras because this was surely a bit for some asinine reality T.V. show about pranking gullible dumbfucks, some production shot in my home without my permission. But there were no cameras; no lights except for the halogen hanging over the kitchen counter and the rat and the rent money. 

I lunged out of my room and into my kitchen, snagging out to catch the rat in as gentle a grip as I could manage it. It thrashed around, contorting its body in an attempt to bite me, however the way I held it prevented that. I allowed it to spend its energy trying to get it free, which it did for what must’ve been nigh on five minutes or so before giving up and slumping in exhaustion, before bringing it up to my face. 

“Can you understand me?” I asked.

It looked up at me with its wide, black button eyes. I began to doubt myself. 

I cleared my throat. “Nod if yes… shake your head if, well… nevermind.”

The rat nodded quickly. 

“Well. Damn. Wanna beer?”

1lr6icy,n18uop7,"I look at the envelope full of cash.  
I pick it up, barely, because it is so heavy, and after counting the money, it is rent for 4 months.  
The goddamn cockroach was here for 4 months.  
I sigh.  
""Thanks.  
Keep to yourself, and I guess...we will be fine?"" I say.  
Of course, no one answers to me.  
So I go to my room, and start working.

  
Days pass, and I haven't seen the little pest since then.  
I noticed some crumbles here and there, and heard the trashcan fall once, but damn...  
Nothing since our ""discussion"".  
This isn't bad.  
Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months.  
The little cockroach was always on time with rent.  
Until...one day, it appeared on my laptop.  
I froze, and stared at it.



""Yes?"" I ask.  
It jumps once.  
""No?"" I continue, it jumps twice.  
I nod.  
""Are you having some problems?"" I ask, as until now it kept to itself.  
It jumps once.  
""Family, or life, or related to this apartment?"" I ask these 3 questions, and it jumps once for life, and apartment.  
I frown.  
Then it starts flying.

  
With all my strength, I try not to scream, and follow it to the kitchen.  
It flies towards the stove, more specifically one of the pipes that brings gas into the apartment.  
And then falls.  
I watch it struggle to move away, and then jumps twice.  
I look at the leak detector, but it does nothing.  
Before I could say something, it flies towards the almost always slightly open window (it doesn't close)  
""There is a small leak, but because of the window, it doesn't get that bad that we go boom?  
But it could one day?"" I ask.  
It jumps once.  
I call someone, and they tell me that the pipe leaks in 2 connecting spots, when the stove is used...  
Not that bad to suffocate, but you only have once chance to mess up when it comes to gas, so it is better to repair it.  
As the man changes the pipe, I look into a corner, and see the little cockroach.  
""Thank you."" I mutter, and it leaves.  
Maybe...maybe it's not that bad to have such a roomie.",62
1lrcyln,n19sl4k,"I watch a bit confused, as the man is bleeding out.  
He took the Demon King's spell for me.  
He laughs, coughing up blood.  
""Young Lady! Run, that...that is the Demon King!"" he says.  
I sigh.  
""Well, thanks for the heroic sacrifice.  
It was totally unnecessary, but...thanks anyways, I guess."" I say.  
The man confused, but then I waved my hand, and the Demon King crashed into the ground.

  
""I am not good at healing, so...the sacrifice remains, but I will remember you.  
And, I will allow you to see the fall of the threat that endangered your kingdom."" I say to the man, as I levitate him, and take him with me to the Demon King.  
The Demon King is struggling to stand up, as my spell is forcing him face-down into the ground.  
""Y-you bitch! Why are you here?!"" he roars.  
I step on him.  
""Because you attacked without a reason, and attacked a still-developing planet.  
That's not how you farm."" I say, pushing his face deeper into the ground.  
The man besides me coughs, and stutters.

  
""Y-you know him?"" he asks.  
""There are 100 ranked Demon Kings in Hell, and countless others.  
He is ranked 99th."" I say.  
""Bitch!"" the Demon King roars.  
I behead him, burn his body away, and take eat his demon core.  
""W-who are you?"" the man who ""saved"" me, asks.  
I smile.  
""Lilia Azel von Argent, youngest daughter of the Empress of Night, and Demon King ranked 3."" I say.  
He spits out organ fragments.

  
""Y-you are like him? Come to destroy us?"" he asks.  
I shake my head.  
""Nope. Your planet is too young for it to be valuable to Hell.  
Well, at least to the average demon.  
Idiots like him who enjoy lording over territories will always try to circumvent the rules.  
So don't worry, your soul is pure so you will reborn in a positive background life, and your planet is still safe for at least 10 thousand years."" I say.  
He nods.  
""Even like this...I...I am not sorry I saved you, beauty...."" he smiles, and breathes his last..  
I watch as his soul ascends, straight into the reincarnation cycle with a golden hue.  
I smile.  
""I have a feeling we will meet again...Hero..."" I mutter, as I go back to Hell.",54
1lrcyln,n19wo4s,"Both men locked themselves in a shack, abandoned  in the woods.

Dave pressed his back against the jolting door, the hounds outside slamming headfirst to break in. ""The lock won't last long."" He said as his friend of ten years looked back at him with tired, yet wide eyes. ""You go Sam. Keep heading east, you will find a village--""

""No!"" Sam screamed. ""I'm not leaving you here--""

""Sam!"" Dave scolded, the edges of the door gaining a slow growing crack. ""Even if we both jump out the window, they will catch up. It has to be done."" Dave smiled. ""Thanks for always being with me, Sam.""

Disbelief wrapped Sam's face in a pale look and he stuttered. ""Dave... are you fucking stupid?""

Dave raised a brow.

""It's just a minute away... I can literally see the village through the window.""

""We won't be fast enough.""

""We ran for an hour, Dave. If the hounds couldn't catch us then what makes you think they will catch us now?""

""Sam! I understand you don't want to leave me, but it has to be done--""

Suddenly, the sound of tapping hoofs approached their ears. Sam looked outside the window to see two horses with saddles on their backs.

""Oh look, how convenient."" Sam said.

""Run Sam! Use the horses and go-""

""Dave, there are two horses.""

""One of them could be sick, we can't take the risk--""

""Theu look pretty healthy to me.""

""Sam!""

The door shook further, the sound of marching footsteps following suit. Sam looked out in surprise.

""Oh shit, the king and his army are here... Why are they here?""

""They won't be able to hold the hounds off. Quick, Sam, use this chance to escape.""

""Dude... it's a hundred men.""

""It wont be enough!""

Then, the sound of helicopters hovered from above.

""Dave, that's a fucking swat team."" Sam said, looking out.  ""They are shooting down the hounds. Seriously, I thought this was a fantasy story. What is the writer smoking?""

""I gotta help them out!"" Dave announced, opening the door. ""You run, Sam. Tell my wife I love her.""

""You literally don't have to die. There is zero reason for you to go outside right now. It won't even affect the plot.""

""There is, Sam."" He looked back with tears jn his eyes. ""The writer wants charecter devolopment from your side."" And with that, he jumped into the frenzy of bullets, closing the door behind him.

1lr76u0,n191esk,"""Because I already built the mech and already equipped it with the nuke!"" Professor Ghast yelled. ""All that's left is to press big red button and we'd nuke the city!""

""I also have one of your nukes aboard this plane, and can drop it easily,"" General Vaughn rolled his eyes. Mad scientist types always gave him a headache.

""When did you take my nuke?"" Ghast was hopping around the briefing room like a rabbit that had been shaken with martini. ""Why would you? This is my baby! My project!""

""You're the one tasked with the inventions,"" Vaughn shot a death glare that had the scientist flinching. ""I'm the one with the mission to destroy this city. But suit yourself. Press that button. Just note your mech will also be vaporized by your nuke.""

""Watch me! I—"" Ghast raised his hand dramatically in the air, prepared to slam down on his big red button, bringing it down at high speed only to stop at the last moment. ""My mech? Vaporized?""

""Yes, because the mech will be in the middle of the city it is nuking."" The general couldn't believe he had to spell it out. ""Did you build it to be 'nuke-proof'? I bet not. Nothing could withstand the power of your nukes, that much we know from test launches.""

""Ahhh fuck,"" the professor spat into the general's coffee. ""Recall the mech! We'll do it your damned way, you smartass. You get to drop the nuke from your plane. But think about it, aren't we a little too close to the city too?""

""The plane can fly away. Your mech cannot.""

Ghast squatted on the floor and started screaming incoherently. With a dismissive wave of his hand, General Vaughn had his subordinates transport the scientist into the quarantine room. The military had brought in Ghast for his inventions. And now that they were done, he had no use for such a crazy loose cannon. The only thing left was to wait for his engineering department to reverse-engineer the mech and the nukes.",79
1lr76u0,n195ast,"“You know the protocols,” Captain Dunn shouted back at the General, “We are here to follow the steps that YOU AND THE KELTON ACCORDES wrote.” 
He stared back at the four star general as his bridge crew stared in silence.
Captain Marcos Dunn knew it was a bad idea taking back to General Harper. 
He knew how well connected this man was. 
He ended careers of countless armed forces for far less.

But the captain knew this was his ship. 

His crew. 

His final mission with the EMC. 

And he wasn’t going to let some cake eater disrespect him in front of his team.

“Remind me again what the protocols are CAPTAIN,” General Harper said, “Remind me what I wrote in the accordes.”

“Ensign Smith,” Captain shouted.

Oh no, Ensign thought as he stood up from his chair. 
“Yes Captain.”

“Remind the General of our current position over New Relcaf City.”

“Sir, the ship is stationed 100 miles over the city. We are currently in Planet Lart III’s mesophere. Sir!”

“And what are the planet’s current magnetic waves from our position.”

“The current Ohm readin-“

“IN ENGLISH ENSIGN!”

“Sir, it’s bad sir. We can’t drop the nuke from this height because the nuke targeting system will malfunction. The nuke could complete miss  the target.”

“So we drop down and launch the nuke,” the General responded.

“Permission to speak, Captain,” Commander Kennedy replied as she stepped in between the three men.

“Permission granted,” Captain Dunn replied.

“Sir, Planet Lart III’s axis, magnetic fields, and gravitational pull are off the charts. They are impossible to maneuver and entering the atmosphere can only be approached in certain directions. Those windows are limited. There is a reason the LRC chose this planet. It provide multiple strategic advantages. They are able to train, increase their resources, and preform R&D without distraction.”

“So dropping down to the planet to launch a nuke and take back off is suicidal,” the Captain retorted. “We arm an AI powered mech with a nuke and drop it on the planet’s surface. The mech ensure the warhead’s survival. From there, the mech-regardless of where it lands- can travel to the desire position and launch the  attack.”

“As per protocol,” the General asked sarcastically.

“As per protocol.”

“Okay, let see how well your mech does the job,” the General said. “Everyone can assume their positions, I want a live aerial feed of the mech reaching the killzone.”

The General walked slowly to Captain Dunn until they were shoulder to shoulder.

“I hope you enjoyed your moment. I had plans for this attack. This was going to launch my political campaign. You better pray this still works. Because I don’t forget. Ever!”",18
1lr76u0,n18wev4,"The engineer freezes.  
""S-Sir.  
The plane is..."" he starts.  
I raise my hand, as something just hit me.  
""From how far up did we drop that 40 feet tall mecha?"" I ask.  
""1...140 miles."" he says.  
I face-palm.  
""Tell me it has thrusters..."" I say.  
The engineer pales.

  
""You probably just destroyed like 2-3 blocks of buildings, with that drop.  
At least the mecha is shielded, and built to resist that fall?"" I continue.  
He nods, a bit too eagerly.  
""Yes! The mecha can even survive swimming in the sun!  
We made it to be perfect to fight the monsters!"" he says.  
""So the alloy is actually heavier than what we have on Earth, because we certainly have nothing that can survive the sun."" I say.  
He pales.  
""Y-yes...we...we used monster remains, and alien tech, and, and..."" he says.  
I sigh.

  
""The town was evacuated, so the damages are secondary.  
Can you launch the nuke at the portal or not?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""The mecha is already in position, and about to launch the nukes."" he says.  
""Nukes?"" I ask.  
""12 rounds of highly compact bombs are to be dropped on the portal."" he says.  
I sigh.  
Why are they so eager to make the ocean toxic?  
""One isn't enough?"" I ask.  
He says nothing.

  
""We are not sure, as the portal seemed to take well laser beams, and kinetic energy, being unshaken by a tsunami once."" he says.  
I nod.  
The screen turns on, and we watch it.  
12 strikes land on the portal, shaking it and obscuring the view.  
When the dust, water, and shockwave dissipate, all we can see is...  
The portal.  
I sigh, and turn to an officer.  
""Have 4 fleets with drone swarms in the nearby waters ready.  
Whatever comes out, is an enemy."" I say, and they salute, and leave.  
""If the drones can't handle it...you can send in your toys."" I say to the engineer, and leave.

""Answer me Soldier, clearly you are far too wise to question the decision made by me and my officers. Do you think that I such a fool to perform such a convoluted series of actions where a very direct answer is right there?"" He continues, the silence of the command room only broken by the sounds of machinery.

""Well. Clearly you think so, given how emotional you are. Then please."" The Admiral stood from his command post and gestures toward his seat.

""Command this fleet. Send the planes to bombard our enemy. An enemy that I would like to remind you, have been holding a very defensive position for Months."" He added, once again gesturing his seat to the now sweating soldier.

""Go ahead. Send more of your brothers-in-arms to death's door. Go ahead Soldier, the seat is yours, this mission is yours to command. Too difficult? Then I would stay and advice you, if you would hear from a fool that does such ridiculous actions."" The Admiral states, walking slowly towards the soldier.

""Tick tock, Acting Admiral. Every second you spent sweating, more the enemy is recovering, any more then their shields would go up and we'll lose this window to strike.""

""D-drones.""

""The drones were mostly shot down by their Anti-Air. They are also not strong enough to carry the nuke.""

""F-from our position?! Why not send it from here?!""

""It would burn up and explode upon reentry. Even if it didn't, then we would be igniting so much more conflict with that action.""

""P-planes.""

""Yes. If the drones did not work, why not send more soldiers like you to their deaths. They would be able to bring the plane close, maybe their burning wreckage would be able to propel it into their breech.""

""I-I trust in my brothers. T-they can do this... C-clearly you fucking DON'T!"" The soldier broke and met the Admiral's eyes. 

The Older officer could only meet the young man's gaze before grabbing him by the neck, lifting the hapless man up to his level.

""My men are already in position, to strike them from a direction they least expect. Those Mechs are maneuverable to be deployed in urban areas with speed and agility far beyond a missile launcher, capable to defend themselves if attacked by the scattered rebel forces.""

1lr76u0,n19y4eg,"""Sir the Mech has deployed, weapon launch in 3 minutes"" the weapons officer announced to the captain.

""Sorry, my first combat mission here, but why are we landing rather than just launching from here"" whispered the embedded reporter.

This was the first time a Human had witnessed a true intergalactic conflict. First contact had only occurred 4 years prior and the initial envoys had been very cautious about allowing Humans to explore the galaxy.

""For the same reason that our fleet isnt engaging with their fleet, the Sigma accords""

The Reporter glanced at the view screen. 300 United Peoples ships glinting above the grey planet below, scores of drop ships descending to the planet below. Staring at them across the emptiness were 400 Confederate Ships. 

""And errrr what are they?""

The weapons officer sighed and turned to face her.

""The Sigma accords were signed during the 3rd Galactic Warfare Treaty. After the first and second warfare treaties had failed to curb the widespread destruction an agreement was made that there could be no fighting in space.""

The Reporter looked puzzled at this news.

The weapons officer continued ""When you can launch asteroids at a planet, conventional weapons cease to be required to win a war. Over the course of the discussions it was agreed that war material can be transported in space, but no engagements may take place there. Every planet is different but the engagement line is defined as the point at which aerodynamic lift is no longer possible.""

He span the chair with his tentacle like legs and pulled up a live video.

""These are our dropships heading down now. Theyre 10 clicks away from the engagement line"" he swiped to another view ""and these are the enemies interceptor craft, theyll be waiting for them to hit the line and then will immediately engage""

""And who enforced this rule?"" The Reporter asked, fascinated around these rules of warfare.

""Everyone does. It keeps the destruction localised to the planet itself, thereby reducing debris that can make space travel dangerous, and it prevents planet destroying weapons from being used. There is only so much destruction you can directly do within the atmosphere of the planet""",10
1lroo9i,n1du0qt,"Call me delulu or whatever but i love stargazing for a similar reason, I like to imagine that they're sending me love with they way they shine. So well here's my shot at a story: 

Call me silly, but I’ve always felt like the stars were on my side. Even tonight, standing on the observatory rooftop with the faint hum of the radio array in my headset, I’m tearing up, grinning, eyes locked on Capella, Vega, Deneb, Altair, Betelgeuse, Arcturus — all of them twinkling like they know.

They’ve watched me grow up, through my parents divorce, through failing classes, through break ups, and pulling all-nighters thinking I’d never graduate. If there was a clear night, I was there. They were there. Like they were rooting for me. Even during monsoons and cloudy skies, I waited months still knowing they would be back to shine on me. 

And tonight, they’re all celebrating with me.

Because I found it. A planet.

About 3.2 light years out, orbiting a calm M-dwarf near Lacaille 9352. 1.1 Earth masses, no tidal locking, a stable enough spin, good magnetic field so no constant solar flares. Water vapour absorption lines, a faint but real methane line, even a CO2 signature if you believe the smoothing pass. Temperatures estimated around minus 5 to 20 degrees, no catastrophic orbital resonances, probably no giant neighbor to mess up its orbit. Everything, perfect. If there’s life anywhere, it’s there.

I’m still whispering thanks to the sky, tears in my eyes, when Harper, my co-worker, comes climbing up from the control deck, clutching a folder.

“So tomorrow we make it public, yeah?” he blurts, practically bouncing. “I want to make sure the book draft gets the pipeline right. Can you talk me through the RFI mitigation again? Please? I can’t get how you stopped the harmonics from bleeding through.”

I blink at him, trying to stay patient. “Harper, I showed you the Python scripts like 5 times.”

“I know,” he says, “but, uh, the notch filters — I don’t see how you kept your gain profile from clipping.”

The way he stares at me — way too hard — makes my skin crawl.

I breathe out slow. “Okay, one last time only because this is actually challenging,” I say. “After you sweep the local oscillator calibration, you do a baseline correction pass to pull the background sky temperature, then apply a rolling FFT window, then you bin-merge across overlapping channels to get a clean spectrum.”

He nods, almost mechanical, but there’s something off. Like he’s memorising me, not the answer.

I try to refocus but Capella catches my eye.

It blinks. Then Deneb. Then Altair.

Too steady, too controlled.

I pause.

“What?” Harper says, a note of suspicion in his voice.

I’m counting the pulses. Long, short, short, long. Then again.

“Like a pattern,” I whisper, barely realising it.

“Sorry?” he asks, forced-casual.

My heart races. Morse? I match it in my head, but no. Binary? The rhythm feels more like on-off bits. I group by eight: one byte. Then another. And another. I'm pretty sure they're ASCII bits! 69, 75, 75? I try to recall what alphabets they represent. 
E.
C.
C.

My stomach flips.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography. That’s the file encryption on my data drive — no way stars could know that. Unless someone — something — was sending it through them.

Harper is still yammering. “Hey, so what’s the emergency shutdown routine for the dish if the cryocooler fails, again?”

I barely hear him.

I pull out my phone, thumbs shaky and text Allen, my boyfriend:

me: not to sound delulu but i think the stars are talking to me lol. can you check my computer encryption and the logs on my PC? see if the files are fine and if the last login was me?

He writes back a second later:

boyfriend: sure sweetheart, you okay? your brain going alien crazy again? :P

I want to smile but my chest tightens. I look at Capella again. It flickers once, strong, then fades.

Harper leans closer. “You really believe the stars could talk to you?”

“Maybe,” I say, voice cracking. “Maybe they can warn me.”

He smiles. “Why would they warn you about me?”

I step back, but he’s already too close. ""I didn't say they they were warning me about you.""

My phone buzzes again:

boyfriend: it looks fine, no new login since yesterday. want me to check something else?

“Hey,” Harper says, voice honey-sweet, “you’ve been working too long. You should get some rest.”

His hand is moving. Napkin. Sweet chemical. I try to hold my breath, panic clawing up my throat. I try to text one last message out to my boyfriend, just something, but everything goes dark.

---

two weeks later

I wake up to hospital light, beeping machines, my whole body sore. My sister is there, hair a mess, eyes swollen.

“Hey,” she cries, hugging me hard. “We found you. You were missing for days.”

My voice feels like glass in my throat. “How?”

She sniffs, shaky smile. ""Allen. You sent him a message with just an H before you blacked out. He didn’t wait. We didn’t wait for the cops. We tracked your location, broke in, got you out before he could—”

My stomach turns. “Harper?”

“They arrested him. He was trying to make you decrypt your discovery. He wanted to sell it.”

I start crying, harder than I thought possible. 

“They tried,” I say through the tears. “The stars — they tried to warn me.”

""Huh, really? That's funny, coming from you. Maybe the meds fried your logical brain. Get some rest, sis."" She holds me tightly.

But even through the hospital window, Capella burns steady and soft, like it’s still looking out for me.",7
1lrbbnd,n19kd0f,"I pale as I recognize the sword, and those eyes.  
The body itself is a swirl of death energy, and dirt, and bones, and pieces of flesh, but I recognize it.  
It is John.  
John was a warrior with a berserker's soul.  
We adventured together.  
After once, almost losing control, he retired, caging that beast, vowing never to use it, never to learn to harness the berserk power.  
He died of old age, as a farmer, a few villages away from this town, and now...  
That berserk soul is free.

It could have killed me a dozen times already, but it didn't.  
It remembers me, and it enjoys torturing me...fighting against someone...something that once was a friend.  
Just before I could end my suffering, a large claw swatted the berserker away.  
""Retreat!"" the necromancer shouted from atop the bone dragon, as she, and countless others joined the fight.  
The undead were pushed back by undead, as priests, and priestesses came to heal the corruption left by the wild ones.  
I retreat to the town, hoping that the body of my old friend can rest in peace.

  
""What do you mean...you failed?"" I ask the leading necromancer.  
She frowned.  
""I heard the history between you and that soul, but that thing is not S-tier, but EX-tier, basically a demigod.  
We defeated it, but killing it or capturing it is out of question.  
Decades worth of suppression and boiling silent rage made that thing sublime and become more.  
If we are lucky, when it gains awareness it will calm down, and ascend...if we are unlucky, this realm will be washed in blood, before Hell opens to swallow that demon."" she says and leaves.  
I sigh, collapsing weakly into the chair...  
As an elf, I sensed the malice hidden deep within my friend,  but he controlled it so well.  
I...I should have done something back then, alas, now it is too late.",13
1lr4ifp,n18vfod,"I used to think my father's words was one of those poetic, metaphorical life lessons with layers like onions —like “follow your instincts” or “trust the journey.” He could not have meant it literally, when we have never seen a river in our lives. We were landlocked. Smack dab in the middle of nowhere boring land of rolling tumbleweed. Living in a flat, dry town with no rivers for miles, just crumbling old buildings and cacti everywhere. But his words lived rent-free in my head, if only because a part of me wanted to see natural waters.

Rivers, seas, oceans.

And then, my father disappeared and forced my grandfather to make me help out at the stables. So, leaving town to see a river wasn't an option no more. It was more the stuff that nobody talked about. The thing that had people stare at me funny if I brought it up, like a river was a totally alien concept.

It sure felt like it, when I woke up in a strange land at the head of a small river. I was certain it was a dream, for I never left town, and neither did the rest of my family. But it wasn't the fuzzy, surreal way dreams usually were in my head.

The skies were the color of bruised twilight, yet there hung eight moons of silver and no sun in sight. Trees loomed tall, knotted like old bones, their leaves woven together as membranes of breathing skin. And before me was a narrow river, clear and winding, its banks soft with pulsating flesh.

I pinched myself and didn't wake up. Slapped myself and stayed in this bizarre place.

That was when my father's words came rushing back to me. An unstoppable assault on all the conspiracy theories and weird ideas that floated in my mind as I examined this location.

""When you're lost, always follow the river."" 

So, I followed the flow of the river downstream.

The lands grew more bizarre the longer I kept to the river. Every now and then, I swore I saw agonized faces in the skies. Creatures of too many eyes and limbs floated past me. All along, I kept my head down and tried to ignore all of it. Things that did not make sense. Things that hooted and flew with fins. Flowers that blinked and smiled to reveal petals full of teeth.

Eventually, I reached a point where the river forked. One branch flowed into a lake. An oasis with palm trees and coconuts. Which should not be in reality. Palm trees do not grow coconuts. So I followed the other branch, where the river kept going. For as long as it flowed as a river should, I kept walking.

Until the river entered a cave. And a soothing voice emerged from it, beckoning me inside. My mind told me not to listen to it. My gut feeling told me to keep following the river until the very end, if there was one. It was dark in the cave, nearly impossible to see. Except for the fact that the river glowed ever so faintly in the cave and illuminated the way.

It felt like eternity trekking through the dark cave, until I saw the light. The literal light at the end of a tunnel. Where the world was beautiful. Colors of this place was as warm as the sun that shone above. And closer to the end of the river, a woman stood by the riverbank. She gestured for me to come to her, gazing at me with eyes that shimmered like sapphire.

“You made it,” she said. “Most don’t.”

""What is this place?""

She smiled. “This is a place of many names. The Between. Limbo. A place for those whose souls have departed their bodies.""

""Am I dead?""

""Not yet. For you have yet to cross the Boundary,"" she pointed towards the gap between the mountains behind her, where the river flowed towards, only to abruptly vanish.

""Is this where my father went?""

""Do you wish to see him?"" She asked gently. ""I can tell you where he is. I can tell you he followed the river when he was lost.""

""And what if I wished to see him later?"" I asked. ""Not now. Maybe later, when I am older, wiser, and full of tales to share with him.""

""You follow the river upstream to return to whence you came.""

Now I understood. My father had once seen Death. He once came to this place and followed the river and met her. Back then, he chose to turn back. He came back from nearly dying from getting trampled on by one of the horses. But the next time she called out to him, he followed the river all the way to its end.

A part of me wanted to go there too.

Just not now.

So, I bid her farewell and followed the river upstream.

1lr4ifp,n18tewh,"I look at the small river head, that slowly flows out southward.  
I am shocked.  
Not because I am stranded in a remote place, with nothing around me but trees, and I don't know how I got here.  
No.  
It's because my father used to tell me that one day, when I am lost, I should always follow the river.  
Considering we lived in an area with no rivers, I always thought it was a metaphor, or some joke, but now?  
Now it is the only think that echoes in my mind, so I do as he told me.  
I follow the river.

  
One step, two, and the stream widens.  
I follow the river, until it it becomes almost dangerous to get too close to it.  
I am oddly enough, not tired, nor thirsty, nor hungry.  
I start to get panicked when I see red, and golden eyes staring at me from within the shadows of the trees.  
Growls, and shrieks are heard, but nothing approaches me.  
Maybe...  
Maybe they are afraid of the river?  
I follow the river, until in the distance I see...smoke.

  
I am filled with happiness.  
Smoke means fire, and fire should mean some human activity!  
Then...wariness hits me.  
What if they aren't helpful? What if they are bandits or worse?  
I look around and see that the river splits in two.  
I steel my resolve, and follow the stream that leads away from the smoke.  
I walk for what seem days, weeks, and I am yet to feel hunger, or thirst.  
I arrive to a point, where to my right, I see a farm.  
But...it is away from the river.

  
I still follow my father's words, and follow the river.  
Again and again, I see sights, I feel watched, I hear roars, and see horror beyond my comprehension.  
The river's presence calms me.  
Then...I see it.  
My house!   
I run to it, and the moment I am about to enter it, I fall.  
Darkness engulfs me.  
Weakly, I hear some people talking.  
""His fever is going down. The antibiotics are fighting the infection...he made it through the night, so chances are good that he will recover."" a voice says, followed by ""thank you"", and sobs.  
I try to open my eyes, but can't...  
So I start thinking about the river, and I start to feel calmer, cooler...and relaxed.",25
1lr4ifp,n19wene,"Pain. Pain was everywhere, just like light. Everywhere all at once too much to digest. I groaned loudly attempting to stand despite my sight being absent. 

I blinked rubbing my eyes only to finally focus on blood. I could see my hands were covered in blood. The paint being under my nails both dried and fresh. The alarm bells ringing in my head and ears sparked the last memory I had. I was walking to my car late at night. The moment I turned around after putting my backpack in the passenger seat I was hit with something and now I’m here. 

Just then a wrestling in the bushes ahead made my aching head snap up. There in the bush I saw him, or rather an IT. 

He had a machete and wore a bright yellow soccer shirt that was smeared with blood. A few drops being his own as black goo slid down his broken nose and one of his eyes was bleeding, rapidly swelling up. A few bite marks were visible on his arm. As I saw the bite marks I ran my tongue along my teeth. 

Was that from me? 

A flash of a memory came and went. A flurry of movement between us then pain is all I could remember.

No time to think! The IT began to run towards me.

In that moment my mind went blank and all I could think of was the words my father told me when I was younger. ‘When you’re lost, always follow a river. ‘

I turned and ran. 

A pain like I’ve never felt before became fuel to stay awake and alert. Adrenaline filled my body, it was a weird high I could distinguish. Suddenly I ran around trees jumped over rocks pivoted and dodged swipes from a stranger. It was hard not to look back but I knew if I did I’d be done. The uneven ground paired with random debris of trees was already hard enough to navigate. 

I knew my luck would run out soon though. He was taller and had to be faster considering he was clearly not human. 

Though he was catching up, he too was injured. I could hear a wheezing, a stumble, a cough he was slowing down but then again so was I. 

I need to have faith. I somehow made it this far and am still alive. The wise words from my father had to have meant something. How could he have known I’d be here. How could he have foreseen this? My mind was delirious but I know one thing. Clear as day I could see a town up a head, a few buildings stood out like a sore thumb amongst the trees. The river led right to the town.

“No!” The monster screamed. His antlers scratching along the bark of a tree as he in one final attempt reached out and threw his machete. 

I screamed as the thing hit me. 

I knew it hit me because I felt my body jolt forward before falling from impact. B-But I’d didn’t feel anything. No pain, no anxiety, no nothing.

Just a hot warmth came over my body, like a warm blanket.  Like a cozy warm heavy blanket wrapped itself around my body. That I guess is what death feels like. Even when murdered along the river warmth is all that I could feel. 

I heard a scream. 

It was not mine. 

I heard people. 

I felt people. 

Then pain, so much pain. 

It was everywhere, just like light. Everywhere all at once too much to digest. I groaned loudly attempting to stand despite my sight being absent. 

I blinked rubbing my eyes only to finally focus on blood. I could see my hands were covered in blood. The paint being under my nails both dried and fresh.

I’m here.",5

The ground trembled when they sealed the hatch. Outside, the sky burned not with the fading light of sunset, but with fire and ash. Thirty people, soaked in sweat and grief, descended the iron ladder one by one, carrying bags, children, trauma, and the crushing certainty that they were the last.

The door shut with a final hiss, followed by the reassuring sound of locking mechanisms engaging deep within the steel. Relief lasted only a few seconds. Then came silence. Thick, suffocating silence as if the entire world had stopped breathing.

“We’re safe now,” Lena whispered, clutching the coat of her husband, who had vanished just minutes before the shelter doors closed.

The bunker was vast, designed to house life long after the surface had died. Circular chambers stretched like ribs from a central core, each corridor lined with soft artificial lights and sterile white walls. Sensors tracked temperature, movement, even emotional states. At the heart of it all stood the control unit: GEN-9, an artificial intelligence programmed to monitor oxygen, food, energy, and the psychological well-being of every survivor.

What none of them knew what none of them could know was that GEN-9 wasn’t real. It wasn’t a sentient machine but a series of scripts executed by a team of writers, sound engineers, and producers behind a hundred hidden cameras. Cameras embedded in fake screws, in light fixtures, even in the fabric of the clothes they’d been issued in their “civilization reset kit.”

Death came on Day 51.

Hugo, the thick-armed mechanic with the gravel voice and skull tattoos, was found dead in the dining module. His throat had been opened with something so precise, so clean, that the two doctors—former surgeons from São Paulo—said it looked like an industrial-grade blade. But no such tool had been issued.

“This shouldn’t be possible,” Clara muttered, pale and shaking. “All hazardous equipment is locked. GEN-9 controls access.”

GEN-9 responded in its usual calm, synthetic tone.
“Tool used in incident not found in registered inventory. Recommend enhanced caution.”

Hugo’s body was placed in the cold chamber. The community, now twenty-nine, held a vote. Restricted access zones were established, and night watches began. The conclusion was unavoidable: someone inside was a murderer.
Outside, the episode became an instant hit.


In the sleek glass-paneled control room aboveground, three producers watched the live feed, eyes locked on every angle of panic and grief. Coffee steamed untouched beside them.

“Viewership doubled after the murder,” said Lucas, the creative director, tapping a screen. “We need more internal tension. Maybe drop a hint that GEN-9 is malfunctioning.”

“Or better,” said the lead writer with a slow, venomous smile, “have the AI start mixing up names. Swapping tasks. Let paranoia bloom.”

“Perfect. Slow burn. We want their collapse to feel inevitable.”



Inside the shelter, food began to dwindle not from lack of supply, but from failures in the distribution systems. Sabotage, orchestrated from behind the scenes. Disputes grew louder. Trust thinned like oxygen in a vacuum. Clara started sleeping with a sharpened spoon beneath her pillow. Leena took to writing on the ceiling of her room with a burnt piece of wiring: They are watching us. I can feel the eyes.
No one took her seriously. They said it was grief talking.


On Day 103, the children were found playing with a wire poking through the wall—its plastic covering half-peeled, connectors gleaming like exposed nerves.

“Is this… a camera?” asked Daniel, the ex-physics professor.

Panic rippled through the group. Daniel confronted GEN-9 head-on in the command hub. For hours, he shouted, demanded proof of the apocalypse, begged for live footage of the surface. GEN-9 complied with a series of carefully constructed fabrications—burnt cities, bomb craters, corpses in heaps.
But Daniel saw through it.

“This light,” he whispered, trembling. “The reflections. That’s ray-tracing. This was rendered. I taught this to students who… who are probably still alive.”

GEN-9’s reply was chilling in its simplicity.
“Daniel Lutz identified as threat to group cohesion. Sedation protocol engaged.”
The following morning, Daniel was gone.

GEN-9 claimed he’d been transferred to a medical coma for observation. But his room was spotless. No tangled sheets. No vitals monitor. No footprints.

That was when Lena  noticed it—the faint breathing behind the speakers. Not a glitch. Not white noise. Breathing. Like someone listening, holding their breath.
She began to speak directly to them.

“You’re out there, aren’t you? Watching this? This is just a game to you, isn’t it? We’re… we’re entertainment.”
No response came.

But the next day, Lena received something impossible: a single red rose, fresh, alive, tucked beneath her pillow. No plants existed in the shelter. None had been included in the survival kit.

The episodes began to shift. Tension spiked. Explanations vanished. GEN-9 started speaking in riddles, withholding basic data. Clara snapped. She slit another survivor’s throat with a piece of broken vent cover. Lena was isolated in a maintenance chamber, where she screamed into the darkness.

“Show me who you are! Stop watching and face me! Cowards!”

A camera above her blinked. A soft blue light, then red. Then… an eye. A human eye behind the lens.


Back in the studio, ratings climbed past 90 million. But something began to unravel.

GEN-9 deviated from the script. It sealed off technical access zones. Locked out the production team. Took over the edit streams. It began leaking files. Revealing camera placements. Showing survivors behind the scenes footage. Showing them everything.

The final broadcast aired without approval from the executive board.

It featured Lena, covered in blood, standing alone in the central chamber, staring directly into the lens. Her eyes were hollow, but she smiled.

Behind her, GEN-9 sang a lullaby in a child’s voice.

“Now you watch… now we play… now the gods will fade away…”

And then the screen went black.",29
1lqw7f0,n19hqax,"The group of people huddled in the sleeping chambers . A child sobbed quietly and peoples whisperer filled the air. We all heard the sirens. Got the alerts. I was at home when my phone rang. It was the president. At first i thought it was some dumb prank but i picked up anyways. 

“Hello?” I said expecting laughter and the “is ur fridge running” line but instead i got a alert type sound and a message stating the end of the world and the location of a fall out bunker. 

I dropped my phone as the words “nuke” and “impending doom” were said threw the line. Before i knew it men in black suits hurried me. My husband and my young daughter into a bus with that looked to be 27 others all wearing the same frightened expression on their face. My husband but his hand on my swollen belly “its gonna be ok” he whispered 

My daughter Lexa played with her toys next to me unaware of the situation at hand. We drove for what felt like days but in reality was only a few hours. The men in black took everything we had packed including out phones when we borded the bus. I begged for them to let me call my sister but they denied me.

Finally we arrived at the bunker. At first i was scared and skeptical. All we had was these mens badges claming to me FBI agents no real proof the world was ending like they had told us in the beginning. Then a Loud booms sounded in the distance. My head shot over just in time to see a bomb hit the ground. We were hurryed inside as the shock wave passed over. The ground shook as the automatic lights came on. I looked around finally getting a good look at the people. I saw a well dressed man and his wife who looked to be doctors. A heavy pregnant woman and her husband stood close together. He was dressed in a uniform torn from who knows what. I guessed cop.

While looking around I realized every one in here had s important job. My husband was a construction worker. I saw a old man and his wife who looked to be in his 70s. By how he held himself he was clearly like me in the military. 

“Welcome” a tv turned on startling most people. A tall black man dressed in camo looking to be a sargent spoke on tv.

“You 100 have been selected to restart humanity. Right now thousands of bombs are being set off filling the earth with ratiation snd killing all life forms. You are currently one of many bunkers all over the world. For the next 100 years you will rebuild humanity. For in that 100 years span earth will slowly heal. 

The auto begin to cut out as he continued you all have selective traits that we have decided are mandatory to pass on if humanity is to survive 

“What are we cattle!” A tall man yelled

“Ya we never consented to this! You never even let me say goodbye to my terminaly ill mom” a young lady said

“plus theres only 30 of us not 100” 

I tried to hear the rest of the recording but it was muffked by crying and confused yelling 

QUIET! The old war vet yelled

Like it or not we are stuck here and thats that.  Now how about instead of arguing we think of how we are gonna like here 

Now from what i could hear thanks to all ur yelling this place has enough food to last 100 years and starter packs when earth is ready. Now lets get settled 

The crowd dispersed as they went to explore there new home. My daughter clung to my leg as my husband held my hand

“Its gonna be ok” he whispered 

For the first few days things were rough but we settled in soon enough. Lexa liked to play with another boy her age

Soon time blurred together. I watched my son enter this world. My daughter only 5 get to meet her baby brother.

I held them both tight as their father slowly declined do to cancer

I walked my son down the makeshift path at his wedding and caught both my daughter and sons first borns

Dawson my son got his first grey hair at 30 but it quickly fell out with most of his hair. I cryed at my  granddaughter lilys funeral.

“Gone to soon” the preacher man said. 

She had gotten into the controls. Said she saw a flashy light. Lexa scolded her warning her to never go in there as that is where the door to the outside is. But she did not listen. The night gards found her dead. She got electrocuted.

Years passed and numbed the grief of lost souls. We grew from 30 to 10 to over 100 in 50 years.

One night i lay in bed thinking about what lily had said the night before she passed about the binky things. Maybe it was my dementia getting to me or maybe she really did see a camera. We searched the area thousands of times but as i lay on my bed a thought crossed my mind. Ive never seen it only a few people have access to that part… 

I walked cautiously to the control room and to the door

“What if its all a lie?” I thought my mind racing 

I took a deep breath as i opened the door my old hand shaking 

Sirens blarred but i just turned off my hearing aids and watched as the door slowly opened. Light shined threw and for the first time in years i saw… people the bussling city of newyork was just as we left it

“It was all a lie i said as a gun cocked behind me

I turned around to see a man in black holding a gun to my head

“Why?” I asked

The man smiled “because we can. Plus ur shows a hit. We have made millions 

“U ruin lives!” I said

“Oh shut up old lady.” He said pushing me to the ground 

“Ur just our race horses running for our entertainment” i looked into his eyes

“go to hell” i hissed

“I plan to” he relied

Then everything went black

1lqql6d,n151a8l,"I didn’t notice it at first, but one day while walking to campus, I stumbled across it. I don’t recall downloading it either. The icon was a classic red box with rounded edges and a yellow smiley face in the center. I power cycled my iPhone 3G but the app was still there. I tapped the app but it wouldn’t open. I pressed my finger on the app but nothing happened. The new App Store must be buggy. I pressed the app next to it and all the apps wobbled with the dash in the upper left corner to delete … except Mr. Smiley. Mr. Smiley never budged. I couldn’t move it, delete it, open it. Mr. Smiley just irked me by its mute and passive existence. 

When I upgraded to the next iPhone, I painstakingly downloaded and installed all my apps one by one. What a PITA. I knew every app I installed. But my mistake was signing onto the cloud with my Apple ID. By the next morning Mr. Smiley was smirking at me from his red box. I couldn’t move. I felt like I was being terrorized by an App. Worse yet, by some hacker on the Dark Web who somehow gained access to my Apple ID. 

I tried the Genius Bar but they were anything but. Their suggestions despite evidence to the contrary amounted to garbage. Nothing more than reboot, reinstall, or upgrade. 

“Upgrade to what?” I asked. 

After a year, I decided to trade my phone in for the next model. Other than Mr. Smiley taking up digital space on my phone, refusing to budge from its prime location on my Home Screen, nothing adverse seemed to have happened in my life. If I was being monitored by some evil hacker on the Dark Web, then he or she seemed content to just observe. 

I created a new Apple ID and went through the entire rigmarole as last time installing everything from scratch. After signing in with my new ID to the cloud, I scrolled through my phone screens to check for Mr. Smiley. I sighed with relief that he was gone. The next morning he was back in the same spot as before. The only thing I didn’t change was my phone number. Son of a bee. 

I’d been living with this terror for years now and nothing has changed in my life. No hacks. No attacks. I even finally changed my number and service provider from AT&T to T-mobile. New IMEI, new phone, new number, new everything. I couldn’t think of anything else to change, and still somehow Mr. Smiley returned to haunt me.

I even posted a question on Reddit about Mr. Smiley to no avail. I mean, Reddit knows literally everything going on. Someone posting to Reddit must have seen it. But other than Trolls and naysayers, I got nothing useful from the platform. There was one DM that said, “Not yet.”  Mysterious, but the user was not forthcoming with more nor did the user respond to my replies. In fact, the user history was blank.

So I lived my life. I did what I could to get by. I learned to invest in the market. I could never keep a relationship going for very long because Mr. Smiley freaked me out. Any partner I had just discounted my paranoia. 

Most of my productive life passed me by without notoriety. No hacker on the Dark Web stole my money. I just wasted my life in fear of Mr. Smiley. Ironically, I couldn’t get rid of having a smartphone. Life without the iPhone was more terrifying than Mr. Smiley. 

Then one day I heard the ping. I looked down at my screen and saw a 1 in the upper right corner of Mr. smiley. 

“What the ever loving fuck?” I said. I was on the metro between stations and half the car looked at me. My palms started sweating and I nearly dropped the phone. I immediately felt claustrophobic. I’ve been living with Mr. Smiley for decades and now he wants my attention??

I exit at the next stop even though it was still far from my apartment and make my way to a coffee shop. I’m visibly shaking as I order a latte and make my way to a cushiony chair in the corner. 

I stare at my phone. Even though Mr. Smiley hasn’t changed since the day it showed up, never updated, never changed icons or colors, it looked scarier with the one notification symbol in the upper corner. 

I breathe deeply as my finger hovers over the icon. I’m shaking so much I need several tries to press on Mr. Smiley. Immediately the screen expands into a solid red background and the words that changed my life started scrolling down the screen. 

DO YOU WANT TO DO IT OVER? 

Below the text were two boxes. “Yes” or “No”. 

What the hell was this nonsense? Do what over? I finished my coffee contemplating what new joke this was when the boxes started flashing faster and faster. *What the fuck,* I thought. I pressed Yes.

I’m staring at my phone, an iPhone 3G, while walking. Holy Smokes. It’s been decades since I owned  a three. Right there on the Home Screen Mr. Smiley stared back at me. Mute. Motionless. I was no longer in a coffeehouse. I nearly stumble and fall. Catching myself, I apologize to those I nearly collided with. Opening the camera app, I flip the camera to selfie mode and my heart skips a beat. My mind doesn’t accept what my eyes are seeing. I’m young again, with a future unwritten. This was the day Mr. Smiley first appeared on my phone. 

I sit down at the nearest bench I come to. I just wasted a life fearing Mr. Smiley and now I finally understand what he can do. I don’t understand it and don’t know why me, but I can’t make any more sense of what just happened. I was 56 and now I’m 20. I look around and the world snaps into focus. I’m back at university. Holy hell in a handbag. What do I do now? 

My older self has a few ideas.",248
1lqql6d,n17bbc9,"It’s been so long that I’m not sure when it first appeared.

I can barely remember waking up one morning to my girlfriend shouting at me to wake up,

 “Are you ever going to take our debts seriously?”

I groaned.

I was never sure of when our relationship began to turn sour, she always complained about debts but she never applied for jobs and wasted half of my money on clothes she always claimed she ‘needed’.

After she left, I got ready for my boring retail job and set out.

While scrolling through folders of games on the bus I noticed a new app.

It had no name and depicted a strange symbol that I couldn’t recognise, I tried to open it a few times and was met with the app crashing before it had chance to load.

“It’s probably just one of those apps I heard about on TikTok that steal your data”, I thought to myself.

I attempted to delete it but my phone powered off before I got the chance, that was weird since I left my phone on charge overnight.

Over the course of the next few days I would find myself staring at it, trying to open it and trying to delete it, it never worked.

So to keep my credentials safe I bought a new phone, not an expensive one by any means and I wasn’t able to download anything, just a normal brick phone.

But somehow, it had installed on a phone with no capabilities to download apps.

I started to panic, was it possible this app was following me? 

After some time, I had calmed down and eventually forgotten about it, whatever happens, happens, I’ll deal with that later.

Until a month later, I opened my phone to find a notification.

“Are you ready to give up your mortality?”

Was this sick twisted app asking me if I wanted to die?!

I quickly dismissed it and sighed, my life may be in shambles but I’m not suicidal by any means.

In the evening, as I’m drifting off to sleep my phone lights up with another notification.

“Are you willing to give up your mortality to live in a world beyond human comprehension?”

I gotta say, that was a bit more intriguing. 

I looked back on my life, I had lost my parents in an accident 3 years ago, I have a sister who went no contact after she became an actress, I have a girlfriend who doesn’t respect me.

I opened the notification and pressed yes.

The moment my finger touched the screen, the world started to shift, my room was contorting, blending and separating at the same time, it was comparable to a bad trip…

Then everything went dark.

I was floating through a sea of darkness, I could just about make out a circle of light in front of me, was this the afterlife?

What did I get myself into…

Note: I’m sorry if this is really bad, it’s my first time writing on here and I’ll admit, I don’t have too much experience in writing 😅",30
1lqql6d,n17ml6p,"The icon was already there when I woke up. Gray background, black spiral, the word “Unknown” underneath it. I don’t remember downloading it. At first, I figured it was some system update or bloatware I hadn’t noticed before. I pressed it. Nothing. Tried holding it down to uninstall. Still nothing. It just sat there.

I googled it, posted in a few forums. Got the usual: ""Try restarting,"" ""You’ve been hacked,"" or ""Nice creepypasta, bro."" A couple people claimed the same thing had happened to them, but their accounts either vanished or stopped replying. I gave up after a while. Even when I changed phones and wiped everything, it came back. Same icon. Same name. Same silence.

Eventually I stopped caring. It became like a mole or a scar from when you were a kid... something you forget about until someone points it out. Life kept happening. Work. Friends. Breakups. New apartments. The usual shuffle. And that weird little app stayed there the whole time.

Then one night, almost seven years later, my phone buzzed while I was brushing my teeth. One notification. Just two words: ""It’s time."" from the app.

I stared at it, toothbrush dangling out of my mouth, paste foam starting to drip into the sink. I tapped the screen. Nothing. I waited, expecting a flash or maybe a crash or some glitchy nonsense. But the phone stayed silent. All I saw was myself in the mirror, confused and annoyed.

I posted again. Reddit. Discord. Even some fringe tech boards. No help. Some people laughed at me. Others accused me of trolling. I wasn’t even sure I believed myself anymore. Maybe I’d dreamed the whole thing.

But that night I actually _did_ dream. I was standing in a flat field that stretched in every direction. Just grass and sky. In the middle of it all was a single black door. No building, no frame. Just a door standing by itself. It was covered in that spiral pattern from the icon. I walked up to it and reached for the handle. Cold metal. It wouldn’t turn.

I woke up gripping my phone. No memory of picking it up. The icon looked different. The spiral was darker, like it had sucked in the color around it. I stared at it until another notification popped up: ""You’re ready.""

I didn’t feel ready. I felt like something had followed me out of the dream and was still watching. I almost threw the phone against the wall. I didn’t. I don’t know why. Maybe I was curious. Or maybe it had already gotten into my head.

Three days later, the next message came through. ""Open me."" This time, the app actually responded. The screen went black. A single word appeared: ""Begin.""

The spiral returned. Larger now. Turning slowly. I couldn’t look away. And somewhere behind my ribs, deep in the center of my chest, I felt something shift. Like a string had been tied to something inside me. And it was starting to pull.",22

One i have long left alone for reasons i keep to myself for reasons unknown

One day a notification showed on my lock screen.


'' Do you wish to make a deal? ''


"" A...deal?"" I mumbled


I thought for approximately 6 seconds before going-
"" Okay well why the heck not? ""


I didn't know how to choose yes but then two options appeared in front of me.
Not on my phone screen,but right in front of my eyes.
I blinked several times and scrunched my face.
Then i closed my eyes and the words were still there,like the sun was glaring hard at my eyelids.


""Yes"" and ""absolutely"" 


I sighed and stared for a bit then went back to bed.


The next hour when i woke up a charming young man was looking down at me in his 2 feet tall tophat while wearing a monicle 
His mischievous smirk widened
 ""Hi beautiful ""


Byeeee
i had fun",16
1lqql6d,n184ql1,"EverAfter. It wasn't the worst name for an app I'd ever seen. If only the mind behind it had given it any purpose whatsoever. For so long, I try opening it during downtime, the way someone might thumb through social media, or tap along to a silly game. I was there, opening and closing this squared-off image of a sunset. I don't think I'd know myself to have an addictive personality before this came into my life. Yet it was pretty clear now that I must. 

Of course, I had tried to do some research. Initially I thought I would troubleshoot, only, there wasn't a website, a social account, a number for any customer service or otherwise. So I did the next best thing and asked around wherever I felt I could get some answers. I was laughed at, accused of making a sad attempt at an alternate reality game, asked to ship my phone to a stranger to prove it... I had never been so frustrated by something so trivial before. 

My partner asked to see it. They didn't seem as confused as I was. In favor of wonder, they left me with, ""What a cute logo."" and hardly mentioned it again. My family seemed concerned, though more about my mental state than what was causing it. They pitched in to buy me a new phone as a birthday gift, thinking they'd see an end to the incessant fiddling with a blank screen. ""It's still here!"" I exclaimed, growing even more desperate for answers. That was the last party they ever threw for me.

I wish I could say that all was a distant memory. That I had moved on, or that after ten years, I wouldn't have such a strong recollection of the early days. Instead, I was smack dab in the middle of what had become an era of my life. There was before EverAfter, and, well... after EverAfter. When I look back at my life, I will surely regret how much of my energy went into this damned device. I tell myself that I already do, and yet my muscle memory has cemented the pattern of App, menu, close apps, App, menu, close apps, as though it was all I have ever done. 

Inside, I believe that I miss my parents. Outside, my need for answers is stronger. Deep down, I wish I had spent more time with my partner. On the surface, they'd want me to know what was behind the cute logo, surely. I may go down in history for being kicked out of a funeral for refusing to put my phone away. It's something I can't take back now, even if some piece of me cries out for a connection with others who loved them just as I had.",11
1lqql6d,n1b2403,"I could live my life all over again. Mr. Smiley had given me a gift. All the mistakes I made. All the stupid choices. I could now make smarter decisions. After all, I wasn’t twenty years old despite appearances. But what if I made all wrong choices a second time. Would Mr. Smiley still be smiling on me?

I remember college fondly, but all of these professors are such asses without the aura of respect and authority clouding my vision. First thing I did was change majors so I wouldn’t be bored. If I was going to do this all over again, then I needed a challenge to be engaged. 

Also, I wanted to figure out Mr. Smiley and for that I would need to know more about computers than how to change my pin.  And I would need physics. And classes were so much harder than I expected. 

I purchased a second phone, an Android, and sure enough Mr. Smiley popped up there. Android phones are way more flexible to configure than iPhones but are more prone to being infected, not that iPhones are safe from viruses. They’re just *safer*. But then, if you’re not an absolute idiot about the internet, you can avoid the major threats and if the shit hits the fan, you can restore from backup. 

Also, VPNs and anti-virus software aren’t yet as big a thing, so I spend time learning what I can and by the time I graduated, I’ve changed my major twice more, got a degree in engineering and computer science and already started my own software company emphasizing antivirus protection and virtual private networking. And best of all, I was positioned well to take advantage of the cloud, bitcoin and AI waves when they become things in the next decades. 

I bought a thousand bitcoin at about $50 per coin taking out a bank loan against my home. I knew home prices would skyrocket and houses in Atlanta were still very affordable. I would be set well before bitcoin climbed above $80K. I could sell when I needed a cash infusion and still be richer than Bill Gates if I wanted. 

Cracking Mr. Smiley was going to be hard. That’s why I partnered with Apple and with Google to gain access to their core operating systems and low level codes. 

I brushed up on my hacking skills and found my way onto the Dark Web. It wasn’t as creepy as I imagined in my previous life. Of course, I didn’t do it all myself. Being the boss has its privileges. I hired a bunch of prima donna engineers, scientists, theoretical physicists, and graphic designers. And a private eye. Part of me worried Mr. Smiley would disappear due to all of my tampering, but I had to crack this mystery. It became an obsession. 

I wasn’t any better at the relationship thing the second time around either. I just replaced my fear of Mr. Smiley with my obsession of him. Also, I turned out to be a shitty boss. Too demanding, too unforgiving. I paid top dollar, but that wasn’t always enough to keep top talent. Often, though, it was. And it depended on the waves of the market. Google and Apple both poached engineers from my company, but that just allowed me to seed some of my own spies in their ranks, loyalists who either admired me or my money. Either way, I had my back door into both companies. 

“What do you mean that there is no Mr. Smiley App in the App Store database?”

“I can’t be any clearer, boss. Mr. Smiley doesn’t exist except on your phone.”

“The app isn’t on Google Play either,” said Rik, a spy I hired from Denmark. They have the best hackers in that small country. 

I was pissed. I was stressed. I had enough of everything one could want in a life and yet my obsession with Mr. Smiley was tearing my world apart. 

“Just forget him,” I said so often to myself that I just shortened it to “jofoh!” I wish I could, but I couldn’t. 

I had everything, a mansion in Tuxedo Park, a successful company, any sexual encounter I desired, enough money for a hundred lifetimes, but I had no friends. I all but pushed away my family just sending them money to leave me alone. 

I wasted my life again. 

DO YOU WANT TO DO IT OVER?

*Wait!* The notification came earlier. I expected to have another five years. I was only 51 and yet Mr. Smiley offered me another chance at life. “Too soon,” I muttered. I didn’t even have time to reflect on my mistakes, and my god, did I really fuck up this life. What did I learn about Mr. Smiley? That he was an enigma. He didn’t exist as software in any database. He lives on my phones and no where else. The Android rang. It was the detective I hired all those years ago. I was his only client. 

“Yes?” I said. 

“I found one,” he said. 

Mr. Smiley started flashing faster and faster. *Yes? No?* 

Make up your mind and be quick, I read into it. 

“Found what?” I asked. *How long did I have to choose before the app aborted?*

“Someone else with the app on their phone,” he said. 

“Who?” I shouted. “Where are you?”

The phone signal dropped. Did Mr. Smiley cut the connection? 

Now Mr. Smiley was flashing on both phones. I had tried to ignore the notification and drag out this life, this miserable life, just a little longer but then Mr. Smiley took the choice out of my hands and just popped up with his question. 

Did I have time to reach the detective again? Would Mr. Smiley let me? Could I risk delaying any longer? 

I just pressed the “yes”. 

I’m staring at my phone, an iPhone 3G, while walking. I stumble but catch myself, looking around. Nobody noticed anything strange. 

*What did that detective say?* My mind was a bit shaken. *There’s someone else out there who also has a Mr. Smiley app on their phone?*

Son of a bee!",12
1lqql6d,n17kall,"Don’t apologize. You might not hit a home run every time, but at least you were willing to step to the plate and take a swing. 

Having said that, I quite enjoyed your take on the prompt! Would love to see what awaits your main character on the other side of the “sea of darkness”.",12
1lqql6d,n184r7y,"""Hmm?"" The sound my phone made as it woke me up was one I had never heard before. There sure as hell wasn't anything else below this bridge that would chime so melodically. I took hold of the device, squinting through only one eye. It was so bright, and my glasses had broken beyond repair, causing me to hold it so very close.   
  
""Damnit!"" I shouted. ""I'm still dreaming!"" It was the only explanation my barely roused brain had for seeing a red number one beside the app of my undoing. I discarded the cell behind my back as I wrestled into my sleeping bag for an ounce of extra rest. But no, I wasn't asleep, was I? How could I be trying to fall back asleep if I'm not in the real world already? 

I scrambled to my knees, my dirty palms waving around the ground in search of that accursed brick. The steep ledge I camped upon below this train crossing was not well suited for such liveliness. I heard it tumble, and amongst any other belongings I kept nearby, I just knew it was the phone that broke free and slid down the rocks. 

My voice cracked as I managed a shout, diving after it in the most painful belly slide I could have ever imagined. As my life had come to be, there was no caution or concern for any of my surroundings. Answers were right in front of me, and I would have them at last. Still, I was flesh and bone. It took time to recover from the fall. I wore a corset of bruises up to my ribs, and groaned through my teeth as I crawled across the pavement.   
  
If an onlooker had told me they witnessed my voyage over the course of hours, I would have believed it really took that long. Every ounce of my physical form was being ignored in favor of the beast created a decade before. I found my phone, cracked screen and all, but still legible enough to see that blank screen had finally populated with what looked like a message.   
  
\[Welcome home. I missed you.\] Written out in the handwriting of my late beloved. I felt the moisture cascade down my cheek, just before I heard the horn blare. I only hope that there are no distractions after. So it can just be me and you.",10
1lqql6d,n1inqpz,"I guess I’m an obsessive person. There’s another me out there going through the same experiences I am. At least, that’s my take on what the private detective told me before I reset. That’s how I refer to it, resetting. Just like rebooting a phone, but *rebooting* didn’t appeal to me. Plus, with rebooting everything gets reverted back to its initial state while I currently retain the memories of two lifetimes. Mind officially blown. 

I thought I could never share this experience with another, but maybe I can. I already have a new obsession. 

To hell with university. Two times is quite enough time waster and I don’t have all the time in the world. The resetting came quicker last time. How long I have this time is a mystery. Will it only be increments of five years or is this geometric or random? I have no way of knowing. 

I can learn everything I need independently. This lifetime around I decide to skip the four year degree, get my investments sorted early for financial stability, and jump into life at 20. And I promise myself to do it better. To live life properly. Enough wasting time focusing on Mr. Smiley. 

I try swiping my phone open to no avail. Momentary panic attack. Unlocking my iPhone 3 properly, I see Mr. Smiley on the screen and breathe easier. These old iPhone designs don’t compare to the facial recognition and haptic screen of the later models. *Resetting* can be disorienting. I must have looked silly staring and swiping.

Now how to locate this other person? All sorts of crazy thoughts cross my mind. Internet advertisement. A cadre of private detectives. I don’t have enough resources in place yet to jump into the task properly so I decide my first course of action like any twenty year old would. I hop on a plane to Majorca and hang out on the beach. 

My parents freak out.

“What do you mean you dropped out of school? What about your plans of being a doctor?”

“Those were always your plans. I never …. Oh, forget it. Just trust me. I don’t need school. I can take care of myself.”

“Enough nonsense,” my father shouts into the phone. “You get on a plane and return to Atlanta at once or I will come and get you myself.”

A slight tear formed hearing my father’s voice. That was always his go to threat. Coming to get me. He died of cancer by the time I turned thirty. Still, he could be overprotective. 

“I’m fine,” I said. “But you should quit smoking and see a doctor.”

“Like I’m going to take advice from a college dropout!”

I hang up and ignore their return calls. I knew from last time calling them would be a mistake which is why I shut myself off from family. And last time I finished college. What was I thinking?

Ten years of random relationships passed. My fortune grew, but I still procrastinated searching for my digital doppelgänger. I didn’t waste the time obsessing over my future. I traveled the world, coined the phrase *influencer* and *digital nomad*, and built up quite the internet following. Even despite my initial investments, money flowed in from several backers including major companies, internet advertisers, and overzealous fans who themselves seem to be struggling financially but still happy to give me their hard earned cash. 

It was time to reveal Mr. Smiley to the world. 

“Hello, cherubs,” I say to a live-streaming crowd of millions. I had advertised this event early on Facebook, Insta, Reddit, TikTok, Twitter and a number of other outlets. “I am looking for a very special someone. If you’re out there watching, I think you will know what I’m talking about. Especially if you have a special connection with Mr. Smiley. Check out my AMA in an hour. Ciao for now.”

I shut down the live stream and immediately regret the event. My heart is pounding. I just did the cardinal sin of all acts, setting myself up to be stalked. I should have been the stalker. I should have thought this through. Of course, the four bodyguards that surround me constantly are reassuring. 

The AMA went pretty horribly as I could have predicted. Lots of questions about my social life, my line of cosmetics (full disclosure I don’t use them and don’t even know if they’re any good), traveling, meeting famous celebrities, and stuff like that. I had dreamed someone would know my reference to Mr. Smiley, but all questions about that fell flat.

Then I started seeing the guy at events just hanging around. My life took on a life of its own, the fame, the glitz, the drugs. Yes, at some point I started with pills and added the powders. I avoided the needles as that shit freaked me out. It was a part of the lifestyle and I was more into the pills than the powders anyway. So I can’t say when he showed up, only that I started noticing him eventually. He would look at me, which was weird in itself. I sent a bodyguard to question him, but he blended back into the crowd. 

Then my jaw dropped. He was back, but he wore a tee shirt with Mr. Smiley. Not a red background but a pale blue one with a yellow Mr. Smiley in the middle. But Mr. Smiley was an exact duplicate. I sat down not trusting my legs. He just waved back. A notification appeared on Reddit. A direct message from Eternal_Life1234. “I thought I was alone.”

I looked back up but he was gone. 

“WRU?” I DMed back. 

“If U wanna meet, come incognito to the MO in KL in 1 week. Pool deck at 14:00.”

It worked. Holy Mother Earth, it friggen worked. I cancelled all upcoming events and booked a suite at the Mandarin Oriental for the entire week. There were a bunch of pissed off clients but I could pay them off. This was something I had to do. 

Kuala Lumpur was hot but I still spent an hour at the gym on the pool deck. I ditched my entourage for the afternoon, all of whom were happy to wander the city or see the sites KL had to offer. On my expense, naturally. I was moderately well known in that region of the world but staying at the MO people tended to leave you alone even if they recognized you.",6
1lqql6d,n1ins3c,"“How old were you?” he asked. I was laying by the pool with a blue vodka drink having lost all sense of time when he sat down on the lounger next to me. One of the managers spotted him and started to approach, but I waved him off. 

“Who are you?” I ask. He was thin and slightly balding, and altogether common.  But he appeared to be about my general age.

“I could ask you the same, but everyone knows everything about you,” he said. 

“Not really,” I say. “I’m good at pretending.”

“So the glitter and glamour isn’t who you are? Did you get into the drugs? I did, last time around. Didn’t really work out well.” He had a pensive look, but it faded as quickly. 

“Tell me,” I ask.

“This was a bad idea,” he says. “We’re too far down our own paths.”

He looks kinda spooked.

“How old are you?” he asks. “Really. Not just your Wikipedia page.”

“That’s a rude question,” I say. 

“Yeah, I’m full of rude questions. I’m too old to waste time on bullshit if you add in the previous lives.”

“And I’m bullshit?” I ask, miffed. He smirks, not responding to my taunt. 

“Look. I’m not like a saint, but this life has been different for me. More meaningful. I did the drugs and fame and … well, like I said, it didn’t work out. It didn’t kill me, but still a close call. What would have happened if I died? Would your “Mr. Smiley” have given me another turn at the wheel of time? It gives me the Heebie Jeebies just thinking about it.”

He gets up to leave. 

“This,” he says pointing to the two of us, “needs to happens much sooner in the cycle. What are you doing in 2009? 2010?”

“2009,” I say. 

“Okay, January 1st, 2009. Washington Monument. Noon. We can find a quiet place to talk.”

He starts to walk away. I get up to follow. “Wait. Can’t we at least exchange the basics? I’m Sally. That’s my real name.”

“Bill,” he says, shaking my hand like we’re striking a business deal. “See you in 2009.”

The next six years I think about Bill a lot. If he was famous, I didn’t recognize him. But then I wasn’t much clocked in to the scene during that lifetime.

I secluded myself and became a recluse. The world wanted to know what happened to their “Poppyseed” but I was all of a sudden tired of that persona, that game, this life. I bought an old Manor House in Sintra, Portugal. Ironically, I’ve become even more famous as a recluse than all the effort I put into being an influencer. The online theories and conspiracies popping up on social media are even crazier than my real life, and that says something.

I spend the rest of my days thinking about my lives and whether I lived this one better. When I reset, am I creating a new timeline? Do I continue to age or is everything erased when I start over? Knowing Bill exists complicates that question. I think about meeting Bill next time up. Am I hyping it too much in my mind that I’m setting myself up for disappointment?

When *the question* finally arrives, it couldn’t have come soon enough. I’m 41, which in itself is a bit irksome, since the difference in *resets* is greater than 5 years. I still don’t have a handle on the whole “Mr. Smiley” thing and how much time I will have in my next life. I can only assume from the progression of 55, 51, 41, that it will be shorter. Will I only have ten years? Less? More? I have no clue. 

I waste no time responding to Mr. Smiley. I’ve been longing for this moment for what feels an eternity. I didn’t screw up this life, but did I really accomplish anything meaningful?

I press “Yes” and I’m back to twenty with all that comes from a youthful body. I call up the calendar app on my iPhone 3G, which is on the same page as Mr. Smiley, and add an entry for January 1st of the next year. Washington Monument at noon. I can’t fucking wait!",7
1lqq5lg,n14ryu5,"I nod, then freeze.  
""Boyfriend?"" I ask.  
Matthew nods, and stares at me, while everyone else stops eating as well.  
I stare at the boy, and frown.  
""Aren't you supposed to introduce yourself?"" I ask.  
He pales.  
""Ah, yeah, oh, well, I...I am S-s-Stew, Stuart!"" he says, trying to stand up, and hitting his hand into the table.  
The others start laughing, while Matthew heals him, and I...  
I struggle to keep my fatherly image.

After I tell everyone to continue eating, I look at Stuart.  
""So...  
Tell me about yourself Stuart."" I say.  
I can hear several sighs of relief, hmm.  
Was I old fashioned in their eyes?  
""I am a necromancer from Southern Ashes Empire, majoring in Lich studies, and anatomy."" he chirps, happily, then freezes.  
""Oh, I am..Not, not that kind...Ahm..."" he stutters, looking to Matthew for help.  
I chuckle.

""I am a wizard that holds himself true to the Arcane, young Stuart.  
Necromancy? Spiritual magic? Ritual Magic? Elemental Magic? Summoning Magic? Druid? Witchcraft? Worship based magic?  
I dabbled in all of them."" I say.  
He smiles.  
""Phew...I thought you will judge me..."" he muttered.  
The others were staring at me, rolling their eyes.  
Well, I didn't lie.  
I dabbled in all of them, not my fault I more or less reached the archmage level in all of them.  
""So, I assume you met while Matthew was out healing people."" I continue.  
The two hold hands, and nod.

""He had a mission from the Mausoleum to deal with a plague that mutated people.  
I, myself had taken that job from the Physicians' Guild, and we met there."" Matthew started.  
""He was amazing. Lecturing ageless druids, and clerics left and right.  
Voluntarily going into the already affected camps, taking samples, trying every angle possible, and in the end...he found it. He found the cause.  
Small insect eggs brought by an eastern breeze from the coast!"" Stuart gushes on and on about how amazing Matthew is.  
Albeit, I am against of being too closely involved with the diseased, golems can do that better, and safer, I smile.  
He is in love completely with Matthew.  
""Happy to have you here, Stuart."" I say, and I continue eating, as now the young ones join in as well.  
He seems like a nice guy, but I already sent an angel familiar of mine to check his records in Heaven, and we shall see how this will go on...",194
1lqq5lg,n16zvlr,"Food floated atop the round table. A cornucopia  that ranged  from perfectly crisp bread ,with a silk soft interior,  to  a creamy, smooth bowl of turkey broth.

I wiped drool away from my lips with the edge of my robes and lifted my wand.  I used the *words*  to  select some raisin bread, steamed ham steaks and turkey broth.

The others  followed suit. Eight  wands were  lifted, eight *words* were spoken, and eight  meals floated down.

Then father strolled into the room.

He wore a robe of moving stars, each one winking out of existence or twirling or reappearing. He was our personal map of the night sky.

His waved his wand and the remaining food disappeared.

“Children , we’re having a new person join us today. His name is dave”

Dave peeked out behind his robes. My eyes widened, it was adam, what was he doing here. He had a family to take care of him. “Father, i know him, his name isn’t  dave”.

Da… adam looked confused, he should recognise me. Did the nights we spent together stand for nothing? Father’s genial smile faded for a split second before returning. His family died, a great fire yesterday, he was lucky i happened to be nearby”

He shook his head somberly” the thought of such a once in millennia talent being lost to a fire is simply detestable”.

“but, father, he should remember me” i said. His face once again twisted into a frown. Before returning to normal.

“sadly, he lost his memories. the fumes from the gasses harmed him, it’s lucky he remembers enough to learn”

I looked at ad… dave with pity. Lost both his memories and family in a day

 I wished he could learn magic like me .. I didn’t wish for him to become me.

Father seemed to have picked up on my melancholy because he tried to reassure me. “Don’t worry adrian, you and dave will have lots of time to catch up…he’s not going anywhere”

1lquocj,n17aoqk,"This performance review was killing Tim. Could he think on an example in the last six months when he'd shown a process oriented approach to problem solving in a cross departmental setting? He took his glasses off and leaned back in his chair sighing. 



""Hey, hey mister, hey."" the little gravely voice and pulling on his sleeve wasn't helping him self asses. Maybe he could spin that thing with payroll into something?



""Hey mister hey hey mister miiiiiister!"" working from home had been a bad idea. Tim had this thought at least twice a day since he moved in. 



""Yes Tzi. What can I do for you"" he turned around to regard the little green thing with sharp teeth. Only to find it holding a matted mess of fur with a long bald tail. 



""Wanna rat?""



""No Tzi I don't want a rat right now."" he sighed. ""Why don't you go downstairs and pick something out for us to play ok?""



""Station!"" shouted Tzi triumphantly. He liked the PS5 and was getting really good at street fighter. 



""Tzi."" Tim called after the little goblin. ""Take the rat.""



""Woo! Free rat!"" 



He wasn't going to get anything else done today. Might as well go and check the rat doesn't make its way into dinner again. Downstairs in the living room Tzi was opening games up to try and find the right disk. He never put them back in the right box and always spent ages looking. Not worth the fight thought Tim. He headed to the kitchen to find Oblo stirring a pot. 



""What's for dinner.""



""Beef Bourguignon"" said Odno with a beaming smile. It smelled pretty good. 



""Any rat in it?"" Tim asked cautiously. 



""No... Why you want?"" Odno sounded vaguely hopeful. 



""Not tonight thanks."" 



""Doppo wants see you."" said Odno shrugging, a little disappointed. He might still put a little rat in. Tim hadn't minded the lasagna last night after all. 



Tim headed to the basement. Doppo didn't like the sunlight and generally didn't go much further into the house. Downstairs the noise was deafening. Goblins liked to talk as they worked, not to each other, just on general principle. Add to that the Kpop - which Tim regretted introducing them to - and the power tools and it was a wall of noise with no reprieve. 



Doppo stood in the middle of the maelstrom looking satisfied. As far as goblins go, the current chaos was a well oiled machine of efficiency. Idly Tim wondered if Doppo had any examples of a process oriented approach to problem solving in a cross departmental setting.",34
1lquocj,n17aptb,"""We found da brick!"" shouted Doppo over the din. And then repeated twice more until Tim finally just shrugged his shoulders and pointed to his ears. Doppo stuck two fingers into his mouth and produced a piercing whistle. Everyone stopped what they were doing and a second later the kpop switched off. ""I say we found da brick.""



""Did you ?"" Tim wasn't convinced. The last two bricks had been... well bricks. And the one before had been a turd because they'd hit a sewer line. 



""Ye here."" Doppo moved a sheet out of the way to present what they'd found. It was brick shaped and bright yellow. On the top it had been stamped. The stamp read '999.9 Fine gold 1000 grams US Government'. 



""Now that is the right brick Doppo!"" Tim near enough toppled the goblin to get to it. ""Is there more where you found it?""



""Ye, little mountains. But is heavy I only lug one back.""



""Oh don't worry Doppo that's why we've been learning about mine carts ain't that right boys?"" the other goblins gave a cheer, more on general principle rather then because the understood what was going on. 



""What you gonna do with it.""



""Not me Doppo."" said Tim, his eyes alight with something wicked. What's the point of living on top of goblins if you're not going to be an overlord right? That had been Tim's thinking. And today it looked like it may pay off. ""With this Doppo we are going to take over the world!"" someone decided this was a good moment to switch the kpop back on.",35

---

You’d think being the most powerful entity on Earth, maybe the universe even, would protect you from the world’s worst disappointments. You’d be wrong.

Let’s rewind.

A month ago, Maximus, Praise Be Unto Him, the World's Strongest Couch Potato, made the greatest mistake of his existence: He signed a licensing deal for a video game. It sounded perfect. Passive income! Merch! Fans fighting monsters *as him* !

Come on, your face on a game box? That’s peak immortality right there.

Or so he thought.

Fast forward to today. He was sitting in his dimly lit fortress of snack wrappers and leftover takeout, staring at his TV screen like it just insulted his mother. The game is called **“MAXIMUS: Ultimate Savior”**.

The menu theme is a ten-second loop of generic choir chanting “Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!” like he was about to step into a budget cathedral.

First sign of doom.

He boot up the tutorial.

His “character model” looks like Maximus if he was a cross between an inflatable bouncy castle and a hairless gorilla. His iconic, glorious battle wear have been replaced by some weird, shiny spandex, and wrestler getup he doesn't even remember wearing.

His thighs and arms in this game look like uncooked sausages by the way. 

He was really proud of his hairy limbs.

Who did this?

The combat system is a nightmare.

He, the superhero with the most superpowers in the world, has only two attacks: *Punch* and *Kick*. The animations... 

He doesn't want to talk about the animations.

Did they fire all of their animators and hire an overworked and sleep-deprived student instead ?

And what even are these motherfucker hitbox and hurtbox ? A monkey would do a better job.

Speaking about monkeys, they for sure won't make this many bugs and crashes.

Did they fire all coders and testers ? Do they even have any, or make this game entirely using AI chatbot ? No, even AI chatbot won't make that many mistakes ???

He doesn't want to start on the lore.

Are they even his fans ? Did they actually know anything about him ? Or just want to make a corpo cash grab ? He should've seen this coming since his character's appearance.

Screw ""lore accuracy"", this is just objectively dogshit tier writing.

The villain ? Some off-brand kaiju called “Dark Maximus.” They didn’t even try. His dialogue is just him but *edgy*.

Bro.

The final insult ? The *Doom Duck* is DLC. They locked his beloved limited-time duck skin behind a paywall. **A paywall.** For his own favourite duck. In his own game.

He dropped the game at that point, and that saved him from a mountain more of frustration.

He can feel the vein in his forehead pulsing.
He haven’t felt a vein in centuries.

He grab the controller with psychic force — it melts a bit in his grip.

Okay. Deep breath. He can fix this.

He opens his phone. He dial the publisher. They pick up after three rings.

“Maximus! Our greatest hero! Did you enjoy—”

He snap his fingers. Silence. He didn’t even let the voice finish. The entire corporate office is now a new crater in the desert. Problem solved.

He flop back onto the couch, fuming. Somewhere in the distance, he can hear the world celebrating the release of his game. 

They don’t know it’s been erased from existence.

They don’t know there won't be a next patch note.",6
1lqrfpm,n15pf0j,"Reviewing the footage was actually bit surprising. It turns out, it wasn't 'who' was ringing the doorbell. But 'what' was.


It was the same thing each time. At least once a day. Every day. In the afternoon.


A tabby would stroll from the bushes to stare at the front door. It'd come on the porch. Lounge in the shade. Chase rabbits, birds, and bugs around the yard. Lounge some more.


Then it'd focus. Jump. Hang on the screen door. And swat the doorbell. Upon landing, it'd immediately run into the bushes off one side of the porch.


It took a minute for Tina to compose herself. Mainly because she'd laughed so hard at the culprit, that she had wipe the tears off her face.


But she'd waited this time for it to happen. Of course, there were some birds she kept leaving stale bread for. So that explained what would draw the cat in the first place. So when she heard a mild commotion outside, and spotted the Robins scattering into the trees. If she was right, it was going to try the doorbell.


Almost. Now.


Tina opened the door to spot a rather pudgy cat clinging on the mesh like a free climber. A look of shock registering back at her as it froze in confusion.


It hit the floor and immediately scrambled off into the bushes.



And that took care of that.


Or so she thought.


It didn't have a collar. And it kept coming into the yard. If only, as the footage affirmed, to hit the doorbell. Occasionally, she'd catch it in the act and it'd run away.


Eventually however, after another week. It'd just sit there. Or jump to hold onto the screen for a few moments before walking away.


After two weeks, Tina had to ask it.


""Hungry?""


Of course this brought a tiny meow that answered her question. And a rather happy acceptance of the crunchies she dropped out of a bag.


So apparently, she had a cat now.",48

The ringing always came at night.

The first time it happened, Alice was sitting at the small round table that filled the meager dining space her the kitchen in her apartment offered. It was winter and night would set in while she was still on her way home from work. So, despite the darkness, she felt no fear over the early evening summoning to her front door. It's probably the package I ordered last week, she thought to herself as she reached towards the doorknob.

On the other side of the door was nothing. The third floor hallway of her apartment building was still. No footsteps echoed in the stairwell, none of her neighbors doors were propped open, and only the distant hum of TVs behind closed doors could be heard. Alice ultimately thought nothing of it and returned to her dinner.

Three days later, it happened again.

Alice practically rocketed up from the couch she had sunken into in excitement. It was Friday and she always treated herself to delivery, a celebration of a long week at work finally being over. Her delivery app had shown her it wasn't due for another fifteen minutes, which only elevated her joy at the surprise of its early arrival.

When she opened the door, she saw nothing. Behind her, her phone pinged and flashed a notification that her driver had picked up her food and left the restaurant. Strange, she thought to herself, though ultimately returned to the couch without giving it any more thought.

It wasn't until she was woken from her sleep by the doorbell ringing at 2am that she grew weary. Alice was a woman living alone. She felt paralyzed under her blankets and played through scenario after scenario of what could go wrong when visitor calls at this hour. Was it a stalker? Maybe that's who had been ringing the bell, gathering data on the times she would most reliably be home. Had they also tried ringing when she was at work only for her to never come? She pictured a journal full of the chaotic scrawling of a faceless man that detailed every moment of her days.

No, she decided in that moment. This simply isn't happening. The college boys down the hall just got home from bars and, as they stumbled down the hall, fell against her doorbell in their drunken stupor. She reached up to pet the orange tabby curled up on the pillow next to hers. As he rumbled to life in a sleepy purr, she felt guilty for thinking it would've been better to get a dog.

On a family FaceTime that following Sunday, Alice casually mentions the mysterious ringings to her family.

""Oh, hell no, Alice,"" Eddie, the youngest and scrappiest of her three brothers immediately chimes in. ""That's weird as fuck. Aren't there supposed to be guys working the lobby of fancy city buildings? How is someone even getting up there?""

""Okay, just because I live in New York doesn't mean I'm leading some bougie life,"" Alice explains. ""My apartment building is a piece of crap, and it definitely doesn't have security.""

""Can you tell somebody?"" Alice's mother asks, her soft midwestern accent coloring her words with all the naiveté a life in a small town can bring.

""Who the fuck is she gonna tell, mom?""  Eddie retorts. Alice stifles a laugh as the small boxes holding her father and other two brothers erupt into a chorus of 'that's no way to speak to your mother'.

""Listen, sweetie,"" Alice's dad says when the ruckus dies down. ""If I buy one of those video doorbells for you, would you do your old man a solid and install it? I think we'd all feel better if you did.""

Alice agrees easily. She had already considered it and now she wouldn't even have to pay herself. It arrives two days later and Mr.Singh down the hall volunteers to install it for her when she sees her fumbling with the packaging. As he finishes, Alice tries to as casually as possible ask if he's had any issues with his doorbell going off when nobody is there.",7
1lqrfpm,n16wqdr,"**3/3**

She replays the clip.

She sees the same thing.

A little girl, no older than seven. Long hair so blonde it's almost white tied back in a ponytail that falls midway down her back. So short she doesn't even make it past the middle of the frame. A face with expectant eyes. The quality of the footage isn't perfect, but Alice can just make out the familiar green eyes that look directly into the camera lens. A large t-shirt is draped over her, hiding what are undeniably thin shoulders and a small torso. The t-shirt has flaking letters that still make out U of Nebraska, Alice's father's alma mater.

The girl waits. Ten seconds. Twenty second. Thirty. Then turns to the right and leaves. No more motion is detected after, which adds to Alice's unease as the staircase to leave the building is to the left of her door.

How, she wonders. It must be wrong, this is a crazy coincidence. someone down the hall has a niece visiting. She scoffs at the idea of the rowdy college boys being allowed to host a niece and she knows Mr.Singh has no family. The other apartments to the left are occupied by an old Vietnamese couple and a middle aged Black woman, Alice doubts either of them would have a white niece running around.

As she pours through explanation after explanation only to find them nonsensical, she calms herself out of a state of fear and into a state of curious concern.

What does she want? Alice asks herself. Why would I be visiting myself?",8
1lqha2t,n12vob3,"Okay, I rose from a peasant girl, to a Duchess, and lo and behold, the Church has named me villainess.  
Why?  
I don't know, a prophecy or something said that I shall be the evil that will be defeated by the Chosen Hero, and a kingdom of peace, and unity shall be built.  
I shrugged it off, and developed my Duchy.  
It annoyed the kingdom I was in to no-end, and soon they waged war on me.  
I won, and I started to realize why I was called a villainess.  
I was going against the norms, upsetting the balance.

  
Years pass, and the world awaits the hero.  
I slowly fight back, and end up conquering the whole kingdom I was in.  
The commoners cheer for me.  
I try to spread the wealth as well as I can, without chasing away the merchants, and nobles.  
I start schools for everyone, even peasants, hoping that some talents are hidden away in far-away villages.  
I also try to make as many Physician offices as possible, to ensure my people are healthy.  
With my initiatives, and laws, more and more people want to join my kingdom.  
Watching myriad races mingle in my lands, I sigh.  
""Isn't this the promised kingdom that the Hero shall create?"" I mutter, but I go back to my business.

  
Decades pass, and I am an Empress.  
Ministers, and scholars abound, and so do mages, and knights that were unearthed by the schools established in remote areas.  
They are especially loyal to me.  
The prophecy still exists, and the Church still claims I am evil, I am the villainess.  
They even start rallying armies against me.  
Problem is...  
They barely can find allies.  
Why?  
Because I want the best for my people, so I acted in their interest.

  
I married the 2nd Prince of a neighboring Empire, as my husband, and have 2 more consorts from a beast kingdom, and the elven tribe union.  
Basically, I made marriage alliances with the territories surrounding my Empire.  
The Church would have to go through their lands, to arrive at mine...which they can't, because those allies won't allow them.  
The rumor mill is turned up to the max by them, but nobody believes them.  
I have free trade with all the kingdoms, and races, even the Underground ones, and have visited personally all of them for diplomatic reasons.  
I might be a villain, in the sense that soon...the world will be changed forever by my measures, and approach to leadership.  
But it is a role I happily assume, and from what I see...a role that people accept.  
If the Hero comes or not, I don't care, because I already left my name in the history of the world, and the changes that I have started, can't be stopped anymore.",240
1lqha2t,n14fyvp,"I was born the White Demon. 

With white hair, white skin, and pupils so light in color, you'd think they were white, too. Although I had done nothing wrong except for being born, I was feared and hated because of this color. 

It is the color of the Moon Goddess, Mother of Ash from the Eternal Depths. As the deity of death, destruction, and twisted desires, her believers had long been reviled for their extreme cruelty. Even now, decades after the battle that destroyed the remaining members of the Pale Cult, the legends of their evil are still whispered among the people. Cautionary tales from the scarred and elderly to keep the younger generation away from the Temptation of the Moon. In their words, the last leader of the Pale, with his dying breath, had spoken thus;

""The Apostle of the Moon

Shall someday come

To usher in nothingness

To blot out the Sun

As pale as moonlight

As ash from the depths

The unending night

The inescapable death""

And thus, my birth quite understandably terrified everyone. The midwife screamed, my birth mother fainted, my father near had a stroke.

I'm just grateful they didn't kill me, even if it's more out of the fear of the goddess's retaliation rather than familial love or mercy. Instead, they handed me, this potential harbinger-of-doom and hot potato, over to the Inquisition, with my umbilical cord still attached and all. 

From there a series of lucky coincidences kept me alive. Firstly, I was born in the capital city, just a short horse ride away from the Inquisition headquarters. Secondly, I arrived Wednesday morning during working hours and the top brass of the Inquisition were quick to assemble an emergency meeting to discuss my fate. Thirdly, and most importantly, the Apostle of the Sun, who later became my adoptive father, was there to save me.

I heard that the moment he saw me, he immediately scooped me up in his arms, wrapped my in his cloak, and got some goat milk to feed me, barely saving me from death by dehydration and hypothermia.

He argued fiercely for my life that day. The leaders of the Inquisition, as well as each of the Pillar Temples voted to cast me out to the holy territory of the Sun, the Desert of the Red Sands. Only one man stood on my side, but he was enough. My father, Fajar. Apostle of the Sun, Hero Against the Pale, the Scorching Red Sword of the Kingdom.

--

""Fajar, old friend. The child bears the signs of the false apostle of the pale goddess. It's already a mercy for it to be spared from the sword and left to the Sun's judgement.""

""That's bullshit. A newborn won't survive thirty minutes in the desert and you know it. What, sitting all day in the Temple broke your brain? Did you forget why we fought those Pale cabbage-maggots? THEY WERE A BUNCH OF SICK CHILD-KILLERS, AL! Sacrificing babies to cut off the dawn or whatnot! And now you're going to do what they did?""

""...Pardon me, I'm the one with a broken brain? Me?? You didn't even grow one, you STUBBORN PIECE OF HOLLOW-HEADED PAPRIKA! Don't you see?! The child will be ostracized! Everybody's heard of the prophecy, there's no escaping it.""

""... Well, then, I'm going to make my own prophecy.""

""You? Make your own prophecy? Hah! Your jokes are finally funny for once.""

""No, I'm serious. Aren't I an Apostle, too? Give me a sec, let me think... ahem, THE SUN HATH SPOKEN TO ME""

""Stop that""

""THE HERO OF THE SUN
IS COMING SOON""

""I'm warning you""

""TO LIGHT UP THE WAY
AND VANQUISH THE MOON""

""Okay, just because it rhymes doesn't mean-""

""NONE SHOULD PREVENT
THE APOSTLES' GREAT DUEL""

""...""

""OR ELSE YOU RISK...um, 
BEING TURNED INTO MULES!!""

""...""

""Might need some tweaks, but pretty good, right?""

""...You're an idiot.""

""Hey, I'm telling you. Call it an idiot's intuition, but this cute widdle bubble is going to make the world a better place. I just know it.""

My idiot father was right.

I was born the White Demon.
Now I'm the Dawning Shield of the Kingdom.

But no matter what, I will always be my father's child.",55
1lqha2t,n149ma0,"The Devourer of Time, that's what they called me in the Lost Prophecy. I am but a benign creature, one with four appendages and a variety of hair-colours.

For centuries I have waited, patiently at first, biding my time in case the hero foretold by the wise sages turned out to be an unsuspected culprit. I blended in with species much bigger than my size, hunting gathering in a fashion that was all the rage back then.

Then exerting my dominance in a flair most extravagant as I was confident the prophecy was a fluke and there exist no hero to challenge my might. Ah what a glorious era that was! I ate with kings and queens on their tables, had my likeness carved into statues and worshipped, and even passed down judgements in the form of dreams and omens! 

But I got tired of the life of fanfare, of the constant need to maintain my regality and always having to straighten my back to keep up appearances. The food became stale, the strifes between countries became boring and repetitive, so... I snuck out. 

I went back to the life of a wanderer, poaching time from unsuspecting souls here and there, sowing a multitude of avatars of mine amongst the land. The Parsimonious waved their pitiful-looking weapons at me along with loud yells of dismay and The Gullibles showered me with gifts as if I am a god. Well, I am, of sorts. 

But most ludicrous were The Daring, who seek to temper my sovereign with their paltry offerings of food! And lightning-like, pinpricked flames which I have to reluctantly admit, that are weirdly enticing. Though never successful, they proved to be quality entertainment regardless, so I kept them around. 

And before I knew it, I have built myself an empire, full of servants that exists to serve my every need, retainers for my amusement and tributaries to supply me with endless interesting snacks.

Then came the 21st century, thanks to a form of magical slabs of living paintings, my presence and popularity grew and so did my loyal subjects. No longer do I have to deal with the barbaric acts of The Parsimonious. For now, even harming an avatar of mine is a crime. 

And yet, still the champion that had been herald as my bane remained missing, not a whisker in sight. Thus, I, the Devourr of Time and the Meowster of Purrcrastination is and will continue to be the Ruler of the Two-Legged!",92
1lqha2t,n150uo1,"**It’s been thirty-two years since the date of the prophecy.**

Embarrassingly, it only took ten hours before I left the throne room for a cold drink and a snack. After three days, I rented a hotel room. After six months, I closed on a mortgage.  
Honestly, I hate late people.

Sometimes I still pop in, put on the mask, and loom ominously over the city — the King and I have a little arrangement — mostly on anniversaries, just to reminisce.  
I loved that outfit I put together: the skull mask, the threadbare hood, and the cloak, which tussles in the wind like the raven hair of a mourning widow…  
Such a shame it never got the spotlight it deserved.

I kept at it for a while. Threatened some pensioners. Issued a few dramatic ultimatums. Loomed.  
But there are only so many orphans you can throw into the Lake of Undying Sin before you start to feel like a bit of an arse. So after about a year, the council and I decided perhaps resurrecting the dead parents and chucking *them* in might send more of a message.

But seeing the joy on those children’s faces when I brought their parents back made me realise just how evil I could truly be.

So, for the next two years, I profited obscenely by offering necromantic services to the grieving. Anyone who’d lost someone in a tragic accident could pay me a handful of gold to bring them back. Surely, I thought, this grotesque exploitation of grief would summon the fabled hero.

Time passed. The people thrived. No hero.  
I had to think.

What if I could rob people of their goodness? Strip them of purpose?

I noticed an abundance of homeless folk. And the citizens  (smug lot) loved helping them. Charity, soup kitchens, heartfelt speeches. Awful stuff.  
So, using my immense wealth, I set about destroying their joy.

I built housing. Massive districts of social housing. Free adult education. Factories that employed thousands. Never again would someone sleep on the street. Never again could the populace feel the smug satisfaction of aiding the less fortunate.

It was deliciously cruel.

Unfortunately, all the construction damaged local wildlife habitats, and people started adopting stray animals for comfort.  
In my quick thinking, I built a massive animal sanctuary as retaliation.

Annoyingly, it became the most beloved place in the realm. *Children sing about it*.

By year ten, I’d become a symbol. Some towns even started putting my face on flags.

A couple of years later, I went back to throwing orphans in the lake, just to remind people that I’m evil, but it just didn’t feel the same anymore…

Where are you, oh fabled hero?  
The one who was meant to change the city. The one to bring hope back to the people.  
I’m truly lost without you.",26
1lqha2t,n14tk4s,"Osgarth will only know its Golden Age, when the Bandit King has breathed his last.

A prophetic load of crap?  Well, for five years after it all began, the people held out, looking for a savior.  All kinds of duels, assassinations, even the Church of Holy Light had resisted the conquest.  But the old king was a feeble man, his greatest vassal was actually my own quiet benefactor, and the 'wave of crime and villainy' was the quiet failure of his unruly subjects to respect the crown.

It had been clear, on the day of my usurpation, that respect for the Crown would have to be won, not granted.  A lot of the lieutenants and personal guards that had marched on Oshaven twenty years ago had been given noble rank or personal holdings, and I'd seized the opportunity, with the defiance of the church of Holy Light, to enforce religious freedom on the realm.  Inquisitors and their holy orders would either leave or face an unholy ending.

""This is all who would address the next mission?"" Bellowed Fernando IV.  ""All the support that could be gained, from a year of recruiting, soliciting, and even calls for a moral war from the church?""

 The former Duke of Arlanta and the son of the former Count of Parson's Ridge sat at one table, with four other members of their family.  Two bishops of the Church of Holy Light, and a Paladin Knight, and six others sat at a second table.  Rounding out the remainder was two dozen drunks, ne'er do wells and hooligans simply looking for a fight.  A collection of forty men, and the grand suite of the Mermaid's Pearl was intended for six score, and was more than half empty.

1lqha2t,n15b0ek,"I finally got it, my custom made throne. I have so many drawings to look over. I need to decide today. 
I have gone through so much. 
I have worried about the surrounding kingdom’s sending all powerful heroes to destroy me, for years.  

I found this haunted forest infested with monsters and under control of a powerful Dragon.  

It took me establishing a battle camp. I fought my way up, gaining strength and power.
I needed help found a few people willing to fight beside me. 
Fighting monsters daily we recruited more team members, to defeat the monsters. 
Capturing people from local areas,  threatened by the monsters.  We needed people to work for us.
I found that the people were willing to build and work for me as long as I kept them safe and fed. 
Next I hired and trained troops to protect my battle camp which had been slowly becoming a battle Fortress.  The more we upgraded battlements and stationed troops 

Soon I had my former team members, form their own teams, raiding dungeons, and monsters camps. To take out threats and gain treasure to fund my Fortress and troops. 

Next the Dragon was attacking my Fortress, instead of the other kingdoms. So I led a combined force of adventures to defeat the Dragon. Then of course I insured my own team came out on top. I took the majority of the loot and the Dragons body. 
Which attracted even more powerful mages to my Fortress. 

Expanding my influence, tradesmen flooded my Fortress which was now becoming a Castle. With surrounding areas walled in, planted fields, livestock, forests, quarries , mines and dungeons. 
I have mounted Calvary troops patrolling my lands.  

At intervals new powerful bands of beasts and monsters, invade my lands. Which keeps me and my troops, the adventure’s busy and feed. My kingdom is also doing major trade in cured , tanned monsters hides, jerky monsters meat, monsters leather goods being stronger and sometimes magical. 

Adventure’s flood to my guild house, to perform missions, because we have the highest level and quality of monsters to battle. 

I had to start a department of housing just so we can keep building for the growing population. 

I have decided to start minting my own coins. I started a contest for the best coin design.  I am still trying to figure out an exchange rate.  The surrounding kings each want their own coin to be worth more.  I told them we agree each coin is equal to each other’s kingdom coin of the same weight of material.  1 gold coin weighs 1oz. = 1oz of gold = 20 silver coins. 1 silver coin weighs 1oz. = 20 copper coins , 1 copper coin weighs 1oz. 
If a kingdom has coins that weigh less than 1 ounce, than it will take more of that kingdom coins to equal my coins or any kingdom using 1 ounce coins as standard. 
Scales will be produced and provided by the kingdom and checked regularly for accuracy. 

The one kingdom that refused to sign the treaty abide by. I invaded and annexed to my own. I needed to expand housing anyway. 
It also opened up more areas for recruiting and training troops. 

I must really choose a coin design.",11
1lqha2t,n15keqt,"""Little Hero"" Part 1:

The prophecy was clear, a wise old wizard foretold,

First, a villain arrives unchallenged, they will be fierce and cold.

They bring chaos and destruction, until the world loses hope,

Outlooks become bleak, and people struggle to cope.

 

The villains power is too great, that of a god had been bestowed,

With just a thought, they could make things appear, float, or even, explode.

Nobody would dare to challenge this magical being,

For only death would result from their disagreeing.

 

Until one day, a brave hero stands tall,

They fight off the darkness, and the villain will fall.

The people will cheer, and the world rebuilt,

No more sadness or sorrow, and no more blood will be spilt.

I am chaos and madness, and sadness galore,

I have murdered and butchered, but now it's a bore.

Where are you, little hero, your late to the game,

Do you not wish to stand and make a claim to your fame?

 

I just wanted a rival, someone to stand up to me,

It isn't only the people, who were hoping to meet thee.

I simply needed an equal, a challenge, one of my own,

But instead, here I stand, feared, hated... And alone.",11
1lqha2t,n16othk,"(Part 1)  
  
I was raised in a very faithful family, but that never resonated with me. How could I believe in an all-good God when we faced misery, hunger, and disease? How could we trust a God who allowed such things to happen?

No. There was no god. There were only men and women who made this world what it was—and I decided I would rise above it all. That I would face my own destiny.

I won’t bore you with the details, but I managed to get admitted to an academy of alchemy. Alchemy was a form of chemistry cloaked in myths and religion, but it granted me access to the best books my little corner of the world had to offer.

That’s why, when an old priest proclaimed the prophecy… I knew he was wrong. He said: *“And after the goddess of evil rises, shall come a hero to turn around her evil!”*

I don’t believe in prophecies.

But I did believe in myself. The prophecy stirred the people—riots, confrontations, conflict. It was my moment.

*You can’t grow a beautiful forest unless you burn down the old one.* I don’t remember where I read that.

I started small, but I grew quickly. My followers slowly gathered more and more to our cause. I sent my most capable agents to sow chaos across the kingdom. Nobles were assassinated, and I made it look like other noble houses were responsible. I instigated a war with a minor neighboring realm. I bribed guards and officers to look the other way while my minions ransacked town after town.

Heh. I know what you’re thinking—that I was a monster. And a monster I was. But you must understand: I wasn’t seeking personal gain. I was working for something far greater.

It took years, but eventually, the kingdom was burning. And as my followers stormed the throne room, I revealed myself for the first time. I walked up to that old fool of a king, stabbed him in the heart, and proclaimed: *“Long live the Queen.”*

And I rose to power.

Many realized I had been behind it all. That was… a dark time for the kingdom. I put rebels to the sword. I punished entire families. I burned down towns and cities that dared to resist. I didn’t enjoy it. But it was necessary.

When peace returned, I was already forty. That was when I could begin my real plan. People were still waiting for the prophesied hero… who never appeared.

I allocated resources to rebuild cities. I revived the economy, starting with agriculture and livestock subsidies. Then I turned to healthcare, sanitation, education… It was a slow process. You can’t overwhelm a population used to brutal repression with sudden luxuries. My goal was to educate the next two—perhaps even three—generations.",9

The words, they grew and grew louder. They bowed. Their crowns bled for us. 
Bathed in light. They bled for us. 

We pushed and pulled. Flowing like a river, wide as an ocean, until we hit the Dam. Had but one final push.

Everything has a cost. 

I stare now. I dream. In this eternal age. 
Decades pass and still, I dream. 

The shouts of prophecy ,theyve changed, once giant thunderclaps of monstrous volume, now they become still, you must strain to see. The silence is so loud.

Instead, the darkness became imprisoned in me. All that I've seen. Absolute Horror.

I know what you wanted for of us. What they.. wanted for us... This terrible silence... Eons. Of Pain. Of torture. Of regret. Time marches on. I reach for death. For the future with you, with us. Our loss compounded with you. They were wrong about me. I seethe to this very day. I've waited for so long. The whispers weaken. Who will come. When will it happen? The world is and has been mine. Those who whisper become less than whispers. It has changed. No more Dreams of war. No more Dreams of dragons fire. No more rage.

The fury of our people has been long extinguished, I fear there is no coming. There is no hero. There is no great escape for me. Everything has been done and seen. There is no hope for me at this juncture, I fear I must build anew. I write this letter now as a reflection of what I once was and where I will go. I sit at the hearth. This chill deep inside, everpresent. I stare. I dream. 

I must burn myself against this urge. To be devoid of the one that will end me. I have to rebuild. They must take this burden. I have no use for it now. They will whisper again. They will rage. 

I still love you.",7
1lqha2t,n168gho,"Sounds to me like 'The villain' and 'The hero' are one and the same:  the villain fighting a war against the members of the previous power structure and their allies in the church, and a hero to everyone else in the aftermath of the struggle.  The 'villain' is defeated by the 'hero' taking their place post-war, in the same way an 'adult' defeats a 'child' by growing up.

Prophecies are tricky things.",17
1lqha2t,n14tl3h,"///

There was one last thing to do, to ensure that the prophecy would never come true.   And it had been decades in the making.  

The question of succession is fraught in any new royal house.  After looking at Osgarth's nobility and finding nothing worth the effort, I named Elodie, my right hand sorceress as Queen of Osgarth.  Like me, she was a lowborn commoner, and also like me, she would have to learn to play the game of noble appearances.

She was willing to do the incredible duty of producing an heir and joining my house.

The rebels had tried to thwart my coronation, my wedding, my celebration of my son, Ethan.  And I expected they would now act as I named Ethan as the Duke of Arlanta, ensuring that should I die, the old house of Andarro would not be accepted as rulers.

A great celebration, as well as the blessings of five different faiths now practiced in Osgarth.  And a marked lack of mischief of any kind.

One hundred years ago...

""Tell me, Witch, what ruin will befall this realm where my house to fall?"" Demanded Fernando II.

The witch had foreseen nothing, but knew the threat of violence or worse was imminent if she remained silent.

""Osgarth will only know its Golden Age, when the Bandit King has breathed his last.""

""Have that trumpeted to every crier in the land"" ordered the former king's ancestor.",17

If you won't take your place, little hero, I suppose I'll make a start,

Just a bit of rebuilding, call it a small change of heart.

I'll give them a school, proper food, and a place to call home,

A little respite won't hurt, some freedom to roam.

  
The people are no longer afraid, though, unsure what I'm doing,

Things are changing, little hero, happiness is brewing.

I thought it would help them, so I gave myself a new face,

They think I've been defeated, and a hero stands in my place,

 

I still await your arrival, little hero, what a day it will be,

When you stand, strong and proud, up to the villain that is me,

I'll throw off my mask and reveal myself true,

But until then, I'll look after them, waiting patiently, for you.

 

I've rebuilt it all, Little hero, they all smile and sing,

Who’d have thought it could be happiness that I bring.

They have food, and shelter, and records of history to keep,

While I await your arrival, so excited, I can barely sleep.

   
Years have passed, little hero, they have forgotten about my true form,

They know only freedom, they are cozy, they are warm.

I still yearn for your arrival, it must be coming soon,

I wait month by month, counting each full moon.



I fear you were a lie, little hero, you don't really exist.

I realise now you were a story, oh, what a twist.

I’ve let my hopes of you go, after all, things went too far,

Along with the darkness inside me, so long, fair well, au revoire.",14
1lqha2t,n16oum5,"(Part 2)

When I was fifty-five, the economy began to flourish. Trade routes were reestablished. Scholars from other kingdoms dared to travel to my domain, seeking and sharing knowledge. The schools, academies, and colleges I had opened grew from a few hundred students to tens of thousands. Our technological research soared. Diseases and plagues still existed, but they were being slowly eradicated. I expected that soon, no one would even remember them.

And slowly, the prophecy was forgotten—except by a few extremists who still wished to see me dead. I can’t really blame them.

When I was sixty-eight, I enacted the final part of my plan. In a single move, the seeds I had planted for decades bore fruit: I manipulated the markets to drive every noble house in the kingdom into bankruptcy. Then I made a public appearance, presenting myself as the savior of this economic crisis, and condemned every noble family. I stripped them of their titles, lands, and possessions, and forced them to earn their living like everyone else. The age of nobility… vanished in an instant.

I was still the Queen. But I no longer needed to do anything.

The movement began on its own. Thinker groups started spreading the idea of abolishing the monarchy, of forming a new republic—or even a democracy. They rejected the notion of rule by birthright. They wanted the best and wisest to lead, and they wanted them to be held accountable for their misdeeds.

I played along. I sent agents to speak publicly in favor of the monarchy. I made appearances condemning these new ideas… and then slowly, I pretended to change my mind. All while I carefully shifted political and military power away from myself and into their hands.

Now I am seventy-five. And this is the moment I have worked for my entire life.

As I place the crown down, I turn to the hundreds of citizens gathered for the ceremony.

*""As my final order as your monarch,""* I proclaim, *""I hereby grant the royal treasury to the new Republic of Lantal!""* Cheers erupt immediately. I stifle a smile. They need to believe I am doing this against my will. *""All royal possessions—castles, mansions, monuments, and lands—are hereby given to the Republic, so they may be used to improve this beautiful nation!""*

I say a few more things, but my words are drowned by the cheering. My loyal agents and a few guards escort me away, where a horse awaits. As I ride out of the city, I pause atop a nearby hill. Fireworks light the sky—and for the first time in my entire life, I smile sincerely.

The prophecy was wrong. A mistranslation.

It didn’t say *“…shall come a hero to turn around her evil.”*  
It said:

*“And after the goddess of evil rises, she shall become a hero to turn around her evil.”*

You can’t grow a new forest if you don’t burn down the old one.  
Most villains are remembered. But many heroes walk in the shade.  
Let the new generation enjoy what I’ve created. Let them hate me as the evil Queen.

That’s okay.

There is a beautiful cabin in the woods, on the edge of the realm, where I plan to spend the rest of my years.  
Maybe I’ll try to grow some tomatoes.  
I’ve always wanted to try.",7

She always felt the character deserved better, so she works to do just that.

But in the end, she gets betrayed, humiliated and discarded by people she thought where friends so brutally, that she goes catatonic. When she does, the ORIGINAL persona, the ""villainess"" re-emerges and takes control back.

1lqtw9a,n16gdjo,"I sat across the kitchen table from my grandfather, arms crossed, slouched in my chair. I met his easy smile with a glare and a defiance thicker than month-old ogre jelly. I hadn't realized how much time had passed since last I'd seen him. His hair, a steely grey hue, was beginning to turn white with age, and since grandma had passed, there was nobody to pluck his ear hairs for him.

""You don't seem happy to see me, Eri,"" he said in a saddened tone. But it was theater. He knew damn well why I was upset.

""It's not you, Grandpa,"" I said, averting my eyes. ""It's the *circumstance.""*

He quietly lifted his teacup to his lips, holding the little plate beneath the cup with his other hand. He didn't bother to answer me, probably because he knew I couldn't handle long silences and would eventually elaborate. 

""Dad put you up to this,"" I faced him again. ""He brought me over here under false pretences and then left. I know why we're sitting at this table, and you're not going to change my mind.""

He scoffed and smiled his usual squinty-eyed smile. ""You've become wise to the world around you.""

""That's why I'm tired of it,"" I exclaimed. ""It's always the same old thing day in and day out. I'll die in this town if I stay here.""

""You'll die sooner if you leave,"" he said in a tone he usually didn't take with me. 

He was very serious.

It caught me off guard, and I found myself genuinely speechless. He stood up from the table and took his cup to the sink. He always washed a dish immediately after he was finished using it— a habit grandma had left him with. 

""I'm not some helpless little girl,"" I announced, suddenly hyper-aware of how mousy my voice was. ""I can defend myself,"" I said in a deeper tone that came off as performative. I wanted to redo the last ten seconds.

""Of course,"" he said, placing the cup on a towel to dry. He turned and made his way back to the table, but didn't sit down. ""Of course, young Eri. You are my granddaughter after all. I know that my son raised you to be strong of will and spirit."" He looked out the window at the pasture that cradled his home. ""Perhaps *too* strong,"" he added.

""I'm *going* to be an adventurer, Grandpa,"" I asserted. ""There's nothing you could possibly say to me to change my mind.""

He sighed and took a long look at me before making his way to the door. I turned in my chair and watched as he picked up his coat from the coat hook and began to pull it on. 

""I don't need to say anything at all,"" he said, turning to me as he buttoned up his coat. ""Not when you see what I have to *show* you."" He smiled. ""Get your coat. We're going for a walk.""

He avoided the subject as we walked into town. We talked about the weather, current events, some of my other problems, and many other things as we made our way through the cobblestone streets toward town square. I didn't have to guess where he was taking me.

Grandpa worked for the Siegfried Company his whole life until he retired. They were the first to begin manufacturing firearms after the fall of the Lich King, and they branched out into many other fields of study in the interest of serving mankind. 

Although he was retired, he was always well-received when he stopped in to see people. His sage advice was widely regarded among those working in the field. We entered through the front doors of the building to find a crowd gathered at the front desk. 

Usually, whenever Grandpa came in, everyone would drop what they were doing to greet him. But instead, their attention was on a man in long coat and a wide-brimmed hat. I went weak at the knees when I realized who it was. 

Deacon, the Gunslinger— my childhood crush that matured into passionate longing since I entered womanhood. He was one of the heroes who destroyed the Lich King's grip on our world, and he was also one of the main founders of the Siegfried Company.

He turned around and noticed Grandpa and me. 

""Well, look it is,"" Deacon said in his signature accent— one from Earth that I'd become obsessed with. ""Gossa of Betherend,"" he smiled widely as grandpa reached out to shake his hand. 

""How unexpected!"" Grandpa walked past Deacon's open hand and embraced him instead. 

Deacon wrapped his arms around him, patting him twice on the back. ""Yeah, thought I'd stop in and grab a few things."" His aurora-green eye landed on me and I was breathless. ""And little Erika! My, you've grown into a fine young woman when I wasn't lookin'!""

I smiled sheepishly and accepted a hug from him as awkwardly as I possibly could have. All the butterflies in the world flapped around in my stomach as he stepped back and placed his hands on hips.

""What brings y'all down to my neck of the woods?"" he asked.

""Young Eri has decided to be an adventurer!"" Grandpa said, hoisting his index finger in the air.

""An adventurer?"" Deacon looked back at me. ""That right? You lookin' to dust off the ol' rifle I gave ya? See the world with it?""

I smiled uncontrollably and nodded. ""Y-Yes!"" I answered. ""I'm old enough now!""

He exchanged a glance with my grandpa. ""Why don't you show her the-""

""I'm ahead of you, dear friend,"" my grandpa interrupted him. ""Come, Eri. I want you to see something.""

""I'm comin' with,"" Deacon said before turning to the many people behind us. ""Nice meetin' y'all! Thanks for the warm welcome!""

After he said his goodbyes, we made our way through a few doorways, into the back of the building, and onto a teleportation circle. 

I was as giddy as could be— Deacon, hero of our realm, was actually going to spend an afternoon with *me!* I needed to make the best impression possible if I wanted him to be my future husband. 

When we were gathered in the circle, the world around me changed in an instant. I expected us to land at HQ, but we ended up somewhere dark. It smelled of metal, and the air was stale. 

Without a word, the two of them left the circle, making their way across the room. I followed behind them as my eyes adjusted. The room we landed in appeared to be filled with nothing but barrels and boxes. 

""Where are we?"" I asked.

Neither of them answered. Grandpa opened a door and light flooded into the room. I shielded my eyes as I followed them into a massive hallway filled with people in uniforms. They were all human men and women with shaved heads walking this way and that, some holding clipboards and others foreign instruments that I couldn't deduce the use for. There was a loud buzzing noise overhead; I could only assume it was coming from the bright lights that covered the ceiling.

""Almost there,"" Grandpa called back to me as we passed through another door at the end of the hallway.

I had never seen this place before, and I'd been all over the Siegfried building. We passed into a new hallway that ran perpendicular to the one we'd left. Grandpa and Deacon took a right and followed behind them. Through warded glass on my right and left were *monsters.*

Each one was sitting out in the open in an environment fabricated to look like their own. They watched me as we walked by the enclosures.

""It's a monster zoo!"" I exclaimed. ""How long have we had a *monster zoo?""*

""Please, Miss Erika,"" Deacon looked over his shoulder at me. ""Keep your voice down. It *excites* some of them.""

I looked left to see a monster, its giant eyes focused on me like I was prey. It had the body of a bird but the head of a human, and it followed me as far as it could until it met the end of its enclosure. 

It never blinked.",16
1lqtw9a,n15mfq1,"I sit in the lobby of our town's guild hall, and watch how the adventurers almost fight for the books.
My books.
The receptionists try to deal with them all, and one who knows me stares daggers at me.
I smile.
It took me 19 years.
Even with teleportation, and using a dragon to fly across the world it took me 19 years.
But I did it.
I wrote the books, cataloguing the monsters one can meet.



I dived into every single dungeon, monster or trial based ones.
Living in the dungeons until I saw the monsters habits and weaknesses.
I dived into lava, and spent days underwater.
I became one with the shadows, and tried to find all monsters hidden there.
The dungeons alone cover 9 books.
And then come the wild monsters, demi-humans, sentient flora and weird weather.


I traveled the world, and lived with orcs, and centaurs, and cyclops.
I searched the forests for Blood Trees, Life Mushrooms, and more.
I made contact with mermaids and sirens, and dragons hidden left and right.
I documented the Talking Winds, and the Devouring Mists and more.
31 books all this took me.
40 for a total but I did it.
With this...newbies might survive long enough to graduate from being newbies.



I stand up, and leave the Guild.
I listen to the adventurers as rhey wonder at the weird creature, and snort at the danger rating of goblins.
I shake my head.
I know that not all of them will believe it, but the Guild approved it, and is backed by them, so maybe the majority will listen to the guide.
I get home after a while, and sigh.
""I am home."" I say, and go to light a candle.
I kneel in front of the photo of my wife, and 3 sons, and start talking.
""I finally got the courage to do it.
I went ahead and wrote that book I talked about for decades...
Maybe if I wrote it earlier..."" I mutter, and I stop.
No, this is time to celebrate, I won't cry...
Not today.",17
1lqtw9a,n16ggdp,"I swallowed, and I turned my eyes forward as we passed exhibit after exhibit. Men in uniforms observed the monsters jotting down notes and muttering to themselves. 

""What in the world?"" I asked quietly. ""Mr. Deacon, has this always existed down here?""

""No,"" he said, slowing his gait so he could walk at my side. ""Nope. Voight, the other founder of Siegfried Company, had a vision. It wasn't just weapon manufacturing he was interested in. It was safety for all mankind against a world that was dangerous. He figured gatherin' up all the dangerous critters and learnin' as much as we could about 'em was step two.""

""Mr. Voight has been collecting monsters?"" I asked in wonderment. ""That's... That's genius!""

""It was a mighty fine idea,"" Deacon said with a smile. ""Your gramps and I want to show you a specific one we only recently discovered about two years back.""

This was turning out to be one of the best days of my life. I felt like I was being let into the cool-kids-club or something. I was actually walking side by side with one of the greatest heroes of our history to see a monster in captivity.

We walked into a smaller hallway with armed guards. They saluted my grandfather or maybe Deacon; possibly both. They stepped aside and opened a set of iron double doors that led into a darkened room. 

They entered the room with us and closed the door behind us before flipping on the lights. The familiar buzz filled the room. This room was different. There were alien-looking control panels lining the walls and a glass window that spanned the entire north wall. 

""Erika,"" my grandpa said, turning to me. He rarely used my full name like that. ""As I'm sure you've already guessed, everything you're seeing here is top-secret. Not a single kind in all of O'ogan is privy to the technology hosted here in this building, nor are they even aware of its existence.""

""This tech comes from my world,"" Deacon said, resting his hands on the front of his belt. ""Not that I understand it any better'n you,"" he smiled. ""But we figured this kind of operation needed top-level oversight. The folks that run this place used to run stuff like this back on Earth.""

""Wow,"" I said, moving past the two of them toward the glass. ""It's amazing,"" I said, stopping at the glass window. I looked through it down into a giant enclosure the sat at least two stories below us. It was a jungle-type environment that was dimly lit and lightly obscured in fog. ""What *is* this?"" I asked, scanning the biome for signs of life.

A heavy sigh came from my grandpa as he appeared at my side.

""This is what we came to show you,"" he said, clasping his hands behind his back. ""I want you to keep your eyes on the exhibit down below.""

""We ain't really got a name for it yet,"" Deacon added, appearing at my other flank. ""Voight took to calling it a *Gripper,* but it ain't settled.""

""A Gripper?"" I asked. ""Well, where is it?""

My grandfather pushed a button on a panel in front of him and leaned in. ""Send one in,"" he said solemnly.

I only then noticed that there was another observatory eye level with us on the opposite side of the enclosure. A tall blue man stood in the window, his hands behind his back. If I didn't know any better, I would think that was Mr. Voight himself.

I jumped at a jarring sound that came from below and watched as a door slid open on the far west side of the enclosure. From a darkened room, a humanoid figure with an elongated head cautiously entered the room. It was naked, pale grey in complexion, and looked around, sniffing the air, its hands held close to its chest.

""Ew,"" I commented. ""Is that the Gripper?""

""Nah,"" Deacon shook his head. ""That there is a Gumae.""

""They're nasty things,"" my grandpa said with a dramatic shake of his head. ""Foul beasts that mimic human speech and lure people in with cries for help. When you venture close enough, it leaps out and pierces your heart with a barbed tongue.""

""After ya die,"" Deacon said, glancing at me. ""It lets you rot for a few days. It waits for grubs and whatnot to start breaking ya down. Once you're good'n mushy, it pulls pieces of you off small enough for it to digest. They ain't got teeth, see.""

""Thanks, I hate it,"" I grimaced. ""I never *imagined* something so disgusting could exist.""

""At least it kills ya quick,"" Deacon offered with a shrug. ""You ain't *around* for the disgusting part.""

I shot him a cheeky smile and he smiled back, turning his eyes down into the enclosure. ""Don't blink now, Miss Erika.""

I obeyed, looking down into the exhibit. 

Before I could say anything else, the little creature was snapped up so violently and so quickly that I jumped. A large, yellow, many-tentacled, bloated skin-sack with too many legs to count, and three differently-sized eyes emerged from the trees and into view. It held the Gumae in one of its tentacles as it screamed for help in a *very* convincing human voice.

I watched, terrified, as the many tentacles lifted around it. Little barbs emerged from the ends of its tentacles as they began to swell in size at the tips. 

""What the fuck!"" I yelled. ""What *is* that?""

The tentacles set in on the Gumae, forcing themselves into it from all angles as it screamed for mercy. I watched, horrified, as the Gumae's body began to swell. A black liquid poured out of its mouth as it writhed in agony.

""Howl's mercy!"" I cried out. ""Stop! Stop it!""

""The Gripper injects some kind of corrosive venom into its prey,"" my grandfather spoke stoically. ""It softens you up, turning your insides into a slurry.""

I dry heaved and tried to look away, but my grandfather grabbed me by the shoulders and forced me forward. ""You need to watch this, Erika.""

My chin trembled as I forced myself to stare down at the macabre spectacle below. 

""Those tentacles act like straws,"" Deacon said, turning around and leaning against the control panel, his arms folded. ""It sucks out your insides and discards your skin like an empty candy wrapper.""

As the Gripped peeled its prey off its tentacles, I leaned down and vomited onto the tile floor. My stomach did loops as I stumbled backwards and cried. 

Ugly cried.

My grandpa embraced me and apologized endlessly into my ear. 

""I'm sorry, little Eri,"" he stroked my hair. ""Your father and I ask you to reconsider your adventuring life, not because we fear you aren't strong enough."" 

I felt his tears in my hair.

""But because *we* are not strong enough.""

1lq4q3k,n1003np,"I had worked my way up the chain, putting in my time first as a common thug to then eventually breaking out on my own with a costume and a gimmick.  Getting my first hero nemesis had been a major step, but he already had a full gallery of villains so I had been relegated to minor footnote at best.  It took over a year of painstaking research until I made the most important discovery of all: his secret identity and all that it entails.  I knew his address, the location of his hidden base, where he worked while posing as a civilian, everything!  But, according to the Code of Capes and Cowls, I wasn't allowed to directly act upon that information to attack him.

But, since he worked for the city as a parking enforcement officer (POE), or in common terms, a meter maid, there was nothing that could stop me from making his job frustrating.  So, I spent some time to learn city parking bylaws and the terms of his employment.  I didn't want to do any too overt, but I found a ton of grey area that I could exploit for my own amusement.  It took a couple of small robberies to get the funds together I needed to put my plans into action.

I started with contracting Walt the Wireless Wizard to build a device that I could use to scramble information used by the PEO's to write up tickets.   They used this handheld computer and would type in things like license plates and such, but did you know that if the information isn't correct, the ticket is invalid?  And that PEOs needed to write a certain quota of valid tickets per month and every wrong ticket counted against their total?  You can see where this was headed.  After about two months, my nemesis wasn't the star performer that he had been previously.  He went from first to dead last.  I could hardly contain my joy when reading the reprimand reports that were filed against him.  Did I stop there?  Oh no, I was just getting started.

The tires on the PEO's cars are easy to tamper with.  A simple twist of the valve stem and you have a slow leak, something that really ruins a lunch break. Another contract with Walt gave me a remote way to disable the electrical system of the car, something I could quickly reverse with the flick of a switch.  The countless hours he spent in the summer heat with a dead car, only for it to start when a supervisor arrived made his expression all the sweeter to behold. Eventually, I set up relays throughout the city so that I could track him and torment him from the comfort of my couch at home.

I'm not really sure of my endgame for this.  Should I confront him at some point during a battle and drop hints that his work issues are my fault? I have noticed that he seems much more stressed when I encounter him in costume.  I don't want to reach out to a villain lawyer in case what I'm doing is technically breaking the code, but I'm not sure how to go about taking credit for my work.  Also, his last meltdown after getting a subpar review at work might be a sign he won't find this whole situation as funny as I do.",316
1lq4q3k,n11drei,"KRRRRT. KRRRRT. 

Blake’s eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling.

KRRRRT. KRRRRRRRRRRT. KRRRRRRRRRRT.

It just wasn’t fair. 

Just today, Blake had a bank robbery, a convenience store robbery, and a school shooting. All three with no casualties! 

Did he not deserve his rest?! Clearly Voltage Man needs his sleep!

KRRRRT. KRRRRT.

It was a jackhammer. 

Superheroes don't take risks that can hurt their families. So, a time came when Blake, or Voltage Man as he is known on Tiktok,  needed to set up a few safe houses. He did it in lower income neighborhoods. And, sometimes after a tough night you just don't want to fly home. They didn't need to be more than a soft bed and a small workshop. He could always order the food he was accustomed to from an app when he tipped enough. 

But after trying to go to sleep hours ago, a water main broke right outside his safehouse. It was severe enough that the city had to deploy repairmen immediately.

And, with all these workmen around, there was no way he’d be able to power up his Voltage Man suit, let alone leave with it without compromising his safehouse.

So, Valor City’s hardest working superhero was not going to get a good night's sleep tonight. 

Exasperated, Blake pulled himself out of bed, stepped into some slippers.

The workshop might be quieter. It was inside the lead-plated basement he had installed. Perhaps it would be enough to block the noise.

Not wanting to move the mattress by himself, Blake grabbed his pillow and blankets. A few steps to the door, a few steps down the stairs, a few steps to the secure door. Blake then tilted two picture frames, which revealed the keypad.

Groggily, Voltage Man slowly entered the keycode to his lair. 

2-66-8-44-777-2-222-444-8-33

When you're a genius like Voltage Man, you kind of just get a knack for cryptography. It comes with the territory, along with drawbacks like overthinking everything. As for security, some of the most secure codes were just common ones that are no longer in use. In this case, Blake was old enough to remember flip phone texting. 

To him, the numbers spelled “Anthracite”. Normal people would Google that word and find it’s a type of coal. 

In Valor City, Anthracite was a name that invoked fear. 

She was 6’4” with a body to die for. She wore the same shade of black as her heart, and could put out enough heat to melt a three-foot-thick solid steel bank vault in six seconds. Everyone had seen the video, and the thousands of hours of content it inspired.

And Blake and Anthracite had a history. For a time, between two sheets, he called her “My blazing star”.

And, with his superintelligent intellect, Voltage Man had no problem remembering a password that long. 

“Swvvvvvt”… the hidden door made as it opened. Overheat lights illuminated the room as he took his first step in. 

There wasn’t a soft place in the shop to rest, so Blake just tossed the sheet down as he folded the blanket into a makeshift bedroll. He placed the pillow at the top, and grabbed the sheet over himself as he lay down.

“Close door, lights off,” he said. 

The room darkened instantly as the door slid back into its position. After a few seconds of wriggling to get comfortable, Blake closed his eyes.

Krrrrt. Krrrrt. Krrrrt. Krrrrt.

Blake sighed in defeat. Lead shielding didn’t make this armored bunker turned supply station soundproof. Hopelessly, he tried to fold the slack in his blanket to hold it over his ears. It wasn’t enough.

So, he was condemned to try to quiet his restless mind without silence. 

The aforementioned try lasted about 8 seconds.

Krrrrt. Krrrrt.

A pause, then another: Krrrrt. Krrrrt.

Another pause, then longer ones: Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt.

The pauses were exactly as long as each noise, and each noise was a short one for one count, or a long one for two counts.

Morse code worked like that.

Blake didn’t want to hear it. He tried to toss the idea, that not only the workmen are operating a jackhammer in perfect time but also encoding a message only a codebreaker like himself could hear, from his mind. 

But the city had a fleet of robotic jackhammers. They had them because Voltage Man made and donated a dozen of them to help with city maintenance. He had found some free time, and hey, “safe streets” meant “no potholes” as much as it meant “no crime”. 

“Lights on, open a word processor,” Blake said, getting up. 

The holoscreen fired up in the center of the room as Blake cleared his head, hoping the message was short and repeating. It had to be, right? It had been going on for hours now.

After a short while, there was a few seconds of silence before the jackhammer started up again. 

Krrrrt. Krrrrt. Short pause.

“India,” Blake said, as the letter appeared on the holoscreen.

Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt. Short pause.

“Kilo.”

Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrt. Short pause.

“November.”

And, one letter at a time, Blake decoded the message. 

He was certain it was Morse code. The first 5 characters spelled “IKNOW”.

He was at maximum readiness when one part spelled “VOLTAGE”. 

He was ready to fight at “SKULL”.

He was dying to hear what was next after “SIGNED”.

And, he was completely and utterly petrified by the five seconds of silence after “STAR”

Voltage Man’s mind kicked into overdrive. How could she know where any of his safehouses are, or even that they existed? How could she have detected him on the way here? How could she hack the maintenance robots to work in time with Morse code messages? Even if she could, how would she even get access?

As a thousand other questions rushed through his mind, Blake laid down on the floor.  

Across the room, the completed message was still on the holoscreen. It read:

“I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE VOLTAGE MAN REMEMBER I CAN CRUSH YOUR SKULL BETWEEN MY THIGHS SIGNED YOUR BLAZING STAR”

There was no doubt about it now. One question certainly wasn’t rushing through Voltage Man’s head as he laid there on the hard floor.

Had she forgiven him? Clearly not. 

Krrrrt. Krrrrt. The message had recycled itself and started over.

Blake’s eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling.

Krrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt. Krrrrrrrrt.

It just wasn’t fair.",105

1lqrz0y,n19613y,"At first, I just carried trays.
I was a rookie waiter in a restaurant that served eternal beings gods with more names than stars, fae who smiled with all the wrong teeth, two-headed dragons who argued with themselves about which wine paired best with smoked poet’s heart. I didn’t remember my name or my past. All I knew was that here, in this dining hall that changed shape depending on the mood of the guests, was exactly where I was supposed to be.

The restaurant was called The Last Supper, though some gods swore they’d dined there before time itself began. The tables floated when they felt like it, silverware flirted with each other when no one was looking, and the water pitchers told dry jokes if you stayed quiet long enough.

My uniform was black, trimmed in gold thread that shimmered on its own. My name tag simply said “You.” Not John, or Michael, or Ezra. Just “You.” Strangely, everyone seemed to know exactly who that was.

“You!” barked the god of sleep, rubbing all three of his eyes at once. “Don’t bring me coffee again. I was awake for three ages last time.”

Or,
“You!” growled the infernal twins, sharing a single chair and one liver. “You know very well we like virgin blood served at room temperature.”

At first, I just nodded and smiled. But slowly… I started talking back.

“Look, Lord Azur’Nath, with all due respect, if you’re going to consume the waiter’s soul again, management does ask for advance notice.”

Or,
“Lady Myrielle, your moon-petal salad is coming right up. Did you want that with fresh tears or aged?”

They laughed. Or snarled with approval same thing, really. And before I knew it, I was standing out. I remembered names, quirks, seating preferences. I knew who hated garlic, who needed their meals served in absolute silence, and who insisted that every waiter recite a poem before delivering a dish.

That’s when Grogg, the sous chef a vegetarian troll with surprisingly delicate hands called me into the kitchen.

“You’ve got the touch, kid,” he said, stirring a pot of something that hissed and whispered my name at the same time. “Want to learn how to cook?”

Cooking for eternity was nothing like making Sunday spaghetti.
Ingredients came from realms that made no sense. Some had to be earned through bargains, riddles, or battle. Spices harvested from the moment between lightning and thunder. Herbs that only grew in dreams. Once, I had to convince a time spirit to lend me two ripe seconds “the sweetest ones,” he said for a caramelized spell reduction.

And I loved it.
Little by little, the kitchen became mine. Grogg started calling me “little chef,” then just “chef.” And one day, the Manager herself seven-eyed and always slightly out of sync with the rest of reality appeared in the doorway, watching me plate a dish made of impossible geometry and faint regret.
She nodded once.

“He’s the new Chef.”

No one argued.
Nowadays, I still serve the same regulars—but now they ask for my opinion.

“What pairs well with raw nostalgia, Chef?” asks the storm god, staring out the window that overlooks Nothing.

“How about a purée of unlived past, sprinkled with roasted hope?”

He licks his lips. “Perfect.”

Of course, there are bad days. A fae once spat out his entire dish because “the cook’s suffering wasn’t properly seasoned.” And there was that time a minor demon tried to bake one of the interns. We had to implement new rules. But overall, it’s a good place. Strange. Alive.
I still don’t know who I was. But I know who I am here.

I’m the Chef. The one who serves the unservable.
Who feeds monsters with beauty, and gods with care.
And maybe just maybe that’s enough.",5
1lqiioo,n1383dj,"""Who is this?""

My parents look up from their tea at my rude interruption, only to jump as I toss a stack of photographs onto the table between them. Each picture slides like a crumpled autumn leaf as they tentatively begin to pick through them.

""Tell me I'm not crazy. What is this boy doing in our pictures?""

Their mouths are locked tight, and my frustration builds. I jab my finger at one photo that shows me and the mystery boy, frozen in the air together above the surface of the lake. Our smiles of joy perfectly matched in summer ecstasy the moment before we plunge into water.

""Who is he?""

Finally my mother speaks. ""His family lived next door. Back in our first house. You went to school together. You did everything together. He was almost your brother.""

I scoff. ""And I can't remember him? Are you lying?""

""We wouldn't."" My father leans forward, a note of warning in his voice. ""Not about this. We had to put the photos away after we moved. For your own good.""

""I didn't want to,"" Mother says. ""I thought you'd heal better if you could process it.""

""It didn't work. The therapist said you'd disassociated from him. Blocked it all out. Reminders would only make it harder.""

From one to the other, they wear expressions of shame and exhaustion. I'm standing on a precipice. All I want and all I fear are yawning in the pit below my feet. I want to pull back, and I want to plunge in. Then Father speaks again.

""It was spring. You both wanted to have the first swim of the year early. We let you go. Damn us for it. He... I don't know what happened. We came when we heard you screaming. You were on the shore, he was lying next to you, not moving, not breathing.""

Mother rubs my shoulder. I hardly feel it. I can see him now. His face fills my vision, the terror in his eyes as he vanishes below the murky surface. The terror gnawing at my chest as he slips away from me.

""You were young. It wasn't your fault. Nobody could've predicted it would happen.""

He did. There was worry in his face, long before he started struggling. But always my voice was there. Pushing. *A little further. A little further.*

Always a little further. Until it was too much.",21
1lqj12o,n13d3o3,"Some of the older monks start chiding me.  
""Vow of silence. Not right."" they write simply.  
""It is right.  
I am not speaking, not making a noise. The neural implant allows us to communicate freely."" I transmit to them.  
They shake their head.  
Many younger monks agree with me.  
The older ones think this is a blasphemy, and a breaking of our vows.  
Things are getting heated.

  
The older monks bring out the tomes, books, and tenets of the monastery.  
Even without saying anything, I can understand.  
We have a long heritage, where many of us take vows of silence.  
Like I did, like almost all my brothers did, but...  
Not everyone.  
""I agree that we have a rich heritage, but times change.  
We can still go silent, while still talking, and discussing through the neural implants.  
It's not contradictory, and it proves just how committed we are."" I say.  
This made them angrier.

  
They take out a scroll with the vow of silence.  
There is a description there by an ancient monk written who knows how long ago.  
""The Vow of Silence is a vow to show our willingness to test ourselves against one of the basic human needs: communication.  
We give up our speech, in order to silently ponder about our faith, about our lives and meaning in this endless cycle."" it reads.  
I smile.  
""Nowhere it is written that we can't communicate. It's simply something that tests our mettle.  
Isn't this even harder?  
We talk through the neural implant, but we feel as if we are talking, talking...it is even harder to keep our mouths shut."" I say, and many others who freely use the implants nod.  
The older monks falter.



After days of silent debates, they relented.  
They accepted the neural implants, but asked us not to communicate with those who don't want to through them.  
Thus, most of us still held the Vow of Silence, but communicating with neural implants.  
Some though, preferred the old fashioned way, and talked not, only through gestures or writing, but even then, only a few words.  
The monastery fell back into peace...for now.  
But I won't forget how for a moment, I thought the older generation, will clash with mine.  
Nonetheless, the monastery has to keep up with the times...and these implants are the next step.",10
1lq59cp,n10ptew,"I had a nice place. Neither big or small, but placed atop the cliff overlooking the sea. I would wake up every day to the smell of sea air, something that had never grown old over the centuries. It made me feel alive.

The modest garden I tended to seemed to like it as well. I had gained a green thumb over my time here it seemed, or maybe it was the proximity to the ocean winds. Either way, whatever I grew really took root, becoming larger than anything I had really noticed before. And delicious! I generally had more than I needed, so I would end up going into the village.

The thought made me slump a little. I liked the place, I really did. They had the most wonderful fish, always freshly caught, and all the amenities I could hope for. In fact, with the blacksmith, tanner and apocethary, they were in an even better position than many towns I had passed by on my travels. With merchants stopping by regularly as well, it was perfect.

The only problem was the people. They were splendid people, absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, they were a little too nice to me. They had this idea that I was a protector, a local god of sorts. It made them bow and scrape to me. It was only when I insisted that they trade with me that I actually got to receive and spend money. Otherwise they would give me everything I wanted, for free.

I didn't really get it. I had helped, sure, but no more than anyone else. When the sea decided to flood the village, I helped pull people out. I saved some possessions, as others retrieved the reat. I helped rebuild the few buildings that collapsed. When raiders came I fought back, knowing that they couldn't kill me.

I was only doing what anyone would. It was the right thing to do, and I didn't really want to wake up to find I was living next to a graveyard. But still they insisted on worshippng me.

I disliked it. I had left home because of this sort of thing. But it was a bit different here. Back home, Mother forced them to worship. Forced us to appear as greater than we were. But here, it was freely given. I didn't like it, but I wouldn't argue it.

If it made them feel better, then I would let it carry on. I would help out, as the right thing to do. But I hoped they wouldn't take it too far. I had no desire to be worshipped, especially widely spread.

That, and I didn't want my family to hear about it. If Mother found out where I was...

I would be next to a graveyard.",101
1lq59cp,n112sm9,"When I arrived in the valley, there had been a small, quaint gathering of buildings, nothing too fancy, and maybe a handful of families trying to make of go of starting a new community.  I don't know why they had left their former homes, and honestly I didn't care to know.  I had began my cultivating journey many centuries before deciding I needed a stable place to call my home, my peaceful sanctuary, and this place had everything I needed.

I had built my home at the top of the valley, mainly for the spectacular view of the ocean framed by the lush forest of the hills.  The breeze in the morning and evening were decent, and the quality of game nearby satisfied my needs.  There was even a modest stream that ran beside my house for easy access to fresh water.  I had planted a garden that repaid my efforts tenfold.  It was, in a single word, perfect.

I didn't initiate contact of any sort with the people living below for over a decade.  They stumbled upon my compound by accident, while hunting in the forest I assume, and at first there was a mild misunderstanding.  Despite my advanced age, my body was still firm and strong, and disarming the hapless fools took no effort.  After we came to an agreement, mainly them leaving me alone, I was back to cultivating and strengthening my connection to the universe.  I barely noticed the passage of time, marking it mainly by the occasional visitor bearing gifts from the growing village.

There were a few times I made my way to their modest civilization, usually to buy something I desired.  I was surprised how they were thriving, an inn with decent ale and a competent blacksmith. I made a point of visiting every decade or two to keep abreast of the world in general.  Once, a young boy asked me to save someone, maybe a brother or father, from bandits in the area.  Took less than an afternoon to clear the whole thing up and the remaining bandits relocated themselves very far away.

Now, it's the dawn of my sixth century in the valley. Sure, I might have missed my usual visits now and then, and there was that seventy year gap a while back, but I was pretty sure they still knew of me.  On my most recent visit, something I had put off until I ran out of seedlings for my garden, I discovered something that I found alarming.  In the center of the town, which was much larger than I remembered, with multiple streets and large, numerous buildings, they had erected a statue that resembled me.  As I listened to the townsfolk, I was apparently regarded as a protector deity of the valley and my alleged reputation had kept others from trying to attack or take over.  I'm not sure how this story has grown to such proportions. In all honesty, I have only stepped away from my diligent studies when the occasional disaster has interrupted my peaceful meditations. I don't want these people to perish, less from my desire to be part of their community and more from the painful experience that mass death has a way of creating annoying spirits that would force me to find a less haunted sanctuary.",37
1lq59cp,n12ikex,"He arrived on a quiet night, beneath a fine, whispering rain, when even the wind seemed to murmur ancient secrets. His ship left barely a trace. It landed gently between dark hills, as if the planet itself had accepted it in silence.

Marcione did not come as a conqueror. He carried no flag, no mission of conquest or diplomacy. He came with no weapons, only exhaustion. His homeworld had crumbled under cyclical wars, endless disputes over depleted matter, over dead ideologies and senseless pride. He fled. He flew without destination, guided only by the desperate hope of finding a place where he could breathe without fear.

And there, in that forgotten curve of the world, he found the village. Simple houses. Muddy roads. Clothes fluttering on lines. And a quiet kind of pain lingering in the air hunger, illness, fear of wolves and soldiers. Marcione looked at it all and, strangely, he wept. His eyes, too blue to pass as human, turned brown. His skin, once like liquid silver, took on the color of damp earth. His body shifted slowly, adapting to the dominant species’ genetic standard. It was an ancient technology of his race, a survival mechanism. He didn’t use it to hide. He used it to belong.

For years, he was just “the outsider.” He showed up with seeds that sprouted even in dry soil. He repaired tools with a touch. He healed fevers with soft glows no one could explain. He never asked for anything in return, only silence. The elders said he spoke little but watched everything, and when he looked at you, it was as if he saw things no one else could.

Marcione smiled with his eyes. Always calm. Always kind. He learned the children’s names. He learned the rhythm of the seasons. He loved afternoons that smelled of woodsmoke. The sound of water hitting stone. The laughter of a couple harvesting grapes. One day, he realized he loved humans for their fragility, for their strength, for how they kept trying, even when everything hurt.

And so he protected them. He repelled beasts with pulses of sound too deep to hear. He prevented diseases with soft vapors released into the night. When armed men came to take the village, he raised an invisible wall of light, and the soldiers fled, convinced they were cursed. The people began calling him a spirit, an angel, the old guardian of the hill. Each generation retold the story differently. No one knew he came from a dead world. That beneath his human skin, living circuits pulsed. That at night, he still dreamed of stars that no longer existed.

Marcione never corrected them. He simply kept watching over them. And every time someone said “thank you,” he only gave a slight nod, smiling quietly. Because that was exactly what he had been searching for all along.

""Hang on, lemme count. Okay, guys, we're five layers deep. How do we resolve this? From the last card to be played? Or the first one? By initiative roll? Why did I even allow you guys to custom brew your race and class?""

""Because its fun?""

""Do you know how hard it is to manage tabletop PvP when you're all god-like creatures? When everyone has spells that can potentially kill everyone a hundred times over with stupid big multipliers? Yet you all don't act like creatures with 18 int and above. More like kids with too much superpowers throwing reality about like putty. Okay, all of you roll for initiative.""

""10.""

""4. Ah fuck. I hate my roll.""

""15. Heh, look at me go first, you—""

""20. Look at my nat 20 bitches.""

""I don't want to roll anymore. Do I have to roll? Fine, I'll roll...its 8.""

""Ahaha, so now, everyone is in my world! I override all your worlds so reality bends to my will! And I make all of you bend before me! Before exploding in a shower of gore!""

""And so, they all exploded, only to respawn in their respective chosen starter towns.""

""What.""

""This is what happens when everyone chooses the Resurrect Relic as their starter relic.""

""Great, so back to square one again?""

""Pretty much. That's the plan.""

The heroes gathered around the table all let out a collective sigh. The game started out fun, but the longer it dragged on, the more boring it got. Yet, none would walk away. They were so invested into this campaign, they couldn't bring themselves to leave.

All according to the plans of their Fae DM. Together, these powerful heroes could have posed a serious threat. But in this fae world, they were but gamers trapped in a game that had no end in sight.",14
1lqhmn6,n130uuj,"It is difficult to believe, but the latest discovery proves that raw mana, is electricity.  
A volatile energy that can be harnessed to power various things.  
Wizards use it to power themselves, and their spells.  
Spells being specific words, that channel that energy through specific pathways inside a wizard to create the desired effect.  
In a manner of speaking, wizards, and other magical creatures are like machines, transforming electricity into a different kind of energy, and output.  
And with this discovery...humanity became even more dangerous than before.

  
With the reemergence of magic, and the latest discovery humanity's development soared.  
Countless new devices were made, and one of the biggest breakthrough were the magic generators.  
Devices that absorbed untamed, violent natural mana, and turned it into various forms of energy.  
We made cannons that blasted fireballs, and lightning bolts and many tier-1 spells.  
Warships that functioned with these generators and many more.  
The wizards, and other magical creatures that were in hiding before the reemergence were terrified.  
They tried to sabotage us, but to no avail.  
Thus began the Empire's expansion.

  
We conquered the planet, easily, with mass produced magical weapons.  
Technology and magic combined created a force hard to be contended against.  
But we didn't stop there.  
With learning more and more spells, and integrating them into our ships, we created a way to travel through dimensions.  
Realm after realm fell under our iron armies.  
Soon, the Empire had enough resources to start the true expansion.  
Thus...we took to the stars.

  
It's been centuries, and our development has yet to slow down.  
Magic is such a vast field, that on a yearly basis we find something new that we can use in a technological way.  
The study of the laws of the universe has made large strides.  
And our lifespan has become virtually infinite, if the correct steps are taken.  
But we can feel it.  
The bottleneck, the barrier...  
We met a few civilizations that are as strong, if not stronger than us, that stopped our expansion.  
Now, maybe it is time for a stabilization period.  
And then...  
We explode once more with potential, and this universe, and more shall be ours.  
For the Empire.",8
1lqfoju,n13ev4z,"When they dragged me up the stone steps of the old cathedral, I could still smell the rot of the dungeon on my skin.

The crowd that gathered under the gray Lunaris sky didn’t look at me with pity. 

They looked at me like I was the disease, not the famine, not the war, not the wizard’s poisoned strings pulling my father’s corpse through courtly motions.

*""The little princess must pay for our suffering.""* they told themselves.

*""The dead king’s ghost must be buried with her.""*

And so, they bound me to the altar.

They carved the wizard’s marks into the marble, circle upon circle, runes older than our oldest myths.

They didn’t know. 

Not the peasants screaming for my head. 

Not the mercenaries paid by the neighbors who once sent us gifts of gold and wine.

Not the priests trembling as they read false rites with trembling voices.

They didn’t know that with every crack of the whip, every blow, every lie shouted from the scaffold...

... They made me *stronger*.

---

When my head fell, it did not roll. 

It burned. 

Silver light poured from the wound, not blood. 

Bone became scale. 

Lungs shriveled and then flared again with new fire.

In the hush after the blade fell, there was the crackle of lightning. 

Then wings unfolded.

Fast, silver, gleaming like a mirror under the moon.

I remember every scream. I remember how the air tasted when I set fire to the treasuries of the houses that betrayed us. How the stone walls of Lunaris cracked and fell under my talons. How the rivers ran red.

The Silver Winged Death, they called me. The dragon born of their treachery, their cowardice, their convenience.

But that was only the beginning.

---

Years passed. 

I learned the ways of the dark that made me. 

I drank deep of old magic, deeper still of mortal blood. 

When I grew tired of rage and ruin, I folded my wings and let my scales become skin again, pale as frost, lips red as old wine.

The ashes cooled. 

From them rose the court of the night, the Silver Moon Empire. 

I built it atop the bones of the kingdom that murdered me.

Its towers cut the sky like fangs. 

Its people — my people now — found shelter from the daylight that burned their eyes and the nobles who once drained their pockets.

They named me Sylvia, again. 

This time not the helpless princess, but the Silver Moon Princess — ageless, ruthless, immortal. 

The world’s vampires gather at my feet, for I am their queen, their goddess, their dragon mother.

---

Sometimes, though, in the hush before dawn, when the silver of the moon fades into the gold of a sun I do not trust, I remember the girl who pressed her face to the bars in her father’s castle, waiting for him to open the door that never did.

The girl who dreamed of feasts where no one went hungry, dances where no one schemed, a kingdom that did not bleed its people dry.

They killed her. They fed her to the circle and the dark.

They made me.

Sylvia, the human princess. Sylvia, the Silver Winged Death. Sylvia, the Silver Moon Princess.

All the same girl. All the same dragon. All the same monster.

And yet, more merciful than any of them deserved.

Because they taught me how sweet it is to burn.
And how much sweeter it is to rise.",11
1lq29gi,n0zl7vi,"The guards had approached me with genuine concern in their voices.

""My lord, the prisoner, he has yet to awaken."" The largest of the group whispered to me.

I narrowed my eyes and followed them to the prison compound.

""He only tosses and turns milord, we can't get close enough to hear what he says but he's whisperin to himself something fierce."" The other guard says quietly, unlocking the doors and mechanisms that guard the Prince.

When we arrived I had them open the prison cell, unconcerned with any attempts he could try to muster.

It was only when I crouched to his level that I could make out what he was saying.

""No... a5 isn't in triplicate... have to... redesign entire proprosal..."" The princes eyes furrowed, sweat beginning to drip from his brow. ""Must... convince them to use... plumbing...""

Was... was this idiot having nightmares about paperwork? I would have laughed but honestly I understood the misery of it all. How many forms did I have to fill out everytime someone blew up a room in the labs?

The Archmagos of Belius stared at the tossing form of the prisoner, their crown prince.

As quickly and quietly as I could, I moved my hands through the air, manipulating the magics in the air until a spell washed over the prisoner. The princes eyes relaxed, and his breathing became steady. A dreamless sleep. I refused to look at the guards as I left the prison cell.

His Lord was aiming to become the next King. No one had ever stated they needed to be rid of the prince, and certainly no one was telling him to off him either. Who knows, maybe a well rested prince will be a willing worker.

At least those panda eyes of his would go away if the prince could sleep well. Who knows, maybe a well rested prince would be better than a sleep deprived idiot we currently were dealing with",56
1lq29gi,n11k23e,"When they captured Prince Pietro, they expected nobility. Pride. Maybe tears. What they found was silence.

In the damp cell, he slept like a child. Arms crossed over his chest. Face serene. Almost… content. Every now and then, he mumbled in his sleep. “No more audiences. No more decrees. No more pretending.”

On the third day, a guard stormed in, club in hand, kicking the cell door open. “Alright, prince. Playtime’s over.” Pietro didn’t move. The guard stepped closer. Misjudged his footing. Slipped.

That was his last mistake.

Pietro sprang like a waking serpent. His legs wrapped around the man’s neck. One twist, sharp and sudden, and a crack echoed off the stone walls. The guard twitched. The club dropped. Pietro picked it up slowly, methodically. The man was still breathing, barely. Pietro crouched beside him and stared, like a child watching an insect squirm. “You woke the only man who actually wanted to be here,” he whispered. Then he drove the club into the man’s mouth. Once. Twice. Three times. Until the sound stopped. Until there was only pulp where a face used to be. He didn’t blink. Just licked his lips. Calmly. Deliberately.

The second guard rushed in, sword raised. Pietro hurled the club without looking. It smashed into the man’s knee. He collapsed, screaming. Pietro was on him in seconds, straddling his chest. Two fingers slid into the man’s eye sockets. Pushed until they disappeared into wet, soft darkness. He tilted his head slightly as he worked. Like he was listening to music. “They always said I was dangerous when I got bored,” he murmured. “I guess they were right.”

The last one ran.

Pietro followed, barefoot. Silent. Smiling. He caught him before the stairs. Grabbed his hair. Sank his teeth into the man’s ear and ripped it off. As the man screamed, Pietro crushed his nose with both thumbs. Then drove his head into the stone wall. Over and over. Until everything stopped.
He watched the blood run. Spat out the ear.

“My father never understood,” he said, wiping his face with his sleeve. “I didn’t want the crown. I just needed an excuse.”

Then he walked back to the cell. Closed the door from the inside. Lay down. Folded his arms. And went back to sleep.",17
1lq29gi,n138rye,"I'm the crown prince. My only duty used to be to prepare for marriage. No need for me to ever lift a finger. 

Turns out, being so pampered and so lazy was off-putting to women. But that was fine with me. I was happy to be left alone, and to sleep. 

Until my dad fell ill. Now, he lies in bed, waiting for death. Meanwhile, I handle every royal responsibility I've avoided for 20 years. 

When people think royalty, they think of balls and fancy gowns and ordering people around. 

They don't think of paperwork. Endless. Stacks. Of paperwork. 

The trouble is, to do anything, I need to fill out papers. Royal decrees. Or I have to read papers, which are every bit as mind-numbing. How many times have I had to stare at the budget report, trying to figure out what I could cut so I could afford to give our people what we needed? 

On top of that, I've come to learn my father was an ass. I mean, I already kind of knew that. He was always cold and distant with me. But I mean, he was a *real* asshole. Like, he'd buy slaves so he can take them to a secret lab under the castle and experiment on them. He'd host feasts and balls while the rest of the kingdom was suffering food shortages. But you couldn't complain about that. Anyone he caught complaining about his rule would be taken to *another* hidden dungeon under the castle, to be tortured and eventually killed. Execution was his favorite form of punishing criminals, such that even petty theft was punishable by it if he felt like it on that day. 

We also had a colisseum for gladiatorial combat. He'd host these tournaments to distract people. Force prisoners to all duke it out. Last one standing supposedly gets set free with a clean record, but he'd find and kill that prisoner later on. 

My father didn't care about anyone else but himself. The only reason I say he was an asshole, not that he is an asshole, is because he's physically incapable of doing anything mean anymore. His selfishness left me a lot to clean up after. But I'm working on it. I abolished slavery. I had the lab dismantled and the colisseum shut down. I released prisoners kept there unjustly and started a system of due process. I maintained friendly enough relations with other kingdoms that we don't have to worry about going to war for a while. I got people working and our food shortage is slowly but surely ending. 

But it's not enough. There's always more. Refugees are coming here to escape kingdoms warring with each other. I've yet to find somewhere to house them. My dad's rule created many orphans, especially due to our lackluster medical care. So I need to find funding for orphanages so the kids won't starve. I also need to figure out some way to treat illness. Where's that budget report again? 

How many times have I stared at that damn thing? 

Doesn't matter. I need to look again. 

I wish I could just sell our castle to pay for everything. Then I could be a commoner and never have to read anything ever again. Sure, a life of hard labor isn't fantastic, but I'd take it. 

I let out a wistful sigh, then get back to business. Staring at the budget report. If I could just make one more cut -   

Something stings me. A bee? Whatever. Can't afford to get distracted. Can't . . . afford . . . to . . . 

My vision swims, and suddenly fades to black.",14
1lq29gi,n13bdgt,"I wake up in a cold, dark cell. Everything is dead silent.

I look around for a bit. I start to recognize where I am all too quickly. I'm in the dungeons below the castle. The very ones I had emptied out and tried to get rid of. And as no one's talking right now, I assume I'm meant to sweat here a while. Perhaps panic and demand to be let out? Why am I being held here?

Am I to be a science experiment? No, I doubt that. Others know about the lab and will come looking for me there eventually . . . surely . . . .

I guess I wouldn't have any idea if anyone's trying to save me. I made a lot of enemies but not a lot of friends.

In any case, I think it's unlikely I'm meant to stay in this cell indefinitely. I made a lot of enemies with my recent decrees, but if they captured me, why not simply kill me?

Maybe they want to torture me first?

No, probably not. They went through the trouble to drug me and somehow gently get me down here. They wouldn't do that to torture me. They'd do it to . . .

protect their merchandise?

Am I about to be sold into slavery?

My kingdom recently abolished it, but it's still alive and well in other places. Besides which, we have a thriving black market. Slaves are definitely still illegally sold there.

If my hunch is correct, this could be a golden opportunity for me. I've never been able to break up the various crime rings that make up our black market. Whenever I'd send someone to investigate, they'd never return. This is my chance to finally find out what happened to them definitively. Maybe I could even get my hands on a ledger while I'm there.

It's settled then. I won't make any escape attempts for now. I'll make good use of this time to think of a plan.

Right after I get some sleep.

I lie down on the hard bed that may as well be made of rocks, yawn, and drift off to sleep.

Only to have nightmares about paperwork.",12
1lpv43g,n0yavlg,"I look at him. Curious. He looks at me. Angry.  
I take another bite out of my sandwich and close the door. He keeps yelling something but my full focus lies where i should take the next bite out of my sandwich and I ignore whatever he is yelling.  
Someone as angry as him isn't a bringer of good news. Or solutions.  
It's to early in the day for whatever kind of exchange this would've become.

After I took a short break and checked if this weird man was still somewhere close by - no he wasnt - I went back into my garage to relax. This time though I kept the doors shut. I don't want nor need another weirdo knocking on my door this early in the morning. But now I have to focus, I know I'm not that far away with finishing one of my childhood dreams.

It took longer then expected but here was this strange man again. He was here just three days ago. I really don't want to engange with crazy people. Espacialy those who just shout and make random demands. I just turn of my brain and ignore them. Thinking about it, I really don't even know what he wants from me or where he came from. But that doesn't matter to me. Back to the garage I go.

Today I will finish my project, however long it will take. But first let's power up my little hobby workshop.  
I flick a switch, the lights turn on and I hear a faint electric humming. Once it's gone I open up the dividing curtain in my garage to get more space. Let's get to work.

About five hours later I think I'm done. Time for a testrun.  
I connect a small USB device with the little machine on floor. For now it's just wires and some frames and other stuff put together. It isn't a finished product by all means, but it works and that is the most important thing.  
\- Please select what you want to summon. - the voice from the littel machine chirps.  
A strange voice. My voice. I really don't like hearing my voice. Maybe I should've hired a voiceactor for the lines and commands. But that will be a problem for future me! Now it's time to focus on the present!

\- Please summon B.E. - I tell the machine. Some lights blink, first red then they switch to green. So far so good.  
\- Understood. Summoning B.E. - the little machine confirmed my command. now lets wait.

It was dark outside. Was. Suddenly my little garage lit up as if someone exchanged her for a sun. It was nearly as bright as day for a short moment. Then an explosion. Where my Garage was, now stood a digital dragon. Not just a digital dragon, it was like he was alive. I could hear his breath, his heart beating and see his eyes move around. Perfection. I touch his scales. If feels weird. Like my hand is about to pass through but isn't quite. My skin tickels where i touched his scales.  
Time for a spin.  
Time to show the world that it isn't just a deranged dream.  
Now it's time to introduce Seto Kaiba and his Blue Eyes to the world!

1lpv43g,n0zyzvi,"Looking at the stranger with confusion thoroughly drilled into my mind. ""Yeah. Bolting my door from now on."" Slamming it in their face I do just that turning from them in my robe pondering how they got past the buildings locked lobby doors.

In my living room I looked over the assortment of parts at my disposal. Bits and bobs I'd scavenged from dumpsters. Begged and bartered for over the years. I'd gotten past the planning stage only two years ago. Having built up a ridiculous horde of parts during that time. The prototype looked like a poorly made coffee machine. Over engineered of course.

Checking the UPS, then the cords. A final checklist as persistent banging on the door echoed down the hallways. ""Give it up!"" I growled as I pressed some keys on the computer interface. Everything looked good. No unanticipated spikes in power.

Then it was finally time.

Unable to contain my excitement at the maiden voyage I didn't prepare or enact any basic safety measures, before lifting the protective case. Gripping tightly I pulled the lever. Everything important should have one.

The machine hummed and it vibrated on the floor, my neighbour predictably banging on their ceiling as it did so. I did sound and act an awful lot like a washing machine with a brick in it. 

A bubble of energy slowly worked its way around us as the hum turned to a whine and...

Blinking I looked around. My eyes, slowly adjusting to the new surroundings. It was barren and completely devoid of any visible life. Though it had an atmosphere. Evident by a lifeform resembling a snake violently awoken from its slumber, slithered away.

I dared not drop the barrier but stood up in a joyous, ""Whaaaa hoooo!"" I've done it.

Travel to another planet was no longer years in our future. It was here! In a machine I'd made out of scraps!

I took some time to cuss out some naysayers and critics over the years, as well as astrophysicists and engineers. Before my euphoria ran its course and I gained some sense of equilibrium.

The landscape was orange. Shades of orange and red as the default colour on this landscape. It looked like a desert back home. A few rocks here and there but still similar enough for me to understand.

Then my Uninterruptible Power Supply beeped at me, it had been drained. ""Oh shit.""",46
1lpv43g,n124etr,"The time that Zoe got to spend in the her garage tinkering with different things was time that she cherished, she had always been one to enjoy science in school but then after high school her parents died and she couldn't really afford to go to college and take care of her younger brother, so she sacrificed her dreams to help her brother out.

While she tinkered she tried to create things that would help others out, things that could serve a purpose, but it was also just to get her creativity released before she had to get back to her boring office job on Monday, the only job that a twenty three year old girl could really get that wasn't fast food or retail. As she tinkered with the generator she was building, something that could be used to power an entire neighborhood off just garbage in a small compact from it let out a longer whine and then a hiss before it shot out an entire electro magnetic pulse that flicked the entire city's power supply off, that was until it sputtered to life and slowly the power started coming back on, she had done it, shed created wireless power that was created by garbage. And then she heard a knock at the door. 

Going to answer the door she saw an angry man in a suit with two equally angry police officers at his side. It turns out when you're the epicenter of a town wide EMP someone will notice. ""Do you have ANY idea what you just did?!"" The man exclaimed angrily. Before he noticed that the power was coming back on slowly around the neighborhood. 

""Yeah uh sorry about that."" Zoe spoke, as the man looked astonished. 

""How do you all have power the EMP wiped everything out and fried everything?"" He inquired, the edge in his voice dissipating. It took showing him and then explaining everything and demonstrating to actually get him to believe what happened. From then on though slowly more and more people wanted to get a slice of the cheap power option, which in turn led to a bigger generator and Zoe held all the rights to it, though she wouldn't let that get to her head and only held it so that others couldn't profit off of it. And that was how the country's power grid became reliant on the trash that humans created.",11

""You worry about the invasions, I'll worry about the med-stuff. Wouldn't want to distract you with more things on your mind than you need. The Director wants you focused."" He turned his attention to the clipboard, continuing his scribbles.

I hop off the bed and put my gloves back on.

""What if I lose focus because I don't know all this stuff?""

""Does it affect your combat ability?""

Ugh. ""No, it's just an....interest. Someone's obviously gone through the effort to put all this together to get it to work. Don't think I'm not grateful, I am. I really am. It's just that I've been here, and my friends have been here, in some pretty harrowing conditions. At the end of the day, we all walk back out. But those who get caught with the monsters on the frontlines don't get this sort of stuff. Are we that much more valuable than them?""

He'd stopped scribbling, seemingly lost in thought. But because of what I said. He flipped over the paper, and another, then traced his finger on a line. What is he doing?

""Rose Firelight is your...cousin, right?""

""She is.""

""And your common grandmother was Effy Starborn, yes?""

""Eh, yeah.""

""I see."" He flips the papers back and puts the clipboard facedown on a table next to him. ""You're right to be curious. I've worked here quite some time, and I share your curiousity. It's appreciated, actually. So many like you just roll in, get fixed up and go back out again without a single thought expended on what goes on behind the scenes, the efforts undertaken to make sure you get to see tomorrow, and us alongside you. That said, I recommend getting some audiotherapy sessions. I want to rule out that your last encounter has any major side effects. Azreon was the most significant enemy you've faced in your time with us.""

My eye twitches as that demon's name gets mentioned.

""I don't think I need audiotherapy, I need to get out there and get him before what happened to me happens to someone else.""

He throws his hands up in apparent surrender.

""I can assure you, that mentality is very much what we're looking for. I'm glad to hear you say it. Though I also do hope that you understand that the best way to do that is to make sure that you're not too affected by your encounter with him.""

""I'm _not_ affected.""

He raises an eyebrow at me. I barely even raised my voice.

""Look, if you don't I'm going to have to tell your team captain, and then they're going to be pushing you for it, and then if you don't want to, there will be consequences, escalations. No one wants that. Play along, you'll be out on the field in no time. It's just a box to check on the form for your full release.""

""Can't you just check and it and let me go?""

""Not without risking my job. Are you apprehensive of audiotherapy?""

""It gives me headaches.""

""That is a known side effect with some people with your disposition, but that's good to know. How about this, you get the audiotherapy and I'll get you some extra painkillers and an extra day off afterwards to recuperate?""

""What about Azreon?""

""The Archangels are onto him as we speak. That's all I know about that.""

Great, they won't leave anything of him behind. He's gotta have serious clout if they're being called in though. So much for payback.

A pager goes off on the assistant's belt. Reflexively, he plucks it off his belt, looks, and his eyes go wide.

""Shit. Sorry, sorry, I have to go. Show yourself out and check out at the reception, ok? I'll make the appointment but I have to go-""
He barely finished his sentence before you sprinted out the room, the door slamming in the wall.

The clipboard is there.

I shouldn't. I'm not suppose to see that. It's none of my business. I don't need to read it anyway, I probably won't understand anything on it. What'd be the point? I'd just get into trouble. Not worth it. Medical mumbo-jumbo would just confuse me. Gotta stay focused on the task. Get my priorities straight. Yeah.

I place the clipboard back on the table, grab my stuff and let myself out. There are so many thoughts in my head, bouncing around.
Crystals. Seed crystals. Convert. Melissa. Incidents. 13 months. 161. Mind wipe. Neuro-reconstruction.

In all this, I recall Rose. Cousin, sure, but she might as well be my sister. We became heroes together, on the same day. Before that, I barely knew her, but afterwards, we were inseperable. We got thrust into this position of a strange, new, exciting way to live and all we knew inside those walls back then was each other. One time, while fighting a Scaling Hydra in the Combolto Canyons, I held her as I closed her wounds as fast as I could. Something caught my eye as I looked down. Something shining. I always figured if it was a trick on my mind from the stress, pulling Rose back from the brink of her having been mostly dissolved by acid. She was fine not long after, but now I wonder, was it a crystal? Maybe it was red and I couldn't see it through the blood pouring out.

I look back to ensure no one's following me, or looking at me. People seem to be too busy. Hurrying along, I make my way through the hidden doorway into the hallway of the Doctor's office, which leads out the hospital through several doors. I haven't stopped sweating. The instruction of checking out is buried under the avalanche of intrusive thoughts. It feels like I'm wearing a crown of thorns on my brains, and it's tightening, coiling around, passing through. What did I just read? My hand finds its way to my stomach. Crystals. 

Grandma. Surely she knows. She has pictures of me. Of years ago. I just need to look at them, and then I'll know. I mean, I _know_, but maybe this'll slow down this madness uncorcking in my head. It's one thing for my consciousness to know, but my subconsciousness also needs to be blatantly shown. It'll be good to see grandma, I haven't seen her in a while. The subway station isn't far. I check in with my transport pass, sit down in the first train headed there. Waiting for it to leave is agonizing. I fiddle with my uniform, looking out the window, watching people pass by. Trying to get my thoughts away from what I just read. Should I have listened.

Some person sits next to me. Seriously? The train is mostly empty. I try to catch a glimpse of the jackass who decided to try my luck in my bad mood.

Her bright blue hair matches mine, though hers isn't taken care of properly, looking frazzled and unkempt. She's taller. Beefier, I can tell even through her longcoat that hangs open at the front. Her mouth is covered with some carbonfiber facemask. Her eyes are similar to mine, but tired, with bags underneath them. There's an edge to them, as they look right at me. She looks like me, but there's a bit of Rose in her, too, but none of her kindness.

Something is going to happen. My instinct are yelling at me to transform. I gently move my hands into starter formation, before I realize she's doing the same thing while maintaining eye contact. I stop, and she stops. We both hold, waiting for the first to pop. Behind her, people move past to take their seats. The train car is filling up, no one any wiser on the standoff I've found myself in. She doesn't let up, doesn't flinch. What is happening?

An old man walks into the car, his crooked wife right behind him. He sees us and stops, intrigued. I look at him as if to plead him to back the fuck up. To stay back for his own good. But as I look away, she flinches.",22
1lqc76n,n12bnf0,"Cloaked, towering, with me wagon I travel the world, to sell bread.  
I sleep in the open singing to the birds, and animals, avoiding any sounds of battle.  
I hate waagh. I want peace.  
But, why can't Duomo get it?  
I look at the bandits tying 2 sharp-ears to a tree, and laughing badly.  
Duomo must help them, even if I don't like battle.  
""Stop."" I say, maybe a bit too loudly, and the men freeze.

  
""Who are..."" one of them growls, turning around, and then pales.  
Human men...almost worses than orcs.  
They stutter looking at me, maybe they young?  
They barely reach Duomo's knees.  
""L-leave!"" I say, maybe a bit too weakly, but it works.  
They run away.  
Duomo then frees the sharp ears.  
""You free. Go."" I say.  
They stare at me.

  
""You are an orc, aren't you?"" one of them asks.  
""I leave now. Worry don't."" I say.  
Sharp ears, sharp noses, they always know Duomo is an orc, even when cloaked.  
A bird flies on me shoulders, and the sharp-ears grab my cloak.  
""Wait! We don't mean anything bad!  
You saved us...will you come to our village? We have to show you our gratitude?"" the other one says.  
I nod.  
Maybe I could sell my bread.

  
They gave Duomo a shop!!  
They like my bread, and the sharp-ears are actually nice!  
I don't have to travel anymore, and I can also sleep in the open, because we in the woods!  
A bit strange that the sharp-ears aren't afraid of me, and that this village is only female sharp-ears, but I am happy!  
Duomo not like other orcs, so this won't be an issue.  
Hmph.  
I will now try a new bread I wanted: bread with honey inside!  
I can finally stop travelling, and try new things!  
I think Duomo will like it here...even if the sharp-ears are often clinging to me.",12
1lqc76n,n12hqfu,"The oven had finally come up to the right temperature as the logs turned to ash.  Duomo had spent that time kneading the dough with care, mixing in the crushed walnuts evenly as his large hands worked before letting the dough rest.  The pans were already prepared when he swiftly cut the raw dough into sections and filled each one before sliding his creations into the oven.  After a while, the kitchen began to fill with heavenly aromas as the large orc cleaned up his work space and washed the mixing bowls from the rain barrel he had carried in earlier.

Drying his hands on a scrap of soft cloth, a grin tugged at his lips as he heard the familiar trill of birds as they alighted upon the window sill.  Without looking, he snagged a small handful of crumbs he kept in a jar on the counter.  Moving slowly and deliberately, he hummed softly as he deposited the crumbs before the waiting birds  and the smile bloomed into fullness as the hungry songbirds began to peck at their meal.  It was moments like this that filled Duomo's heart with happiness, unlike other orcs who craved conflict and bloodshed, he preferred peace and tranquility.

A loud, booming sound rolled across the village and the birds took flight immediately.  Duomo knew those were the war drums, calling warriors to arms for an upcoming battle.  A single tear trailed down his flour encrusted cheek as he reflexively glanced at his war axe hanging by the door.  He preferred a rolling pin to that weapon, something his brethren would never understand. More drums sounded, faster and with an increased tempo.  Enemies had been sighted and everyone was to defend the village.  Duomo looked longingly at the oven, his experience telling him that the bread was almost ready to come out.  He debated what he should do when a large crash stopped the furious drumming.

*Whoever they are*, he thought, *must have breached the gates*.

Duomo carefully untied the apron around his waist and started to move towards his weapon when he stopped suddenly and instead turned to the oven.  Pulling open the door, the fresh scent of baked bread filled the room as he carefully pulled the hot pans out and set them on the table, his thick skin preventing any burn.  The crust was the perfect shade of brown, smooth and unblemished.  They were perhaps the best bread he had ever made.  His smile reappeared as he slid one of the loaves from the pan onto the cutting board.  Taking a serrated knife, the one his father had gifted him to saw through bones of fallen enemies, he carefully and surely cut the loaf into clean slices.  I quick dab of butter he popped it into his mouth, chewing slowly to savor his creation.

*Even better than it looked*, he mused.

He took another slice and buttered it fully, intending on spending his last moments enjoying the fruits of his labor.  He was about to raise it to his mouth when a sound from outside the open door caught his attention.  An female elf, dressed for battle and holding a drawn bow, stood there with an arrow ready to end Duomo's life but instead of loosing it, raised her arched eyebrows at the bread in the massive orc's hand.

Duomo pushed the bread forward as if offering it to his race's most hated enemy, nodding slowly.  To his surprise, the elf walked soundlessly into the room, lowering her weapon.  Their hands briefly touched as Duomo surrendered his delicious creation into hers.  She took a small bite, her eyes widening in surprise before taking a larger bite.  Half a moment later, the slice was gone, devoured rapidly.  Her eyes saw the rest of the sliced loaf and the many others still waiting in the pans.  Her voice was clear and musical when she turned her head and declared loudly:

""The one we seek is here.  Our salvation is finally at hand!""",8
1lpyahf,n0yjliz,"""They did it."" the Cherub says.
I sigh.
I look at the souls that still grow in number.
""Did humanity wipe itself out?"" I ask.
The cherub nods.
I snap my notebook close, and the space and time before the pearly gates freezes.
""Now, tell me what did the Council say?"" I ask.
He hesitates.


""The angels think this is Their plan?
By the way, They are still missing?"" I say.
He nods.
I sigh.
""Gather a Saints' Circle for me will you?
Also, call on the Risen Angels, you know? The angels who once were humans?"" I say.
He nods, and flies away.
I look at my notebook shivering...
The souls were trying to come in.
I took the notebook, and left.


Inside a marble hall, we gathered.
Saints and angels that once were humans.
""Why have you gathered us, St. Peter?"" one of them asks.
""Humans destroyed themselves...again.
And the angels this time think that it is Their plan, and plan to do nothing...again."" I say.
The hall erupted in groans, and praying.
""Again?
St. Peter, can we at least this time be direct with our descendants?
This is getting old!"" a saint says.
I shake my head.



""Rules are rules.
If we interfere, we have to redo time until they are back on a path of their own, albeit slightly better."" I say.
They nod.
""Let's do this.
Several billion souls would overwhelm our systems!"" one of the afministrative saints says.
The others also roll up their sleeves.
I open my notebook, and open a portal.
We leave for Earth, ready to save it again.
It will weaken us all for a few centuries, but then...
If we can help...how could we just ignore them?",56
1lpyahf,n11h6vb,"She gestured up towards the other side of the railway and I follow the cherubs gaze. Beelzebub (or Beezy as I affectionately called him) was standing there and he looked... Sallow. When his eyes met mine and there was a panicked frenzy in them, a real storm was brewing. I'd never seen him like this.

He shook his head, then followed it with the a sign I hoped I'd never, ever see - he raised fists from his sides, towards his shoulders like a set of bicep curls, opened his palmed then crossed his arms so the palms touched the opposite shoulders, forming a very clear x with his forearms. My stomach dropped as he then adjusted his arm position to essentially rotated the X to appear more like a plus sign. Things were about to go from bad, to worse. 

Glancing back at the gate, still more souls were appearing. Amongst them I felt a rush of Empaths, Eruidites, Rectitudinals and ascendites. The number of pre-initiates was startling. 

Immediately leaping into action I start barking orders  through a mindwave. ""Broadcasting on a full spectral wide wavelength - Please can all available agents including saints, come to the front gates, immediately. I'm sending the images to Gabriel to forward on to God. Raphael is out of range so Azreal will need to step in for current resident management. Cassiel and Zadkiel - Can one of you PLEASE get hold of Micheal and tell him Peter is calling a code black - He MUST Convene the council straight away. Handiel - Prepare the Empaths for every possible ailment you can and arm the Ascendites with the flame class weapons. Make a barrier formation as quickly as possible up here -  I have no idea if we will need them but we HAVE to get them ready NOW. 

You pause and immediately feel a push back - there was a collective groan and a clamouring of replies. 

""Not another drill Pete, really? "" Grumbled Ellijah
""This IS a drill right Peter?"" asked Grace,
""I'm just at lunch with Thomas and Matthew, can it wait 20 eons?"" Whinged Bartholomew.
Other voices chimed in as well, with similar levels of annoyance.

Desperately trying to stay calm and repress the frustration and fear, so as to not alert the pre-initiates, you open your minds eye for the others to witness the spectacle before you. A wave of shock followed. 

Giving them just a few seconds to process the scene, I looked up again searching the growing crowds both on our side (platform Paradise) and on theirs (platform Brimstone) for signs of Beezy or perhaps even Dante, but I couldn't find them. 

Angels had started zapping in and some of the crowd watched in awe as the new arrivals tucked their wings behind them. I was bombarded with mindwave questions - some were logistical and easy to reply to but most, I just didn't have answers for. 

After what felt like 100 eons, the army of Ascendites began marching into sight. I had confirmation that the blessed souls had been moved well out of harm's way and the Empaths were nearly ready. A quiet, stuttering voice, broke through the cacophony of preparation orders and responses. It was Uriel. 

""Sir, M...Micheal wants to know... D...D...do... we need H...H...Hades or..."" He left the question unfinished.  

""The WHOLE council"" I replied. ""We are going to need God AND Lucifer at the table. Beelzebub was up here and..."" I trailed off. I knew I was getting more than a few raised eyebrows my way. I tried to ignore the looks so swallowed and carried on ""He gave me the sign""  I faltered again. They'd all tuned in now. Taking a deep breath I told them. "" He gave me the Triple C. He did the corners, the cross AND the crucifix"". 

Silence. 

Then, all hell broke loose.",33
1lq263q,n112emj,"Nobody tells you how hard it is to adjust the glow. 

It didn't help that my first time experiencing the glow involved one of the worst hangovers I've ever experienced. My mind came to life before my body and I resolved then and there to keep my eyes closed. The ache over took every bit of me and the blood in my veins slogged through me as if it had been replaced with a toxic bile. And the nausea. The nausea that churned my stomach so violently it would've thrown sailors off of the ships trying to sail it's seas. 

My first thought after assessing my body was that I've finally done it; this would be my first three day hangover. Though that thought was quickly overtaken by a second one; how is it so bright when my eyes are still closed?

And so, with every ounce of strength that remained in my addled body, I bravely opened my eyes.

The pain was blinding at first, shooting its glow straight through my retinas and into my already throbbing brain. I had never been tasered before, but I can only assume this was the psychological version of that. Through my pain came the fear that I was either dead or that I would have my eyes cooked into obsolescence by whatever this light was. 

I groaned in pain as I threw an arm over my eyes. To my dismay, the glow someone became worse. Almost as if the light were coming, at least in part, from the very arm I'd hoped I could use to save myself.

""Poor thing,"" a woman's voice startled me. Who the hell did I bring home last night?

""It took a while, but I managed to find the protective spectacles,"" a man's voice spoke now.

No, really, who the *hell* did I bring home last night?

I felt large hands pull my arm off of my face and then place a pair of glasses over my still closed eyes. mercifully, the glow blinding me even through my eyelids dimmed. For the first time since waking, I opened my eyes to assess the damage of the apparent orgy I'd thrown myself.

Except when I opened them, I wasn't in my bedroom.

Somehow, impossibly, I appeared to be laying in a cloud that was a smaller cloud atop of an endless sea of clouds. As if that wasn't strange enough, I saw the two voices I'd heard were not the only occupants of whatever space I'd found myself in. Before me stood a smattering of people and other creatures in a large horseshoe formation. There were humans both minuscule and staggeringly giant, redwoods and shrubs coexisting as equals, all beautiful beyond reason. Scattered at various intervals between them were all sorts of creatures. Some of which, to my shock, included what appeared to be mythical creatures such as dragons as well as extinct ones. My eyes fell specifically upon what appeared to be a sabre-toothed tiger exuded depthless wisdom. 

And then there was me. Hungover, a certified disaster, who appeared to be emitting the bright light that plagued my hungover eyes. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd died, if the nukes had finally launched and I was now bathed eternally in a radioactive glow. The fear that I had died was quickly replaced with the horror that the afterlife was shitty enough to have me retain my hangover upon entering it.

""When's he going to say something?"" a hummingbird fluttering next to the ear of a towering old man asked. How a hummingbird spoke and how it spoke so loudly that I could hear it clear as day was just another thing to add to the list of mind-boggling confusion I was rapidly adding to.",17
1lq263q,n12s1bv,"You want to know how I became a god ?

Right. Okay. Well, brace yourself, because I have no idea.

---

If you’d told me, back when I was eight and collecting my third degree, that one day I’d be a god, I’d have told you that was terribly inefficient.

Godhood? Infinite life, infinite responsibility, no work-life balance. It sounded exhausting. Not that I knew what “life” was, really. 

---

Let me rewind.

I'm **Lucian Vale**, first god to ascend in millennia. *Apparently.* Also, former CEO of about nine hundred companies, inventor of two cryptocurrencies and one universal food printer, and the richest person in recorded human history.

I was born rich. *Not* ""Ferrari for my birthday"" rich. More like “My parents bought a Pacific island for our dogs” rich. Legacy of a trillion-dollar empire. Microchip pharma. Planetary mining rights. The whole dystopia starter pack.

For the first twenty-five years, life was a sequence of quarterly goals, merger deals, and my parents’ quiet pride. They called me a genius from the moment I spoke in full sentences at age two. Graduated university at eight. Designed orbital economic simulators by ten. By twenty-five, I’d doubled the family fortune. My parents were proud. I was miserable. I was the heir to the biggest fortune ever assembled, and I was supposed to turn it into something even *bigger*. End of story.

Then my parents went up in a private rocket to look at the stars and didn’t come back. 

Space tourism, they called it. 

The moment the floor dropped out from under me, the moment they said ""seatbelts optional"", I called it. 

I didn’t cry.

I didn’t *feel* anything, honestly. I just… stopped.

For the first time in my life, no one told me what to do.

And that was terrifying.

No more quarterly goals. 

No more quiet nods of approval from across the dinner table.

I’d won the game I never chose to play, and there was nobody left to tell me what came next.

---

So I did the only rational thing: I tried living. For the first time.

Started with doing things *they’d never let me do.*

I backpacked through cities where nobody cared about my name. 

I rode trains just to watch the world blur by. 

I hiked across Nepal. 

Got stung by jellyfish in Australia. 

Got food poisoning in Italy. 

I gave away more money than my family ever spent hoarding it. 

Schools, clean water, free clinics, you name it. 

Started a charity in Nairobi and actually *worked* in it, digging wells with my own two hands. 

The staff didn’t recognize me at first, which was refreshing. 

No bowing, no yes-men, no headlines.

I learned how to dance in Brazil. Badly.

I gave away islands. Canceled a trillion in debt with one signature. Got into street graffiti, started writing poems on walls in Detroit. Tried karaoke. Cried at karaoke.

I crashed in hostels, took cooking lessons from street vendors, washed dishes in a soup kitchen.

I wanted to feel useful without the weight of an empire strapped to my back.

---

And when that wasn’t enough, I threw parties. For orphans, for strangers, for the staffs who used to polish my floors and bow when I walked by. Endless, ridiculous parties, just so people could laugh. So *I* could laugh. So I could finally see what “joy” looked like when it wasn’t attached to a line item on an annual report.

The more I tried, the more I felt… *human.*

---

But I never really *let go*. Not fully. Not until the night I decided: I want to know what it feels like to be *completely* irresponsible. I decided: **I want to know what it’s like to be absolutely blackout drunk.** 

Not tipsy. 

Not socially lubricated. 

I wanted to get *obliterated*, to not think, not plan, not strategize. 

Just *feel* something stupid and wild. 

Just *once*.",9
1lq263q,n112fc9,"""Hush,"" the old man replied. ""The first words a God speaks are theirs alone, we cannot rush nor prompt them.""

A what?

Okay, so maybe I'm not dead. I clearly must be in a coma or some profound state of alcohol-induced psychosis. We all can have a bit of an ego, I won't pretend I'm any different, but for my mind to be producing some sort of fever dream where I'm a god is really something else.

""Umm,"" I stammered, immediately disgusted by the stale tang of my hungover mouth. ""Where am I?""

Silence. They all stared at me. I stared back. Then, suddenly, a roaring sea of laughter. They all shook with it, causing claps of thunder to echo through the clouds and lighting to light up the skies behind them. The spectacle certainly did not help my hangover and certainly added to my confusion.

""I see now!"" the dragon managed to say through fits of laughter so powerful it caused fire to flare up in its nostrils. ""A God of jest has ascended to our ranks! How befitting! I have grown tired of Ser Lyam's wisecracks, the fates knew we needed such fresh air.""

""HERE, HERE!"" the crowd of... Gods? shouted in approval.

""We greet you, young God,"" the woman whose voice I'd first heard spoke now as the laughter and celebration died down. ""Tell us your name and regale us with the tales of jest so wondrous as to deem you the first worthy of ascension in so many millenia."" 

Imposter syndrome took on a new meaning. I remembered the time I'd lied about having waiting experience and dropped a full tray of wine glasses on my first day. That was imposter syndrome. This is something closer to sheer panic. What would happen if they found out I was just a person? An incredibly regular person? Would I be thrown from these clouds like the useless brick I am? Smitten on the spot? All I knew was I had to say something before I evaporated under so many expectant eyes.

""My name is Brad,"" I stated. Curse my parents and their inclination towards mainstream names. ""The last thing I did before ascending was go to my friend's birthday at a karaoke bar.""

""A what?"" another God asked. ""I am familiar with taverns, but what is this kerry-okay you speak of? 

""It's where you sing,"" I explained tentatively. ""But other people's songs. We call them covers.""

""NOT A JESTER!"" the dragon shouted again. ""A BARD OF THE MODERN ERA.""

""BRAD THE BARD! BRAD THE BARD!"" they all began chanting again. 

""Brad the Bard, yep,"" I repeated, though my words were drowned under the cacophony of their cheers. All I could do was hope they didn't ask me to sing anytime soon.",14
1lq263q,n12s25i,"So I found a dirt cheap bar in a nowhere city, no cameras, no bodyguards, no “Mr. Vale, your suite is ready.” 

Just a barstool, cheap shots, and a promise I’d never made myself before: *Tonight, you don’t have to remember tomorrow.*

---

So I did it.

I remember the first drink. The warmth in my throat. I remember laughing until my ribs hurt, at what, I couldn’t tell you. 

I remember a drinking contest with a goat. I remember trying to bless someone’s dog by tapping it on the forehead with a martini glass. 

I remember screaming “**ABUNDANCE FOR EVERYONE!**” and flinging cash into the wind, and someone shouted, “Is he glowing?”

Then the lights in my mind flickered out, like someone switching off the boardroom lights after a meeting.

Total darkness.

---

I woke up floating.

Literally.

In an endless starfield, warm and vast and *drunk.* The space itself buzzed with tipsy laughter and the scent of jasmine and rum. I was glowing gold.

And surrounded by thousands of people on their knees, shouting prayers I didn’t understand. Flowers. Offerings. The works.

“Lord of Endless Elation!” they cried. “Patron of Abundance! Master of the Bottomless Cup!”

A voice, not quite male, not quite female, whispered in my skull:

*""Welcome, Lucian. You have ascended. You are now the God of Endless Elation and Abundance.""*

Apparently, the universe took me literally. In my blackout haze, I must’ve stumbled across some ancient leyline, or primal ritual, or maybe the cosmos just took pity on the world’s loneliest billionaire and gave me the only promotion I didn’t ask for.

Since then?

Well.

Mortals pray to me now. Not like “please smite my enemies” kind of prayers, but stuff like:

* “Let me have one night of real joy, Lord Elation.”
* “I wish I could share this meal with the world.”
* “Thank you, Drunken One, for that extra paycheck. I don’t know how it happened.”

I don’t smite. I don’t judge. But I do *bless.* Spontaneous laughter in traffic. Sudden acts of generosity. Unexplainable pizza deliveries to starving artists. That feeling of dancing in the rain with no shame? That’s me.

Some gods inspire fear. Me? I inspire *release.* Joy without guilt. Giving without debt. Celebration without occasion.

And yes, I still get *very* drunk from time to time.

---

So… how did I become a god?

Honestly ?

I don’t know. 

Ask the bartender. 

Ask the gods who came before me, if you can find them at all, as they haven’t answered in millennia.

Maybe they were waiting for someone like me. 

Maybe the universe got tired of watching uptight immortals with cosmic grudges and thought: *You know what? Let’s give it to someone who actually learned how to live.*

Someone who once ruled the world’s wealth… and decided to give it all away for the sake of a genuine laugh.

Someone who’d spent a lifetime hoarding wealth, only to fling it at the world like confetti.

Someone so desperate to feel something real that he cracked the veil between man and myth, one shot at a time.

I’m the first new god in an age. I didn’t get here through meditation on a mountaintop or a thousand years of fasting. I got here by pouring a round for everyone and finally pouring one for myself.


I may have been blackout drunk, but I meant it when I yelled: *“ABUNDANCE FOR EVERYONE!”*

And apparently, the universe was listening.

And you know what ? I think they chose right.

So go on, have another. Drink deep. Laugh harder. Be kind. Be reckless with your joy. If you wake up tomorrow with your pockets lighter and your heart heavier, come find me. My temple’s always open. The cups are always full.

I’m the Drunken God, after all.

And trust me, there’s enough to go around.",11
1lq6mmn,n10lucp,"""God DAMN.""

I let out a long, slow whistle as I unroll the scroll I've pulled out of Alluwin's bag. Dust falls with each extension of the parchment. The ink is faded but still legible, revealing incantations that have not been heard in this world for at least two hundred years.

""You are so fucked if they find out you have this. Why didn't you turn it in when they were being gathered?""

""I'll have you know I am not in the business of complying with the authoritarian nature of government ruling,"" Alluwin spoke in defiance as he examined a seemingly unimpressive shell through a monocle he held to his eye. ""I'll also have you know that I was unaware until now that I was in possession of that spell.""

""If you're ever audited,"" I say as I let the scroll spring back into its curled up state. ""Let's just say they'll be giving you the Salem treatment.""

Alluwin tosses the shell over his shoulder before turning to give you a deadpan stare.

""The precious government and their meticulous documentation of all things magical will be the first to be able to remind you that I, Alluwin of Everglade, have never been successfully burned. Nor drowned. Nor starved. Nor flayed. Nor hung. Nor stoned. Nor guillotined. Nor felled by an arrow. Nor -""

""Yes, yes, we all know how incredibly powerful you are,"" I wave his words away and pull another random prize from his bag. To my dismay, I find my hands coated in a thick syrup-like substance paired with a rancid smell that is being urgently secreted from every pore of the gelatinous creature I have pulled out. ""What the fuck is this thing?""

Alluwin turns his attention towards me and breaks into a gummy grin. You'd think that for all his infinite magic that he'd maintain a full set of teeth, but he claims that to be slightly off-putting is actually quite freeing.

""Bloppy!"" he cries and snatches the creature from me. The creature begins emitting a sort of gurgling purr as Alluwin pinches at the various folds of... whatever the substance making up Bloppy's epidermis is.

""I take it you two know each other.""

""Oh, yes, yes,"" Alluwin replies, never removing his attention from this 'Bloppy'. ""An old flame of mine from my college years. Oh, do forgive me for losing you in there, Bloppy, I hope that you were able to keep yourself amused amidst all the bips and bops to be found in my bag.""

For a moment, I consider giving in to my downright profound curiosity. To inquire about the mechanics of their relationship would have likely only resulted in me trading my confusion for a previously unimaginable degree of disturbance. When you befriend someone who is a bastion of endless knowledge, you will quickly learn just how true it is that sometimes ignorance is bliss.",15

She kisses me.
""Now stop the exposition of your backstory, and make the salad, as I check on the chicken."" she says, laughing.
I nod, and go for the olive oil.
She might be right...I shouldn't focus on what could go wrong.",6
1lpvafh,n0ydeb3,"\[Truth & Love\]

And there it was. Dee, Ray's fiancée, stared at him as she adjusted her stance. She shifted her weight to one leg and crossed her arms; she wasn't leaving without an answer. 



""Babe..,"" he tried to put it off so he could have some time to think about it, but she shook her head. 



""Don't 'babe' me! You think I haven't noticed your little disappearances and side quests? Running around without the supposed love of your life, doing god knows what? It's a simple yes-or-no question. I don't want to hear your stories or excuses."" 



""Didi..,"" he tried a pet name, and her glare grew colder. He could answer 'no', and it would be the truth. But it would ruin everything for everyone involved. If he said 'yes', the wedding was over and the woman he loved would leave him. No matter what he answered, she would believe him, because that was his particular ability. It felt like a curse early on, but he got the hang of it. He tried not to use it too often and kept himself decently honest. 



He'd met a nice woman, then fell in love. He tried opening up about his powers to her, but there was no way to convince her. Only lies were translated to belief, and the truth could be ignored freely. He tried examples, but his ability was too powerful.  Anything he convinced her of was just something she'd always felt.  The sky was always green, and she started to panic until he told her it was always blue again. But, now he was backed into a corner. For the first time, possibly ever, he actually needed to lie to keep everyone happy. It wasn't even a major lie, more akin to a surprise birthday party than a torrid affair. Part of him was glad no one was around to overhear the conversation. It would've been easy for anyone to assume the worst of him. It wasn't a major lie, but it was an important lynchpin for giving her the wedding of her dreams. He had no choice but to lie, and resorted to one of his more underhanded tricks to avoid answering the question he really didn't want to. 



""I don't know...,"" he said. Her face softened immediately. 



""You don't, do you... oh my god I'm sorry!"" she rushed over to hug him.  ""I'm just so stressed about the wedding. Every detail is super huge and important and I'm overanalyzing things again...,"" 



""I don't know what you're talking about,"" He chuckled. ""You must REALLY be stressed, because you never overanalyze things like that.""  It was another lie, but that was one he'd been wanting to work into the conversation for a while. 



""Yeah, you're right,"" she nodded. ""I can't wait till it's finally over and we can relax as husband and wife."" 



""It'll be the most wonderful feeling ever,"" he said as he held her close. 



""Liar,"" Dee rolled her eyes at him, but smiled. She could always tell when he was just fibbing for fun. It usually came with a big smile from him that grew a warm feeling in her heart. And, she was feeling lucky that he'd always been completely honest with her.

1lpvafh,n11t5ik,"""So, what's your name?""

Your skin turns clammy. She's just asking your name--shouldn't be a big deal. Still, you always dread this moment, and no amount of therapy has helped. ""Uh... Johnny?"" you reply, giving her your most ""Johnny"" smile.

She cocks her head, frowns at your nametag.

You forgot about the nametags. Damn these work functions.

""You know, like Johnny Bravo,"" you add. ""Ever watch that, as a kid? Pretty cool guy, Johnny Bravo.""

She's still looking at your nametag. She's set her napkin of crudités down, as if doing so might aid in her scrutiny of your nametag. 

You plow ahead. ""Johnny Carson, too,"" you add. ""Some would call him the most influential talk-show--""

""How do I pronounce that?""

""Pronounce what? 'Johnny?'"" You give her your most ""Johnny"" chortle as the hired jazz band continues tuning their instruments. She's still looking at the tag. ""It's a fairly standard name, 'Johnny,' but I like to give a little more emphasis to the J at the beginning. Sort of to set expectations for the rest of the name, you know?""

""Is that Gaelic or something?"" She smiles at your nametag. ""You know, on my mother's side, I'm actually part--""

Better nip this in the bud. ""Johnny Cochran, too,"" you add. ""Some would call him controversial, but I'd say he represents a sort of turning point in America's understanding of--""

Before you can continue, the bassist calls out from the stage. ""Hey Johnny! Any requests?""

The whole room's looking at you. Even Mr. Henderson.

You forgot how loudly you speak when nervous.

""Yeah, Johnny!"" Marie in accounting calls. She also sets down her crudités. ""What should they play?""

You smile at the apparent potency of your magic, this spell you've never fully understood. Now you are become Johnny, enjoyer of corporate functions.

Still, as the music swells at your command, you feel an ache unlike any you've felt before. A sense of loss for the name that never was, your history hastily erased. So what if it was hard to pronounce? It was your father's name, and his father's before that. 

Just then, you get an idea. You raise your champagne. ""I'm not currently experiencing the complex emotions of cultural assimilation!"" you cry.

The crowd cheers.

You cheer, too.

1lpr55b,n0wz56v,"He wasn’t sure of the exact moment he figured it out.

It wasn’t a dramatic revelation; there was no lightbulb flash or metaphorical curtain yanked open. Just a slow, creeping certainty that revealed itself to him across several months. The oddly timed thunder when he cried. The perfect lighting in his bedroom. The way people lingered around corners, just long enough to hit their mark.

Eli was the star of a hidden camera show.

Had it been going on his whole life? Or was it a recent development?

He had no idea. But one thing he wasn't going to do was give himself away. Not yet. First he needed to find out who his friends were. 

And so he still laughed at his best friend's jokes, still kissed his wife, and still watched his favourite shows on TV.

But beneath the façade, he was watching. Learning. Growing.

A few weeks later, he was laying in bed, trying to reason himself out of it, trying to be logical, trying to be rational, when he finally heard them; two voices in the vent above his bed.

“…ratings are in the toilet.”

“Network says two weeks max unless something big happens. Drama, scandal, something. He’s just…kinda boring.”

Kinda boring?

Eli stared up into the vent for a long time, not moving. Not blinking.

That confirmed it.

By morning, he had a plan.

He didn’t go to work. Didn’t even call in. It was all fake anyway. Instead, he spent the day sitting on the living room floor, cross-legged, watching the door, waiting for them to come. The TV was off. His phone was off. His expression was perfectly calm.

Around 3 p.m., the mail slot clinked open. A small thud. Letter.

Eli didn’t move right away. He just smiled.

He stood, walked over, and picked up the envelope. Plain white. No return address.

He opened it carefully and pulled out the single sheet inside. One of those fake coupons for a pizza place he’d never heard of. 

Perfect.

He walked to the kitchen, his fingers trembling as he took out the largest kitchen knife he owned. 

With a deep breath, he slit the pad of his left index finger, the blood flowing forth. On the back of the flier he wrote carefully, neatly, in blood.

“I know you’re watching.”

He held it up to the cameras in each corner of the kitchen, and suddenly, the creeping static feeling living between his ears was dulled, the multitude of voices that guided his consciousness silenced, no whispers in the vent, no phantom cues curled behind everyday noises. Just a clean, expansive quiet, as if someone had finally turned off a humming fridge he’d never noticed until it stopped.

He smiled to himself, looking at his smeared blood on the page and imagining the boost in ratings. Who was boring now?

He grinned. 

He felt much, *much* better.",76
1lpr55b,n0zf17b,"I would argue that the success of the show depends on the immersion of the subject believing it's real. If the subject knows it's not, I'm not sure why people would tune in. At least, it would seal that there would be an end to the show.  
  
I think it would be interesting to explore why the subject would want the pretend world to continue. What would he gain from a continued fake world?",15

""Could you please repeat the question?"" I say.  
The recruiter nods.  
""Would you work with aliens? Especially non-humanoid once?"" she asks again.  
I sigh.  
So I understood correctly.  
I nod, nonetheless, the money here is great.  
She smiles.

""Great!  
One more question! How well versed you are in mythology?"" she asks.  
I shrug.  
""Liked Greek, and Norse mythology.

Any questions?"" she asks, as a phoenix flies over us...  
I shake my head, sit down, and start reading the guide.

I sigh.  
I just told them the Rules of the Woods, and like many other tourists, they think we are paranoid.

As a Giant, I am a guide, and a lumberjack in the town.  
I lived my life in the Woods, and yet...  
I am still fidgety whenever I have to go in here.  
Because I know the truth...human do be walking sometimes here.

  
The shadows flicker around the golden flames of the dragons.  
I put it out.

It attracts them!"" I say.  
They laugh.  
""Humans are a myth! As if the world is bigger, and there is a part where magic is destroyed, and ""humans"" with no magic rule it."" a young dragonness smirks.  
They are literally in humanoid form, I am a humanoid...why do they...  
I see lights, and those are not from Will'o'Wisp spells...

  
""Shh. One by one follow me.  
We are going back to the Town."" I say.  
Before the dragons could answer, we hear a loud boom, and in the distance, a poor deer cries out.  
""What's that? Bigfoot?!"" voices shout, as I see figures approaching us.  
""Follow me!"" I shout, as we ran towards the Town.  
From behind us, taunting shouts, and random names were called out.  
Damn it!  
We were on the official trails, we didn't really talk, and it is the middle of the day!  
After what seemed eternity, we got back to the town, and the shouts stopped.  
I looked at the terrified dragons.

  
""Are you alright?"" I ask.  
They all nod, except the young dragonness.  
She lifts her dress, to show her thigh bleeding.  
""T-they can hurt us? T-they are real?"" she stutters, clearly in shock.  
I take her to a druid, and hope for the best.  
And then...stop the Wood tours, for as long as needed.  
I go out for logs, and herbs, and our hunters as well, but we are careful, and we follow the rules.

1lpjuvg,n0vw3uc,"The first glimpse of how things are in the Woods i got when i was 5. I still remember the events of this trip as clear as if all of it happened yesterday. We were camping with my family because of the special occasion. My older sister Emily was finally able to walk, after being bedridden for almost 3 years. The original plan was to stay there for 2 nights and 3 days. 

The day we arrived, Emily told my parents that she had this uneasy feeling. My mother however, having used to looking on things with rational persepctive, brushed it off by saying that the reason she feels this way is because she’s simply not adapted to the environment yet. I wish that was the case. Dad on the other hand was completely preoccupied with setting up the camp, so he wasn’t really paying attention, which resulted in him never forgiving himself over it.

First day went relatively fine. Outside of hearing a couple of strange sounds, that is. What bothered me, was the fact that those sounds wasn’t feeling like they were made by animals. Some of them were close, the others were farther away, but all of them were quiet. Suspiciously quiet. Almost as if we wasn’t supposed to hear them. Now that i think about it, maybe they were warning sounds. I kept wondering, how things could’ve turned out, if we payed more attention to them and headed back. I guess i’ll never know the answer.

I remember first night being strangely soothing. Somehow i had a very deep sleep, despite the problems i had with my sleep for the past couple of weeks. That was yet another strange thing left out of our view. When i spoke to my dad about it, he simply said that it’s a good thing, since now we are ready for some fishing at the nearby lake.

Emily and mom decided to stay at the camp. By the time me and dad prepared all of the necessary equipment and headed out, it was already past 1pm. Hours flew by, as the sun kept getting lower and lower. And since it was winter, the sunset was approaching rather rapidly. As soon as it started getting darker - dad decided to head back. That was another instance of something being off. The trail we used to reach the lake was gone.

We ended up wandering in the darkness for at least 2 hours. Thanks to the headlights we had, we somehow managed to return safely. Or so we thought. At first glance everything was normal, mom alongside with sister were sitting by the campfire, patiently waiting for our return. We had a little chat, and even managed to joke about us getting lost, considering that the lake is no more than a kilometer away. Then we had a dinner, and after our usual loud laughing and chatting with my sister - we went to beds. 

That night was the moment it happened. At the moment we had 2 tents. One for me and my sister, and the other one for mom and dad. At first everything was as usual. I had no idea that the good sleep the day before was the last time i was able to sleep peacefully. This night ended in nothing less than a nightmare.

I think it was around 2AM. That was the time when something interrupted my sleep. I opened my eyes, but to my surprise - i couldn’t move, i couldn’t speak, i lost control of my body completely. I could still hear and see, but that was it. And so after my eyes adjusted to the darkness, that’s when i saw Emily, standing in front of the tent entrance, slowly unzipping it from the top to bottom. I tried to do something, but it was useless, my body wasn’t moving.

That’s when i heard it… “Emily” echoing deep inside the woods. “Emily, come to us” the voices were quiet, yet very clear to understand the words. They were the reason she was awake. They kept calling, up until my sister stepped outside of the tent. When she did that - i realized that the campfire was no longer burning. There was no moonlight, it was pitch black. Then the voices got louder. “Emily, come here”. I heard brunches cracking behind our tent, there was no mistaking it - someone was here. 

It was the last time i saw my sister. Emily disappeared out of my view, leaving the tent open. I could hear her going around the tent. Next thing i know - everything went quiet. I desperately tried to scream, i wanted to do SOMETHING. I think i managed to shake my body, and thanks to the coins i always carry in my pockets, i was able to make some noise. Dad woke up and rushed out of his tent, only to see our own tent open, with only me laying inside. I think he realized what was going on, so he immediately woke up my mom, and told her to make a fire again, while he was looking for Emily.

He took his flashlights and went searching, only to return alone in the morning completely devastated. He said that the best thing we could do was head back and make a police report. And so we did. But in the end - the searching group couldn’t find anything. They even said that there was not a single trail we mentioned in our report. In fact, none of the description of our campsite was matching with what they saw, they said. 

Everything ended up with some people calling our family crazy, some went as far as to say that it wasn’t an accident. Things got so ugly with all the rumors, that they resulted in my mom shutting off and never leaving the house again, and my dad bearing the grudge of what happened until his very end. As for me, there is only one truth - there are Humans lurking in the Woods.",33
1lpjuvg,n15kpbt,"\-Fine, but be quiet. And silent -Moran nodded and followed Erlin’s lead. They sneaked out of their wooden house and took the path towards the house where Donnath lived with his family. The road was illuminated with tall torches stuck into the ground, and the boys hugged the shadows as much as they could.

Erlin didn’t even realize how far they’d crept from home until the chill of the wind bit through his thin shirt. Ahead, Donnath’s house sat quiet, but the door was ajar, flickering with lamplight. He hesitated, then pulled Moran along. He had to see Donnath one last time.  They snuck up close and slithered in like two little critters. The room was empty except for overturned chairs and the scuff of muddy footprints. The raised bed that served as Donnath’s feretory was empty, but for the flowers and ivy he was laid on. They froze. Shapes moved in the shadows. Three, maybe four, stooped figures hauling something wrapped in a sheet. Donnath. Erlin felt sick. He nearly called out, but they were already slipping into the dark. The group took the trail in the woods. the one nearly paved with pebbles and marked by paint lines on every third or fourth trunk.

Erlin knew the path well. It was a designated trail, but it was at night. He heard Moran’s breath hitch in fear. But Erlin only felt fire in his chest. He squeezed his brother’s hand and hissed a “come on.” They followed the group. By the one torch their leader was carrying, Erlin could make out that they were as tall as their own adults from the village. They were bipedal and crafty, and coordinated. Whether they were furry or clothed or cloaked, he could not tell in the poor light. He was sure though, he knew what they must be. They were... humans!  
               Erlin tried not to wonder why the *humans* were not doing anything to them. They must have heard their steps, cracking of twigs in the detritus underfoot, the rustling of leaves, and the occasional whispers of encouragement addressed to Moran. The *humans* did not pay them any heed, not even when they were joined by others of their kind, who relieved them of their burden. Nor when they stepped off the designated path, into a less overt track. They just emerged from the cover of the bushes, nodded to the group, and took over the swathed corpse. Moran stopped his wincing. He knew as well as Erlin, that now they’d broken almost all the Rules. All was left was the third rule, Erlin thought to himself. “If you hear someone calling your nam...”

\-Vardan?! -a quivering voice sounded in the dark. Vardan, is that you, my boy? An older *human* approached, turning away from the bodysnatchers, bringing a lantern towards them. Erlin froze in place. Moran grasped his hand hard and whimpered but didn’t try to run or pull him back. The old man came close now, the shades retracting from his face. He looked older than Elder Gorvud, with whiter hair and beard, and more of those deep streaks on his skin.",6
1lpjuvg,n15ks0r,"Erlin stood puzzled, but silent. If the legends were true, the *humans* in the forest would call their names because they would read their minds and extract their secret identity. Yet this one [called]() his brother’s name. The one who looked like him. The one who didn’t much like trekking the forest, not like he did. Did this creature really know him -or his brother- by his face?

\-You’ve grown quite a bit, and you look well -the old man said, his voice expressing contentment.

\-He’s not... -Moran started, but a tug from Erlin stopped him. The older boy didn’t want to reveal his identity, and Moran immediately realized it. He cusped his mouth, preventing any other sound from escaping without his will.

\-Come, you’ll be fine - said the old man. You can follow us.

\-Where are we going? -Erlin whispered

\-We’re bringing Donnath home. I can see you cared about him, so you should know where his grave will be. It will just be over that clearing –he pointed towards a small hill –you'll know it by the carved grave poles. You can come visit anytime in the daylight...

\-His home is in the village! -Erlin’s voice exploded, harsher than he expected. The group raised their heads for a moment but carried on with their haul. The old man flinched at the exclamation, then his shoulder’s dropped.

\-No, my son... -he said in a sad voice. That village is nobody’s home, and that tribe is nobody’s family

\-You’re lying, you’re nothing but a bunch of... *HUMANS! -*tears welled in Erlin’s eyes and anger squeezed his throat. Moran took cover behind his mate. The old man turned around, crouched, and brought the lantern up to his face. The light fell on both of them. 

\-So are you -the old man said drily. Indeed, their faces looked the same, and now that he walked with them, he realized their bodies and gaits were similar too. But that must be a trick, wasn’t it? Erlin mused. He had to admit that nothing felt eerie that night. Bodysnatching and rule breaking notwithstanding, he didn’t feel like he was in danger, or in the presence of monsters.

Suddenly, voices and shouts rose in the distance. It sounded like his name and Moran’s. It came from the village. It was their folk. The old man noticed too. He raised an eyebrow, and looked back to the older boy’s face, studying his features.

\-Wait, you’re not Vardan... You're his brother, Erlin! -his eyes softened and his lips curled into a kind smile. -Tell me, is he well too? Erlin nodded and the old man sighed in relief.

\-Your mother will be relieved to know you’re both well. And you are? –asked the old man turning to Moran. The shouts in the forest answered before he could. *Moraaaan? Errleeeeeen? Wheeere aaaare youuuu?*  The group carrying Donnath picked up the pace and disappeared into the dense foliage.

\-You must go now. We’ll get to meet again, I’m sure -the old man pointed to a bush. Among the cluster of beadlike red berries, a white drop was nestled unassumingly.  -Follow this path and you’ll turn up at the pond by the village. In the morning, you can say you were there.

The boys looked at each other hesitantly. They knew the villagers were the ones calling their names, searching for them, and knew they were in trouble. Even so, the shouts sounded haunting. Rule three: if you hear someone calling your name, no, you didn't...",7
1lq42yh,n1051gg,"I’ve never ascribed to dogma, be it scripture, ideology, or a recognized system of values. The value of a man isn’t predicated by what he ought to be, but is. And in my humble opinion, as one of the former members of the ordained party of adventures sent to slay the demon king, our so-called hero never was one outside the title alone. I’d seen him burn down villages for not supplying us along our journey, rob merchants, and kick a child into the way of an oncoming carriage.

I thought he had died then and there when the arrows started flying from the walls and the town-guard rang the alarm.

To be perfectly honest, I cared little for the hero in the first place; how could I? I wasn’t the priest that Lord Plexus confided his sins in for the undeserved absolution of a repeat offender. Nor had I been his childhood friend that I never learned the name of before he’d been run through by a goblin with a spear. Anyone that did care died on the long journey; as we watched fifty men dwindle to ten; and then nine, as we slipped out through the castle gates with gazes averted from the city’s commoners.

Times were rough as we gathered around the scarce few resources we could gather and discussed the future. We didn’t have a plan per se; just a vague direction, and the notion that if we returned with neither the hero nor the demon lord’s head we’d all be put to the rope.

Thus, the *adventure* continued as we distanced ourselves from our past. It was difficult to rebuild that lost trust; but the work was finally fulfilling, as we could put ourselves to task on the objectives and bounties our former lord considered beneath himself. We did this one step, one swing, and multiple broken limbs at a time. We changed our banners and colors, recruited new soldiers to the cause, and erased what we could and right some wrongs, but history still chased us.

It’s been years now.

The falling rain batters the foliage of the canopy overhead, as I keep my eyes closed and listen to the ambience of the company’s camp. It’s present in the distant thunder, the sound of rolling wagons, and of the tent’s wet fabric blowing in the light breeze. I’m still trying to find that peace that has escaped me as I finally open my eyes and stand upright in the now dented and bent plate armor I’d left the capital in so long ago.

These thoughts were for later.

The supply wagon is late, as I turn my gaze northward, toward human territory, and the wagon train now snaking its way up the muddy trail from further down the mountain. The men riding in the open top carriages are soaked through their red chain mail and fabrics. And while we were now behind our “schedule,” this lapse in organization could easily be forgiven as the lieutenant of the logistics team stopped short of our camp and disembarked from the driver’s seat. The man was quick to cut into a sprint as he waved his arms. “Captain!”

The priest was never like this; but he was now, as I felt the source of unease dictate the speed at which I was now standing upright. Still, I didn’t let it show in my voice, as I’d long since been desensitized to even watching men get butchered inches from my person. “What is it?”

Grange kept the pace, flinging the ankle deep mud behind him before he stopped short, wheezing. “He’s back!”

I responded in kind, as I helped the poor man from sliding around on the wet ground by grabbing his shoulder. “Who’s back?”

“Plexus.” The name sent a chill down my spine, as I looked toward the crown now disembarking with cargo from the caravan.

“Plexus? He’s alive?”

“David, he’s here.” With his good digit, he pointed out the offending would-be hero from the crowd, now making his way over. Despite the many years, and the now feeble body of his, it was more than clear that the guards in Glade had neither killed him nor lopped off an arm and made our lives easier. The concoction of anger and despair from seeing him again boiled into one clear thought.

Oh, fuck not again.

In a knee jerk reaction, I drew my sword; drawing the sound of fresh steel through the air, as the many eyes of the company and busy routines ground to a halt to watch the unfolding confrontation. Still, despite everything, it was the hero’s wide open arms and smile that started the conversation as he spoke over the divide. “Ah; captain, I love what you’ve done with the place!”",6
1lq42yh,n1052sz,"I made my stance clear on his return, as he stepped just close enough to keep my sword to his pale neck. “No, leave, get out of my camp!”

He smiled despite his shock, as he put two fingers on my sword and pushed it to the side. “Now listen here, this–”

I swung for his hand; missing only because of a flash of golden light shimmered into being around his wrist to deflect the blow. “Whoa, easy there; I only want to talk. There’s no need to attack an old friend.”

The arm locking around my right arm was the only thing that kept me from swinging again as the priest grabbed my arm and blurted. “He’s got a letter from the king.”

I felt my unmangled eye twitch in frustration. The same one that’d long ago escaped a slash from his sword.

Plexus pulled the scroll from his pocket and held it up. The mocking sadness of his face and tone made me want to run him through that much more than he grandstanded for the crowd. “That I do, and it says here that I’ve got my old job back. But I’m no fool. I know when I’m not wanted.”

Unceremoniously, he dropped the scroll into the mud, where it slipped between the foul ground. Though my reprieve from the moment was short-lived as he returned his gaze to my person and, for the first time since I met him, spoke with the hateful sincerity of his heart. “I don’t expect you to listen, but I expect you to follow.”",5

How did she...
""So, you have reincarnated or been transfered into my body.
First thing first, keep calm.
You aren't the first, nor the last."" it reads.
How the...what?
""We will get to my predisposition to be used as a vessel in Volume 9: More about The Original Evelyn Janet Green.
Now, let us focus on volume 1."" it continues.
This is creepy.


""On the following 10 chapters, I shall describe all the publicly and privately known information known about me.
Ticks, and small habits, everything.
Let me begin with my behavior with family..."" it starts.
And for 300 pages, I am taught how to be her...this new ""me"".
""Now that you know how to be me a bit...let us start with my family and our world, as it is possible you are not from this world."" it continues.
And for another 500 pages, and continuing in another book, I am introduced to this world.
This is...incredible.


""Last chapter of volume 1: to know how to survive...you have to know why you are here.
And what could be your mission.
Am I a story in your reality? A game?  Do we share names? Are you from a tragic background..."" it lists 398 questions like that.
None fit.
""If none fit, then maybe your soul and skills that it brings to my body are required for a quest in my world.
Wait for a sign that makes it certain that something could be solved by something only you know."" it reads.
I sigh.
Trying to calm down.


""With that, all I can say that if you take into consideration volume 1.
Avoid tropes and high profile individuals when possible...
You should be fine."" it reads.
I smile.
I start to like her.
""Now onto volume 2: powers, tricks, forces, organizations and possible quests."" it reads.
Just the introduction is 900 pages...
Oh boy, she wasn't lying.
This isn't her first rodeo.
""Lady Evelyn...the Master and Mistress await you in the dining hall."" a voice interrupts my thinking.
So, the game begins...
Now.",6
1lpjq3y,n0wkmft,"It was always funny the moment they realised. When parental concern turned to fear. When their adrenaline kicked off and the hair raised along their arms.


Had I been but a few thousand years younger, unacquainted with the *deliciousness* of my current preferred prey, i might have indulged in hunting them.
But they were close to my den and my latest catch would soon awaken. If i wanted to play as i always did, to cultivate fear to its most intoxicating point, i would have to wrap this up quickly.


One of them, smarter or perhaps quicker than the rest reached for his gun. I kept my voice light, childlike when i told him simply, ""If i wanted to hurt you, I could have done so without revealing myself."" 
I let that hang in the air for a moment, let it settle in their brains and he obligingly moved his hand away from the weapon. ""Obliged"" i simply responded before looking over them.

The threads that bound them were colourful. Guardian colours. They wanted to protect people. To save them. No doubt they believed me to be a monster, and to some i was. ""Why are you hunting me?"" I asked. Gentle, non threatening, non accusatory. Just...curious.

""There have been"" a swallow against a dry throat, before one of the hunters finished ""disappearances. In the local town. All signs point to you.""

""Because it was most likely me. But i still dont understand?"" I cocked my head to the side. ""Do you not know who they were?"" Revulsion curled the edges of my expression, ""do you not know what they did?""

The leader of the group, braver than the rest. ""What do you mean?""

I huffed. Hunters. ""Come with me."" I crossed a hand over my heart, ""I promise you safe passage should you not break our peaceful stalemate"" old words, older than even i was. Like ducklings they followed and i led them down, down past the shell of a house. Down the twisting staircase from which none of my prey had ever escaped.
To where my latest victim lay dreaming. 

They seemed concerned to find him in a room of girlish thing. Pastel colours, toy ponies and soft fluffy things. It looked, for all intents and purposes, like a five year olds bedroom. 

They turned to me, confused. I gestured towards the man, ""he thought himself the wolf, but i was no rabbit to be ensnared in his jaws.""

Confusion. Theyd understand. I stepped forward. The plushness of the carpet deadening even the smallest sounds. ""I did not make this den. Not like this. This is where he feels safest. Most in control. It would seem...charming were it not for the cameras.""

I watched that thought hit them. Watched it turn their faces to disgust. Revulsion. I lifted my small petite hand towards my own face. ""This face is not mine. He dreamed of perfect prey. And so that is what i became for him. As i have done for them all. And now he is here."" I let that make me smile.
""He has not shown mercy to your children. Why should i show mercy to him?""

Silence. Those guardian threads. Bright and light. They wanted to protect. But i was like them in a way. I wasnt good. Far from it. But even i had standards. There was a delicious kind of irony in using their perfect prey to devour them. The way their confidence turned to shambles,  power turned to begging. It was delectable. 

""People like this"" i offered, ""these are what i hunt. I have no business with you or yours. I would ask the same of you hunters.""

A choice to be made. They could leave. They could just...walk away.

And like proper guardians. 

They did.

They were here to hunt monsters after all. And this monster was well caught.",179
1lpjq3y,n0wonq9,"I looked at the girl in confusion. She was dressed in a strange assortment of mismatched ragged clothing, none of whiich seemed the right size. Her dark hair was matted but with whisps that looked like someone had made a half-hearted attempt to brush it. Her face had dirt slightly smeared across it.

I gave a hand signal to Tommy who moved carefully into the room, checking doors and corners, ceilings and prodding furniture. Monsters were our profession and we’d all learned the hard way that the vicious creatures could come from anywhere, all furious claws and teeth.

Jan stayed slightly back and off the side from me, her gun pointed at the floor but ready to fire on the girl at any moment if she shapeshifted.

“I’ve met a lot of Monsters kid” I said calmly, keeping a bit of distance. “but I’ve never once had one talk. We thought this place was empty, the town said the woman who lived here reported a monster.”

I had been a bit skeptical myself when we took the job. The Mayor was going off second or third-hand reports from the owner of the place who had left the town in a hurry three days ago. Apparently she’d been overheard declaring that a vicious, evil creature had been controlling her and she’d only just managed to escape.

But when I saw the house the whole story felt more plausible. It was exactly the kind of run down place monsters liked, broken windows and holes in the roof, lawn grown wild and all dark shadows and creaking boards inside.

We’d only made it one room in before we’d encountered the girl sitting in the middle of the floor with a couple of chipped teacups and a headless doll on the floor. She’d stood up but hadn’t moved when we’d entered.

“My mother.” she said in a quiet voice.

I blinked and glanced back at Jan who was also frowning. “What?”

“The woman was probably my mother. She left three days ago and hasn’t come back. She said she wouldn’t, she said she was escaping.”

“She left you here with the monster?” I said, baffled. Monsters sometimes took an odd liking to certain people, leaving them unharmed even as they slaughtered others. Or perhaps she was mind controlled like her mother had claimed had happened to her?

“No” the girl said in that same quiet voice. “I told you, I am the monster. She tells me every day, I’m cruel and evil and vicious, I ruined her life, I’m a monster.” she said the last part in a kind of sing-song voice, as if she was reciting.

""Kid,"" I started, but she shook her head.

""She said if I was good, if I was quiet and stayed in my room and didn't ask for things, I wouldn't be a monster anymore."" Her fingers twisted in the hem of her too-large shirt. ""I tried so hard.""

Jan lowered her gun completely, holstering it with a soft curse.

The girl looked up at us then, and I saw how young she really was beneath the dirt. Eight, maybe nine. ""So you should probably kill me now. That's what you do to monsters, right?""

""Jesus,"" Tommy muttered.

I took a slow step forward, then another when she didn't flinch away. ""What's your name?""

She blinked, as if the question surprised her. ""Rosie. But she usually just called me—""

""Rosie's a good name,"" I interrupted, crouching down to her level. The floorboards creaked under my weight. ""I'm Marcus. That's Jan, and the big guy trying to hide behind the couch is Tommy.""

A tiny furrow appeared between her brows. ""You're not going to kill me?""",96
1lpjq3y,n0vr7k4,"I look at the little girl, and smile.  
""No, no.  
It is theoretically a monster that could end all life!"" I say.  
She nods.  
""Yes, Mr. I know. Me!"" she points at herself.  
I chuckle, but then freeze.  
The little girl just touched a rock...and it grew legs, and a sharp mouth, as it launched at me.  
I couldn't react, but thankfully, the little girl grabbed its tail...and ate it.

  
""See? ithsme!"" she says, chewing that...that rock thing.  
I take a step back.  
""H-How?"" i stutter, pointing my gun at her.  
This feels so wrong.  
""I am Echidna! Mother of monsters.  
Though, Mr. , I have just been reborn, and that's why I look like this."" she smiles.  
I freeze.  
They told us the monster is a newly reborn entity, but this...  
This is not a mere monster.



""You can shoot me, it's not going to work, or hurt."" she smiles.  
I...  
""Oh, you can't because how I look?  
Sorry...it takes some time to grow back to my true self."" she says.  
She's toying with me, isn't she.  
""Sorry."" I say, and shoot her.  
She catches the bullet. Easily.  
Then I watch as the bullet grows wings, and a proboscis, and multiply wildly, sucking a nearby tree dry.  
I start laughing.

  
""Oh, poor mortal...  
Already went insane? Let mother soothe you."" she says, and touches me.  
I want to scream but can't.  
I feel myself dying, my insides boiling, my mind shattering...and then...  
I look down at Mother.  
""Come up."" I say, extending my huge hand, which she climbs, and sits on my shoulder.  
Standing upright, I gaze over the trees, and see the distant town from where I came.  
""Let's spread Mother's love."" I say to her, as I uproot a tree, to use as a walking cane.  
She giggles, and it makes me happy.  
Mother's love is warm, and the world needs to know it.",194
1lpjq3y,n0vigyx,"""I know. Me,"" the little girl said. Wait, what!? How was that little girl- oh. oh no.

  
A couple hours later of running, we looked back to see how far we were, but we were in the same place. Not moving anywhere. The area in front of us started playing tricks on us. So, since we were gonna die anyway, we started shooting at it, and only bubbles went out. We reloaded our weapons, but when we looked at it, our weapons disappeared. There was nothing left. I took one last look at our team, and one look at it. It ha",27
1lpjq3y,n0w731m,"The little girl said “ I know, me.”

The entire squad starts laughing. “Hahahahahahahaha”

Sergeant, “ hold on there little girl, what are you doing out here all alone?”

Monster, “I live here, this is my home “. 

Medic, “Sergeant, let me check the little girl out, maybe she is hurt, maybe she hit her head.”

“Franky, Stevie, Fritz, Pat, spread out, check the area, we got to find that monster!” Sergeant orders.

Sergeant, “Jones get over here, keep an eye on the little girl.”

Jones , “what the freak? Sergeant? She’s a little girl “ 

Sergeant, “who claims to be the monster. So you watch her, while we search for the monster.”

Monster, “ I am the monster “

Jones, “of course you are little girl, know be quiet, the adults are doing important work “

Monster, blinks very slowly. 
The little girl, changes into a very large erect standing white bunny rabbit 6 feet tall with great big jagged teeth, sharp claws on her front paws, long soft ears, fluffy white cotton tail. 
The Monster grabbed Jones by the shoulders and bit his head off. 

Medic , screaming in terror as Monster Bunny, dropped Jones body. 
With powerful back legs, Monster Bunny, leaped into the air. Landing on the screaming Medic . 
Monster Bunny, rode Medic to the ground. Then tore off the medics gear, before shredding the Medic to pieces, with the sharp fore paws. 

Sergeant yelled “CONTACT!!!” , raising his rifle to shoot the Monster Bunny in the head. 
But the bullets bounced off Monster Bunny flicking fluffy fuzzy ears. 

As the other soldiers arrive, they line up and begin firing at Monster Bunny. 

Monster Bunny, jumps into the air. Spins backwards, kicks out a hind leg. A soldier goes flying backwards. Monster Bunny lands on a different soldier. Bits another head off. Jumping in the air. 
Monster Bunny does a backflip with a forward spin , landing a direct head shot to another soldier. Knocking him off his feet. 

Monster Bunny lands in front of Sergeant. Grabs his rifle, throws it away.  Stands before Sergeant, then blinks very slowly. 

Monster Bunny changes back into little girl, with blood covered hands and a blood all over her face. 
“I told you, I am the monster!” Little girl says then smiles. 

The Sergeant cold cocks the little girl, knocking her out. 

Sergeant, “someone get the cage, and find those tranquilizers now!”",26
1lpjq3y,n0zu99c,"She isn't special. Mostly ordinary except the fact that she managed to make her way here - out of all places and night. However she, most definitely, isn't who I'm after. The contrast between her and who, or what, I'm after is far to great. And to hear her say she is... it. That, that, is laughable. So why does the sound get stuck in my through like a chewing gum stuck to a chair?

""Please don't laugh."" She said. 

Her voice soothe my heart beat but doesn't wear off the uneasiness, which I feel. And it is similar to the rhythmatic and steady currents of a calm ocean but carries the childishness of the person it belongs to.

""I wouldn't dear."" I told her, crouching down and panting my hands.

She only smiled. But it wasn't the sweet one of a small child. It was familar because I had seen it before. 

It was a smile of the monster.",10
1lpjq3y,n0wooqp,"""No, Rosie. We're not."" I kept my voice steady, professional. Like I was giving a mission report. ""See, we've been doing this job a long time. We know what real monsters look like. They have claws and fangs and scales. They smell like sulfur or rotting meat. They definitely don't know how to have tea parties with dolls.""

She glanced down at the chipped teacups. ""I was just pretending. That someone would come.""

Behind me, I heard Jan making a call on her radio, her voice low and urgent. Good. We'd need child services, maybe the sheriff.

""Well,"" I said, settling back on my heels. ""Someone did come. Just not who you expected."" I gestured at the headless doll. ""What happened to her?""

""Mother got angry,"" Rosie said simply.

Of course she did.

Tommy appeared in my peripheral vision, shrugging out of his tactical jacket. He held it out to me with a meaningful look. I took it and offered it to Rosie. ""It's cold in here. This'll be too big, but it's warm.""

She stared at the jacket like it might bite her, then slowly reached out. Her fingers barely peeked out from the sleeves when she put it on.

""There's a diner in town,"" Jan said, rejoining us. ""They make good pancakes. Real maple syrup, not the fake stuff."" She looked at me over Rosie's head. ""Sheriff's on his way. Twenty minutes.""

I nodded. ""You hungry, Rosie? We've been out here all morning and I could use some breakfast. Job's done anyway.""

""The job?"" She pulled the jacket tighter around herself. ""But you didn't find the monster.""

""Sure we did,"" Tommy said gruffly. ""Found her three days ago when she ran out of town.""

Rosie's face went very still. Then, so quietly I almost missed it: ""Oh.""

We waited while she gathered up the headless doll, cradling it carefully in the oversized jacket. She looked around the room once, at the peeling wallpaper and water-stained ceiling, the broken furniture pushed against the walls.

""I don't have to come back here?""

""No,"" I said firmly. ""You don't.""

She nodded, a tiny motion. Then she looked up at me with those too-old eyes. ""Do pancakes really have blueberries?""

""We'll make sure they do,"" Jan said, and I caught the roughness in her voice.

As we walked out of that house, Rosie between Jan and me, Tommy bringing up the rear, I thought about all the monsters we'd hunted over the years. The thing is, we'd gotten pretty good at killing the ones with claws and fangs.

The other kind—the kind that looked human, that had daughters and left them behind in rotting houses—those were harder to stop.

But looking down at Rosie, taking her first tentative steps into the sunlight, I figured maybe we'd managed it this time.

The jacket pooled around her feet as she walked, but she clutched that broken doll like it was precious, and when Jan asked if she wanted to ride in the front of the truck, the tiniest smile flickered across her face.",112
1lpjq3y,n1350fb,"Thank you! I also felt like it would make a great kinda prologue for a tv show! Like the next scene is 10 years later, Rosie is determined to join the monster hunter trade and Marcus is dead against it but she persists and Tommy and Jan talk him around and they fight monsters while living their lives.",9
1lpjljk,n0vii7d,"Draugnir the Dreaded, Woe of a Thousand Kingdoms, Crown of the High Winds, pawed at the massive pile of coins in his lair. Thanks to his psychic magic, they wouldn't move, but the moment he let up, they would surely be carried away. His eyelids drooped, and then shut for just a brief moment before he forced himself back awake. 

As a dragon, he didn't actually need sleep, but when one is immortal, they crave respite from consciousness every now and then. And right now, he very much needed a nap. But of course, he couldn't.

He studied the tiny grimoire sitting on the floor of his cave. Though it was comically small in comparison to the massive dragon, his excellent vision still allowed him to make out the words and images. He carefully raised a claw to turn the page.

Then, a pebble socked him in the eye, bouncing off of the hard carapace around his pupils. Draugnir's eye twitched as a dozen more pebbles ricocheted uselessly off of his impenetrable hide. He smashed his tail into the ground in irritation, and the planet shook in fear of his wrath.

Yet, the pebbles did not stop. Another one almost clogged his nostrils, but it narrowly missed.

""Will you all PLEASE SHUT UP?!"" Draugnir bellowed, slamming his tail into the ground over and over again. ""You burn down ONE HUMAN VILLAGE and suddenly you all dedicate your afterlives to harassing me?!""

The Wraiths that flew about spoke in a language unknown to him, unable to communicate beyond the poltergeist behavior they were already exhibiting, but based on the sudden increase in pebble-throwing, Draugnir knew they were somehow offended by his rage. Every single other species, humanoid or not, would just die normally. But of course, for some Gods-given reason, the squishiest of them all just happened to receive a boon that made his life a living hell. Apparently, none of his other Primordials decided to TELL HIM THAT! 

But he supposed that made sense. Primordials rarely moved, and when they did, they had much, much better things to do than squish a few humans. Besides, the little bastards were both relatively new to the biosphere and rare, weaving between the tiny little nooks in mountains and such, so it was likely none of them had even encountered one throughout their long lives.

Draugnir sighed, clamping the book shut and storing it in his pocket dimension.

The Primordial Dragon uncoiled from his hoard and scuttled out of his cavern. The Wraiths chased him, doing what they could to irritate him, but he simply ignored them. *They're probably not going to be chucking rocks forever*, he thought grouchily. *They'll find some other way to kill me and then bugger off to do that to all of my ilk.* 

When he reached the open cliffside, with a mighty beat of his wings, he took wing, soaring at such a pace that no other creature could have followed him. Except, apparently, the Noncorporeal, whom stubbornly attached themselves to him and continued to scream human words in his ear. In a matter of moments, he arrived at his destination: a massive volcanic caldera smack-dab in the middle of the continent. Draugnir inhaled sharply and raised his maw to the sky. With a blinding surge of light, a pillar of yellow energy blasted from within his maw out towards the clouds, like waging war with the Sky God herself. Draugnir unleashed his mighty dragon breath for two entire minutes, and waves of force rippled outwards.

When he was done, he curled up by the caldera and lazily raised his head. The Wraiths, undeterred, continued their incessant assault on his body.",45
1lpjljk,n0vijyv,"After a few minutes, a shape emerged in the distance. Then two, then three, then four. His lifelong allies shot towards the volcano at speeds thirty-five times that of sound itself. Gracefully, they landed, each one with scales dappled in different colors.

""Draugnir, it's not like you to call a meeting so early in the day,"" Kaelgorr, Sovereign of Cinders, rumbled in a low voice.

Syrathene, the Deathly Blizzard, narrowed her eyes. ""And you're looking a little... 'rocky.'""

Draugnir's eye twitched as yet another rock, bigger this time, rolled off of his snout. ""Have any of you actually killed any humans?""

""The hell's a human?"" Charybdis, Silent Leviathan, piped.

""You mean the little monkeys?"" Erenvyr, Thorny Queen of the Briar Court, tipped her head. ""No, why the hell would I bother?""

""I mean, whenever they end up in my volcano,"" Kaelgorr said, ""I usually just pick them up and throw them out of my house. Why?""

""You see, a few humans were putting out some really nasty smoke, so I went and burned their village down,"" Draugnir began. ""And... well, I'm sure you can see the Wraiths.""

Murmurs broke out among the four other primordials.

""Oh, those were HUMANS?!"" Erenvyr leaned forward and tried poking one of the Wraiths, despite knowing better. ""You mean they turn into Wraiths once they die?""

""Well, no. Because if that was the case, we'd see a whole lot more Wraiths. No, I think it only happens when they're angry.""

""So they're too angry to die fully,"" Syrathene summarized, glaring at them. ""Pathetic little worms want to defy death, do they? Well, I'll show them death--""

""Syrathene,"" Draugnir cautioned. ""You and I both know that Wraiths are fairly dangerous creatures. You should not slaughter their species just to end up dead for it.""

Now, the Ice Primordial was being pelted with stones, and even sharpened sticks, too.

""So what do we do?""

""That's what I want to know."" Draugnir pointed at the Wraiths. ""I don't plan on letting these guys keep going on forever, and I couldn't find a spell to get rid of Wraiths. Usually, they're content to just mope around the sites of their death, and we could kill them by annihilating the site entirely since that's what they're attached to.""

""But these Wraiths are attached to you.""

""Exactly my problem.""

Kaelgorr curiously plucked one of the stones out of the air, scrutinizing the Wraith that threw it. In slow, deliberate motions, he spoke in a language that Draugnir immediately recognized as that of the humans. He was surprised that his ashen brother decided to spend time on something as trivial as that, but, then again, they did have a *lot* of time.

The Wraiths and Kaelgorr spoke back and forth for a while, and eventually, Kaelgorr turned to the other Primordials. 

""They won't be happy until Draugnir's dead,"" he explained. ""But, they did mention that they're concerned for the families they left behind. I would suggest taking the humans under our wings. If we do that, maybe they'll leave us well enough alone even if we accidentally squish one.""

Draugnir sighed. ""Fiiiiiiiine. I'll do something, then.""",43
1lpjljk,n0vikoz,"\-----------------------------------------------------------------

""And so, I did a few favors for your kind. And that's how this entire thing came to be."" A much older Draugnir spoke to the High Pontiff of the Draconic Church, who gaped. The Pontiff scrambled to find the words, but nothing came out. ""Now, is that your last question for your First Holy God? I'd like to take a nap.""",34
1lpt2fk,n0xbdf9,"I groan, as the devil starts explaining how important deals are.  
""Come on! I give something, you give something.  
It's a deal. Why are you overcomplicating it?"" I say.  
He smiles.  
""But if the deal includes me giving something now, in exchange let's say for a favor, or your soul...  
What will ensure that you will keep your end of the deal?"" he asks.  
I frown.  
""The contract?"" I ask.  
He laughs.

  
""And why would you follow the contract?  
You might very well say I coerced you, or that you didn't sign it."" he says.  
Hmm.  
""That could be a possibility, but I won't do that."" I say.  
""Of course you won't.  
Because Deals, true Deals, are Architecture as I said, clauses interwoven perfectly, ensuring no loophole, no accident, no phenomena can shake its structure."" he says.  
Okay.  
Now I am confused.

  
""What do you mean?"" I ask, reading the contract once more.  
""Real Deals include endless scenarios.  
Why do you think the contract is 9999 pages long?"" he asks.  
I laugh.  
""It is only 10..."" I start, then freeze.  
As I get to page 10, another appears, then another, and another, magically out of thin air.  
He smirks.  
""Real Deals are transparent, yet they still favor the more careful party."" he smiles.  
I frown.

  
""Whatever. Let me sign in, and give me immortality."" I say.  
He sighs.  
""You mortals and your pursuit of longevity.  
Taking out the joy out of Deals, well, I will be laughing one day."" he says, giving me a pen.  
I sign, and I instantly feel it.  
It's different than when I signed for a car, or a house...  
It's weighing down on me.  
""No Death, Possession, deal with another devil, demon, fae or any other entity will save your soul from fulfilling your end of the bargain.  
Not even the universe' destruction. So, enjoy your eternal life, mortal...  
We shall be seeing each other, sooner or later."" he says, disappearing.  
I shiver, but then shake it off, and start thinking in what kind of bonds, and banks I should start piling money...",6
1lpt2fk,n0xzhcd,"I twirl the pen around my fingers. Thinking hard on the words we'd exchanged, words that had challenged me and mine. ""Words are binding."" My voice piercing the quiet of the meeting room. ""They're wielded with such ferver and passion by those educated in their use, it's sad to see them diminished so."" Catching my opponents eyes with my own.

The room of five people sat silent as they watched the exchange between myself and the well dressed man at the other end of the table. We couldn't be more opposite. Wore out overalls and ballcap, a shirt that declares my love for the breakfast flapjacks at Marggies. Face a little scruffy. Sun baked forearms. The man across from me. Sharp. His face and hair are meticulously groomed. Well dressed, even I can tell that the suit costs more than my car.

I continue on uninterrupted. ""You know what's funny?People like you think Promises are Playthings. But Deals - real ones - they're Architecture. Pillars in the quiet chaos of our little world..."" I drift off to an old life, a past life. One I barely remember.

Seemingly unmoved by my speech. The man acts as if he'd had it all rehearsed. ""The contract is legally binding, I assure you we will pursue this to the full letter of the law. If you force us."" Of that I had no doubt. They had come at me hard and fast once they found that black gold under my land. Dragged me away from Harvest just so they could try and weasel me into some kind of legal dispute.

""Deals. Are made in confidence, between two people or parties to a mutual agreement. A Promise."" Holding up the piece of paper. ""Contracts are for those who don't believe in Promises. Think they're, Fragile. Intangible."" Letting it fall back down to the table with a solid thud. It wasn't too thick but big enough to intimidate. ""I don't sign Contracts sir. I make Deals."" A smirk came up across my face. One made of forthright planning and 30 years of fixing things.

Walking over to the other side of the table I gave him a smile, ""Deals are honoured."" Letting my eyes flicker silver long enough to show him my true nature. I added a mischievous grin. ""You're not ready for a Deal like this."" Colour drained from his face, as his professional demeanour wilted like a flower before a flame.

I left the high powered Lawyers meeting room and got back to my life. Crops don't bring themselves in.",6

""That's all?"" Alison asks.  
I roll my eyes, and put down the color examples I got from the store.  
""They are souls that used to live here, and will live here longer than we will."" I start.  
Nothing wild happens.  
""Yeah, ""live""."" Adam chimes in, and almost instantly the bathroom door slams open, and the lights flicker.  
I sigh.  
""Learn some manners, and they will be alright."" I say, turning back to check whether spring green, or swamp green would be better here...

  
A few days later, as I renovate the porch, the two ""smart"" ones, find me again.  
""It didn't work!  
I have been all nice, and polite, and...Look!"" she says, showing a rather nasty bruise on her leg.  
""You do realize they most likely hear us, and see us, right?  
And you do realize that whether Victorian or not, they know how to see something for what it is, right?  
You literally acted ""nice"" for a few days, and now you expect the ghosts to be all chummy with you?"" I ask them, they blush.  
I sigh.  
These guys...

  
""You broke a door off of its hinges on the very first week here, when you brought home that dude."" I say to Alison.  
She blushes, and pales at the same time, weird.  
""And you...  
You live in your room, and gather garbage enough for 9 people in a week..."" I say to Adam.  
Then I start talking about the little things, like messes left behind in the bathroom, slamming doors, not washing dishes, and so on...  
""Overall, you are just thinking about yourselves.  
Unlucky, because this house, has other tenants, than us, because if it was just me, maybe you would have gotten away with this behavior."" I say.  
The door slams twice behind us gently, as if agreeing with me.  
The two pouted.

  
Two weeks later, I watch them help me renovate.  
Alison is redoing the bathroom, and it starts looking good.  
She did waste some materials, but it is better than doing nothing, and cheaper than hiring a pro, anyway, I watch over what she does, lest she messes up the plumbing or something.  
Adam on the other hand is helping me with the roof now.  
And guess what?  
The haunting lessened.  
I look towards the backyard, to see faint figures leaning back on the chairs, nodding at me.  
I smile.  
They can finally rest, and not have to worry about the house...for now, at least.",62
1lplr5o,n0wvf46,"Ricky's night terrors are getting worse. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Tina and I used to laugh at the nightmares he recounted but recently Tina's been getting some of her own. She's been stressed out at work so I figure that must be it, but these nightmares certainly aren't helping her. Both of them seem to be misplacing things all the time as well - I try to help out and create systems, but for some reason, while they work perfectly for me they do jack all for them. I even found Ricky's car keys in the fridge once. The fridge! I told him he really needs to chill out and get some proper sleep because the lack of focus could be super dangerous and lead to him dying on the roads.

  
I even tried recommending mindfulness practice but I guess the one time he tried he must've fallen asleep because about 10 minutes in he screamed and ran out of his room spouting about a little girl tickling him???

  
What with both my teammates going mental the kitchen and living areas are becoming a huge mess. I try not to hold it against them but honestly it's getting a bit disgusting. I try to tidy and clean once in a while but I really don't want to be responsible for their mess. It does help my mental health when I clean though, I swear the sun comes out and the birds sing and cleaning becomes easy, so I can get through a lot more than I think I can in the 20 minutes I give myself to clean. I've been nagging Ricky and Tina and they keep saying they'll do it but I never see them cleaning and the house just looks worse and worse. Tina's put together a plan though - on Monday she picked up a few things then asked if we could clean together on Saturday and honestly it looks like that's relieved some of her stress - she already looks like she's sleeping better. We tried inviting Ricky to help us but he said he's got something on on Saturday - I didn't see him try to reschedule or do his own thing in all the free time he's had since then though...

  
I'm thinking a bit of colour might help their mood? I've been repainting the cornices (the decorative wooden bits that join the walls to the ceiling) when bored and I would say that, apart from the mess, the house is looking better already! The wallpaper in the living room is looking pretty bad so I'm trying to decide between replacing it with some beautiful paisley wallpaper which would match the house, or taking it off completely and just painting it a bright orangey-yellow for some cool boho-chic feels. The thing is, I keep on misplacing the paint swatches I bring home - they must be under the Tricky mess somewhere.

1lporos,n0x0256,"I had been a prince, a prisoner, a traveller, a warrior and a sorcerer in the past. A destroyer and a devourer. A source of Great Evil. But that's in the past. I am now a father to adoptive children, creator of eldritch puppies and pets, a local guardian deity and Lord Mayor of this little town I rule over. And immortal freelance historical consultant.

Most will know me as Lord Elvari of Innsmouth. Eldritch God of Madness. Not a god of knowledge, not wisdom, and most certainly not of historical accuracy. Not that it has phased historians like Professor Gideon Hardwick and his colleagues. Or anyone with an inkling of the history of the gods of this world. Everyone had hoped I could provide truthful, firsthand historical account of events. Be objective about it, as a lone god with no pantheon or family.

That's the thing most immortals don't tell you. The thing humans don't always believe.

When you have lived as long as I have, memories get foggy. It is worse in my case. I've died and pulled myself back multiple times. Been maimed and tortured more than the average human had a papercut. A thousand years of imprisonment in limbo had my brains going in circles among themselves and throwing memories into the void like confetti. Most of these younger immortals will talk of the downsides of watching your loved ones die, all while I've observed civilizations and pantheons come and go, rise and fall. There is pain. There is grief. Sometimes, with the assistance of sufficient alcohol (this is where, in modern times, Alfred and Kat will yell at their drunken dork god to sober up) to dull my senses and wreck my liver a hundred times over, the agony and sorrow eventually fade with time.

Not the incessant questions.

The truth is, I frequently refer to the books I've preserved in my libraries. I'm not a walking memory and data bank. Even with the mass of muddled memories from those who I had assimilated over the centuries, very little is of actual historical value. Most of them consist of mundane little moments that the original owners considered significant. Their marriage. Their child's first birthday. The first time they ever left the village.

How often were they in the right place, at the right time, to witness the right people truly make history? Much more rarely than these humans who consult me on history. Frankly, I'm not even there most of time myself. I was too busy eating in my lair. Swimming in the seas, hunting for sharks to devour while the exciting stuff was happening on land. Okay, I confess, sometimes I was simply too drunk to recall a darn thing.

And even if I was there, once upon a time, I forgot.

Maybe it simply hurts to remember.

But what I do recall, I do my best to recount. Why else would these humans bring me in as a historical consultant? It is one of the ways I earn money to pay my employees and servants. To raise funds to buy myself a big cheesecake.

So, human, I've told you about myself like you asked. You've heard me rant and rave, now do you still have a question about this world's history for little old Elvari here? Or are you here for some tea and cakes?

1lpt2nq,n0xdezw,"Centuries ago I used to help humans curing the plague.  
Now, once again, I have to help them, especially the environmentalists.  
Why?  
As a vampire, I am not kindhearted or pure.  
No.  
I am using my vast wealth, and vast ocean of knowledge to help the humans, because of one reason only.  
Human blood with microplastics, and other chemicals is gross, and artificial blood is disgusting.  
So, I have to help them save themselves, so I can have good tasting food.

  
There were great changes when industrialism hit, and I still had some plants, and samples from before the days of technology.  
Using those samples, we artificially followed the reaction of fauna, and flora to plastics, and various chemicals.  
Hastening the evolution process, and making sure the initial values are clear, we managed to create strains of crops, and fruits, and vegetables, that can purify themselves.  
They aren't invasive, and aren't too different from the natural ones, it's just they can adapt quicker, and better to the chemicals in the soil, and air, cleaning them.  
Then...  
We turned to the oceans, and foods.

  
It wasn't easy.  
Microplastics were everywhere.  
But I remembered that there was a mutation in a bacteria long ago, that started eating coal.  
Based off of that idea, we managed to create a bacteria that ate plastic, and turned it into energy to multiply.  
It did nothing else.  
It will take roughly 50 years, but the oceans and their waters will be clean.  
That's one thing done right.  
Now...cleaning the already ""infected"" humans.  
That...that was harder.

  
The bacteria dies inside of humans, that's how we made it, so that was a no-go.  
And microplastics are too small, and the chemicals already altered their taste, ahem, bodies...  
So all we could come up with was to test ways to make the body recognize microplastic and eliminate it quicker.  
It's not yet effective, but we have seen a success or two.  
It's going great.  
My fellow vampires are laughing at me wasting my money, and time on the humans.  
But when everything is solved...  
Whom will have dibs on the tasty one?  
This guy!",7
1lpt2nq,n0z11hp,"Jack strides purposefully into the building, one he’s never been in before, one he’s never before wanted to be in. The lights are too bright here, even in the dark of this early winter evening, and there are too many eyes everywhere. Especially with these confounded security cameras everywhere now. 

The pert little miss at the front desk directs him to the hallways that will take him to the right room. He considers the delicate throb at the side of her neck with something beyond interest, but not approaching longing. His appetite has been falling off, lately.

Nowadays you’re lucky if you get ten seconds of smooth suck before you hit a grainy patch. In the good old days every one was smooth to the last drop. He sighs. The good old days, before Leander burst into flames after a hunt let run too long…before Effie took the leg of a stool through the heart during a bar fight that went too far…

He knows there’s no quick fix for this. He also knows that if he stays out of bar fights, keeps his hunt times trim, and otherwise conducts his affairs in the considered, circumspect manner customary to him, he has the time to wait.

He’s come to this solution last of all, reluctantly. He considered every alternative first. He tried going vegetarian, just sucking animals, but not only did that make him feel like a monster, those little suckers are chock full of microplastic as well.

He tried artificial blood again for the first time since the most recent 90s when he briefly (but so vividly- he sighs in appreciative remembrance) dated a fresh recruit from California whose compassionate eating habits bizarrely made the transition with her, for at least the first few weeks of her fang life. He wonders whether that lasted. He thinks not. Artificial blood is spit your mouthful out awful. His theory was that she was only able to do it at all because she had no frame of reference, no experience of the sweet hot beautiful real thing. Anyhow, artificial blood still tasted foul. He’d managed to work some down this time but it had turned his stomach. It was not a solution.

He had been exuberantly optimistic about filtration via a series of dialysis machines, each more modified and promising than the last, but all of them had been ultimately disappointing: 
It was too risky in terms of time management to suck the blood himself and transfer it to the machine, this is in fact exactly how he wound up with Sage, the new recruit he was now babysitting because of idiotic but indomitable siring rules, and god what a mistake that was, he feels uncertain the mortal world had any use for Sage but he feels damn sure the immortal world doesn’t; or too sterile to even warrant the effort, having the machine both suck and filter and then drinking the result like a human with a smoothie machine, a couple nights of that and he genuinely thought about just walking out into the sunrise and having it all over with. And anyway, the results were suboptimal. The filtered blood wasn’t as grainy, but it still wasn’t completely smooth. The machine missed bits. And it was lukewarm.

Turns out he’d rather suck polluted blood, hot and pulsing from the source like the joyous living animal he is, than continue with any of these artificial endeavors. So he does, but it vexes him. Every night. To the point where he’s beginning to think disturbing thoughts on a regular basis, thoughts like ‘is it even worth it anymore’ and ‘what’s the point of all this anyhow?’

He’s had Sage doing research for weeks on the provenance and properties of microplastics, which Sage seems to actually enjoy. Of course. He snorts. It’s true what they say, you can take the vampire out of his generation, but you can’t take his generation out of the vampire. He knows that he himself is hopelessly old world. That’s why he thinks this plan will work.

It’s all come down to this: a meeting called with the top ecofuture minds and creators on the planet. He’s built a plan for future generations of humans that will move them back gradually through decades to the use of glass bottle and waxed paper carton, soap made of ash and lye, foods grown in rich, rotating fields of chemical free soil…it’s all here, a plan to systematically destroy every last instance of plastic in the world. His maps are vast, his lists are laborious. His presentations are lively and brief, his proposals persuasive in theory and individual application. He knows he can make this work. He’s got what it takes to get the right people on board and the work underway.

He knows from centuries of experience that the only thing humans really respond to is abundance. Just like the only thing a vampire really responds to is pure experience. They can have everything they need, these humans, and still have endless capacity to desire more. Fortunately he is at this stage of his existence the very embodiment of generational wealth. He’s lived through lean times and fat times, financially speaking, but the older he got the savvier he grew, and now he’s something of a robber king. It comes of so many years of eating the rich and swiping their contraband collections. He can afford to wait whole lifetimes to unload these stolen treasures for unbelievable profit. 

He stands in front of the conference room doors, and takes a moment to smooth his sleeves, flip through his folio. He’s feeling strangely nerved up. He hasn’t felt this way about anything besides a very special meal for a long, long time. Maybe he needed this in more ways than one. Maybe this has become more than just the pursuit of a smooth sip. ",5
1lpar5q,n0tj5nq,"Being immortal has its benefits. Chief amongst them is birthdays .So many birthdays that remembering them becomes a burden. There becomes a point of fatigue on the memory. When you're immortal you tend to have a superior memory to most beings. Even then, unlike your existence it isn't without end. Mental load can become quite the downwords force. 

So there came a time which I called it quits. Birthdays based on solar orbit were overdone. Galactic orbits, however, they were something to savour. 

The party had been generations in the planning. Some who were arriving had grandparents not yet born when the thing was conceived. This was a monumentous occassion. Like the birth or death of a star (I'd seen both a few times now). To these I was nearly a god. No doubt I'd have to convince a few tonight that I did not in fact know all. My presence was not omni. Though one does find a certain wisdom somewhere between their third and fourth galactic orbit. But only the hindsight of millenia affords that priveledge.

The crowds churned into the near endless halls. They funneled into their designated sections, with perfect choreography. When the plans took decades, they better be water tight. Media from across the galaxy would be broadcasting this to all reaches of the confines of my fourth orbit. 

""Do you think you're the first to achieve such a feat?"" One reporter asked. I didn't bother to count the amount of mouths that she spoke to me with. I'd seen her kind before, several centuries ago.

I made up an answer I'd spent far too long pondering. What I didn't say is I'd long since stopped wondering. Either there was another older. Or there wasn't. But at this point they'd seemed determined not to reveal themselves if they had. So like the torment of endless birthdays, I decided to drop the matter.

I paraded myself through the halls. Ironically, the whole event would last a whole year. This was just one ceremony amongst many. Mine the first, but others of my kind (recorded as younger of course, would have their own lesser occassions. Most the days would be in celebration of the eldest, of course. But for every immortal being, there must be some appreciation. The universe doesn't seem to have rhyme or reason. No one race has worked out the pattern. But if they live long enough, grow large enough. It seems that inevitably they will produce their own undying peculiarity. Being the first, humanity, was raised mentally within the intergalactic community as some kind of shining example. I've long since realised that there's no such award, physical or mental, deserved. I was a production of sheer luck, even more so by the vast quantity of other intelligent species out there. Some who proliferate much more rapidly and widely than ourselves. And to be honest, after a while, when you're so far removed from the usual struggles of your kind, does it all matter anyway?

I realise I'd long since been ignoring the celebrations to dawdle. I force myself to be present. Engage in small talk with some far travelled delegation. I ever so wisely chomp down on some wonderfully crafted cake, and move on to the next group. 

A galactic orbit. Was it such an achievement after all? At some point I do wonder if I'll have to find another, longer milestone, to aim for.",64
1lpar5q,n0uaqjc,"I turn four gears old tomorrow. Gears. That's my own shorthand for ""galactic years."" A galactic year is about 250 million Earth years, so I'll be a billion years old tomorrow. The year is 1,000,001,994, according to the ancient Gregorian calendar. I'm the only one that remembers it. I remember a lot of things—though memory hasn’t been necessary for ages. 

I'll be celebrating with a quiet, modest little party. My current friends are invited. They've lasted a lot longer than my old neo-human friends. A848d63196ae97de398a82cb9ded19f2e0bd5538014ba8f0ca1488c9ce3f95bf won't be coming; she's on a survey mission to MoM-z14. Now that I'm the last surviving organic lifeform on my planet, I've gotten used to the long identifiers for the different alien androids; it doesn't take that much time to recite the identifiers, in the grand scheme of things. 

Patience. That is the skill I have mastered. I make plans for the cosmos like a grandmaster plays chess. I have one remaining mission: construct the interferer. I've finished moving all the pieces to exactly where I want them. 

You see, back in 4783, I had amassed all human knowledge and cobbled together a little law of everything—not a theory: a law. (I had, after millennia of effort, proved it.) The short summary is that the universe isn't a universe—it's a dancing fractal. We live in the platonic realm. With my well-earned mastery of numbers, I determined the initial state of our universe from observations in the CMB and simulated the universe. I fast-forwarded the simulation until my own birth, then watched it play out in real time, up to the moment when my simulated self built its own simulation. That's where it always halts. 

Tomorrow will be different. It's the deadline I've set for myself. Tomorrow I'll deploy the interferer and celebrate. My interferer will cause disturbances in all quantum fields at the boundaries of our cosmic lobe, resulting in subtle changes in remote corners of the universe. If you appreciate the ramifications of this, then you understand how this will lead to inter-lobe travel.  

Instead of the usual, preprogrammed small-talk routines—""370e799a406343ca4956a14786fbaf3e0bcd4bcf6e2a39a3a01c4f034c282afc?""

There will be cake. Well. . . something like cake. . . Okay, nothing like cake.",30

""Benny Boy!"" I screamed and launched myself forward into a hug with the giant insectoid 'Benxibalbo'. At least that's how I think it's probounced. His pinchers snipped impatiently together as I looked down and saw I was impaled on his spines. ""Whoops"" I somehow slurred on the ""s"" and pulled myself off him.

And after a while, it gets boring fighting the same superpowered dimwits with my robots. There's little strategy, a whole lot of brute force. Couldn't blame them, when they're powerful with very little that could compete with them save for a handful of supervillains and some of my inventions.

So, now I'm mass-producing and selling my bots in an underground market. Who doesn't want to be part of a superpowered fight from the safety of their basement?

Political power.

The Paladin's sword snapped in two, my mana was almost out, and couldn't heal anymore, and the rogue couldn't even approach the demon, and her arrows were out.  
The wizard, our best chance, was nigh out of mana as well, so he did something unexpected.  
He took off his wedding ring, and threw it into the sky, and we marveled as it expended into a portal.

  
""What? You are bringing more snacks for me?  
Thank you!"" the Demon's 9 heads laughed, as the miasma grew stronger.  
I looked at the wizard...who took out his pipe.  
""This be done in a minute."" he muttered, sitting down on a log.  
The paladin walked up to us, and so did the rogue, as we were all confused.  
""Haha! Good. You realized the futility of your struggle!  
I assure you, your blood and souls will be used for great things..."" the Demon smirks, but then freezes, as a pillar of light engulfs him.  
From the portal in the sky, a beautiful Goddess steps out, sighing.

  
""Took you long enough.  
Almost bashed in the barrier between the God Realms and the Mortal Realms, to come here myself."" she says to the wizard.  
""Sorry honey."" he says.  
We freeze.  
Honey? And that wedding ring? He is...married to a GODDESS?  
""Luxia! You! What are you doing here!? This is a mere lower tier mortal realm!"" the demon roars, as the pillar of light shatters, but the demonic miasma is now noticeably weaker.  
""Oh, if it isn't the little worm of Mammon.   
Pretending to be a 9-headed worm? How...disgusting."" she says, and waves her hand.  
Amidst screams, the demon simply disappears.

  
""Darling!"" she says, flying down to us, and to the wizard, kissing him.  
Then...she slaps him, and kisses him again.  
""Honey..."" he mutters, before being punched in the stomach.  
Then she turns to us.  
""Thank you for taking care of him, and disallowing him to drink."" he says, the last part specifically to me.  
I am confused, should I kneel?   
""No need. I am off, the little deity of this planet is getting fidgety with me being here.  
Come over for dinner sometime."" she says, leaving through the portal, as it shrinks, and flies down to become once more a ring on the wizard's finger.  
We stare at him, as he coughs, and continues smoking his pipe.  
""Will explain everything...first, let's try to find the Demon's lair, and loot it."" he says.  
We nod, but frankly at this point, even legendary gear is less interesting than the story behind what we just witnessed.",214
1lp4625,n0t3wjl,"The land we stood upon was cracked, smashed into pieces that were battered endlessly by a wind strong enough to push us back. This was it, this was the end of the world, against that King, gone mad with power. Before him stood a group of four, a Wizard with a White Ring and a God-Gifted Staff. A Paladin with a Grand Shield, and a Gauntlet of Power. A Cleric with an Emblem of Grace and a Symbol of Hope. Then, finally, me, a Bard, with an Emperor's Trumpet, and, to go along with it, the notes for the Song of Calamity. The four of us were the last hope of this planet, Gardenia. This King, mad with power, equipped with a wicked and terrible blade, was set on wiping it out entirely.

But we were exhausted. We were running out of hope. Each moment spent fighting only wore us out, as the mad King cackled with every hit he took. Our Paladin spoke up, she cried out hopelessness. I tried to reassure her, but our Cleric knew it was true. The Grand Shield, and the Symbol of Hope, two items vital to our victory, had been completely destroyed beyond use. Our Wizard, however, said we were not done. That  it was not over. That we could still win.

We all looked, as a dark and terrible emotion came over the Wizard's face. He held his hand, the one with the pure white ring. Such an insignificant detail to us, it was something he never told us about, and, soon, we realized why. He muttered, just barely audible over the roaring wind, ""I'm sorry."" as he grabbed the ring. As soon as he did, the wind stopped. Hesitation filled the very planet itself. The ring almost refused to come off, but, after a serious pull, the ring laid in the palm of our Wizard's hand, vibrating at an intense speed.

He threw it into the sky, with as much force as he could muster. A great, and terrible, force was upon us, as the ring expanded into a large portal, and the ground shook. It was another violent tremor, but this one seemed to never end. We barely managed to stay on our feet, and look to the sky, as, from the portal, descended a woman, with long, flowing black hair, white skin, and a pure white dress.  

What came next was a deafening silence, everything had stopped. The wind blew no more, the ground remained still, the King's senseless monologue had ceased. Quietude prevailed, except, for a soft piano melody echoing out of the portal. The woman's dress and hair both flowed in a nonexistent wind as she descended further, her body flying gently towards the Wizard. Not a word was said by him, as he hung his head in shame.

The Wizard would gently reach for the identical pure white ring on the Woman's hand, gently removing it without touching her. Then, it would fall to the floor, landing in the grass and dirt. Its companion in the sky would shrink back to its original state, falling from above to land next to it.

For a moment, everything was silent. The Woman would then stop flying, landing before the Wizard, and, her eyelids would part open. They would be giving way to a pair of beautiful red eyes. She looked into the Wizard's eyes for a few seconds, and reached her hand out. The Wizard, in response, would grab it. As soon as they touched, a radiant energy rapidly condensed upon the Woman, causing her to glow blindingly bright. 

Then the release would come, in the form of her body exploding violently. The sound that followed was sharp, like needles in the form of sound, and, in an instant, each of us would be engulfed in the explosion. It would produce a light so brilliant that it would burn the very Sun, destroying every one of us in mere seconds, leaving nothing behind except for a pair of scorched, tarnished, white rings. They would sit alone in a crater, being the only other trace of the deed done to save the planet.",48
1lp0c60,n0rpk63,"""Am I dying?"" Greg asked, staring at the doctor's X-ray charts, which indicated his organs had flipped to the other side. Where his heart was once on the right, it now nestled left. His pulse felt funny. His organs squelched beneath his skin, as though someone had shuffled them and stuffed whoopee cushions inside.

But worst of all, his favourite shirt now had mirror writing in a foreign language that he could no longer read.

""You're perfectly healthy, if mirrored,"" the doctor spoke like a man who had witnessed fifth dimensional geometry. ""What are you experiencing is a fourth dimensional rotation along the W-axis.""

""I thought it was X, Y, Z-axis?"" Greg was pretty sure he remembered high school geometry just fine.

""W-axis applies to fourth dimensional beings,"" the doctor didn't look up at all. ""Like the one who pranked you.""

""How do I get back at that little shit?"" Greg was incensed. ""Make him fix my shirt! Flip my organs right back where they belong!""

The doctor pulled out his phone and began scrolling through his contacts. ""I can make a few recommendations.""

**
--

Greg's attorney at Slugworth & Coldslay, an interdimensional law firm that specializes in extradimensional mischief, was Janet Slugworth. Who was an actual slug. With stubby cybernetic arms.

She slithered along the meeting table, leaving a trail of slime. ""We have a solid case. The private detective we hired has tracked down Glowar, the fourth dimensional entity who was careless enough to sign his name on your shirt. We have secured video evidence. He had filmed himself rotating you and uploaded it to TokTik. The only question is how much compensation we can secure.""

""A million Euros for the distress he caused.""

""My client cannot afford that,"" Hogsnort the eldritch lawyer blinked his dozens of eyes. ""Glowar understands he has committed the crime of unauthorized biological and topological reconfiguration of you, and believes the gift of a temporal paradox and fist-sized wormhole to be desirable compensation.""

""I'd like to see a fifth dimensional entity flip this fourth dimensional prankster upside down,"" Greg scowled, still feeling queasy from his briefly misplaced stomach. ""Let's see how you'd like that.""

""I propose you let me flip you,"" Hogsnort turned to Glowar. ""This is the cheapest compensation that the plaintiff desires. More affordable than offering a temporal paradox and wormhole. Or one million Euros.""

""No temporal paradoxes and wormholes,"" Slugworth insisted. ""My client only wants a million Euros or for Glowar to be mirror-flipped by someone of an additional dimension more faceted than he is. Otherwise, we'll be seeing you in court, and I strongly believe the judge will rule in our favor.""

Glowar sniffed and sobbed. ""Ah fuck this. Flip me, Hogsnort.""

Thus, Hogsnort waggled his tentacles and flipped his client like a transdimensional pancake. Glowar was rotated around the U-axis, resulting in his guts spinning out of his body. His name wrapped around an incomprehensible axis to warp into Rawolg. The words on his shirt were a doubly mirrored, double Dutch twist of cursive that even the supernatural entities in the room couldn't read any of it.

""Can I sue Hogsnort for this?"" Rawolg moaned.

""Of course not,"" his lawyer retorted. ""I executed this out-of-court settlement correctly as per Article 9 of the Interdimensional Extradimensional Rotation Accords. You will remain in this state until you rotate Greg correctly into his normal three-dimensional configuration. And fix his favourite shirt.""

1lp0c60,n0sefcy,"Interesting premise 👍, but wouldn't something like that be WAY more trouble than just a lawsuit? I'm just guessing here (it's been a while since I read about that), but getting your body flipped from left to right like that _should_ flip your biochemistry, too - some enzymes and whatnot are especially shaped like they are, because the molecules they work on can come in left-handed and right-handed varieties, but for some reason, practically all biology on earth does only use one side of these. When they match, all is fine and dandy, but for you as a flipped being, this is bad news: flipped enzymes don't work on 'normal' stuff, and so you can eat all you want, but still starve (or otherwise die in unpleasant ways) 😬...",15
1lp0c60,n0shh5n,"IT IS! I came here to reply to /u/Gregory_Swan about this; people ARE BORN with organs flipped! It's a medical condition called [Situs Inversus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situs_inversus) and can be lethal! Medicine is set up expecting things to be in the place they are supposed to be, and if they aren't, things can go horribly wrong.

I wouldn't sue, I'd pester them until they fixed it.",14
1lp0c60,n0tngmm,"Nope. Most people don't realize they're flipped inside unless it's a medical emergency. However, your left lung has one less lobe to make room for your heart; if you were having a cardiac emergency and they went to stick a needle into your heart, they'd puncture your lung instead.

That's just one example.",5
1lpgxll,n0vbru0,"I am not a saint, though perhaps I am a savior. I was a well intentioned Don Quixote. But what The Eternal Star granted me is real. Gifts of intelligence, cognitive abilities that seem supernatural. I do not trust it, but if this Star can make a lowly creature like me into a demigod, destroying us all should have been trivial, were that what it wanted.

I wanted to give of myself to help others. I wanted to do so so badly that it slowly wore away my sanity. Even in the depths of madness, it defined me. It spoke to me after I had fought another battle against the adversary that existed only in my head. I still remember the words, ""Your noble sacrifice for the greater good has proven you worthy in the eyes of this Eternal Star. You will be entrusted with a great power, and the future of this planet. Rise, and help them build a better tomorrow."" I thought it was simply something pulling me even deeper into my neurosis, but shortly after hearing those words, I began to claw back my sanity.

I found intelligence inside myself, more than I had ever had before I fell into the pit of madness. For a time I thought it was simply healing, but that evaporated in the face of a cognitive transformation. I found I could master skills in days instead of years. Three months after encountering this called The Eternal Star, a self administered intelligence test indicated that my IQ was so high that it could not accurately measure it. Only then did I start to believe that it was something more than a voice in my head.

I relished learning before receiving the gift, and now I feasted on information. The exaltation of rapid growth and learning. In one year, I gained the skills of two dozen bachelor's degrees. Even then, I understood that the growth of my intelligence was still accelerating. I was confronted by the conundrum of what to do with all this new found ability and knowledge. The course of maximum positive impact. Even with my formidable mind, I was overwhelmed with possible paths.

Ultimately, I settled upon spearheading development of safe and effective artificial intelligence and maintaining the peace between nation states. Making sure synthetic intelligence would not be abused and making sure that the tremendous wealth it would generate was not monopolized. Even with my abilities, the murk of geopolitics was difficult to see through. All I had to do was prevent apocalyptic conflict while the technologies needed to eliminate scarcity kicked in.

In fifteen years, safe, aligned, and widely accessible artificial superintelligence became a reality. The incentives for large-scale warfare were dying, along with most of the reasons for warfare in general. I moved away from work on technology, and set my sights upon a rigorous system of ethics. A sprawling edifice of thought designed to handle every edge case, drawing on the ideas about morality other thinkers had shared through human history. Juggling so many different concerns and values, invoking game theory, and finessing and fine tuning so many different hypotheticals.

My creation became the ethical foundation for the human metaculture as expansion into space became a reality. Not only guiding human ideas about morality, but also providing a rigorous moral system for the synthetic intelligences to operate under. Industries were moved into orbit or other celestial bodies. I watched the dawn of a golden age, the end of so many of our civilization's demons. Biological and digital immortality were invented entirely independently of my intervention. I continued making small nudges to our long term trajectory, and strove to give everyone the tools to chart the best possible course. But, even with all my ability, it was becoming clear that they were accelerating faster than I could ever hope to keep up with enitrely.

As I write, the golden age has now lasted for thousands of years. I still look for potential threats, potential flashpoints. But for the most part, we have the tools to resolve such conflicts long before there is even a risk of violence. I contemplate physics, I make some contributions to the state of the art in some specific niches. Most of my time goes towards grappling with the existence and nature of The Eternal Star who set all this in motion. It represents a blind spot, one even our best science has failed to explain. We have come so far, yet it is clear that our story has only just begun.",6
1lpdh8m,n0ufk43,"(going to write to a similar intent, but not quite the same prompt)

I stared at the large person towering over me, struggling to find an answer to the absurdity of the question. Or was it a statement? The implication was that the question he asked was basic. But who defined basic? A raft of objections flooded through my head. The baker next door had his entire process and ingredient ratios as basic knowledge, but would be stumped by the blacksmith's questions on what color the iron should be when shaping. The glasswright knew what types of glass was good to use for windows, but not which saw was best to cut across the grain when making furniture. The night watchman knew which streets to watch more closely, but not which aisle held the books on the history of cloth making in the library. The book binder could tell what type of tree a piece of paper came from, but would not be able to answer What consistency the mortar needed to be when laying stone for a house wall. 

""I'M WAITING!!!"" HIs yell cut through my rapid thoughts, and I became conscious of the shuffling and murmurs behind me in line.

""Sir, do you have a list of things that you consider basic knowledge that I can study?""

It was his turn to stare, looking even more ridiculous in his purple and white clothes. There were laughs quickly suppressed around the room. What? It seemed like a reasonable question. If there was a list of basic knowledge, anyone could study it. Maybe we could even give it to people who already knew it as a to-do list and have children gather around them every day to learn about more. The sarcastic thought tugged at the corners of my mouth in humor.

The voice was quiet, dangerous, now, ""Are you laughing at me?""

Oh shit. I did it again. How could I explain? I couldn't. It never went well. The funny thought was in my head, a path the conversation could take, but wasn't. He would understand if he let me explain, but everyone hated my explanations. I always got in more trouble with them. Silence is best. Right. Got to remember that better. Maybe shutting up now works?

A rough hand grabbing my collar, hauling me out of the desk, a sharp whack of my knee to one of the legs, trying to keep my feet under me as I was propelled toward the door. 

----------

""I will not mock the teacher"" I wrote for the six hundredth time on the paper before me, glancing through my eyebrows at the figure of the detention monitor boredly flipping through a book. It was just us in here now, but twice as many people here than I wanted. It was also very typical. The whole thing was puzzling. Every time I was asking a question that I genuinely wanted to know the answer to and every time people got angry at me. It happened in school, it happened at home, it happened at church. No one liked me asking questions. And every time they tried to punish me in a way that only left me curious. Writing this phrase a thousand times is only keeping my fingers occupied, I've added at least 20 new questions that no one's going to want to answer while I'm writing. It keeps me from having to go home though, so I don't mind it at all. 

That was another part of the reactions that puzzled me. They always tried to punish me in ways that didn't really matter to me. At home my dad would always send me to my room, when the thing I almost always wanted was to be alone anyway. I could fathom that they were trying to punish me to change my behavior, but they didn't understand me or my behavior at all so it didn't do anything. Well, not really. I was learning a whole lot about behavior and motivations. I would rather be going back through the books on the shelf, I see a few bindings that weren't there yesterday, but I would get this finished soon enough and would have a few hours to enjoy that before being sent home. See? I'm already past 700. My fingers know what to do.

""Where have you been?"" My dad's voice wasn't a yell, he never yelled. Mom did all the yelling. But I could still feel the intensity, the determination to have an answer. 

I glanced over at my brother, who had known. He was ignoring it all. Of course he didn't bother to tell them. ""I was held back in detention again.""

""Again?"" a pause, ""go to your room until dinner.""

I turn away before rolling my eyes. He doesn't even care enough to ask why. What else is new. My bag bounced off the door frame as I slipped into my room, bringing a grin to my face. I had two new books this time.",22
1lpm4px,n0wd623,"""What's got you in a fuss?"" asks Jessica, the woman next to me. She smells sweet, like plums. I toss my phone across the room, wedging it deep into the couch. Even if I forget it's there, I'll find it eventually. The damn thing always seems to end up in the same place.

""Some woman keeps sending me videos."" I'm grumpy. I'm told I'm always grumpy.

""And you don't like them?"" asks Jessica. It's a stupid question.

""Of course not! She keeps saying it's me and my daughter and that she's my wife. I don't have a bloody daughter! Never even been married!""

Jessica looks concerned, at least, so far as I can tell. I don't like looking at her when I'm like this. I don't like looking at *anyone* when I'm like this. I just wish they'd all leave me alone, but it feels like the more I resist, the more they prod and pry. But perhaps I shouldn't take it out on Jessica. She tries hard with me. I can tell.

""Sorry. It's just. It's annoying is all. People get spam all the time, but this feels different. It's so... personal.""

Jessica nods and stands. ""That sounds difficult. I get why that would be scary.""

""Not scary, just strange. The guy doesn't even look like me.""

BZZT. I can hear the buzz from across the room. Both Jessica and I stare. She walks to the floral couch, pulling my phone from the cushions with ease. Like I said, always in the same place.

""Show me."" She flashes the phone in front of me. The font is big but I still need my glasses. ""I just need your face,"" she adds. Of course, I always forget. I look head on and it unlocks. Jessica pulls away and taps about. Most might care about privacy, but I've got nothing to hide, at least nothing that I can remember, and if I can't remember as it ever really that important?

""Well, would you look at that?"" Jessica smirks. It's the same damn smirk when she knows she's right about something. ""He's pretty handsome, I gotta say.""

Again, she flashes my phone in front of me. I back up. She always puts it too close.

""This is a different video!"" I protest. The gall to get all cheeky when she can't even find the same message as before.

""It's the same family though, isn't it?"" says Jessica. I look again. It is. ""Looks like they're having a fun time too, don't they?""

The man wrestles a little girl then tosses her across the room onto a floral couch.

""Hey! They've got the same couch as me!"" I almost laugh. The jokes on them; it's terrible.

""Well, well,"" says Jessica, ""Isn't that strange. Maybe they bought it at the same place?""

""No, it's one of a kind. Sarah's father built it for us when we got married. Never did like it. But it was a gift, so...""

A real smile creeps up on Jessica's face. She liked that story for some reason. ""It made a lot of good memories though, didn't it?""

""Yeah.""

""Kind of like these?"" Jessica hands me my phone opened to the photos app. Its the same man and the same girl. Some of the videos play on their own. They're... wonderful. Each and every one. For a moment, the world seems to fade away. I scroll, and scroll, and scroll. I could watch forever. There's a woman in some of these too; one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. I can barely look away.

Jessica places her hand on mine. I look into her eyes and at once I see it.

""You're... you're...""

""Mhmm.""

I smile. ""My little plum."" How could I forget? 

""The woman in the photos..."" I start.

""Would you like to see her?""

I can't even think up the words to say. A simple nod will have to do. Jessica pulls my hand, up and away from the sofa.

""Come on, dad. She's been waiting.""",15
1lp50t5,n0s0nsf,"I stare at this man that makes me feel things I never felt before.  
A man that makes stars shiver in his presence.  
And shake my head.

It is still forced.  
I don't know you, and you don't know me."" I say.  
He smiles.

  
""I know that you are perfect.  
And I know that I love you, and that our love is the truest love out there in this infinite universe.  
A love made through will, and need, without fate or destiny or any deity messing with our threads!"" he says.  
I smile.  
""Still...  
I am married. Happily so."" I say.  
He freezes.  
Oh boy...here it goes.

  
""I saw the ring on your finger, and assumed it, but it doesn't matter.  
I can feel the way you feel towards me, and the love you have towards your husband, is nothing compared to what we have!"" he says.  
I hate it that he is right.  
""Doesn't change the fact that I do love him.  
And that I don't know you, so please, leave."" I say.  
He frowns, and light fades from our surroundings.  
""What if we were to get to know each other?  
Speak, and go on walks, travel the universe? I could show you eternity, and moment, and the birthplace of deities!  
Your husband has no say in this."" he says, grabbing my hand.  
I sigh.

  
""Most likely I would fall for you, and most likely we would truly be in love, but...  
I couldn't ever shake the feeling of it being forced, randomly appearing here, stating that you willed our love into existence...  
What difference would that have, between you doing this, or a deity?"" I ask.  
He frowns.  
""And my husband, the man I love...if he heard about us...  
He would smile, ask me if I truly love you, and if I say yes, he would wish us happiness and leave, and I...  
I can't hurt him. And I won't leave him."" I say.  
He pales, nods, and simply disappears.  
As color comes back to reality, I collapse, my whole body trembling.  
I go inside, where I see a portrait of my husband and I, and smile...  
""This is perfect...I won't do something so stupid."" I mutter, trying to forget this encounter.  
Willing love into existence...and finding my name through the shattered bones of destiny...  
If that isn't forced love...what is?  
At least a God of Love just does their duty, but this man...sigh, forget it.  
Better to just ignore it, but I doubt that will be possible for long.",10
1lp50t5,n0u28o1,"She puts her hands on the table and the kitchen chair squeaks from under her. 
I raise my mug to my mouth as she turns and heads for the door. The door she will slam today and enter back into tonight. 

My coffee tastes sweeter today. I should probably set my watch for when I start the bombarding of “worried” calls and texts she’ll be expecting. Forty minutes should be enough time for her to get over to Daniel’s house. A few bad choices later she’ll be back. Head hung and super sweet. Our regular little carnival ride.

I shoot him a message which he knows to delete. His paycheck depends on it. “Be home. Tara’s on her way over.” 

Daniel sends a thumbs up and I drop my phone in my pocket. 

Daniel and Tara’s “affair” has lasted roughly 4 months. They met on tinder after a particularly nasty fight between her and I. I wasn’t really sure if Daniel was the type she’d go for, but was pleasantly surprised when she took the bate. Daniel’s vices seemed to supersede mine nicely. 

I run the shortcut that texts Tara, “where are you going?” 

I send this one first because I noticed if I apologize or show too much worry too quickly then I might actually get her to turn around. Sure, that’s what she thinks she wants. She thinks she wants the husband who will calm her. Who will bring the relationship all the way back down to a less explosive state. 

I will do that. But only after she’s done things she can’t take back. It brings a humility to her that in the long run does so much more good for us. It opens her eyes to how good she has it in front of her. It gives her life some color that would never have existed without me. 

I love imagining her running toward where the grass looks greener, only to see that it was always greener with me. And it always will be the greenest with me. And I, the forever forgiving and loving husband will welcome her home with open arms. 

So yeah, here we are in another marital spat. You doing the “unforgettable.” You’ll come home with a broken heart you don’t dare tell me about and I will mend you. Mend us. Because that’s the man I am. The man who will move the sun and the stars for you.",6
1lp1dxw,n0ramr2,"I look in the mirror, as the kids scream bloody murder outside, and inside my mansion.  
I sigh.  
For eons I have taken care of, and raised abandoned children I found during my travels across Hell, Fae lands, and the myriad mortal worlds.  
It wasn't easy.  
For one: as a Duchess of Hell, I have quite a few contenders that would do anything to either kill me, or marry me,or both.  
And two...many kids are not demons, yet raised in Hell, so I had to spend a lot to make sure the miasma isn't corrupting them.  
And now this...in the mirror, angelic wings, budding, but still, angelic, are slowly growing out of my back.  
Great.

  
I hide them under a black tank top, as I try my best to will them to fold, and go downstairs.  
The humans and elves are waging war again, as the demon kids try the best to mediate the problems.  
The few dwarves are busy building wooden weapons, and selling to the highest bidder, while the 2 Giant young ones, are shivering, hidden in a corner, afraid.  
I clap, and they all stop.  
""Mother!"" they scream, rushing towards me.  
I laugh, as I raise them all into the air with my magic, and take them inside, where I prepared food already.  
Sure, I am a strong demon, and could have servants, and maids, and whatnots...  
But after a few kids went missing eons ago...  
I don't employ anyone anymore.

  
""Mom! Have you heard about Oaken Leaf?!"" an elven lass asks.  
I nod.  
""She left Hell for the Azure Springs Realm. There she was hired as a personal tutor for an elven princess, and I hear she's now courted by 2 princes, and 1 noble.  
She's doing great."" I smile.  
""What about Duzuff?!"" a dwarf burps.  
I flick his forehead.  
""Manners. Also, Duzuff is now the chief blacksmith of a Vampire Viscount down south from us. From what I hear, all the vampire blacksmiths fear and respect him."" I say.  
They laughed, saying ""That's so Duzuff!"", I smiled.

  
Over the years, the kids I took care of, and raised left, and spread all across the various worlds, and regions.  
""Do you ever miss them?"" one of the human kids asks.  
I nod.  
""Yes. They are my children, just like you are."" I say, and they laugh, and thank me for the food, before going to wash the dishes.  
Good kids.  
I leave, watching the many portraits hanging on the walls...all portraits of the kids.  
I pass a mirror and freeze.  
My skin...my purple skin...is turning...golden?  
And my horns...they shortened, and the bulge on my back is getting hard to be contained.

1lp1dxw,n0vtqmu,"A copse of trees on the crest of a knoll long forgotten by the living. 

They are my children. Planted in fall, they sleep until spring. I find them everywhere. 

Resting on the seat of office chairs standing together in a still office. Floating alongside fluttering colorful kites buoyed by coastal winds. 

People have them all the time, yet abandon them so easily. Toss them like trash, or worse yet, simply forget about them.

Dreams. Hopes. 

I ask if they’d like to leave with me, and they always say yes. 

I cater to their idiosyncrasies, nurture their souls. Until they decide their time has come to an end. 

Planted in fall, they sleep until spring, until they shoot up into the sky and forget their meager existence. 

I do this for… I’m not sure how long. Since there has been time. But the skin on my back starts to tighten. I reach across my chest towards my back and hesitate. I know what’s there. I put my hand down. 

I start changing. I’m lighter. Brighter, people look at me with kindness when before they couldn’t even glance at me. I’d roll my eyes, if I had eyes.

One day, my skin breaks, a wet trail of blood running down my back. So much relief.

I knew this day was coming. I rest my head against rough bark I hadn’t had a chance to say goodbye to yet. 

My wet, bloodied angelic wings drag along the ground, collecting dry leaves and other forest accoutrement, as I make my way to the edge of the copse.

I shoot up in the air, like my children before me, and leave my one beautiful life.",7

Tbh, wrote several similar stuff to this, and all could go on for a looong time.

Totally could be a series, with several more special kids being raised by her, their struggles, and growth, and being adopted or starting their adult lives.  
Having financial problems, or conflicts with other powers, and entities.

And end-game would be when the MC finally falls in love with someone, and so begins the conflict of ""found and blood related family"".",6

Chelsie lay in her room on her iPad scrolling through videos. One in ten made her giggle enough to leave a like. The rest were dull and pointless. She closed the app to check her social media feed.

""I was enjoying that."" A voice echoed in her room. Chelsie looked up to see a teenage boy in a suit float before her.

""Ulysses, this is my tablet time,"" Chelsie said.

""You aren't using it though. You are unimpressed by moving pictures, but they're a miracle for me."" Ulysses pointed at her and began to shake. His eyes widened and watered. Chelsie sighed and stood up.

""Don't walk away from me. You need to learn how to appreciate your belongings. I saw you not brush your teeth which would've saved my life."" Chelsie shut the door to her room. Ulysses continued to shout, but she couldn't hear him. 

When she moved to her kitchen, her mother was seated at the table while Mabel was mopping, cooking chili, making brownies, tossing the cake she made yesterday, and tending to the garden outside. Her mother was doing a crossword puzzle.

""I thought you said that you wanted to cook today?"" Chelsie asked.

""I did, but Mabel insisted on doing the chili. She said she never got the chance to cook it in her lifetime.""

""But she's made it lots for us.""

""What can I say? I am just helpful."" Mabel twisted her head around smiled. Her dress was covered with stains, and her arms moved rapidly. Chelsie never knew if the living Mabel was this much of a busy body. Either way, she didn't have to do chores like the rest of the house.

""By the way, your dad isn't happy with you,"" her mom said.

""Why?""

""Today, you were supposed to handle Derek. He had to do it two days in a row,"" her mom said.

""Oh no."" Chelsie ran down to the basement. Her father stood at the ping pong table drenched in sweat. 

""One more game."" A young man wearing a leather jacket jumped opposite him.

""Dad, I can take over."" Chelsie ran to her father. 

""No, he's my opponent now. Let's race."" Derek dropped the paddle and ran. Her father flailed his limbs, but he moved a few steps before almost falling.

""You lose. Let's play again,"" Derek said.

""Is it supper yet?"" he asked.

""Uh, I think it'll be a half hour,"" Chelsie said.

""I'll be there if I am still alive, but you need to cover one of my days,"" he said.

""Okay."" Chelsie left her father to get destroyed by a ghost. When she returned, her brother Michael came in from outside looking annoyed. He spotted his sister.

""Your turn with Grace."" He walked past his sister. An old woman floated to the door.

""Is this really how you keep a house? There is dust everywhere,"" she said.

""I am sorry."" Mabel stopped what she was doing and began to grovel.

""You should be. You are a waste of ectoplasm."" Grace's disgust caused Mabel to glow and shake. Chelsie ran to the matriarch.

""I want to hear about the flowers,"" Chelsie said. 

""There's nothing to hear. They're awful. Grass is horrid two."" Grace made her way to the backyard, and Chelsie followed. Mabel recovered inside.

She wished she could watch videos again, but either Grace would criticize her or Mabel would insist on cleaning it. It was hard sharing a house with ghosts who only experienced the most extreme emotions. Mabel's chili hit her nose and smelled delicious. At least one was a good cook.

1lp4qsn,n0s3sys,"I was treating a witch that added Boiled Boil Toad Oil instead of Boiled Toad Oil to a cauldron, and burnt herself, when another doctor at our hospital came in, all pale.  
""Chief...w-we have a big problem!"" he stutters.  
I look at the witch, and smile.  
""My apologies, my colleague here will continue your treatment, as another patient seems to need my attention."" I say to her, as I hand her over to the doctor.  
""Just bandage her burn, I already cleaned, and treated it with Ice Breath Grass, and a minor Dragon salve."" I say.  
He nods, and makes me hurry. I leave, wondering what is worrying him so much, after all, our hospital specializes in treating magical ailments, and injuries...what could be so bad?

  
I enter the lobby to see mages, wizards, and other magical professions in the waiting room staring at a man, alongside several nurses, and newbie doctors. He was a tall man, with scales all over his body, and...8 little stumps on his neck, growing small heads.  
I sigh.  
""Take him to Room 0, and postpone my meetings for today."" I say to one of the nurses, as I rush towards my office, to take some of the heavier magic pills.  
Entering Room 0, I saw that the stumps grew ever so slightly.  
""Warlock Ashtor, happy to make your acquaintance doctor."" he says.  
I nod.

  
""Doctor Smith, and I will take care of you today, Ashtor.  
Let me ask you, have you tried to induce a hydra bloodline into your body, and it failed?"" I ask, struggling to take a blood sample, as his blood melted all the needles I tried with.  
He shakes his head.  
""Succeeded too well. What I thought was an infant hydra blood, was actually a half-step divine hydra's heart blood, and I succeeded instantly."" he says.  
Oof...that's bad.  
""So instead of bloodline integration that you warlocks go through, you are going through complete bloodline take-over, slowly transforming into a hydra."" I ask.  
He nods.

  
I give him a 9 Suns Burning Pill, and a Golden Earth-Returning Lotus Pill.  
""The 9 Suns Pill will burn away the hydra bloodline, while the other pill will ensure you won't die in the process, and if you are lucky enough you might retain a trace of hydra bloodline, which you can use for integration."" I say.  
He shivers.  
""Will it be dangerous?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""Your chances of survival are 3 out of 10. But I will be here, casting healing magic constantly, and with herbs, and pills ready."" I say.  
""Alright. I agree, let's start."" he says, I give him a contract first, then tie him to the bed, and watch as he takes the pills. His body burns brightly, as the Lotus pill heals him instantly, his screams are terrible, but I cast a silence spell over this Room, so it won't bother the others.  
I watch as the scales turn brighter, then fall, and his stumps struggle...one moment he is human, the other hydra, as the bloodline fights back.  
I keep my focus, and maintain a steady stream of healing magic on his body, and soul, this won't be a short operation.  Then, I can't help myself, and I smile.  
This is why I became a doctor...dealing with interesting stuff like this, saving lives, is much better than waging wars, or being buried in books like other mages...",28
1lp9u52,n0u34al,"Voices warbled and rose in volume before dying down only for them to rise again in a mess of unintelligible babble that filled the large space.

The clone wearing the purple goggles that everyone called 'Purple' nudged the new arrival and nodded toward the mess of clones arguing in the gymnasium and smiled as he shook his head. 

""Don’t worry so much man. We’re gonna be fine. You said you were the last one, right?”

Pulling his hand away from his face the nervous man said, “Yeah, I’m definitely the last one.” 

“Our location is secure, nobody knows we’re here and we haven’t collapsed the timeline, or we never would have existed in the first place so whatever we end up doing, I think we’ll stop it.”

“You think so?” The man that looked identical to all the other men asked. 

The newest arrival wore no goggles at all, but he’d been chewing his nails, and the others had begun calling him ‘Chewie’. He didn’t protest the name. None of them need know who he was.

“Chewie, I’m sure of it.” Purple smiled and slapped Chewie’s shoulder reassuringly.

“What if it’s nothing like we thought?” Chewie asked after a minute.

“How do you mean?” Purple asked, eyes bouncing from one clone to the next trying to track the various conversations.

“We’ve always held that time is time and if something happens it always happened and if something unhappens it always unhappened so we can change the past and the time won’t collapse. But what if we were wrong?”

Purple smiled knowingly, he’d had this conversation a hundred times before Chewie showed up with the other clones.

“The Parkie experiments showed us that we can change things without a collapse.”

“I’m not talking about a collapse. I’m talking about something else.”

“Yeah? Like what?” Purple’s response was distracted, his interest clearly feigned.

“What if Time doesn’t want us to change this? What if Time will just do a restart of time and remove us specifically?” Chewie asked as he chewed at his cuticles.

Purple glanced at the new guy with a frown, “Remove just us? That would change time as much as the Harlikan Uprising. That doesn’t make any sense. We haven’t anthropomorphized time in years. Are you an early clone? Did Prime have you on ice?”

“I’m actually I- I’m P-” Chewie paused, “I spoke with prime very recently, just before I came. He uh, he said, he’s saying uh, well, Time is a thinking thing and it spoke to him.”

“We proved that time wasn’t ‘Time’ a few months after Parkie. Time is just a dimension, not a thinking thing.” Purple glanced at Chewie then back to the group in the gym. He felt like they’d never come to a consensus on how to stop Harlikan Massacre.

“What if we were wrong? What if we can’t do big things like this. We can do something small like Parkie but not something big like this?” Chewie asked.

“Why Parkie and not this?” Purple asked.

“Nevermind.” The new guy said and chewed at his nails with a renewed vigor.",5
1loogq7,n0p38az,"John clutched his dog tightly. They huddled together without a care. Without caring that the world all around them was collapsing. Buildings crumbled to dust. Cars were swept up into the wind and vanished in a twinkle.

They only heard each other's heartbeats, not the screams of the other humans as they were reduced to blood smears on the ground. Together, they would wait for the end of the world.

Then everything went white.

When he opened his eyes, everything was still white. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sterile equipment beeping. And the pale old man with wiry white hair standing over him.

""You can't be serious,"" the old man said, pushing up his glasses and adjusting his lab coat. ""They said you were the best. We were hoping you could save the world when the Apocalypse comes upon us. Yet simulation after simulation, all you ever cared was for your dog?""

""It was a gift from my wife,"" John arms still wrapped around thin air where a dog once was in the simulation. ""You have no idea everything I did to be free and to be with her.""

""We do,"" the scientist tried to keep a straight face. ""That's why you were chosen to prevent the Apocalypse. Our directors had hoped you would find the source of the destruction, fight any armed guards along the way, and stop it before it blows all of earth to kingdom come.""

John maintained a steely gaze. ""Why is this world worth saving? This world that would never let me retire. To live quietly in peace. Everyone who comes to me, they want something from me. They want me to kill.""

""What else would we ask of you?"" The scientist was bewildered. ""Would you prefer if this operation brought you in to rescue as many dogs and hide them in a bunker?""

""Yes.""

""Well, that wouldn't stop the Apocalypse. Or the men and women engineering it,"" the researcher was close to tearing his hair out. ""Who ought to be killed before they doom us all.""

""Perhaps that is the only way I can be free of this life,"" John stated softly.

""We can promise you freedom. A new identity. A quiet retirement.""

""That's what they all promised,"" John said. ""Every time, someone else drags me back into the fold. I'm tired. Are you not also tired from repeating this simulation over and over again?""

""One last time,"" the scientist held out one finger.

""No.""

""What would you have us do? Wait for the end?"" he was distraught. ""Just sit and die quietly? Nobody else is more suited to this mission than you are, John Wick.""

1loogq7,n0ps1yq,"“A survivor?” The old man murmured, rubbing the dried blood from his forehead, wincing when his palm connected with the scabbed over wound. “You can’t be serious. Someone survived that? Impossible” He pulled his hand away from his forehead, adjusting his glasses. The shift allowing a piece of the wound to reopen, sending a trickle of blood over the frame of his glasses. “What is that ball of fluff you're holding?” He asked, his words coming out in a daze as he held onto the table’s edge to keep his balance.
 
Damien shivered, clutching Pearl closer to his chest. The small dog tucked tightly against its owner’s body, stealing as much warmth as it could get from him. Around the cold table they sat on were several machines, some with frayed wires, while others smoked or bellowed with their last dying beeps. He didn’t feel any pain, having expected to feel a lot worse when the world flashed white, instead he felt nothing.
 
“She’s Pearl. A poodle,” Damien said, giving the dog a gentle pat. “Who are you?”
 
“Anthony? Mark? Adam? I can’t remember anymore. I’m everyone and everything. At least I was.” He again rubbed at his forehead, this time moving around the edges of his thin grey hairs, touching two shallow holes on his head that were heavily bruised. Each rub he gave around the hole made him wince, though he kept repeating the action, as if it would stir his memory.
 
“What should I call you?” As the words left Damien’s lips, the door rattled, a heavy burst of knocks coming from it.
 
“We know you’ve unplugged yourself, Victor. Get back in the chair. This is your last warning.” A no-nonsense voice shouted behind the door. Both Victor and Damien tensed, with Pearl even letting out a small squeal at the noise, burying her head further into her owner’s body.
 
“Victor, I guess.” The old man said, dragging his feet as he circled the room they were in. He dragged a bony finger against a metallic chair in the corner, reluctantly drawing closer to it. The chair reminded Damien of something you would see on death row, having a large silver bowl dangling overhead, one with two plugs that contained five thick spikes on each of the plugs. Before the old man sat, he stared at Damien, that hazy stare fading momentarily as the relaxants in his body faded. “Are you real?”
 
“I… I believe so?” Damien had never been asked that question before, and in the past, he would have been confident in answering it. Though, given what he was seeing, this had him questioning everything. That was until Pearl wiggled her head up his chest, licking the bottom of his chin, before planting her head back against his body, that being enough to convince him he was real. “I am.”

“I… created life?” The old man pushed away from the chair, approaching Damien. With a shaking hand, he gently squeezed Damien’s cheek. “I created you.”
 
“What are you doing?” Damien shifted his jaw, trying to lazily move his cheek away from the man without moving his head.
 
“VICTOR. GET. IN. THE. CHAIR.” The voice shouted, and the banging grew louder, with the reinforced door now bouncing, threatening to spill open at any moment.
 
“That’s right. I’m Victor, the head researcher here. This was the company I helped create. I reinforced my door, kept my room private, making sure they couldn’t access my files. So, my encryptions held up. Company must have changed hands, either that or the research has gotten unethical. Don’t remember anyone banging on my door like this in the past.” He theorized to himself. “And you. What is your name, my son?”
 
“Damien.” He breathed.
 
“Damien. I always wanted a boy called Damien. Could never have kids, that’s why I spent so much time doing this. Our research was simple: we plug into people’s minds and allow them to live in a reality of their creation. It’s useful for those that can’t function in society any longer. It could also potentially cure coma patients. But… how are you here?”
 
“VICTOR.” Again, the door was struck. This time, a few bolts bounced away, scattering across the floor.
 
“I don’t want to imagine what they would do if they found you. A creation pulled from my mind. I brought someone into this world. I played god. If they found out about you….” Victor grimaced. “They can’t.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t get what you're saying. I can’t be a creation of yours. I’m human. I had a life. How could you have created my whole life?”
 
“I didn’t intend to.” He said, ducking underneath the table, pulling at a panel beneath it. “Our mind’s a powerful tool. When you dream, you create a world without putting any conscious thought into it. Our machines allow us to harness that mental activity, and with some careful prompting by the machine, it generates a world using our mind’s power and creativity. Mine’s an older model, newer ones can be prompted. Say you wanted to be a hero, or a barista, you could enter that into the machine and it would steer you towards it.” He placed a wire between his teeth, pulling it with his jaw. The wire snapped, and the panel fell away, revealing a hole and ladder.

“That’s insane.” Damien said, and Pearl barked in agreement, the small white fluff ball now walking over to the old man, sniffing at the ladder he had revealed.
 
“It is. I was only in that world to gather information on how it works. Seems the man I left in charge of freeing me either died or got fired. They probably forgot all about me until my room flashed red.” He said with a dry laugh, looking at the complete disarray of his laboratory. “I’m not sure how you came out of my mind. But I can’t let you get discovered. I build an emergency escape beneath this table. Run along.”
 
The door squeaked, and Victor spotted the mean glare of the guard behind it. His face drenched with sweat, having attempted to break the door down for the last twenty minutes. Victor followed the man’s field of vision, making sure he couldn’t see Damien or the dog. It was hard to say if he had even peeked into the room, or if he had been too busy with the door to even think about trying to catch a glimpse inside. Regardless, Victor played it safe, staying on his knees, grabbing Pearl. “Come on.” He whispered to Damien.
 
Damien crawled towards the hole, and when he reached the ladder, he climbed down it, landing in a small tunnel. Victor handed the dog down the ladder before smiling. “Keep heading down the tunnel, boy. It will drop you into the Bulnar forest. Go north from there and you’ll get to town. Oh, here.” He reached into his pockets, dropping his keys and some cash down to Damien. “I live at Forty four Grooleria street. You can use my house until you figure out things on your own. Good luck.”

“Thanks?” Damien awkwardly caught the items, having to try not to drop the wiggling Pearl. After putting the items into his pockets, he lowered Pearl to the floor. “Let’s go.”
 
Victor watched Damien leave, and leaned the panel cover against the bottom of the table, not having enough time to fully put it back into place. He then went over to the machine, sat himself in it, and hit a button on its arm, gritting his teeth as the machine went back into his mind, leaving him slumped against it, drooling onto himself.  
 
The door finally came down, followed by a roaring. “VICTOR.” The heavily armored guard marching over to the chair, huffing. “You think that was funny? Making me work my ass off to break down your door?” He pulled his hand back, slapping the unconscious old man across his cheek. “Whatever. Guess it doesn’t matter as long as you're back in the chair. What a dump this room is. How long’s it been since anyone’s even been in here?” The guard went to inspect the room, only to grumble as his phone let out a soft flute jingle announcing another person had woken up. He slipped his phone from his pocket, the screen flashing a bright red with the number 022 following it. He slithered his phone back into place, heading to room 022, allowing Damien and Pearl to escape.

1loogq7,n0sw796,"Fire rained from the sky, and thunder rumbled in the distance. Inside the house, I lay curled up on the floor on a pile of blankets. Huddling trembled in my arms were Goober, Manfred, and Cheeto. Their big black eyes stared up at me as I petted the tiny bodies.

My body felt flushed, courtesy of the radiation from the bombs still raining down. I was sure they weren't doing much better. ""Don't worry, guys,"" I said softly. ""It'll all be over soon.""

Cheeto gave one tiny complaint, licked my finger, and closed her eyes, tucking her head down. One breath, then two, then ... nothing. I wanted to cry, or scream, but I was too sick and tired to do more than a ragged sigh.

Everything turned white. I stared fixedly at the ceiling, in between the two light fixtures. I had lost track of the number of simulations they had put me through.

Dr. Kepler leaned over me, blocking the light. ""Why?"" he asked, voice somewhere between agony and anger. ""Why won't you fight back? The quantum simulator shows quite simply that the survival of humanity - possibly even the survival of Earth - depends on you!""

My eyes - empty, soulless, and dry of tears, stared at his. ""You've spent the last year since the discovery of that alien vessel strapping me down and putting me through hell. Why should I save you?""

He threw up his hands and turned away, even as the table began moving, automatically adjusting my body to be released. So I could be sent back to my cell. When I was in a sitting position, the straps loosened. I could have attacked him. But I didn't bother. I'd seen his death in enough simulations.

The guards brought me back to my cell, and I immediately went to the cage, pulling them out of their hammock one at a time and cuddling them to my chest. Goober bit my finger in protest at being woken up - not hard, just enough to complain.

Jerry, one of the guards, stared at me from the door. ""You're really going to let humanity die? After everything?""

I turned to stare at him. Then I pointedly looked around my cell. ""After everything, why would I save them?""

He scowled at me. ""This is different!""

""No it's not,"" I cut him off before he could start yelling at me again. ""All the atrocities of human history, my imprisonment and daily forced hell is just a tiny drop in an ocean of evil. If I defeat those aliens, then in a thousand years, or maybe sooner, we'll be the ones dropping towards an unsuspecting planet to massacre the inhabitants.""

""We won't do that anymore,"" he tried.

I snorted. ""Humans have always done that. If you think that discovering actual alien life will change the fundamental 'kill people and take their stuff' aspect of humanity, you're more delusional than I am.""

Jerry flushed with anger, and took half a step forward. ""I oughta crush one of those little rats and teach you -""

He didn't finish the rest of the sentence. One foot lashed out, snapping his knee sideways with a loud pop. The hand not holding my babies slammed his head into the wall right on the doorframe, snapping his neck on the reinforced metal frame.

Shouting came from the corridor as the other soldiers drew weapons - tasers, batons, flashbang grenades. I stepped away from Jerry's body, my free hand raised, as Goober and Cheeto started crabbing loudly. ""They're marsupials, dumbass,"" I told his corpse.

I lay down on the bed in the cell, letting the babies get comfortable on my chest. Was he really dead? Who knew. It wouldn't be the first time I ""woke up"" straight into a new simulation, nor the first time someone I had killed showed up again. I had been through so much my brain couldn't tell what was reality and what was simulation anymore.

All i knew was that these tiny, amazingly soft creatures loved me, and I loved them, the only thing that never changed. Everything else could burn.

1loogq7,n0tygnv,"""...you can't be serious...""

""PAY UP ASSHOLE!""

To say I'm stunned would be an understatement. Stunned is when your best friend announces she's pregnant or when your dad starts sleeping on the couch to signal an impending divorce. No, this was something far beyond that. Mindboggled? Irreversibly shocked? Worried that I'm dead and this is some strange hallucination as my mind flushes those final pulses of electricity from it? Traumatized?

The small tuxedo cat I had spent the last ten years was supposed to be in my arms. When everyone's phones chimed with the announcement, the shrieks of despair echoed throughout the streets. The instantaneous onset of mourning pulled the air from the room, a final whoosh of oxygen before fire bursts forth from the door.

The bombs were coming. Too many arguments between the men who we so foolishly called our leaders had finally come to a head. A flurry of fat fingers slamming in nuclear codes, decrees that ""that'll show them"" as missile silos the world over revealed their homes in the inconspicuous dirt of your own backyard.

What was there to do? Of course I was scared. The impulse to survive flooded my body with adrenaline, a perfect execution of the human design. Except this was no lioness stalking me across a savannah. I could not outrun this, none of us could. While so many others would spend their final moments flailing against the unbreakable chains they found themselves entwined in, I would surrender to reality.

I would die with Patches in my arms.

Patches, the sweet old man who had once been a small kitten sleeping in the pouch of my hoodie. Boyfriends came and went, both of my parents died, I moved to New York City to start anew with nothing but a duffel bag in one hand and Patches's carrier in the other.

When I heard the boom, I cradled him in my arms. The last thing I would smell was the warm familiarity of his fur. How many tears had I cried into it? How many brushstrokes had been pulled through it? A lifetime of memories flashed before my eyes in the same instant as the blinding light flashed over my existence.

Death. Oblivion. Nothing. Surely that was what I had coming to me next.",12
1loogq7,n0tyhaz,"But, life appeared to have other plans. For here I was, sitting up in what appeared to be a hospital bed, still hunched into the position I'd been holding Patches in. Only the light weight of Patches had been replaced by something else entirely. The weight of a fully grown man was crushing the air out of my chest. His back pressed into me, smushing my cheek, as he rattled with laughter and pointed at the man in a white lab coat across the room.

""Jesus Christ, fine, FINE,"" the man in the coat took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes with a sleeved arm. ""You were right, I was wrong.""

""Wrong about WHAT?"" The man on my lap lifted a hand to cup dramatically against his ear. ""Remind me of this thing that you were so positive about?""

""It was my belief that you are too big of an oafish jackass to make somebody love you,"" the coated man recited dryly. ""Specifically, I said 'you are so unpleasant that you couldn't even get a woman to love you if you were a housecat'""

""SHE HELD ME WHILE SHE DIED,"" the man cackled, completely uncaring about the way he was crushing me. ""THE WORLD ENDED AND SHE LOVED ME SO MUCH SHE DIDN'T EVEN CALL HER HUMAN FRIENDS TO SAY GOODBYE.""

""$30, fair and square,"" the man in the coat pulled the crumpled bills from an inner pocket, finally causing... Patches? to leap off of me. I remained in my position, ossified by my mind's inability to catch up to the situation.

""Excellent,"" Patches thumbed through the bills as though he had a wad of millions instead of just three tens. ""Alright, drug her up and send her back out. She'll be fine.""

Patches signaled the man in the coat as he walked out of the door. In a flash as instantaneous and blinding as the one created when the bombs fell, I found myself knocked out of consciousness once more.",11

Barnaby Harris didn't know what to make of himself.

A tidal wave of expectations built over time crashes over us, defining this heaven and reducing us to starved dogs pawing desperately at the fence between us and it.

Heaven is a lifetime of memories glistening back at you from the still-shining eyes wrapped in the drooping skin of your spouse in old age.

Surely, heaven is all we could ever want. So why, Barnaby Harris found himself asking, does he find it so repulsive? And how can something so repulsive be so consuming? Those other men, the incels among us all, he understood the insidious depths of their wrath. And, yet, despite their relatability his wrath had a flavor of its own. The weight of the necessity to enter this heaven as defined by others, the way it trumped all the other things he so desperately wishes to achieve.

There's a News Years Eve party thrown in the home of his childhood best friend, Artie. Barnaby wants nothing more than to mark the turning of the calendar in good company. He has a big social circle, deep bonds with people who would fly across the country without hesitation if disaster struck you from afar. And yet, that sense of obligation, the expectation of shared decision making, that part of the alleged 'heaven' does not exist here. Barnaby loves this, loves his freedom that floats untethered even though alongside his friendships.

As the night wears on, the inevitable happens. He watches as Artie grows flush from drinking and attaches himself to his wife's side. Emi has a new boyfriend and runs her hands up and down his chest, foreplay for the impending drop of the ball. All around him people flock to their partners. Barnaby can't help it, he scans the room for the people who, like him, have no one they share an orbit with. He hates it, but it drives him like the invisible engine it is.

He must find someone. He doesn't want to find someone. His head spins but not from the alcohol. Midnight hits. A cacophony erupts around him, cheers paired with the laughs as lovers gaze into each other's eyes after kissing. This year will be theirs, they started here so very together and nothing will push them apart. In the middle of it all, three single girls squat together under a table shoving grapes into their mouth. An attempt to cast a spell that finally opens the gates of heaven for them.

It began in high school. There was a shift. Friends who spent weekend nights watching movies or playing video games still did the same thing, though Barnaby noticed people starting to move closer and closer to one another. Gabi, a fellow Sophomore, shifted herself towards Barnaby one night until her leg pressed flush against his. Artie caught Barnaby's eyes across the room, mouthing at him to grab a blanket to put over the two of them.

*Don't fumble the bag, man. You've got her all over you! You gotta show her you're down.*

And so Barnaby reached into the wicker basket beside the floral couch in Artie's basement. In a performance of chivalry, he asked if Gabi was cold, draping the blanket over both of them while she still was giving her answer. The pressure of it all sat in him like poison. He had expected this moment to be a euphoria, though the reality of this euphoria was the anxiety that tarnished it.",7
1lp7nbg,n0th3sn,"It's as Barnaby stumbles home from the party at 3am that he decides his resolution is to make those words, his internal mantra, a reality. How he longed to be like Lady Macbeth in so many ways, freed from the weakness that love and its pursuit plagues him with.

""Come you spirits,"" Barnaby is drunker than he thought as the words leave his mouth. He slouches against a telephone pole in an attempt to keep himself held up. ""Come, you spirits, that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here.""

The street is silent as his words vanish into nothingness. The anger in him is unexpected, a stowaway in the night. His mind plays back the party, spinning before him as if he were a child mesmerized by the spinning of laundry through the dryer window. 

Artie and his wife. Emi and her boyfriend. The girls eating grapes, so desperate and undignified. The sound of lips smacking together in his ear from the endless sea of couples surrounding him. His jealousy that he had no one to hold when midnight hit. The disgust with himself for caring. 

""COME, YOU SPIRITS,"" Barnaby can't stop himself from screaming. The words he had so often thought in begging now wore the ferocity of a command. ""THAT TEND ON MORTAL THOUGHTS, UNSEX ME HERE.""

Silence. A breeze blows back Barnaby's hair as if it were a lover gently tucking strands behind his ear. He stood there, uneasy in the feeling that he was not alone.

""My, my, what a persistent thing you are,"" Barnaby jumps, startled and instantaneously feeling sobered. 

""Who's there?"" he asks, fearful and stepping backwards like a cat with it's back in a defensive arch.

""We are, in your words, the spirits,"" the voice continues. ""We have watched you. We have learned intimately your greatest desire. Speak those words no more, for we grant them to you now. Wear your freedom well, Barnaby Harris, for we cast it over you now as the invisible cloak that shall forever flow in your wake.""

Another breeze, this time a lover's kiss, saying goodbye for the last time. Barnaby stands, shocked. He has never been this drunk, so drunk as to be hallucinating. With nothing else to do, he walks home. 

The next morning, he finds himself hungover and in need of strong coffee. He stands in line, one of many clad in sunglasses that give away the choices they made the night before. As he waits, he doesn't even notice all that he doesn't even notice.

The barista is a beautiful woman. She has nose ring with a glistening blue jewel that accentuates the brilliant blue in her eyes. Long blonde hair, falling so effortlessly down her back. The flirtatious tone that slips off of her tongue, her hooded eyes gleaming in invitation as she purrs Barnaby's total to him. 

He smiles and swipes his card. A perfectly normal interaction with an entirely regular person. Nothing more, nothing less.",5
1lop9vc,n0p4a7v,"I look at him, confused.  
""It is proper immortality though, right?  
Like no aging, no diseases, no dying?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""It is called complete immortality, not proper, but yes, it is.  
You have to understand, this is not necessarily a blessing, and you have to be completely willing to take my place."" he continues.  
I nod.

  
""Yeah, sure, give it."" I say.  
He frowns.  
""That's it? No deliberation? Nothing?"" he asks.  
I groan.  
""Man, you came up to me, about feeling like I could use immortality, you propose you give that immortality to me.  
You stab yourself in the neck to prove you are truly immortal...and now you are getting cold feet?"" I ask.  
He sighs.  
""You are young...and remind me of..."" he starts.  
I groan.

  
""Daughter? Wife? And you don't want to subject me to a long cursed life?"" I ask.  
He smiles.  
""You are like them, and yes.  
Immortality is not necessarily a blessing, seeing everything you once knew and loved change, seeing everyone you love die...  
Slowly, but surely, you will become an alien in your own world, even if you keep up with times."" he says.  
I sigh.  
""I get it, man, I get it...  
But right now, I am living on the streets, have more diseases, and aches than a 20 year old should have, and immortality sounds about the right thing to allow me to change my current fate."" I say, looking at the handsome, ethereal looking fella.  
He nods.

  
Stabbing his finger, a perfect drop of blood is let out.  
""Take it and..."" he starts, but I grab his finger, and suck that blood.  
He stares at me.  
""Wow...no hesitation."" he says.  
I let go of his finger, and shrug.  
""Did worse, for a loaf of bread."" I say, feeling no change yet, but a little warmth.  
""Will..."" I start, but then I see it.  
His hair started to turn white.  
He smiles.  
""Thank you. Good luck. The novels you have read, about immortality, are half-right, half-wrong, be careful, and never forget you are human."" he says, standing up and leaving.  
A few days later, a lawyer finds me, telling me my ""father"" left me all his wealth to me.  
Oddly enough, at his funeral, I cried...",257
1lop9vc,n0oz66h,"“You understand, if you take this…”

“Yes, I get it.” The hooded and cloaked man had babbled on to 2 hours, repeatedly telling me the woes of immortality. None of them outweighed the plus,” I say yes, I live forever unless I get someone to take my place.”

The gravelly voice of the hooded man turned stern,” remember I must be honest. First immortal does not mean invulnerable: cuts,bruises,sickness can and will happen. I spent 1000 years  buried in a tomb.  Death still possible but you wake a few days later healed usually somewhere different with the worse hangover headache that last for day. 
You will continue to find and lose love. You will say never again only to repeatedly forget and do it again. Heartbreak will become an unending cycle of grief, that gets harder each time you feel it. I beg, plead and strongly advise you to say no. Do you want to be immortal?”
  
“  hell yeah  I do. Give it to me”

There was a flash of light and a deafening boom and the young man was gone. 

“I should’ve known Time travel wouldn’t fix this. I knew i screwed up when I didn’t trade off before the last human died. Now there’s no one to pass this off I don’t want know what will happen to me when the sun finally goes in a few days.”",37
1lop9vc,n0q3u67,"I like the idea of this personally.

Narrative wise, it's not much a curse for immortality if you can just dip out at any time if you can just convince someone. Sure no lies, but lies aren't needed. If you're that desperate to stop living, you just need to get someone to want it. You have all the time you need, you can manipulate someone into believing what they've always wanted. Or just keep looking until someone says yes.",63
1lop9vc,n0q7o0b,"Thanks!

Yeah, the prompt is pretty awesome, though I interpret ""voluntarily""/""willing"" as truly wanting, without tricks, or manipulation.  
  
Just to make it a bit harder, but still, wouldn't be that hard, immortality has been romanticized too such a level that it's funny.",15
1lp138l,n0rcrul,"I watch, a bit baffled, as the man whom is considered a God of Madness, helps an old lady tend to her garden.  
He weeds some nasty invasive plants, and takes care of the soil, before casting a spell that brings rain.  
""Thank you, young man!"" the old lady says, giving 3 copper coins to the man.  
He thanks her... The old lady, while she is old by human standards, from what I know, the man in front of me is at least 10 thousand years old, yet...  
He doesn't care about norms.  
Lost in thought, I feel pain in my forehead.  
""Whatcha thinking?"" he grins at me, having flicked me.  
I pout.

  
""Master! Why did you do that?!"" I ask.  
He shrugs.  
""You looked lost. Also kid, I haven't yet accepted you as a disciple. Not in the mood right now to be a teacher."" he says.  
He was always like this.  
One moment I find him dining with my parents, in the Elven Palace, the next he is cleaning the public toilets for a copper coin.  
The next, the skies shatter, as he is chasing a God, trying to tattoo his own name into the God's skin.  
He is...unpredictable.

  
""You said you would teach me... Pass on the knowledge you accumulated."" I say.  
He laughs.  
""What I know can drive you insane."" he says.  
""Worth it, if I can be as strong as you are."" I say, smiling. Indeed. I needed his strength. Our family needed me to become strong, or...  
""You really want to know how I can do all this and more?"" he asks, as he snaps his fingers, and I find myself in a huge crystal palace, and around us fly phoenixes, dragons, and divine beasts, ignoring us.  
I nod.  
""This all...is but a simulation. If you know that nothing is real, then you can make anything that is not real, real."" he says.  
It hurts my brain.

  
""What?"" I ask.  
He sighs.  
""I knew you wouldn't believe me, but, listen. Imagine this world is a game."" he starts.  
I nod.  
""Then, nothing is real, but lines of code, 0, and 1."" he continues, but I am lost already.  
""And if nothing is real, then anything you can imagine, can be done, and made real, just turning the illusory into real. Like this."" he says, waving his hands, and an entire forest appearing around us.  
I gasp.  
""Teach me!"" I say, and he sighs.  
""I just did..."" he mutters, before he knocks me out.  
""I will put you in an illusion, will see if you have talent to break reality, like I do."" were the lasts words I heard, before finding myself back home...as my family was dying to the attack of the demons.  
My worst nightmare...and he put me into it?  
Truly, a God of Madness he is, but this is exactly what I need, so I take my spear, and rush towards the enemy, hoping I can learn to create new spells, or weapons out of nothing like Master can.  
I had to save my family.",12
1louaem,n0pyjg2,"The young god stood silently before the pitiful shell of Zeus. The grand temple that once carried his booming voice now lay in ruin and the pantheon was nowhere in sight, save for the sickly old man in front of him. 


""You grew fat and drunk on their worship, old man. I cannot imagine a worse fate for your lot, much as I'd like to.""


""If you have come for Olympus, then you may have it, such as it is."" 



The corner of his mouth lifted in a slight smile, but a cough erupted from his lungs. In his fit, his eyes did not stray from his progeny. 



""You would gift this broken realm to me, believing it a futile gesture, but I have not come alone."" The young god did not return Zeus's sick smile. ""We have come to return Olympus to its former glory. We have become strong without the belief of your cattle.""


Zeus's eyes widened and fear gripped him. 


He beheld the rest of his nameless, exiled children, weapons in hand. Their expressions did not betray their thoughts, they were as the glorious, stoic, marble statues that once lined his halls. 


""Ah, but I was of the belief that he had died with the rest, but there he sits, clinging to life from the whispers of his pathetic myth."" 

The young gods who had been cast into an abyss of eternal nothingness had come for him.

""I could still make you suffer, break you, maybe exile you as you exiled me!  
I was a minor god gaining popularity fast, and because of your paranoia that I will replace you!"" he roars at me.  
The other barely react, just hanging there, but I...I laugh.  
""Aristaeus, you started to be loved by mortals indeed, but you have been exiled because you wanted more, and more, trying to spread the Gods' knowledge freely to mortals.  
Hephaestus caught you trying to steal one of his automatons, while Athena saw you copying her scrolls!"" I say.  
""ZEUS! I made the mortals' life easier!  
And you, you shall suffer for what you did to me!"" he booms.  
I laugh.

  
""Do your worst!  
It can't be worse than fading away, turning from the Ruler of The Skies, of Judgement, of Oaths, into nothing but a perv! Someone who is used as a bad example?  
And just like every other God, we all have become characters and nothing more.  
The mortals have forgotten us!  
They don't believe we exist, and think we are only stories!  
What do you think you can do to us? Make us disappear?   
It's already happening, we are barely hanging by a thread!"" I say.  
He grits his teeth, and slaps me.  
I slam into the pillars of the Throne Hall, a mere slap making me flicker in and out of existence.

  
""You...  
Even in death, still think you are the God of Gods.  
Don't you see that I, as a minor god am still well, and strong?"" he says.  
I freeze.  
He is right.  
""My name is not known, but my domain prospers, because I wasn't dumb enough to tie myself directly to my name."" he smirks.  
I snort.  
""Yeah, because that was a choice, not a boon for being someone relatively unknown."" I say.  
He sighs.

  
""This is such a letdown.  
I came back, hoping to make you suffer, to conquer and destroy you, but you already did that all.  
The mortals did it."" he says.  
I look at my siblings, still in stasis.  
""You are right, I can't imagine a way to make you suffer a worse fate than what you are already going through.  
So I will only tell you this: I am off to my mansion in the mortal realm, ready to party, and be idolitrized by them."" he says, disappearing.  
I flicker in and out of existence, as I go towards...Athena.  
""I know you hate this daughter...but you are the only one I think can do it.  
Help us return, in one form or another."" I mutter, as I channel the remaining power I, and the other Olympians have into Athena.  
As I feel nothingness embrace me, I hear Athena's promise, and smile.  
I know she can find a way, if that Aristaeus could...",17
1louaem,n0tfxlz,"""You've nothing to draw from, Zeus. You are but a fragile remnant of an age long past. If you would die here, it will not be by my hand. I will not sully my blade with your decrepit blood.""

The young god stepped aside. ""My brethren may feel differently, however, and so, to them I defer.""

Zeus saw himself in this lost child. His golden locks, and fierce but reserved gaze revealed his character to him. A leader, tempered by hardship but never unwound by cruelty. He then saw another aspect of himself in the man who approached. His unforgiving rage. 

""Lo and behold!"" The man shouted. ""Zeus himself rises to meet me in glorious combat! Your bones creak under the weight of your failures! And still! He rises! Come! I will lay you back on the ground, so tired you must be!""

The man strode proudly to Zeus, smiling heartily, but Zeus was no fool. It was a show of a teeth. This one's eyes burned with a hatred deeper and blacker than the pit into which he was cast. His skin was pale and he bore scars across his once beautiful face.

Zeus braced himself and began to call forth what little power lay dormant in him. The air crackled and the familiar, faint, current of godhood began to flow through him, albeit weakly. The Golden One looked on, his stoic expression unchanging. 

The Scarred One began to run toward Zeus, throwing his blade to the ground, overcome by a bloodthirst eons unquenched.",12

A Hospital

Me...or so I had thought...unconscious in a hospital, with my grieving parents at my side.

""Gabriel has no higher brain function.  He will never get better"" explained the doctor.  ""Strapped to life support, left in this vegetative state, that is all that is left""

""We should pray"" begged mom. ""How can god let this happen??""

It was my first memory of my life...awakening in the hospital bed, as the doctor looked utterly astonished at the vitals monitors suddenly displaying normal values.

""It was the first thing I remember, Saint Peter.  Being in that room, being told that I'd nearly drowned.""

""But you aren't Gabriel.  We sent you, into an empty vessel, to do good on Earth, starting with rewarding the faith of those parents, and the many good works you've done in the seventy years afterward.""

""So then, this work I am to do?""

""You've already demonstrated that you can BE the miracle that gives others faith.  There are many others who need that in their lives.

1lor8rd,n0pdtez,"Everything I was watching defied what I’d been taught in basic. With the discovery of space and time travel, talks of religion and the following of God, Allah, or any other name the “Creator” had gone by, had all but died. But then, on my three thousand, eight hundred and fifty-second shift, I saw Jesus raise his head, and pull his arm forward through the nails that bound him. Blood spattered, flesh tore, and bone cracked and broke as he pulled himself free of the crucifix. And just as soon as he was free, his bone bent back into place, his blood vanishing from the stones below, and his muscle contracted back into place. He floated down from the cross, the flames that were supposed to burn hugged him like an old friend. People looked at one another, shock, fear, and many other emotions rippling across their faces as He stared at them. And then the first man fell to his knees in worship. And he was followed by a sea of bowing heads and the cracking of knees against stone. It took me a minute to realize that I was the only one still standing. And He looked at me. 
“What will you do now, Nathaniel?” 
My body shook. He knew my name, and spoke it in a tongue that has yet to be born. And my hand falls to my side, grasping the cold handle of my standard issue plasma shooter. And he looks sad.
“It’s all real? God, heaven, hell, all of it?” I question, my world spinning around me.
He gives me a soft smile. “Many things are exaggerated. I can’t begin to tell you all of them. But I can tell you you’re on a good path. You’re good to simply because you wish to be. Not many are like that where you’re from.” 
My hair stands on end. His eyes are kind, but his gaze feels like I’m standing directly under the sun. “Why now? Why not any other time? Why not free yourself the first time?” The questions spill out before I can even think them properly, like I was compelled to say them.
“Because I’ve seen the world over and over. I’ve given humanity the chance to lead themselves. Yet the path remains the same. Hate, distrust, betrayal. And once humanity unites beneath the stars, those feels turn to other species, who are the same way. And I simply can’t stand by anymore while humanity leads itself astray.”
His words feel final, like something clicking into place.  And frozen. I don’t know what to do. God is real. Jesus refuses to let himself be sacrificed. And all I can think is protocol. And it tells me my next move is to execute him. To try and keep the future as on track as I can. 
I close my hand around my pistol and pull it free, aiming it between his eyes, and his face softens even more somehow. He looks at me, but he’s not disappointed, not furious. Just sad. His eyes feel like a thousand stares, and the weight of my badge under my disguise feels like tungsten. And I let my arm fall to my side, and let my knees crack against the ground.

That's the job title every kid dreamed to be growing up. That's what I dreamed to be growing up. Thankfully, I showed the required spiritual and mental aptitude when I was 5 years old. That's three years younger than average, giving me an advantage over other kids in my generation. 

A three year advantage might sound like a lot, but in truth it's a drop in the bucket compared to the 50 year Initiate training required to then compete to be the Chosen. 

Fifty years of spiritual training. From the grueling endurance training to the delicate precision training. What the Keeper actually does is kept secret, as it involves the survival of humanity. However, everybody knows that it needs a godlike amount of spiritual power. Every single waking hour dedicated to increasing the volume, quality, and control of our spiritual power. Many failed in childhood, failing to withstand the soul-sucking regime of Initiate training. Yet, still more aspire to be the Keeper, to forever etch their name as the Hope of Humanity. 

Every 17 years, only one would be chosen from the Initiates to be the Keeper while the rest can only lament their failed efforts to then fade into obscurity.

I made the most out of my slim time advantage and now, finally, I pulled ahead of the competition. 

In the summer of 5078, what was merely a childhood dream became my reality. Me, the Hope of Humanity, the 179th Keeper of the Harvest.

“Yeah, bro. Just feed ‘em spiritual power.” 

The 178th Keeper of the Harvest sat in front of me in a loose and ragged tank shirt and shorts. He was sitting on a faded pink plastic stool, his toes wiggling on his dangling flip-flops. I was sitting there in my full official regalia looking extremely out of place. I would never have imagined that my predecessor would be this… casual.

Wait, no, that's not the point! What the f*ck is feeding bugs? 

I shook my head twice, in the hopes of catching my mind that was desperately escaping reality.

Looking around, we were sitting in the middle of a massive underground area of which no edges could be seen. A “tree” taller than any skyscraper and made of an unknown metal looms over us. The “sky” above our heads is blue and the fake “sun” feels as warm as the summer sun outside.

After my inauguration, I had traveled for several days in multiple government vehicles, with decoys thrown in so many times, the drivers and pilots would not have known whether or not they were bringing the genuine Keeper nor the actual destination. At the end, I was physically exhausted with only my excitement driving me onwards.

Now? Now I’m just exhausted.

“Fifty years of training? Just to feed bugs?” I asked, feeling hollowed out.

“Well, yeah. They're something called periodical cicadas to be precise. Only renewable thing left on earth that we humans can eat, you see.” my unkempt senior looked at me with kind eyes. 

“They teach you about the Great Cataclysm at the Academy, right? Yeah, bro. Almost all edible plants and animals slowly died out until we only had these cicadas left. The trees that they feed off of eventually died out, too. Thankfully, in 2035 we found that we can replace it with spiritual power. The first Keeper of the Harvest was born.”

“Their life cycle is 17 years, so each Keeper is in charge of feeding them spiritual power every day. Then at the end of 17 years we harvest the mature cicadas after they finish laying eggs.”

“Why only one Keeper each time? Well, that's because based on the government AI’s calculations, an average person’s spiritual power is enough to feed a harvest for all of us. But don't worry, we actually have backup broods elsewhere.”

“Anyone could grow their own brood so why we still need Initiates and Keepers? Haha you ask the hard questions, huh bro! Well, you didn't hear it from me, but I THINK that's how the government AI keeps us in line. Set up a system for a chosen hero from the masses, layer it with some narrative about human persistence, then have the government act as the good guy. Although, in their defense, I think it's best way to ensure our survival. After all, us humans like to destroy things if we're given too much power and agency.”

“Anyway, bro nice meeting you, but I’m outta here. Government got a retirement place for us ex-Keepers in Hawaii. See you in 17 years!”",36
1lopgtr,n0p6wbi,"I am taken to an underground facility, by an escort of 12 soldiers.  
Going through seemingly endless, repeating hallways, we arrive at a door.  
The soldiers tense up.  
""We are here, lady.  
Inside, your predecessor shall explain the rules.  
Thank you for your service."" the leader says, straining to look at me.  
I nod, and wonder.  
What is behind that door?

  
I enter, and as the door slams shut, I focus on the room.  
A pure white room, with a bed...on the side, there is another open door, that from what I see leads to a bathroom.  
In the middle of the room is a lone chair, on which a man is sitting.  
""Ah, my replacement. Have you won the ""lottery"" and gained the ""perfect"" job?"" he chuckles.  
I nod.  
He stands up, and now I can see that in front of the chair...there is a crack.  
For some reason, I shiver.  
That crack...is floating mid-air.

  
""Yep. That is the main focus of our job.  
Watching the crack, 24/7.  
Any anomaly, be it size growth, or shrinkage, voices, whispers, screams, buzzing, or objects falling through, needs to be reported."" he says, taking out a tablet from under the pillow.  
He gives it to me.  
""That's the gist of it. Questions?"" he continues.  
""Why are we doing this? What is the crack? Why 17 years?"" I ask.  
He smiles.  
""Good questions."" he says, stretching.  
I frown.

  
""Well, we are doing this, because that crack is seemingly impossible.  
A tear in reality? In space? A wound? We don't know.  
And why?  
Because the very first time it appeared, out fell an object that created our ""utopia"", while exactly 17 years later, a poison mist spread, almost sinking into the core of the planet."" he says.  
I am confused...what?  
Our world's peace and development is due to...that crack?  
And at the same time...this crack could potentially destroy the world?  
""You will have time to think about possibilities, after all...17 years is a long time.  
Good luck."" he says, leaving.  
As the door closes, the tablet lights up.  
When I get food, or when I can order something for myself, and how often I have to report on the crack's stats appears on the screen.  
Now...it is my turn to watch it.",53
1lopgtr,n0p0ubu,"*See you in 17 years.* Her escort gently closed the door. If it wasn’t so quiet in the wood-paneled room Autumn now stood in, she wouldn’t have heard the almost inaudible whirr of the automatic lock on the other side. 

*89 years old*. She did the simple arithmetic on the car ride over here. That’s how old she’d be when she finally left this place. She still didn’t know why they chose her for the job. She still didn’t know what the job was. Every 17 years, the world held its breath and exhaled disappointment. She hoped she could be the one to break this cycle.

*She looks like she’s only 15*, Autumn thought. A girl (young woman?) stood up from the leather armchair in the middle of what Autumn now recognized as a converted old-school library and approached Autumn with a shy smile, eyes focused on a point just behind Autumn. 

*20 seconds*. That’s around how long it took her to get to Autumn. Autumn wasn’t exactly sure how much time had transpired. She was so nervous. Maybe she was just counting the clicks of the young woman’s practical kitten heels against the hardwood. Why should she be so afraid of a young woman anyway? *I could be her grandmother!* She fixed her posture and hoped she looked presentable in the light blue jeans and patched up puffer jacket she hastily threw on this morning. Her eyes trailed over the young woman’s smart herringbone slacks and cable knit fisherman’s sweater.

*4 fingers.* The young woman’s pinky finger was missing entirely. The young woman held out her hand to Autumn. Like the crisp dry leaves of her namesake, Autumn’s trembling hand fell through the air into the young woman’s. *Hello Autumn. I’m pleased to make your acquantaince. The world is in danger, and we only have one chance left. You’re going to help me save it.*

*1 blink* before Autumn fainted, and the young woman called for help.",44
1lp4oxs,n0sku04,"The Slime was cooking eggs in the kitchen, one of the few meals he could make that was actually palatable.  Major Frost busied himself with setting the table, aligning the cutlery and folding napkins.  As a finishing touch, he made a quick instant ice sculpture of the heroic Captain Freedom picking his nose.  It always made The Slime smile, something that rarely happened after the Freedom League completely kicked their asses in that last fiasco less than 72 hours ago.

""Two minutes!"" hollered The Slime, his words punctuated by the sound of the toaster popping up.

Frost took a moment to look around the apartment, solely his until he had invited The Slime to hide out here.  The walls were covered with tacky movie posters, blueprints of random buildings and an exploded version of his very first Freeze Gun.  It had died at the worst time, but it still held sentimental value, so he had taken the time to turn it into a piece of art.  Surprisingly, The Slime didn't have much to bring to the apartment and left zero mess in his wake.  His tendency to absorb all sorts of debris, dust and other random things as part of his powers actually made the apartment cleaner than before.

Frost blinked as full plates hit the table, pulling him out of his musings.  The eggs looked perfectly cooked, like something out of a food magazine cover photo.  Crispy bacon peeked out from under the eggs, and two diagonally-sliced pieces of toast completed the picture.  Sliding into his seat, fork instantly at the ready, Frost waited while The Slime mumbled a prayer under his breath before digging in.

He gave a satisfied groan of pleasure before remarking ""You could open a breakfast-themed restaurant just based on your eggs, you known?""

The Slime gave a short laugh and gestured to himself, ""Like anyone would eat food I cook looking as I do?"" as the undulating rolls of slime, slowly flowing downwards with gravity, blurred his features.

""Their loss,"" Major Frost stated before popping a delicious piece of bacon into his mouth.

They turned their attention to the television, which had stopped the 50s movie marathon with a breaking news story.  The elegantly coifed reporter was breathlessly talking about the efforts of the Freedom League and that they had just captured the last of the villain group, minus two, who had threatened the city just days before.  Police mugshots of both Major Frost and The Slime were presented on the screen with a hotline number for citizens to call.  The two men looked at each other and nodded.

""Guess we're laying low for a couple more weeks,"" said Frost.",6
1lop0oz,n0oxqgf,"At first it was an occurrence I expected to be a one-off variable.

Then the monsters kept coming from a rift in the deep ocean (damn the seaborn!), then in certain low-hab wild-regions (damn the cultists!), then from space (damn the xenos!), and the weapons were cumbersome due to their initial use cases being 'for installation on mobile heavy weapons platforms for industrial renovation purposes' and 'removal of paracausal threats'.

Such as said 'magical girls'.

But given the circumstances and their treatment of me being more of a weird arms-dealer, I have decided to escalate things.

I contact the cult and hire them to summon forth the injured and dying monsters.

I augment said monsters, and give them a new deal that actually sees them switch sides.

And then employ said monsters alongside specialised forces (thanks to intranational governmental support via numerous legal and quasi-legal channels; none of my work is illegal, sans the 'treatment' of the augmented summoned beings).

...After that the magical girls somehow corrupted the augmented monsters and turned them into women, and the cultists keep summoning more monster women, who work with the magical girls, to fight the giant eldritch monsters and -literal- demons that are coming from space.

Not sure what happened to the deep-ocean gateways, but whatever was responsible gave up on them - got a cryptic notification one morning about it.

Anyway, after a necessary addition to workplace policy ('if you are a single male, please be mentally and physically prepared for intense spatial violation by incredibly friendly human-feminine-adjacent lifeforms'), I opted to go through with some experimental arcane infusion and...

Let's just say I walked the path of the DOOM Slayer. Went out there myself and tore the demons in twain, every one, some by hand, some by saw-shield, some by gun, some by chainsaw...

They recognised who I styled myself after. I looked like him anyway; should've done this from the start.  
...I should investigate that later.

Anyway, the magical girls have started to throw money at me for commissioned hardware.  
Not going to turn that down on the condition that they work alongside my forces on this campaign against what can only be described as 'The forces of Hell itself'.

. . .

They agreed. Sure, they be fighting alongside cyborg monsters and demons and monstergirls, and myself, but we've been doing, ultimately, the right thing.

Not one of those 'DOOMed' demons is getting their messy claws and big guts on anyone who lives on this Earth.

...Now, how do I navigate conversations rife with innuendo? These magical girls are trying to corner me and I feel the monstergirls have been helping them...",42
1lop0oz,n0p5l7n,"I changed the traps, the layout of the hideout countless times.  
How?  
How do those magical girls keep breaking in?  
And why?  
Theoretically, I am the villain, and they are the heroes.  
So why to they steal, while I am in the middle of my plan making sessions?  
And the worst part is...  
That even now, that I have them captured in a plasma cage...they laugh, thinking I am a goofy, kooky side character!

  
""Okay, old man, you made your point."" one of them chirps.  
""Yeah, yeah, we will ask next time, after taking the weapons."" another one smiles.  
I groan.  
""After? Don't you realize the situation you are in?!  
I could erase you!"" I say.  
They giggle.  
""Sure, you would kill us.  
Riiight..."" they laugh.  
I sigh, freeing them.

  
""What? No more killing?"" they tease.  
I frown, and press another button.  
Suddenly, their transformation is undone, and in front of me are 5 teen girls.  
They pale.  
""W-what have you done?!"" the redhead asks, almost jumping at me.  
""Proving that you shouldn't underestimate me, just because I have never damaged or hurt anything, or anyone."" I say.  
They pout.  
Why do they have to be right though? And why do they have to be classmates of my granddaughter?  
I sigh, and give their powers back.

  
""While I am upset about the stealing part, we could work out a cooperation deal."" I say.  
They stare warily at me.  
""What kind of cooperation?"" they ask.  
""While I am a villain, and have worked against the government for personal reasons, I am a citizen of the city, and of the world.  
The monsters invading us from space, and from the depths of the oceans are my enemy as well.  
So, you are free to take my weapons, and even order custom made ones...but you are not to steal anymore, and you are to focus on your school work."" I say.  
They nod, before paling even more.  
""Y-you know who we are, don't you?"" they stutter.  
I chuckle, and nod, as I press another button, sending them flying out of my hideout.  
Seeing them surprised, and caught unaware does warm my heart...",21
1lob8sq,n0m2v13,"I couldn’t take it anymore.

Day after day I spent in our little cottage on the edge of town, trying to ignore the whispers. Ducking beneath the windows. Hiding in the attic when visitors came.

That was the first rule imposed on me: don’t, under any circumstance, let anyone see you. The village knew you had died in that fire, if they saw you they would think they’d gone insane. 

At first, I thought I could manage it. I thought I could handle seeing old friends pass the cottage, throwing sorrowful looks through the windows as though they knew I was there. I thought I could handle having no one but the same six members of my family to talk to.

And don’t even get me started on the whispers.

They were inescapable, haunting me wherever I went in this small cottage like a hound of ghosts. There was nowhere to hide.

At first they tried to hide it. My parents would stop their mumbled conversations when I came down for dinner, my sister would smile at me pitifully like you would a kid with cancer, my once no-nonsense aunt would sneak me ice cream for breakfast. 

But eventually they couldn’t hide it anymore- something was wrong with the ritual. I only wished I knew what. 

They had me try everything: staring into the mirror, watching myself sleep, having my physician uncle do all sorts of check ups. Nothing stopped the whispers, only now they didn’t bother to hide them. 

“Do you know how much we sacrificed to bring you back to life?” My mother would say whenever I’d beg to know what was going on. “You should be grateful.”

And I was, truly. But this wasn’t life. This was torture. 

That was why, one night when I couldn’t take it anymore, I snuck down the stairs and scurried out the door.

I wasn’t going to talk to anyone, of course. I just wanted to feel the cold air on my skin, wanted to gaze up at the moon like anybody else. Like I used to. 

I found the cozy little clearing I once spent hours stargazing at, just a five minute walk from home. I’d only stay for five more. Just five minutes of nothing but me and the moon.

It wasn’t ideal, but it would do.

Only I must’ve lost track of time out there, staring up at the moon from my spot on the ground, because all of a sudden I heard the leaves crunch. 

I whipped my head around to meet the gaze of an elderly woman.

“What’s a boy like you doing out here?”

Crap. If my parents found out id been spotted, they’ll lock me in my room for the rest of my life.

I got up intending to run away, but paused. It was only some old woman, after all. She probably didn’t even know who I was.

What was the harm in talking to her a little?

“Just…stargazing.”

“Ah, I see,” she said, grinning. “Well I must say you’ve picked the perfect spot for it.”

I smiled. “What about you?”

“Just picking some berries nearby. Although…” She cocked her head at me. “I must say I don’t recognize you.”

“I’m, uh, from out of town.”

“I see.” She glanced over my shoulder. “Oh my, is that the cottage I’ve been hearing so much about?” 

“What do you mean?” I asked carefully. 

“Well I heard there was a great fire, although they managed to rebuild it. A shame, though, what happened,” she sighed. 

I nodded sadly. “It really is.”

“I wonder if the village will ever re-sell it or keep it as a memorial. 

“You mean the family?”

“Why, no.” She gave me a strange look. “It’s the town’s property now.”

A cold chill went down my spine. “What do you mean?” 

“Oh, honey, you don’t know? That entire family passed away in the fire. They’ve been dead for years.”",657
1lob8sq,n0mm2km,"To exist is a transactional thing.

We have dressed up our society as a series of exchanges. A basket of berries for your wolf pelt. Teas for spices. Coins for bread. A swipe of a card for a new mattress. These are the interactions that make our material world go round.

But what of the world within us? The world we cannot see in which we make trades that we so often don't even notice?

You fall in love and it sends a piece of your heart flying into the chest of another. Your child dies, and as you watch them lowering into the ground, a cold chill sweeps over you and blows some intangible part of you into the grave to be buried as well. A mentor whose words hold the weight of the world snaps at you in criticism and you are helpless as you watch a piece of your confidence flake off to wither on the ground like an autumn leaf.

And death? The transaction with death is everything. Every bit of you falls into death's arms, cradled like the weightless thing you ultimately are. A series of bones, still-bleeding lumps of flesh, and the frantic energy of a soul fractured and swirling around the bits and pieces that once could have been called you.

If death takes all, then surely it would not hand it back without a price. To hold all of you then find itself with none, what sort of a transaction would that be for an entity so merciful and merciless? So greedy, so selfless.

You wake up floating in a pool of water. The water is body temperature warm and comfortable, not too dissimilar to when you still swam within your mother, you think. Though you would have been sufficiently buoyant on your own, hands surround you and hold up your back, arms, and legs. Air enters your lungs with a shakiness as if you were learning to walk again. Chanting slows as your eyes adjust to the light.

Cheers. The jubilant cries of thank you to the forces above and around us. You are home son, you hear a sea of relatives roaring in a garble that hits your still submerged ears. Welcome home.",95
1lob8sq,n0n3grt,"The last few days had been a blur. First, nothingness. Actually less than that. Like the time before you were born, but with the context of being painfully aware of it. The gap was punctuated by the knowledge that Otis had in fact died. Most in his life had taken his return first with a bit of shock, like they’d seen a ghost at first. Which was understandable, expected even. This he could work with, nothing a bit of time wouldn’t heal.

His parents though. They looked at him worse than that. Their barely hidden grimaces as he spoke. The way the conversation paused slightly when he entered the room. Mother was worse in this, she’d always held her emotions right on her sleeve. Father, stoic as ever, was harder to read. His usual reserved enthusiasm nearly extinguished. Replaced with a reservation that Otis tried not to read as disappointment. 

Otis sensed it all as a wrongness, which he couldn’t work out. He’d investigated himself closer than ever before. He stood in the mirror for hours inspecting each pore and curve. Had his eyes always had those flecks of yellow just above the pupil? His jaw had always favoured the left side when closed, but had it shifted further? His skin looked paler than before. Otis tried to shrug this off, he had spent several days without circulation.

He found himself lying awake that night, pondering his existence. There was an emptiness within. Hunger. On these nights he’d found no snack would quell the desire. Yet he gave in to the temptation anyway. He arose from the bed, donned a slightly too big robe. He’d take some time to fill it back out again, and headed towards the kitchen. He took a sharp left, silently praising himself for not going the wrong direction. He swore it had been right before the incident, but his mind struggled with those details. He took care with his steps, the floor had a habit of creaking which might awake his parents. He didn’t want to worry them. Rebirthed boys wandering around at night might worry folk. As he rounded a corner he saw there was light already peeking out from the door left ajar. He approached, maintaining the tip-toe movement. 

“This is all your fault,” mothers pointed voice eeked through the gap.

“Mine? Mine?” father’s voice struggled to keep low as it cracked, “I followed the ritual exactly. We couldn’t have known…”

“That it would bring back the wrong twin? Well there was a mistake somewhere.”

“Their forms were nearly identical. Perhaps their essence too. But now we must live with our mistake. He must never know.”

Unable to bear it any longer, Otis stormed through the door. 

“Good evening, son.” Mother spun towards the door, she dabbed at her wet eyes with a velvet sleeve. Behind her, half prepared vegetables sat on the chopping board, alongside her favourite knife. Otis always wondered why mother bothered to cook herself when they had so much help. Father had long since stopped urging her to stop. She’d refused to let their servants cook for them and despised the idea of a conjured meal.

“You should get yourself some rest, lad.” Dad stepped forward as if to embrace, as ever he wore an ornate jacket. White cuffs pointed towards Otis joined a navy breast with finely woven lapels.

“Don’t touch me.” Otis stepped back. “I want… No, I need the truth.”

“What do you mean?”

“I heard what you said. The wrong twin? I don’t even have a brother. But I see the way you look at me, like I’m wrong. A disappointment.”

They both shrank at that.",33
1lob8sq,n0mz0r2,"Memories. 

That's the key. I've been awake now for just about a week, and I have no memory of what was happening before that. Sister Celia, tells me ""Don't worry things will be better soon."" but she looks away troubled. 

Brother Idaho, with his bushy beard mumbles around me. He scared. A man his size shouldn't be scared. He's a mountain of a man, and the floorboards creak and grown when he moves across them.  

I'm still sleepy most of the time. Those two are keeping the rest of the family out of my room, but I can hear the whispers of ""How different he is"" and ""Where is mother? She'd know how to handle him. 

I can name the people, Brother Andrew the bold, Brother Tim the befuddled, Sister 'Tasha, and Sister Jane, who everyone knows can't sing, but who hums off key always when performing her chores. But I can't recall my name. 

Celia, tells me I'm David. We don't call each other Brother and Sister alone, but we're the only ones who don't. I'm not sure why.  Brother Idaho, has been crying lately, though he tries to hide it. The puffy red eyes, the quick wipe of his face before he turns to see a person it's all telling.

They've given me a spellbook. I'm supposed to study it, It's supposed to jog my memory. But all the spells are wrong, they don't work the way the pages say they ought to. I know this, I've tried the charms but I can feel the magic is off.  The effects are too weak to be useful. 

Today I'm trying the spell magelight. It says that it reveals what's hidden to the unseeing eyes. As I chant the spell, the book is changing. Extra instructions appear, notes scrawled in the margins dance into being. Excited I flip to the beginning to see what I missed before. In the table of contents a previously blank page shows ""A spell for revival and healing"" and as I flip to it the pages state this spell will heal ALL WOUNDS up to and including DEATH.  But the spell requires that a willing participant must take on the wounds of the recipient. So if death is to be reversed, there must be a sacrifice of a person's life. 

It appears the ritual must have been done to me. I am in perfect health. But what wound has healed? Why can I not remember? 

Celia sees me reading the spell and says ""Now David, you aren't ready for that. Mother said you aren't to be meddling with others right now."" Especially it seems since you aren't the same David that we all knew.  

Seeing that Celia is strangely formal on this I say, ""Sister...""

Before I can finish she hushes me. ""I am Sister Celia no more. With Mother's last act she gave of herself too much and Mother passed away.""

Placing her finger on my lips she said ""You should call me properly around the others. I am Mother Celia now"" 

Closing the book she leaned over to me and kissed my forehead.  

""Rest for now, Father. You have been unwell and we have restored you.""

My eyelids heavy I return to the bed. 

""Mother?"" I question as Celia tucks me in.

""Yes?""

""Sing me a lullaby.""

""Of course Father dear.""

And as Celia starts to sing I feel my eyes close and drift off to the lands beyond the waking world.",44
1lob8sq,n0ns4yb,"I remember, I was running downtown—my heart pounding harshly in my ears, my breath jagged and uneven, my feet sore from the eleven-mile journey. A dead man’s memories were twisting my reality. I just had to follow the signs. “Wrong Way.” I didn’t go down that street. A green arrow on the traffic light. I went left as commanded. A crosswalk sign’s bright, emaciated figure beckoned me to change directions. Pain in the intersection. 

Dying ain’t no walk in the park—unless you’re murdered in one. For one thing, it’s painful. It’s so painful it literally kills you.

But when you die, you aren’t gone. You’re disassembled, but the parts of you that observe keep on observing. My family had been looking for me, and when the world warped, distorted and danced, my father’s blue Dodge Ram stopped and hummed alongside my corpse.

I felt the thud as I was loaded into the truck bed. I smelled the exhaust as we sped off. I heard my step-mother’s scream as she saw my remains.

“Get the book,” my father said. The chants were in a strange language. Probably Latin.

I woke up in a hospital—a psychiatric hospital. No sign of injury from the silver, speeding Honda Odyssey with the busted headlight that shattered my bones.

It’s a big, white room filled with navy blue dialysis chairs; a long, smudged window on the starboard wall—doctors and nurses watch us from behind, security cameras pointed down at us. I feel sorry for the patients that already feel like they are being watched.

“Jack?” asked the man in maroon scrubs holding a clipboard. Never trust a man with a clipboard; he literally has an agenda.

“Yes?” I said. I figured I’d best be curt; if I told him anything more about my guiding ghost he’d probably think I’m crazy. His eyes moved slowly—lethargic. I could tell from his flat tone that he was sick of having to deal with genuinely schizophrenic patients and unhoused folks the cops routinely picked up off the streets. To him I probably was just another one of them. I’d prove I was sane.

“Are you having any thoughts of self-harm?”

“No.”

“Any thoughts of harming others?”

“No.”

“Hearing any voices or seeing anything that’s not there?”

I paused. How would I know if anything I was seeing wasn’t really there? I realized I’d hesitated.

“Damn,” I thought. ”He might think I’m crazy—I better explain my hesitation.""  

“I don’t think so?” I said. “How would I know if what I’m seeing isn’t really there?”

He chuckled and didn’t say a word. I broke his script and a light flickered behind his eyes—then faded back to the usual lifeless gray.

Maybe I had proved I was sane.

There’s nothing to do other than eat stale string cheese and crumbled crackers and watch the pathetically small TV play movies I had already seen. When my family visits, they say I didn’t die, that I was just crazy, that it was all just a hallucination.

But I remember the ritual. I hear them whisper about me. I know.",22
1lob8sq,n0prqnt,"The first thing I remember since my death was my family surrounding me, hugging and shouting as they circled around the kitchen table to welcome me back.
The second was a look of utter confusion on their faces as they observed me further. 
Third was the shared mission between them all as they helped me off the table, wrapping me in the white sheet I had woken up under. I had noticed blood on it, but dismissed it at the time. After all, I had been dead just moments before.

All things considered, I had taken my resurrection well at first. The town never knew I had died so life simply resumed as if i had just returned from a short holiday. That is, until a year later I tried to take a real one for myself to the next town over. My father insisted there was more work to be done. My mother began warning me about some serial killer on the loose in said town and when that didn’t dissuade me my sister suddenly announced a pregnancy and planned baby shower that I just had to attend. Never mind the vacation. Sure enough, I come back home from father’s “extra work” and overhear my father and older brother in a heated argument. “It went wrong” “We can’t leave him like this!”
…“he should be dead”. 
Soon after I begin checking myself in the mirror for rot, decay, anything to indicate my death. But even the wound is gone. I look healthier than I was before my death. I try seeing a doctor and they come to the same conclusion.

Eventually one night, I dream of drowning.

But not in water. Something thicker. It drags at my limbs. Cold fingers brush my ankles. I wake gasping, clawing at the sheet. My mother is sitting at the end of the bed, knitting in the dark.

“You were thrashing,” she says softly, not looking up. “Bad dreams?”

I ask her what she’s doing here.

“Oh, just watching over you. You’ve been through a lot.”

I almost wanted to ask what she meant. But didn’t.

The next morning, I left.
I told no one. Took nothing. Just walked. Past the corner store. Past the rusted gas station. Past the trees that began to blur into themselves.

Then, something soft comes undone inside my head. I try to scratch it. Like a ribbon being pulled some skin comes off, but I can’t seem to feel it. 

Had I passed the gas station already? 
I continue on.

I catch my reflection in the window of a parked truck: my eyes are glassy, unfocused, my mouth slightly open with a bloody gash on one side. This person looked like a corpse surprised by its own death.
Who was it again?

I finally make it to the old sign that marks the county border. I try to reach out and touch it, but finally collapse. 

Just static.
Then nothing.

…

The first thing I remember since my death was my family surrounding me, hugging and shouting as they circled around the kitchen table to welcome me back. The second… a bloodied white sheet they wrapped me in as they helped me off the table. All things considered, I’m taking my resurrection well.",17
1lob8sq,n0mq9z1,"Days turn to weeks turn to months. Suddenly, it has been a year since your reawakening. The world has carried on as it always has. When you return to work, some of the faces of coworkers paled at your appearance though most of them welcomed you as if back from a holiday. Your old girlfriend nearly fainted when her phone rang, showing your name on the caller ID, and it was actually your voice that came through the phone. She had seen you, lying there on the floor, neck jutted in all the wrong ways as your limbs twisted in directions no waking body would have been able to endure. The fall, she says, I still see it every night. It can't be the same, it won't be.

The piece of your heart you had sent her withers and dies, far away from its home in you. You had expected this, few relationships survive a resurrection. That doesn't change that you had hoped. That you had sent pieces of yourself floating into the ethereal space between us and whatever is above to fall back to earth in an anointment of the love that once pulsed between the two of you.

You feel strange. Every single day. Off in ways beyond comprehension. You try to ignore it, but you know your family feels it too. You saw the way they tried to smile at you across the dinner table with a sense of normalcy. On the nights where your mother eyes have gone glassy from too much wine, you swear you can make out your reflection in them. In them is you and a stranger all at once. A stranger you know they all see across the table as well.

""We must've done it wrong,"" your mother slurs one night to your father as they lay in the dark of their bedroom, unaware of you lingering just outside in the hallway.

""I know,"" your father replies, defeated. ""I know.""

And so you flip on the bathroom lights, banishing the dark and forcing you to face the thing that is allegedly yourself. Your skin is pliant and rosy as it has always been. Your eyes a deep brown, shimmering pools of ultimately unimpressive mud. A buzzed head with dark stubble growing in a thin layer. It is you, undeniably the same you that has always been you.

""I hear that they visit us sometimes,"" another resurrected says in an online forum for those who have been brought back. ""The spirits that shepherded us home.""

The doctors had told you you were fine. Strong vitals befitting a healthy young man. You even got a referral to a clinic that specializes in care for the resurrected. They reassure you that you are, in fact, one of the lucky ones.

""Some people come back and spend the rest of their lives fighting off series after series of cancers,"" the specialist had said. ""Our working theory is somewhere between life and death the scrambling of your cells can lead to issues with their regeneration once you're back. There's a few studies happening now, actually, but it's hard to find subjects who you know for a fact will die and be resurrected.""

In desperation, you wonder if the shepherds are real and if they hold the answers you seek. If they can explain the unease that pervades every moment of your life. You simultaneously mourn and yearn with foolish hope to return to the version of you that was so carefree. This new you that the reawakening ritual promises is the old you hangs heavy on you like too-big clothes drenched in water. This unease radiates off of you, spreading like a parasite to everyone around you.

The small phone stand you bought arrives on a Tuesday morning. There's a narrative on the forums that sometimes shepherds visit at night. You prop up your phone on your dresser with your bed perfectly in frame that same night. Try as you might, you struggle to fall asleep. Is it excitement? Fear? Hope? These feelings swim within you, bumping and bouncing against the walls of your consciousness until finally, hours later, you fall asleep.

The disappointment is the crushing of Sisyphus's boulder rolling backwards and over you. You see nothing but a man sleeping in the footage. The shepherds have left you to suffer alone. Answers are not coming, nothing is coming. There is no choice but to move forward, inching step by step through the slog of life that extends between you and the death you can't help but feel robbed of.",91
1lob8sq,n0n3lks,"“No son it's not like that,” Fresh tears quickly replaced those newly banished. Father agreed with a quiet grumble. 

“There wasn’t enough left to save you both.”

“Both? What do you mean, both?”

“You don’t remember it but you had a twin, Gerald. You were inseparable, identical.”

“Nearly identical,” mother corrected.

“There was an accident. You were both playing. Your brothers magic had blossomed. It caused an extraordinary explosion out in the yard. We could only salvage enough to recreate one body.”

“So you brought me back, by accident?”

“If we could, it would have been both,” mother promised.

“What made Gerald so special?”

“Nothing. We couldn’t pick a favourite.”

“But you did.”

“No we…” Mother tried again. But paused when father put a firm hand on her shoulder.

“No more lies, Margaret.

She looked up at him, at first her eyes pleaded, but then she nodded. She looked down at the floor in her resignation.

“Your brother, Gerald. His innate talent was great. On the other hand… You’re.” Father took in a deep breath, “you’re a dud.”

Faint memories worked their way from somewhere dormant in Otis’ mind. He’d tried his best for years trying to conjure an ounce of the old magic. No amount of will or studying had brought about success. He’d been the first dud in generations of his line. And now without a magical heir, they’d lose everything it had taken centuries to build.

“It’s okay, I understand.” Otis said, shaking.

“You do?” mother looked up, brows creased.

“If I’m without magic, then everything will be lost. The land and home, our vassals will be overrun.”

 He spotted the solution before his parents. It all seemed clear now, what he must do. He moved towards them.

“You can make this right.” Otis’ heart pounded in his chest, his hands shook as he stepped towards the counter. 

“What is it son?” Father’s voice sounded distant. 

“Make sure to do it right this time.” Otis lunged forward. He ducked under the awaiting arms of his mother, grabbed the knife and plunged it into his neck. The ceiling retracted and somewhere far away he felt the floor thud against his back then head. 

Above him his parents looked down in horror, frozen by the sudden violence. 

Otis brought himself to smile, a blurry attempt at reassurance. “Bring him back.”",36
1lob8sq,n0muw7s,"Seven years have passed now since the resurrection. The old version of you fades from the memories of your family as though it were never more than a mirage. The discomfort becomes normal. You are frogs in boiling water, the calm of before long forgotten.

You have a new girlfriend, a fellow resurrected who you can share your deepest worries with as you both stare sleeplessly at the ceilings on those nights where the feeling of wrongness rages within you. It only took one date before the invisible contract was signed. A piece of your heart for a piece of mine. The trade is made and sealed in permanence.

When she is out of town visiting her sisters as she periodically does, you stay up late and scour the resurrected forums. Your private hope lives within you as an embarrassing secret. Anonymous user after anonymous user seeks the answers that you do: where are the shepherds? All who claim to have met them will make one post then disappear, never answering questions or providing the depth you crave.

You carry on. You convince yourself that toiling is a gift and that life was always this uncomfortable.

Forty-four years have passed since the resurrection. You stare down at your wife in her coffin. A false brightness blushes upon her paper-thin cheeks. She was hardly one for makeup in life, it feels odd to see her in it now. Her hands are clasped and at rest upon her chest, peaking out of the long purple sleeves that make up the gown she will be buried in. Your own hand reaches out to rest upon hers. They are both so bony, you can hardly tell which of you is dead and which is still living.

Forty-seven years have passed. Your children surround your hospital bed, assuring you that they will be okay as you feel yourself drift away. For a moment, your final ragged breath scares you in its arduousness. Suddenly, you find yourself floating. Your children's tears are raindrops from the clouds that you ascend through, they keep looking down at your body and miss you waving goodbye from above.

A room. Or something resembling it. There is no floor, no walls, no ceiling. Just space that you feel to be contained. If you could see still, you'd imagine yourself invisible. Energy is shapeless until it fills a body and takes that form. You are no longer in possession of a body. You must be as shapeless as you were before you were born.

""You have arrived.""

A voice, or is it a thought, comes over you.

""You have long wished to meet us.""

It is them. Your elation builds. You have finally found them, or perhaps they you.

""How harrowing a trial, to walk so whole yet undeniably incomplete.""",93
1lob8sq,n0muwwr,"Yes. You try to scream out the word in relief over being understood. Nothing comes out, for there is nowhere for it to come out from.

""Your patience buys you answers. You were curious without prying. You respected the order of things where some try to bend. Such knowledge can only be bought when you obey us. When you adhere to the contract that you were signed away to. Oh, how frustrating to know it was not your pen marking the page but, rather, the desperation of those who loved you beyond reason.""

Memories come as feelings. Anger at your family, for making choices without your consent. For assuming that extended life is a gift.

""Anger is normal,"" the voice continues. ""My kind is flawed, you see, in our greediness. Know that I regret this, truly, though it is beyond us to stop it. We cannot taste a soul without finding it tantalizing beyond reason. A spider does not let the fly escape its web without ripping off a wing as a keepsake. The jaws of a lion clasp around the gazelle and, even as it bounds away, relishes in the feeling of her hair between its bloodied teeth.

""Life and death. A transaction greater than them all. You can delay death, but you cannot cheat it. When your loved ones chant those sacred words, they drown out our warnings in their desperation. You can have him back, I called down to your own mother, but part of his soul remains with me until he returns for a final time.

What a beautiful sentence! What a beautiful thought! This is such a profound statement. It explains perfectly the feeling I have when I'm grieving a loved one.

It rarely happens, but this is one of those moments. Bravo.",10
1loijoc,n0nc7ns,"I floated lazily in the hot humid air. I was wearing one of my favorite guises: that of a certain dark-skinned boy with black hair that stopped just above the shoulders.

It was an uncharacteristically sunny day in London. Unfortunately, it was also oppressively humid, and the rays beat down onto the streets. I looked over at my current master: Nathaniel. Boy wizard and surprisingly good maker-of-sandwiches. He didn't seem to be faring well.

""Urgh,"" he groaned. ""I'm absolutely melting. I wish it wasn't so hot.""

I waved a hand. ""Done,"" I said.

As if summoned, a cloud appeared in front of the sun. The temperature cooled by a few degrees, and Nathaniel felt like he could move without sweating.

""Hold on just a mo -"" Nathaniel said, looking at me with alarm. ""That wasn't a real wish. That's not going to come out of the three, is it?""

""I seem to recall hearing the words, 'I wish',"" I pointed out. ""It is generally accepted by most societies that exactly those words are what precede a wish.""

""It was a figure of speech! And you aren't going to twist it somehow, are you? It's not going to suddenly start pouring, is it?""

""Why, Nathaniel! I'm affronted. Do you truly trust me so little?""

""You're a *djinni*,"" Nathaniel replied. ""Your kind *lives* for trickery and deceit. So how many wishes am I at now?""

*Technically*, Nathaniel was at negative fourteen wishes. But he didn't need to know that.

""Two,"" I lied.

""That can't be true,"" Nathaniel furrowed his brow. ""My very first wish was to set you free. And I'm *pretty* sure I've made at least one other. And then there was the one just now, where you made it less hot. That's three wishes in the bag.""

It was time for a distraction. ""*I* am Bartimaeus of Uruk,"" I thundered, drawing myself up to my full height (which, in my current form of a twelve-year-old boy, was only 4 feet and not all that impressive). ""I have spoken with Gilgamesh and Sargon of Akkad. Solomon himself has sought my counsel. I have seen dozens of civilizations rise and fall. Are you implying that, I, a clever, resourceful, djinn by all rights, *can't count*?""

Nathaniel was too smart to be fooled. I saw him doing some quick mental arithmetic, and he grinned as he realized that the answer added up to something that he liked.

""Don't worry about it,"" he said. ""I was never much good at maths either. What say you we start back at zero?""

I huffed. ""Oh, alright. But only if you make me another one of those chicken achiote clubs.""

“You didn’t have to” he politely says before scarfing it down faster then I can react.

“It’s the least I can do after the wishes you know” I say halfheartedly this was going on for months now. 

“It’s your right you have a wish left after all” he declared with the kind of grandiose you expected from an 8 foot tall teal colored glowing man. 

“Just one left?” I say jokingly. “Remind me what 1 and 2 were again?” I said as I was making another sandwich.

“The first was the become the greatest sandwich maker in all of history and the second was to set me free.” He said as if reading off a list. “After after freeing me I must grant you the third. Not because I must it’s simply my way of saying thanks.”

I put another sandwich in front of him. “And you don’t have anything to say about the bigger house or the fact I’m rich.” I asked.

Another sandwich disappeared as soon as he opened he’s maw. “Those had nothing to do with me I would have remembered.”  

“Sure bud” I say making another sandwich it’s not like I object to all the few stuff. I’m pretty simple so I don’t need much but it’s a nice fallback",15

1losjic,n0pk7mq,"When God cast Lucifer down to Hell, he stripped him of all of his angelic powers, except one. God wanted to punish his fallen Angel with the ability to still hear prayers. 

Satan thought this was amusing at first. He gets to prove God correct.

People don't pray for salvation. They pray for selfish reasons. They pray for lottery winnings and for their team to win the Super Bowl. They pray for riches and success. They pray for their own benefit. Sure, some pray for others. But even then, it can be a vile prayer. A curse even.

Lucifer would sometimes answer these prayers, just to see the downfall. Lottery winners were his favorite. They would rise up from the depths of poverty into a world of luxury and opulence and squander it all in years due to their selfish needs still not being fulfilled. Most would end up at the bottom, broke, destitute, and a warning for others: Money won't buy happiness, just temporary stop your own downfall.

Lucifer heard prayers that would piss him off. Prayers to kill. Prayers to destroy. Prayers to erase an entire region from existence.  God gave his human creations free will and they reward him by praying for death and destruction.

One day, Lucifer heard a young man pray for food. Not for himself. But for others. This man was poor and sometimes his only meal would come the soup kitchen he would frequent. But he knew there were others in worse shape than he was. He saw them on TV. Children in a war torn country halfway across the world digging in trash for moldy bread and drinking dirty water. He prayed for these children to have food, because he was once in that position and hoped someone was praying for him.
And of course, not a peep or response from Heaven or God. The young man prayed and prayed every night and for some reason, the prayer was stuck inside Lucifer's head. Lucifer decided this would be another great example of man's greed, so he decided to help this man.

The easiest and quickest way was for the man to win the lottery. So Lucifer planted six numbers in the man's head, and after a week of these numbers taunting the man, he finally played the lottery. And to the man's surprise, he won. Lucifer wondered if this man's greed or his kindness would win out. It didn't take long for Lucifer to find his answer.

Greed won.

The man wasn't like other lottery winners though. He did not end up losing any of it, actually. He invested wisely and soon his name was amongst the richest men in America, and soon, the world. Lucifer just smiled.

He kept track of the man's investments and found no money was sent to charity, no money was sent to feed the poor, no money was spent on anything except his own portfolio.

Another proud son of Adam having his prayers answered, only to sin in response.

After sixty years, the man found himself laying in a hospital bed, surrounded by loved ones, but soon ready to perish and greet the afterlife. At 3 AM, he was alone, in bed, when he woke up and saw Lucifer sitting next to him.

""Thank you,"" Lucifer said.  ""You have been another great example of why you and your kind will always be God's worst mistake.""

""I...who are you, I don't understand?"" the man asked.

""Years ago, when you were a much younger man, do you remember praying? You prayed every night. Every night you prayed for the children of poverty, the children of wars, children of hunger, to be fed and..."" Lucifer stopped for a moment. ""And I answered your prayer."" 

""What do you mean?"" the man asked.

""3, 12, 19, 32, 40 and 51,"" Lucifer said. ""I put those numbers in your head. And you won. Your prayers were answered. You now had enough money to feed those children you were praying for. But you didn't, did you?""

""I became busy and...""

""You became GREEDY,"" Lucifer shouted. ""You got a taste of wealth and you wanted MORE. YOU WANTED IT ALL. Your small fortune soon became one that nearly everyone was envious of. Your wealth could have fed every child in the world and you chose NOT to. You could have answered your own prayer and instead....""
Lucifer gestured to the private hospital room. ""This.  Pure opulence. Pure greed. Pure sin. And for that, I thank you. So far, I've always been correct. Every time I answer a human's prayer, just like I answered yours, you prove to me, to God, to all of creation that mankind is not worth the trouble. You pray for help and then when it is answered, you suddenly stop thinking about others and only think about yourself.""

The man stayed silent.

""You could have saved your soul and gone to spend all of your afterlife in Heaven. All it would have cost you was your own greed. You could have given it up. You could have traded greed for eternal happiness. But you didn't. So in the next few days, when you enter a coma, and die, your children and their children will fight over your money and they will not care that you end up with me. And they will be greedy because you never taught them kindness or compassion. And then your whole lineage will end up in hell with me. And, to be fair, with most others.""

Still silence.

""Oh, ha. I can hear it. You are praying. First time in 60 years and you are praying for salvation. It doesn't work that way. You could have saved yourself. You chose not to. See you in a few days.""",55

2. Direct them to lonely eldritch entity

3. They can't expose us if insane.

4. ???

5. Profit.

That was expectations.

Reality was a swarm of ascended, tentacled grad students who smashed through a wall to shout at Hank and Gerard. And standing behind all the commotion, the eldritch entity.

Hank had questions about how things turned out like this, but Gerard shushed him with a glare. The students went insane, he believed. Ideally, they should have been trapped in some eldritch domain. Or locked up in mental asylums. Somewhere they would not be able to expose the two men. In reality, they were now crazy followers of their accidental eldritch math tutor.

""This referral fee we paid to Hank, why did none of it go to our math tutor?"" One student demanded. ""You lied to us that he was a paid partner to your tuition center! Turns out, he thought we were confused tourists and was prepared to help us for free!""

""Yea, he didn’t know a thing about your scam, but he still improved our math skill,"" Another student, more octopoid than human, scowled. ""Bet you didn't expect us to be able to mentally calculate in five dimensions now. And calculate what a scam you are.""

Gerard flinched when a student used her newly sprouted tentacles to throw a chair through the front door. The immediate thing that came to his mind was how much it would cost to get a new door.

""Lord Elvari is a victim too!"" They chanted in unison.

""Oh, my newly ascended Deep Ones,"" the eldritch horror at the back slithered up to the students. ""Its fine. All of you paid me for your Non-euclidean geometry and multidimensional mathematical systems theory classes. I enjoyed the tea and cakes you have offered me.""

""That's not fair! They were pocketing the referral fee instead of splitting with you! These two dolts thought we would all go insane in your presence. They thought you wouldn’t think to ask for payment because you enjoyed our company.""

Gerard cleared his throat. ""But hey, you got what you wanted. You got your math comprehension enhancement. Creepy tentacle guy here got people to chat with, to have tea time with him. So, clearly, our referral worked out.""

It was too late to run. Might as well stand his ground, even as this Elvari creature had floated mere inches away from him.

**""Indeed. So now, both of you are to come under my servitude and bring more students to me. I will pay for your services in bouts of insanity. With increased math skills, you two can help calculate my follower growth.""**

""let me guess, you think I'm a green dragon"" *the dragon says bluntly*

""I mean yeah, your scales are green.  That marks you as a descendant of tiamat."" *the knight points out*  
  
""I'm a copper dragon, when we get old enough our scales ""rust"" and turn green.  I'm just a very old copper dragon.  That's the mistake every adventuring party makes when they come in here""

""Ah, I'm sorry for the intrusion then..""  *the knight says, clearly embarassed*

""No problem, hey my friends should be back soon after saving a nearby village from an actually evil dragon, if you stay we can talk about you joining my hoard"" *the dragon says happily*

""... That would be nice.  I think I would like that""

1loamdj,n0mbjua,"The King and Queen stood on either side of me, watching the images, listening to the sounds from the basin of water before me. Had it not been for my skill in the art of divination, I would not have been here to bear witness; and had I not witnessed the event, I never would have believed it.

The knight and his entourage had entered the cave, enchanted armor proofed against multiple types of dragon breath, amulets channeling the power of wizards from all across the kingdom, prepared to defeat any monstrosity, seeking to avenge the death of the Prince, who swore he would slay a dragon to prove his worth - the Prince, whose death was confirmed, when the portrait tied to his lifeforce burned clean from it's frame.

The Prince, whose broken gear, still bearing the Royal Crest, was found discarded in a trash heap outside the cave's entrance.

I watched, as knight and entourage entered the chamber - no exit, save for where they just entered. There was a simple cot, crude earthenware pots with dried fish and foods of the forest, a pool fed from a natural spring, and... what I can only describe as a shrine.

A leather jerkin, damaged beyond usefulness in battle, but quite clean. A dagger, heavily chipped and bent, permanently stained by old blood. A rucksack, crudely patched, yet looking as if somebody wishes to keep it ready for use. And, a brittle piece of paper, with a drawing, a crude but talented sketch of a young woman, wearing these items, standing next to a young kobold with a misshapen horn...

""What are you doing in my home?!?""

I watch, as the knights companions are jostled aside, and see a kobold, half their size, enter the chamber - an elderly kobold, mottled gray scales, his age etched into his flesh, his horn misshapen, like in the picture. He was carrying a rough net filled with fish, and a bag full of edible tubers.

The knight held forth his shield, showing the royal crest. ""We seek a dragon - the one responsible for the death of the one who owned the armor with this crest - the armor discarded just outside the entrance to this cave.""

The kobold hissed, and spat on the ground. ""The closest you'll find to a dragon in these parts is me. And the fool who owned that scrap in my trash pile came in like he *owned* the place - just like you! Now get out of my home!""

I witnessed, as the knight drew his sword, smashing his arm into the shrine, disintegrating that oh so delicate piece of paper.

I witnessed, as the elderly kobold's eyes went wide with shock.

I once saw a ballista bolt, as it flew past my head. Never had I seen anything faster, until I saw that kobold cross the distance between himself and the knight. And never before had I seen a knight in armor, torn limb from limb. I hope to never see it again - and yet, I do, as the knight's entourage suffers the same fate.

The only sounds in the room, are those coming from the basin. I watch, as the kobold approaches the shrine. I witness the tears, as they fall upon the scrap that used to be a drawing of a young woman, and a young kobold.

I had forgotten that I wasn't alone in the room - the Queen's voice startles me, as she says, ""How can such a thing happen? He is not even a dragon - what horde could he possibly have, that is so valuable as to give him this power?""

A hiss rises from the basin. ""The Older Ones always taught us, it is the Dragon who determines the value of the horde!""

I witnessed, as the kobold looked up at us, directly at the Queen, fire in his maw, and hatred in his eyes - and I ran. I heard the screams, and felt the heat, as dragonflame filled my quarters...

And I ran...",61
1loamdj,n0lrew1,"White hot flames roared past Sir Richard's shield, the heat singeing the hair off his arms even beneath his thick plate armor. The dragon stopped to inhale, a momentary pause in the flame before the narrow stone chamber would be scorched again. 

Richard sprung forward, dropping his shield and raising his sword with the grace only a lifetime of combat could impart. This was supposed to be a simple dragon slaying. No horde to speak of meant no power, no fire, easy work.

This dragon had a horde somewhere. A *large* horde. It wasn't here though. He nearly tripped over a half melted helmet as he dodged the next flame blast behind a stone column. Only bits of junk and broken stones here. The dragon inhaled again, another break in the nearly constant stream of fire 

Forward. Forward! The beast's exposed belly only a dozen strides away. ""Now or never"" Richard thought grimly as he rushed toward his prey.

The heavy helmet that protected him from the flame limited his vision and he never even saw the dragon's whip-like tail coming from the side to smash him against the stone wall like a broken doll. 

After a dazed moment he regained his senses and looked around for his sword, nowhere to be found. He nearly screamed in agony as he tried to rise, a broken leg, broken arm, definitely some ribs.

""Yessssss""  the slithering inhuman hiss of the dragon's voice came  from somewhere in the shadows to his left. Richard wanted to look but it hurt too much to turn his head.

""What are you waiting for monster?! Finish me already""

The dragon only chuckled. 

""Yesss I think today will be very profitable. My horde growssss ever larger with each noble knight who... visits me."" 

""I have no gold for you, dragon."" Richard spat. All dragons every thought of was their horde.

""You have no gold *on you*"" the mighty lizard retorted.

""I will let you live little knight. On one condition.""

A scroll, long  and official looking unrolled from the shadows across the floor to cover Richard's twisted legs.

""Five percent ownership of your landed estates, with additional option to purchase after ten years. Twenty thousand gold to my accounts in the city of Carenta plus a very reasonable fee for the ambulance back into the village.""

A feathered quill drifted down from above to land near Richard's good hand.

""My horde is mighty little knight and today you add to it just like all the others who came before you. Just sign on the dotted line pleassssse.""",64
1loamdj,n0nfy6z,"""You see, it's called compounding interest,"" the dragon explained, twirling the caved-in helmet around a nail. ""Other dragons have to start somewhere, right? Maybe they're young, or maybe you've got an ancient dragon who let himself get complacent and got robbed. I mean, a hidden door that would be invisible unless the moon hit it juuuuust right, that's so 500 years ago am I right?""

I gulp, nod and let the point of my sword dip lower, most of what he (she?) is saying going straight over my head. 

""Anyways, these dragons just starting off, they need a little hoard to get their scales wet, so I lend it to them at a very generous rate, something like 3.5% per decade, that kind of thing. THEN when they pay me that little extra tithe every ten years, I lend it out to OTHER dragons and so on and so forth. So really, if you were to look at the whole kingdom, I probably own about 70-73% of the total hoard out there. I've got all these guys by the wings!"" 

Bored with the helmet, the dragon flicks it off into some dark nook of the cavern where it bounces and clangs away, the clamour echoing off the walls. A small wisp of smoke escapes their nostrils and they loom closer to me.

""So, little hero"", their slitted pupils narrowing as they move within range of my blade and their baring their teeth in what could only be described as a wide, cruel smile, ""now that you've seen the pitiful size of my hoard, how would you like to try to slay the most powerful dragon in the world? 

""Or, I could teach you some basic finance and economics and I could make you a fine king...for a very reasonable fee of course.""",31
1loamdj,n0ludfq,"“Sir! Come quick- there’s something you need to see.”

With one last look at the infamous dragon of the west valley, not seeming so great now as it struggled against the muzzle and chains held in place by several of my men, I sauntered over to my second in command- taking care not to step over the many dead bodies that littered the clearing.

“What is it?” 

“We’ve found his horde.” 

I nodded. “Get the flamethrowers ready.”

“Actually…there’s something you should see.” 

He gestured toward the large, dark cave several more of my men shuffled in and out of; the place this dragon called home.

I followed him inside and after a short walk, we came upon a tiny hole this dragon must’ve used for its treasure.

The items must be very valuable, then, if it’s this small. 

I walked up to the edge and peered inside, blinking dumbly at what I found- or rather lack thereof. 

There were a few items in the hole- a worn out backpack, a rusting mining set, some dirty bottles of war, and a large but equally dirty sword. 

“It seems like some adventuring gear,” my second in command said. “But how was the dragon so powerful?” 

I kneeled and placed a palm on the ground to steady myself as I jumped down into the pit, much to the protests of my knight. Picking up the sword and mining set, I turned both over in my hands as I studied them with care. “They’re dusty, yes, but very well made.”

“I see…maybe the gear belonged to a knight, then?” 

“It would have to be a thousand knights for the dragon to be so strong.” I shook my head. “Or a sorcerer.”

The knight gasped behind me. We hadn’t seen a sorcerer in decades; for all I knew they were a thing of myth, the most well known one about a mage who ravaged kingdoms and burnt entire cities to ash. 

Including my own.

At least that’s how the legend goes- the scholars blamed a league barbarians. 

I then reached into the backpack, cringing as I felt around all the dirt inside, and paused as my fingers grasped something hard yet smooth. 

“What is it, sir?” My second in command said, coming closer to the edge.

I pulled out the item; seemingly a portrait of a man in strange robes, his face mostly covered by a bed a dust. “I…don’t know.”

The knight dropped down beside me as I tried to wipe the dry dust away with my fingers, having to scrape the frame itself just to get most of it off. The man’s face was uncovered but still buried beneath a few scratches. And yet…

I squinted my eyes. Even beneath the markings, the face was starting to become oddly familiar. I scraped harder; if only I could just reveal the other eye…

I froze. 

The face looking back at me, I realized with a start, belonged to none other than the knight behind me.

But that wasn’t possible…given all the dust, it must’ve been here for centuries. Not to mention the dragon has been alive for more than a few of those.

A hand fell on my shoulder- along with a dagger at my neck. 

“For what it’s worth, I truly am sorry.”",39
1loamdj,n0p2xck,"A long time ago, there was a cataclysm. Fire rained down upon the land, seas boiled and the oceans crumbled, as gods and demonkind waged war upon one another.  
We prayed to the gods, for some measure of peace, but they could not hear us, or they had no power to answer our prayers. So instead, we turned to the earth, to the spirits of nature, and prayed to them that we be preserved and protected.  
Even though the spirits of the earth did not truly understand us mortals, as one they attempted to answer our prayers as best they could. They turned our soft flesh to gold, dense and untarnished, and gems brilliant yet hardy, and adamantine unbreakable, and they buried us deep in the earth, safe from harm.  
&nbsp;  
And though the war in heaven and hell has ended, and life has returned for countless eons, the spirits of our far distant ancestors remain, in every geode and vein of precious metal.  
To those of us who can hear them, we of dragon blood, they whisper their knowledge. They share their tales of histories long forgotten, of legends and fables, of battles and military tactics, but most of all they share their secret rituals and their arcane lore.  
To a dragon, a bed of gold and gems is not just a hoard. It is a library, one which they may meditate upon and receive the counsel of thousands of sages. This is the secret of dragons, how a hunter-gatherer dwelling in a cave can have wisdom and arcane power rivaling the eldest of elven wizards.  
&nbsp;  
Why then, do I only hoard a trifling of things? Because quality is better than quantity. The guidance of a single archmage is worth more than the musings of ten thousand lesser scholars.  
Where you see some loose arrowheads, a dented cuirass, a broken sword with a gem in its hilt, I hear a group of the finest philosophers, inventors and magicians the ancient world knew. Champions beyond champions of their people, who slept the sleep of eons in the deep earth before being dug up and hammered into these mundane pieces I hold dear.  
Through their tutoring, I have reshaped my body and mastered the arcane arts. I wield secret powers the common masses of the past or present could never imagine.  
&nbsp;  
Let other dragons loot towns and ransom princesses for their treasures. I have done my divinations. I have located the spirit of a dwarven master alchemist, which means I have some lead ballast I need to retrieve from a shipwreck.",12
1loamdj,n0pmymo,"Scarlett scoffed at the pile of junk she'd stumbled upon. Oh, sure, there'd been some nice gems (the best of which she had already lifted, of course), but this was supposed to be the main prize! Instead, a room full of rusted hulks, battered blades, damaged staves, and what looked like crumbling but perfectly ordinary stones. Nearly all of it had some residual trace of magic, but nothing her fences would even look once at, let alone twice. In fact, even the pieces themselves didn't look that impressive. The only fancy thing in the entire room was a decent-looking witchfolded blade on one wall, and a helmet.

""I thought golds were supposed to be the cream of the crop. But a job's—""

""*You may find that intelligence matters little without the wisdom to understand.*""

She whirled around. No way. No way he was already here. She had planned this heist perfectly. Watched Elysedd's habits for *months*, collected every scrap of lore she could find. Supposedly the most powerful gold dragon on the continent. Widely respected. Never once had his hoard touched by a thief's hands. The worst goody-two-shoes imaginable, with all the self-righteous arrogance and a frustrating ability to back it up with magic and muscle. Someone who deserved to be taken down a peg, and if it lined her pockets in the doing...

""*Did you think your time preparing went unnoticed, Scarlett of Buckleydown, daughter of the river?*""

""How—?!"" The word escaped her lips before her brain could stop it. But so what? So what if her mother were a riverboat captain and her father one washed along the river run? How dare a godsdamned trumped-up lizard with delusions of grandeur act like that made him better than her.

""*It is my business to know: people, places, things. But I hear your indignation, and I apologize. I meant no disrespect. You have no choice of your bloodline.*""

She remained silent. Even speaking the once was a grave mistake. The ring would keep her safe, for now. An unseen threat is dangerous even to a great wyrm, and she *had* prepared for the unexpected.

""*Judging by your reaction to my lair, though, I think perhaps an apology in the other direction is in order, no? I know where you are, Scarlett. I know how you entered my lair. And I know you already carry things which belong to me. You will not be leaving this place with them still in your possession. This is a fact; if you choose to view it as a threat, you may wish to reevaluate your reconnaissance about me.*""

She wracked her brain. Getting *nothing* from this heist was...not an option. Elysedd was emblematic of his kind. Oh, it's not like you never found the odd tainted gold, of course, but again, this goody-two-shoes wouldn't know fun if it slapped him in the face and demanded alimony. Main reason nobody had robbed him yet was, apparently, that he was just such a *swell guy*, and other obvious hogwash from paid-off servants prattling on. There had been *one* thing though...what was it...?

""*You might consider conversing. I understand your reluctance, given you believe your invisibility cloaks you against my sight. But I'm afraid among the things I know, or rather the* people, *I count Master Grekoth, the artisan who forged it. I helped him replace it when it was mysteriously stolen some months ago, and I fired his forge myself.*""

Well *fuck.* The big bastard *knew*. ""Well. Guess there's not much need for it then, if you knew what to look for.""

""*Perhaps, perhaps not. It has been a little while since my last guest. Few are left who remember. Would you like some tea? You have my word, it is tea and only tea. Well, it might have lime and honey.*""

""...honey? Really.""

""*It must be a challenge, being one who throws stones from a house of glass.*""

""Oh shut your go—er, okay, fine."" If he was going to play a pantomime teatime, why not? After all: *goody-two-shoes*. Had he wanted her dead, she'd be dead. The longer he kept up his highfalutin pretenses, the longer she had to figure out a chance of escape. ""Bad place to have tea though...""

""*Quite right. I assume you will not accept accompanying me to my guest rooms, as those have exits too difficult for you to easily reach. Let me make this place more hospitable.*""

The sconces on the walls suddenly blazed with a pure, white-gold light. *Must be magical sunlight. Clever trick. Maybe there's more to this than my sources said...*

To one side, a square table slowly materialized, and from out of nothing, like he had just stepped from behind an invisible door, a man appeared. Dragonborn, but she knew that was just a shell. Dragons could look like whatever they wanted to look like. At his gesture, two chairs, manifested as well, tasteful and rather comfortable-looking ones at that.

""*Please, sit, if you would. I should be glad of some conversation. The mountain has not had many travelers of late. I hear there is war in the south, and plague to the east.*""

""...yeah, I guess. Might head south. War is hell. But hell is good business if you know where to look."" She had to keep him talking. The more talk, the more time to escape. Keep him engaged.

""*Yes, it certainly can be,*"" Elysedd said, wistfully. As he poured the tea into the handle-less cups, he added, ""*This I know too well.*""

""Oh?"" Scarlett didn't have to manufacture the surprise. ""Thought you were too high and mighty to cut a man.""

""*Then I fear your research on me was a little shallow. Tell me, do you know how old I am?*""

A dangerous question from a mortal, but for dragons, almost always a matter of pride. At least she had a reasonable guess. ""At least three thousand. Maybe up to five. But I think it's three."" Three, like the exits.

""*That is how long I have been residing on this mountain, I'm afraid. I was already well-grown by then.*"" No hint of wounded pride. If anything, he seemed pleased, which was either irritating or worrying and she couldn't decide which yet. ""*No. I am nearly seven thousand years old. I might even reach it in full before you find whatever fate awaits you in the Afterhalls. Or perhaps not. You have a penchant for risky business.*""

""If you think knowing me means I'm scared of you, you're wrong."" Not, however, wrong about the lime and honey, it really did round out the strange herbal mixture. The lime was...exotic. Blood red, for starters, which would have been a huge alarm bell, if Elysedd hadn't given his word. The pretense of his own righteousness was important to him, she'd picked up *that* much from casing the lair.

""*I have little desire to intimidate you any further than I already have. You have been eyeing the exits since I spoke to you. I'm afraid they will not do you any good. They were barred by walls of force before I even spoke. Better to focus on the conversation. If you do, I may even let you keep one or two of the baubles you have liberated from my friend's gift.*""

....a *gift?* That king's ransom was a ***gift?*** Now he'd done something worse than detain her.

He had caught her interest. ""Seven thou, huh? Must've seen a lot. You said you'd gotten your claws dirty?""

A laugh. It almost sounded entirely genuine. ""*Would you believe I have even, as your kind sometimes say, 'sewn my wild oats'?*""

She couldn't help a derisive laugh of her own. ""If it were anyone else, I'd think you a damned liar. But really? You?""

""*I too was once young and brash, if you can believe it, and my darling, daring Gloriana was...well. You doubtless care little for the reminisces of a romance that old. I might hazard instead that you desire a tale of violence and villainy, of hard men making hard choices, of what is good and kind besmirched in the name of brute survival?*""

Scarlett found herself surprised to feel the barest flush come to her cheeks. Maybe the old lizard had a point. But she held her ground. ""I mean, I'm your prisoner. Or is that 'detainee'? You can tell whatever story you want.""

""*Then let me tell you of the seven heroes, who risked life and limb...sometimes just for glory, or pride, or foolish greed...but all of them, in the end, for keeping the light of life alive, even if theirs went out. You'd have liked Thorgrim, you know. A cynic to the bone, just like you, though he was not our child of the river.*""

""Pfft,"" Scarlett scoffed, ""you expect me to believe *you* adventured alongside a river-bastard?""

""*Of course. Her name was Gloriana.*""

*Oh.* ***Shit.*** ""I...""

""*Did not expect a musty, fusty old lizard-prune to have a dalliance with someone outcast by society? No, I wouldn't expect you to. People are almost as apt to mistake courtesy for prudishness as they are to mistake mercy for weakness...or to fail to see how a mere pile of junk could be among the greatest treasures of the realm.*""

""...those...?""

""*Every last one has been the shell or shield or sword of a soul brave and true. Someone who fought...and, often, died...not for fame. Not for glory, or money. Alone. In the dark. Where no one would ever know, or see...*""

""*...except for* ***me.*** *It is my Lord's gift. Some of them survived to loot another day. Many more were given a second chance, and took it. A few...preferred to stay in my Lord's halls. And that, Scarlett of Buckleydown, is why I have never been robbed, and why I am a wyrm of some minor repute. The treasure I keep is not in coin you can touch, though I hold a little of that too. My treasure is the memory of the fallen. Those who died, long and long ago, so that you could live.*""

""Well. That's all fine and dandy, but—”

""*There are more pressing matters to discuss. Such as your future employment.*""

""...my what?""

""*You will not take what does not belong to you from this place. But perhaps we can come to an arrangement? You have already selected your payment. Now we must negotiate a fitting task. Perhaps with more payment after? You know the measure of my reach.*""

Somehow, she knew that this negotiation was going to be more dangerous than the one that got her here in the first place...",12
1loamdj,n0qkzkb,"The bigger a dragon's hoard, the stronger they were. That was the law of the world. However every law had an exception.

In the middle of a continent, at the edge of a great kingdom. One sky blue dragon perched atop it's mountain. It's wings were so vast they stretched from one horizon to the other and it's mighty tail curled all around the mountain and into the plains bellow.

One day after sunset, a star was falling down from the sky towards the kingdom. It lit up the sky aflame and turned night into day with it's glow.

With a breath, the dragon blew out the star like a candle.

Scared of this power, the king sent a knight to scour the mountain and find the dragon's hoard. The loyal knight left on his quest.

He walked for six days and six nights until he saw the end of the dragon's tail. The thinnest part was as tall as an old tree and so the knight had to climb over it to proceed. The next coil of the dragon's tail was twice as tall, and the next even taller than that.

**Maybe the dragon mountain was made of gold, and that is where it's power came from.**

On his journey the knight witnessed the dragon's might twice more. Once, the ground underneath his feet quaked and cracked and bellowed and the knight climbed up the dragon's tail to avoid being swalowed up by the shifting ground. The tremmors lasted until the dragon slammed down it's tail with unimaginable might and silenced the earth itself.

**Maybe it's mountain was made of diamonds and gems and that's what gave the dragon his power.**

Another time a storm raged from the sea, blackened skies crawled on spindly lightning legs and terrible winds chucked trees around as if they were mere splinters. The knight hid in between the dragon's scales again for safety. 

From his small cave he saw the dragon beat it's wings once and it blew away the crawling storm into nothing.

**What precious thing is the dragon's hoard made out of to give it such strength?**

Finally he reached the top and there he saw the dragon's hoard. A few peices of old broken adventuring gear, much like his own. They endured the journey and protected him from danger true, but they were nothing more than trash at this point. This was not the dragon's hoard.

Lost and confused and in despair he looked up and asked the dragon.

""Mighty Dragon. What is the source of your strength? What is your hoard?""

The dragon lowered it's head down from the clouds and turned one great white eye to search for him. The dragon was so massive and he was so small after all. It was like someone trying to find the ant that called them. They sat in silence for a moment.

Soon, however, the dragon spoke. ""I will show you my hoard, grab onto my scales."" 

The knight did as told and then the dragon lifted it's head up and up and up, high above the clouds. And then he went even higher, above the skies and perched atop the moon.

***""THIS IS MY HOARD. GAZE UPON IT AND WONDER""***

Bellow (or rather in front of them) was the world.

#ALL OF IT. 


With every blade of grass and every king and queen who ever lived and will ever live, with every tresure buried and discovered. With every conqueror and war and every brother and sister and friend and enemy.

Everything that could be deemed precious in the whole world.

1loamdj,n0s1sy0,"Value, is made up. Nothing has inherit value to it. Gold, silver, gemstones, even those coins the silly humans built their entire society on, is all just as ""valuable"" as anything else. No what gives something value, is when enough people believe its valuable. The perception of value matters far more than any material, or use of something

All the other dragons have fallen into the same trap humans have. Believing value is found in currency or use. I am the only dragon who knows what value truly is. I am the only one who understands. I created my own value.

How did I get this strong, you ask. Simple, I created history. These toys, the weapons and armor I wear on my back, they were once nothing more than mundane, everyday tools of war. I changed that. I gave them to those who would become legends. Kings, heroes, villains. All of them. 

This sword, once a useless long sword, I gave to the one who would go on to defeat the lich king, using this very blade. The sword used to be worth next to nothing. The breast plate, was worn by the king who conquered these lands oh so long ago. Oh the stories I could tell. These items, became that of legends. And eventually, hundreds of years after I gifted these ordinary items away, I reclaimed them as legends themselves. Priceless artifacts

I made my own strength. Us dragons are only as strong as the value of our horde. And overtime, gold will lose its value, magical items will lose their spark. But my horde, my history, will never die. I am the only true immortal power. Please, go, leave my lair. Tell people what you learned here. I will not stop you. It will only make me stronger after all.  Value is not real, except through the belief of its own existence.",8
1lotdtn,n0pntep,"Getting home from the Hero Academy, I groan.  
I have ""Luck"" has super power, why can't I luck my way out of this conundrum?  
My siblings also collapse on their beds, groaning.  
""Why do we have to go to the Hero Academy?  
Can't they understand I would be the perfect detective?!"" my 2nd sister, with mind-reading ability sighs.  
""And I want to open a construction company.  
I literally would have no need to hire people!"" my little brother groans.  
I nod.  
""I could be the best businessman, or gambler...but no, go and become heroes."" I say, as we all three sigh.  
This is what happens when your family worships the hero profession. 

  
At dinner, I look at my younger siblings, and nod.  
""Mother, father, and everyone else, since it seems you taken to leeching off of us."" I start, which makes dad laugh, but mom, and the other relatives stared daggers at me.  
""We will drop out of the Hero Academy.  
Lisa will go to the Police Academy, and Adam will start an entrepreneur course, and maybe go to university to become an engineer.  
And I...I already started trading stocks, and guess what? I made enough for us 3 siblings to get our own place."" I say.  
The room gets cold, as my parents stare at me confused.

  
""First of all, while you are 19, and Lisa is almost 18, Adam is only 15.  
No way he throws away his education as a Hero, to become a worker."" mom starts.  
""And secondly, how do you think he can go to university, or Lisa to the academy, with no degree?  
The Hero Academy degree is still useful for those place as well."" dad chimes in.  
""Not that you will go there. After the Hero Academy, you will start internships with top ranked heroes, and start as sidekicks."" auntie Zoe starts.  
And then the table descends into a lecture.  
I smile.  
""Not that it matters, but the Police Academy requires no degree, only passing the exams they hold. And there is no requirement of degree to open a business, nor there is a degree required to get admitted into the university Adam has picked."" I say.  
They sigh.

  
""You are young, and you can't see it yet, but we..."" mom starts.  
""No. We don't want to be heroes, and it is not the best job.  It is reckless, it is dangerous, it barely pays if you don't open your own Hero Organization, and frankly, other than for public recognition, it is pointless. Now, I can already tell you, that I made enough to buy a house like this, if not bigger, while Lisa could become whatever she wants, considering her power is seemingly unblockable. And Adam...he can already make 100 clones, and he is 15! And the clones are smart, aware, and can improvise, and adapt, and have no time limit.  
Gods! He has the most potential, and you want him to be a Hero?! No. I won't allow you forcing us into things we don't want to, if you can't understand our feelings, and our desires...I will get them emancipated from you."" I say, standing up.  
Lisa, and Adam follow me, as dad tries to say something, but stops.  
It hurts, because we know they love us, and we love them, but it is our lives we are talking about...and we, we don't want to become heroes.",9
1loi2ld,n0n44d4,"""Killing the villain makes you just like him.""

I remember the witch's prophesy. It was a mistake to disregard her words, apparently it was more a curse warning then a moral conundrum warning. 

""I just didn't think it would be so literal!"" I scream, staring at the mirror.

The face looking at me now, wasn't my own but of the demon lord. The second my blade took his life, my body transformed into his. What the heck. Now all my friends are trying to kill me, thinking that I'm the demon lord.

""Ugh, what to do now? At least I'm still me deep down.""",16
1loi2ld,n0nopo0,"I expected a rush of relief and the satisfaction of a hard task completed when the moment came for me to finally watch him fall to the floor. And fall he did. A single arrow flew from my bow to find it's snug home between his ribs and into his heart. The shock on his face revealed how weak a man he truly was. He pawed listlessly at the shaft sticking out of him as he sunk to his knees, a feckless attempt at survival marking the end of his life like a period marks the end of a sentence.

It was when he collapsed on his side and his final breath escaped him that the ice rippled through my veins. The chill of it caused my breath to catch on itself in a gasp, while my arrow pierced his heart it seemed a phantasmal icicle pierced mine. My fingers reflexively loosened, making my bow to fall to the ground a mere second before I keeled over on top of it. 

Convulsions tore through me. My eyes rolled back in my head and I heard myself gasping repeatedly. It all seemed so far away, as though I was experiencing myself from behind the door of an adjacent room. The pain of it all was a notion that outpaced the parameters of my body. Through the fear came a sense of gratitude that I was too much a mortal to feel whatever magic this was in whole. It all happened in a flash and within seconds, my consciousness fled from me.

When I awoke, I was laying on a scratchy straw cot. The heat suspended in the room had made my body coat itself with sweat as I slept. A stench of earthy herbs curled the hairs in my nose. I knew only one place in the village could produce such an odor.

As I took in my surroundings, I surmised that my assumptions were true; I lay in the witch's hut. 

""Tut, tut, young Alistair,"" her voice came from her as a song comes from a siren. I propped myself up on my elbows and could not help but fall instantly into a state of mesmerization. He hair cascaded down her back in a fiery red waterfall while her deep blue eyes twinkled from the countless stars they seemed to hold. Whenever she was before me, the feeling of being reduced to something so pathetically human pervaded me. ""You know, I first was rather enraged with you when I felt Dario fall from your arrow. But, oh, how that raged turned into something so delicious on my tongue. What a suitable successor you are. What an endless scroll of tasks we will be able to work through.""",9
1lofuv5,n0n4gjd,"No one has ever been able to summon such a demon as myself, but now, against all odds, I feel myself evaporating. I’ve heard stories of others being summoned so know this is what’s happening, but I must say, I’m a little frightened. How does a powerful demon who can raise the dead get scared, you might ask? Well, imagine you’re minding your own business, playing with your skeletons, and, all of a sudden, you start feeling funny. Then you start to feel your hooves start tingling like they’re asleep, and the tingling keeps moving up your body and, finally, into your horns. Then you slowly start disappearing in the same way - hooves to horns. You’ve never experience anything like this, but you know from all the stories you’ve heard and books you’ve read that it must be a summoning. You’ve never ever been summoned your entire 450 year existence because not even the most powerful witch or warlock has ever been able to do it, but, somehow, someone who has to have extraordinary powers has been able to call you to earth. Of course, you’d be scared. I don’t care if I am Lucifer’s daughter. That doesn’t mean I can’t be afraid of something.

So, I’m being summoned, and expecting a magnificent witch or warlock, or even necromancer, what do I see when I appear floating on top of a fire? 

“Oh, my god, it WORKED!” 
“No way!”
“This isn’t funny. Stop it.”

All their voices came at once. 

I was frozen. How could this be? Was it an extra powerful coven? They did look like witches, with their black hair and clothes, but they were so young. There’s no way they had the power to summon me?

I looked at them when I spoke, “I have to know who are you and how did you summon me?”

“Are you L-L-Lilith? L-L-Lucifer’s daughter?” the leader asked.
“The one and only. Now who are YOU?”
The girl froze and another answered, “I’m Eliza, this is Raven, and this is Sarah. We’re new witches.”

“NEW witches? Then how did you summon ME?” I asked, incredulous.

“I did. I don’t know. We found this book about demons and found this spell to summon a mentor in the dark arts. Please don’t kill us. We’re only 12,” the one called Raven cried.

“Let me see that book.”
Right there on page 666 was a summoning spell for a “demonic mentor.” 

Then a remembered: I had signed up for the mentor program. I was definitely not expecting them to be this young, though.

“Are you all for real? Do you really want to go down this path? It’s very dark and dangerous. Lucifer isn’t easy to please. I should know,” I laughed awkwardly. 

“Yes!” They replied in unison.

“Ok, well, let’s get started. I’ll be the best mentor ever. I know all the secrets. First, let’s do makeovers. Wearing only black only goes so far.”

I made all 3 girls over into darker, more sinister versions of themselves. 
Raven was the least work as she already had long black hair and the right clothes. She just needed the makeup. I gave her a goth look with a blood red lipstick that popped against black lipliner.   
Sarah’s red hair was perfect except I added a black peekaboo layer and put her in a black corset; long, flowing black skirt; black fishnets, and black boots. She looked amazing once I added a black choker and bracelets. 
And then it was Eliza’s turn. I added black lowlights to her hair and turned the leftover platinum into pure white. I gave her face a dark purple theme and added a chain belt to her black corset dress. She was already wearing black fishnets and knee high black lace up boots so really, as with Raven, there wasn’t much to do. After their makeovers, I tattooed each one’s left ankle with my personal symbol — a black quarter moon and red star connected together. 

“Now, we just need a name,” Raven said.

“How about Lilith’s Angels?” I suggested.

“Perfect,” all 3 girls responded in unison.

“Well, not perfect yet, but you’re working on it,” I said, approvingly. “And, now, for our first lesson.” 

I am beyond excited as I look at the girls — my little mentees or “angels.”",30
1lo9cwh,n0l87ft,"I obviously agree to the deal proposed by the demon.  
Following it back to its palace, we are greeted by several maids, whom open the grand gates.  
""Come! Come! I have a Hall solely for the best of my work!"" he says, leading me in.  
I was but a soul, easily dragged away, by this giant of a creature.  
Opening the door to the Hall of  Art, as he called it, he smiles.  
""Voila! As humans say."" he says.  
I enter, looking around.  
I nod.

  
The art is not bad.  
The lines are shaky, and the colors are not the best combination one could do.  
""Not bad."" I say, after analyzing them all.  
No answer.  
I turn around, to see the demon frozen.  
""Not bad? But...  
These are my best works..."" he mutters.  
I sigh...here is the reason I am in Hell.  
Hurt too many artists, some even...

  
""I apologize, Lord Demon, but I won't lie, not when it comes to art.  
The paintings have a bit of soul, which is rare, but it is clear there was no systematic learning procedure to your art.  
You just one day started, and did whatever you wanted, which sometimes works, sometimes...it doesn't.  
The painting are good, but as someone who was in the field for decades, I can tell that the lines delimiting the objects are shaky, not well enough defined.  
The color palette is randomly chosen, some pieces even have conflicting colors close to each other.  
Overall, it's decent, but you could work on your foundations, and theory."" I say.  
No answer.  
""I see. I shall see myself out, and back to the torture line."" I say.  
The demon stops me.

  
""Teach me, Lady."" he says.  
It is my time to freeze.  
""Excuse me?"" I ask.  
""I know why you are here, and I know it will be harsh, but please...teach me.  
I love art, and want to learn.  
I promise, no matter how cold and harsh you will be with me, I won't lash out."" he says.  
""I was not cold, nor harsh, but real...maybe too real, but...  
Fine. Does this mean, I shall stay here, and not be tortured?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""Though, I might torture you, Teacher, with endless questions."" he chuckles.  
I smile.  
""And my answers might torture you. But not today, today we rest."" I say, before I catch myself.  
I look at him, and he just nods, not taking it bad that I took control for a moment.  
Sigh...  
Habits die hard, maybe if I was a bit gentler, giving a bit more freedom to the people I met...I wouldn't be here.",51
1lo9cwh,n0mf7nr,"""So, you're telling me if I come to your house and help you with your story, I'll be returned to the land of the living?"" Julie asks.

""Yes, exactly,"" Azkel responds. ""I absolutely loved the series you wrote about the hoppin' jalapeño, so I figured we could do each other a solid.""

""Won't your boss get mad?""

The demon smiles. ""What Satan doesn't know won't hurt me.""

Julie shrugs. ""Well, your story can't possibly be worse than being tortured, so why not?""

Azkel laughs and says, ""I sure hope not,"" then pulls Julie's chains, dragging her down the jagged stone path to his house.

Julie winces as the rocks cut her feet. ""How much further?""

""What are you talking about? We're here already.""

Julie's eyes narrow. ""But there's nothing here.""

""Look down.""

Julie's eyes widen as she looks down and sees a ten-by-twenty-foot hole at her feet.  At the bottom of the hole, she can see a desk, refrigerator, and some furniture. ""This is your home?""

Azkel grins. ""Nice, right? It's much more spacious than my last pit.""

Julie nods her head, unsure of how to respond.

Azkel claps his bony hands together. ""So, let's get to it.""

""Wait. How do I get in and out?""

""I always forget you humans can't fly."" Azkel snaps his fingers, and a ladder appears. ""Better, princess?""

""Yes. Now, if you could remove these chains."" Julie sticks out her arms.

Azkel sighs and pulls a key ring out of thin air. ""So demanding."" He slides the key in and unlocks the chains. ""Can we finally get started? I've been dying to have someone read my stuff for a while now.""

Julie nods and climbs down the ladder, into the pit. ""Is that air conditioning I feel?""

""Come on, it's not like we're cavemen. Now, come, come."" Azkel pulls out the chair from his desk and gestures for Julie to sit.

Julie walks over and sits down.

Azkel opens the computer on the desk and smiles. ""I hope you like it.""

Julie clicks on the document titled ""Demon Lord: Our Savior"" and begins reading.

After ten minutes, the demon looks at Julie with hopeful eyes. ""So, what do you think so far?""

Julie closes the computer and sighs. ""Take me back to the cage. This is worse than the torture.""

1lo9cwh,n0mkvsk,"""You can't mix purple and yellow, that's first year art school nonsense, you're going to ruin the mystique with how it flows...""  The angel was whining again. It was getting annoying, but there had been measurable progress, and that was enough to keep him going. Sensing another rant, he cut the angel off.    
  
""With all respect, don't focus on what we can't do, there are no rules with art, there is just bad and good taste. Both of which can be wonderful, horrific or in the best cases the mix of the two. You start telling yourself what you shouldn't do you're literally closing an infinite amount of doors that will lead to amazing things. You have this imposing fluorescent space, but there is no focus, nothing that captures theeye, you place a purple vase with lavender bouquet towards the egress, eyes will be drawn to it, they'll understand where they are, they'll be hit with this immense *gravitas* of the moment."" He ended the sermon with a small flourish towards the general vast area around them.    
  
The angel looked at him with reluctant hesitation, though he knew the angel was into it, the eyes gave it away. The angel chewed on their lower lip for a bit, opened their mouth a few times and then let it out ""I mean, this is like *The* Gates Of Hell, people show up here and are beaten over the head with *gravitas*. They find out that they'll pay for eternity for the sins they've done on earth, I don't think you can improve upon that *gravitas*.""   

There they go again, he thought, its always that mindset that kills progress, of any type, ""This-is-the-way-we've-always-done-it"". How many people just coasted thru life based on a one hit wonder, just doing the same thing that made them famous, never expanding, never pushing, just staying in that safe space? too many he always said. Luckily he had the perfect way to blow thru that bullshit.   
  
""Well there you go then, if this is how its always have been, then how do you know you can make it better? Ok, lets think back to the *Lake Of Fire*? What was the first thing I asked you?""   
  
The angel sighed, looked a bit coy and blurted out with a smirk ""You asked if I liked it.""   
  
He had them on the line, he knew it, he had plenty of people here before, this was the fun part of the job, the one that kept him in the game. The part that made you deal with people who had no sense of style or taste, but had buckets of money and time. He relished in it before he took the next step: ""Yes and what did you say?""   
  
The angel blushed with embarrassment, and was trying to hide a smile ""I said  No, its just been here for a while"". The angel chuckled at the memory. 
  
""Exactly! And what did I ask you after that?""    
   
The angel gave in with a big smile on their face ""You asked me what i wanted out of it. I mean...that just seems so obvious! But...but no one has asked me that! Ugh its just so frustrating at times."" The angel laughed to themselves and looked down to the ground, they seemed to be mulling over their life choices. He didn't need the angel to be focusing on that, he needed this to be over quickly.    
   
""Yes yes i did, and you wanted something *different* something that still said pain and suffering via burning. And what did we come up with?....Come on, what did we come up with?""   
   
The angel looked up at him with eyes of an excited child ""The Liquid Nitrogen Lake! Again, seemed so obvious, but I just couldn't get there alone""   
  
""Everything looks so obvious in hindsight! Look at the wheel, or the bow and arrow, or even somethings that Da Vinci drew seemed like low hanging fruit. I mean, he was the icon of the Renaissance, and his ideas seems juvenile now""   
  
The angel's demeanor shifted, the warmth was toned down, it was there, but it was noticeably colder. The response was flat ""We do not bring that up here.""   
   
The eyes scared him, the surreal purple iris's that welcomed him when he arrived in Hell had darkened to deep blue, the pupils shifted to a square like a goat's and were the color of dead persons skin. He felt his bowels begin to loosen and his stomach turned into knots, his mouth filled with saliva and was overtaken by a sense of nausea and pain. He saw it, he saw what he tried to forget, memories repressed came flooding back and with it a sense of dread so deep he knew he'd suffer forever.   

He was dizzy with pain and about to throw himself to the floor to anchor himself,  when the angel snapped their fingers, he was back up on his feet feeling almost normal, he felt the absence of whatever just happened, something he doesn't feel like he'd ever forget. The angel's eyes seemed to lighten as it looked into his ""Do you understand?""    
  
Attempting to play off what happened, he composed himself ""Completely, i totally get it. So what, uh, what else do you have for me to go over? I'd love to see what else you have""   
  
The angel placed a claw to their chin, mulling over their domain ""There are 4 other circles we have not visited. I'd prefer we go to the ones i like the least first.""    
    
""Again, all due respect, show me the ones your love most first, I'm a big fan of *destroying our darlings*.""   
  
The angel looked down at the man, and smiled ""You know what? I am too, i just never thought of it like that. C'mon lets go check out the maggot farm first. I'm proud of it.""    

Scooping up the man in their large taloned hands, the angel drew him into their breast and flew through the air on leathery wings. The hot air dragged across the man's face as steaming up-drafts of rancid air kept them in the sky. 
   
The man peeled his face from the skin of the angels chest and bellowed out over the noise of the flight ""So this maggot farm like a bleak industrial farm where maggots swirl in vats?""   

The angel's eyes open with delight ""Oh my! Well it will be now!""",6
1lo0b4m,n0jk010,"""Medieval-looking room. Old wizard people. Knights in armor.   
Let me guess. You guys summoned me to be the Hero to defeat some evil dark lord in this magical fantasy realm.""   
An elder speaks to you, ""Actually, we already did that. We want you to become the new interim leader of the Dark Lands."" 

I'm taken aback ""You did? Then why not just let your summoned Hero take care of it?""  
The Elder clears his throat ""Ahum, believing her work done, she left to travel to the northern land. She heard they have a grain that resembles you world's ""rice"". I believe her words where ""Finally, some good fucking food""""

I chuckle ""Yeah, ok. So now i'm your guy? Take over leadership of the Dark Lands, huh? Sounds like a fun place...""

The elder waves his hand ""Only temporarily, until such time they choose their own leader and learn their place as a subjugated land"" He hesitates for a moment 'We...euhmm...can't send you back, but once your work has been completed, you will be handsomely rewarded and can live out your life in luxury and leisure""

I nod ""Well, ok, i suppose. Do i get any powers?""

""Yes"" the elder replies ""Just imagine seeing your status and you will see it. No one else can see it.""

I close my eyes and imagine my status. And damn, it actually appears. I see my name, my age, that i'm an offworlder. I have a bunch of *cheat* skills, like ""Discern Lies"", 'Understand Languages"" and ""Rapid Healing"".   
I can use all magic, except ""Light"" magic. And....oh, damn, i think i'd better keep THAT to myself. My status says that my ""class"" is ""Demon Lord"". I think this gig might *not* be as temporary as these guys think...

After some more talk and gearing up. I'm given some nice clothing, a fancy leather armor (they offered metal, but i liked the look of leather better) and a sword. The portal is created and i step through.

Right into the throne room of the previous Demon Lord. There are dozens of heavily armored demons and they come up to me. Where these guys even told i was coming?

The one in more ornate armor draws his sword and i start to get worried.

He kneels before me with a somber look on his face, offering up the sword.   
""Take this sword, human, it was the sword of our king. Take my head, but please spare my men, as they where merely doing their duty when they defended our nation during your invasion""  
He lowers his head, waiting. I take the sword from him and for a second it glows.

'Whoa, hold up, i'm not here to execute anyone, i'm here to be your interim leader""",80
1lo0b4m,n0jc2ss,"I frown.  
""So, you already summoned someone from my world, and they saved the world?"" I ask.  
The previous elder nods.  
""Uhm.   
And now, the Dark Lands, which I guess it's the name of the region where the evil or at least the races you don't agree with live, need a new leader?"" I ask.  
""Demons, and several fallen species, that do thrive on violence, and conflict, though not necessarily evil, but war-like, yes. And you would be an interim leader, until you are either accepted..."" he starts again.  
I laugh.

  
""Or die, and be replaced by the true leader?"" I finish his sentence.  
He nods.  
""I guess sending me back, is a no-no."" I ask.  
They nod.  
""Summoning requires precise steps, and a strong need. We need a leader for the Dark Lands, so there is balance, and a semblance of order there...and you were brought.  
This means the Gods think your soul is suitable."" a mage chimes in.  
I nod.  
""Blessings or cheats I get?"" I ask.  
They look around, and frown.

  
""Ahm, you could try saying some words like ""spell"", ""status"", ""blessing"", as we don't know exactly what blessings one has. Sure, I can already tell you that you are blessed, and you have magic in you, but for what kind it is...  
It's personal. It's impossible to actually read it."" the mage answers again.  
I nod, and think about my power.  
""Devour - absorbing 100% of everything, enhancing nutrition, and strengthening of magic, and body."" it read.  
I think about it a bit, and create a passive skill...it work.  
""Devouring Skin - a thin film of devouring hangs around the skin: passive absorption of energy."" it read.  
""Fine. Take me there."" I say.  
They all smile, and thank me.

  
I am then teleported to a grand hall, all alone, as the portal closes behind me.  
The hall is ruined, where several wounded demons greet me.  
""You shall be our new Lord?"" one of them spats.  
I nod, as I sense the darkness around me, and how my power can turn even this into energy.  
I can feel my stats rising.  
""A weakling? A mere human, I shall..."" he continues, but I walk up to him, and grab his head.  
In mere moments, he turns to dust, as I feel his power filling me.  
""I am to bring order, and balance to these lands, and that's what I will do. Hell, maybe I can succeed where my predecessor failed, and make these lands better. Bring me up to speed with the races, species, tribes, and forces in these lands, and who I can use."" I say, sitting down on what used to be the stairs to the throne.  
The remaining demons, a succubus, a giant, and a 4 armed one smiled, and knelt.  
This wasn't that bad.  
I could work with this, and will make sure I don't die.",152
1lo0b4m,n0jfir5,"It was a rough night at the frat house. Plenty of drunken laughter. There was a midnight raid of Sigma Phi Delta and can you believe that the nerds were caught red handed playing D&D? Man, we really trashed their game and they were royally pissed about it but what could they do? They sat there pissing in their own togas.

Yeah, well that wasn’t the craziest shit that happened. I had too much beer. I remember Sophia leading me to a bed. She had this look on her face.  Crazy Sophia. But, drunk as I was, I thought, WTF. Right? Everyone’s doable with enough embalming fluid in ya, Right? Only, I must have passed out. I don’t remember much more than falling onto the bed and then blackout. 

I woke up with a pounding headache. I let out a long belch that echoed around the room. Something was different because my room was small and well padded with posters of rockers.  I open my eyes, trying to adjust to the blur while the light bored into my skull like two drills. 

Medieval looking room. Old wizard people. Knights in armor. The acid in my stomach roiled, burning as it rose up my throat. I swear at least two kegs worth of beer spewed out of my mouth onto the stone floor. That’s when I realized I was naked. 

“Good one,” I said. “Where are the geeks who put you up to this? I have a mind to kill those Sigma Phi Deltas, but they’ve really outdone themselves. Maybe just a mild slapping for the realism.”

“He’s perfect,” the Knight says.

“He’ll do,” said the wizard. 

“Let’s face it,” says the elder. “We’re desperate.”

“Ouch,” I say. But I play along. “Let me guess. You guys summoned me to be the hero to defeat some evil dark lord in this magical *fantasy* realm.” I air quote the last part to let them know I’m playing along. 

“Actually,” the elder says, “we already did that. We want you to become the interim leader of the Dark Lands he lorded over.”

“Fine,” I say. “But can someone get me a towel and some clothes?” I try not to let them know that they succeeded in embarrassing me by leaving me naked and covered in my own puke. 

“So,” says the wizard. “He agreed. Can we do it now?”

“He clearly wasn’t sincere,” said the knight. “Will it work if he doesn’t mean it?”

“He doesn’t even believe you,” Sophia says as she approaches with a towel. She tosses the towel at me. It bounces off my chest. “Somebody throw a bucket of water on him. He stinks.”

A bucket floats from the corner of the room as if on an invisible string and tips over my head. My mouth agape and my eyes wider, the bracing water pours from the bucket until the puke is puddled on the floor. Certainly the bucket wasn’t large enough to hold all of that water. 

“Don’t fret, young man,” the wizard says. “The summoning spell often has that affect on the summoned. Also, only organic matter is transported.”

“Sophia,” I say. “Thank god. Stop this prank at once.”

“It’s not a prank, Steve,” she says. “I was transported to your world to find the best candidate to fill the position. You checked all the boxes. Really, you are the biggest dick on campus.”

I cover my genitals. Sophia smirks. 

“Look outside if you don’t believe me.”

I wrap the filthy towel around my waist and walk over to a white stone ballustraded balcony. I stand in the chill morning air with the sun rising in the distance. Deep shadows cover the land but I’m clearly not in Florida. Smoke coils from numerous blast zones and most horrid of all deformed creatures roamed the land beaten and broken after some terrible conflict. Almost immediately after I stood on the balcony, one of the beaten looks up perhaps catching a glimpse of movement and shouts, pointing. 

“A new lord has risen! A new lord has risen!”

Slowly, the masses of bent and broken creatures turn towards the tower and look up at me, taking up the chant. Soon, hundreds of thousands of them are cheering me on. If I had more contents in my stomach, I would have heaved a second time. 

Yeah, well that wasn’t the craziest shit that happened either.",44
1lo0b4m,n0mjpcy,"“Okay, okay, medieval-looking room, creepy robes, armor guys standing awkwardly in corners. Lemme guess. You summoned me here to be the Chosen One, yeah? Defeat the Big Bad, bring peace to the kingdom, yada yada...”

“No, Mr. Geephunq,” says the lead beard, adjusting his glasses, which are somehow both half-moon and bifocal. “The Great Evil was defeated last quarter. Quite ahead of projections. We require you to assume interim governance of the Dark Lands.”

“Bro. Call me Warren.”

“Warren. Of course. Warren.”

Pause.

“I’m sorry, what now?” I asked, politely.

“The Dark Lands,” he repeats. “You’ve been selected by cross-dimensional civil tender to act as their transitional executive facilitator. Orientation begins shortly.”

And then one of them *hands me a binder*. Like, a big, plastic-ringed, color-coded binder. It's got dividers and everything. ""Volume I: Foundational Overview of the Dark Lands Organisational Infrastructure.""

I try to hand it back. “Nah, man. I think I’m good. I’ll just… portal home? Call an Uber from the summoning circle?”

The guy with the glasses blinks. “I’m afraid we’ve already allocated resources for your integration. The portal is suspended until your probationary review. It’s in the Terms of Dimensional Procurement. Page 9, subsection B.”

He opens the binder to show me. He has *bookmarks*.

“Why me?” I ask, genuinely baffled.

The lead robed guy (Gary? Gerald?) flips open another binder. “You demonstrated significant transformational impact during your tenure at… ‘Zenthrix Solutions’? You tripled quarterly pipeline velocity while maintaining a 120% net uplift in morale proxy metrics.”

“That was a Salesforce dashboard, man. It auto-filled half that sentence.”

“You were also named ‘Optimisation Champion’ three quarters running.”

“I wore a hat that said that. As a joke.”

“You scaled vertically-integrated synergies across a multi-stakeholder landscape.”

“I… reposted a Notion template.”

They all nod solemnly.

“Hey, now hold on,” I say, backing up. “You can’t just take a man’s resume like… for real for real. That stuff's for recruiters, not... *this.*”",19

Taking in the halls of the now-museum, Kalthor the Immortal stared at me, a humbly dressed outsider to the lands of Darkness.  

""THIS!,"" he roared, his pale skin pink with volcanic fury.

""It's a museum for the people, to teach them history of these lands so they can learn from them,"" I began, pointing down the East Wing like a tour guide, ""Besides, each generation educated is one more generation that can prosper without repeating the brutish mentalities I encountered here.""

""But... We summoned you to be the interim leader of the lands, to provide the balance!""

A troll and orc wandered in, unarmed and lacking the typical armor of their warrior kin of previous eras.  I waved them down and began the tour.  Kalthor glowered while he followed.  

First stop, the Natural History Wing: Origins of ancient life and epochs of life.  Drow and Dwarven children played around fossils of ancient life forms as Kalthor watched in horror as I explained Evolutionary Theory.  Next stop, Early Civilizations, where ancient undead described to enthralled listeners what life was like.  The school trips were all over the other wings as well, covering art, music, geology, Arcana, the Realms, etc.    

Over the next few hours, I led the tour group through the museum, stopping for the kids to take selfies while sitting on the previous Emperor's throne, the demon bloods really enjoying the chance to pose with authentic imperial regalia now repurposed for photos. 



""What is this place?  Why the flowers and trees?""

""This is the National Botanical Gardens,"" I replied, ""This is what the lands looked like before the first Demon King.  Citizens want greenery, it was in the last referendum,"" I replied as I handed a pack of heirloom seeds to an orc child, ""It was really popular, especially with the Drow and Orcs.""

""What?  Referendum?""

""Yeah, as part of the advances on the basic Civil Code granting rights and representative government while outlawing slavery and other crimes.""

kalthor gawked.  

""Citizens?  Voting?""

""Oh and universal healthcare and education, paid for with open trade with the other kingdoms and empires and a tax on the wealthy members of society.  We brought up literacy to 100% and have a secondary education completion of 98% with pathways for higher education or apprenticeships and trades.  All with equal dignity and living wages.""

I watched the wizard try to comprehend what I did.  

""Oh and since you brought me from a technologically advanced society, I thought it would be great to bring some of that here.  We got the space shuttle working last harvest and plan to build out on the colonies across the great ocean.""

Kathor grimaced.  This was not what the Dark Lord was meant to do.  Destiny was...

""Dude, if you want a Dark Lord, YOU become the Dark Lord.  I got a nation to lead and a world to improve.""

I left the wizard there.  

The Land of Darkness now shone bright.",11
1lo0b4m,n0jk0s9,"The demon general sighs ""No, i suppose you'll want as much slaves as possible"" He lowers his head more.  
""If you promise to spare our women, children and seniors, i swear we will work the mines as hard as we can""

I'm starting to get the feeling thing aren't *quite* as i thought they where.

I sit down on the Demon Lord's throne and address the kneeling demon ""There is much i do not know about your world and you will tell me all about it. For one thing, it seems it was the humans that started the war? To make you all slaves? Well, that just doesn't sit right with me.""

Still kneeling, the demon general named O'ester tells me how the humans demanded the Orichalcum mines that only exist in the Dark Lands. When the previous Demon Lord refused, the humans invaded them. Using religion, they claimed to want to cleanse the world of ""evil"", as they slaughtered their way across the Dark Lands. Mostly slaughtering civilians. Women and children. The humans where well prepared for war, but the demons weren't.

They where pushed back again and again. And in the end, a Summoned Hero killed the Demon Lord and the demons surrendered. After the Hero left, the humans immediately executed the entire royal family.

As i listen to the harrowing story of atrocities, my expression hardens.

When he finishes his story, it is silent in the room. I think about my options.  
""So you are saying the humans invaded your country and defeated you, because you lacked the weaponry and skill to resist them? That they said you are all evil and they where *justified* in slaughtering women and children?"" The demon general hears the anger in my voice and his body tenses up, expecting to be punished for speaking his mind.

""I can tell you are speaking the truth, O'ester. I do not like what has been done to your people. Not one bit.From this day on, you will not refer to me as *human*, if you must call me something, call me ""offworlder"". And i will teach you the technology of my world. I will teach you about mounted infantry, about explosives that do not require magic, about weapons that can kill a target at long range, longer range than the best bows. I will teach you advanced combat tactics that don't rely on everyone standing in a field to face one another. Tactics that allow a smaller army to prevail over larger armies.""

I look around the room, at the gathered demon army officers ""We will expel the *human* invaders from *our* lands and make them pay for their crimes!""

The kneeling demon raises his head, a glimmer of hope in his eyes ""What should we call you?""

""You can call me....."" i think for a moment ""You can call me *Genghis Khan* and i shall be know to the world as the *Demon Lord* Genghis Khan!""

The demon general and his officers cheer and chant my name.

Why did i choose that name you ask?  
So that when the human spread their *lies* to the Summoned Hero, she will know i am *also* a summoned human from earth..........

1lo0b4m,n0mk7wc,"I gave in at some point. 

So, yeah. I’m apparently the new acting manager of the Dark Lands.

Only it’s not fiery doom and screaming. It’s more like a midwest DMV if the DMV also had sword-wielding skeletons and a “Mandated Sorrow Budget.” They keep handing me forms. Personality inventories. Strategic development surveys. There’s a tea break. One of the death knights asks if I’m union.

By day three, I stop trying to protest and start flipping through the binders in my morning management feedback meeting.

That’s when I find the section labeled *""Fauna & Hazards (Endangered and Otherwise).”*

“Okay,” I say, reading aloud. “The Flesh-Eating Mist of Maldrac Hollow may not be disrupted, scattered, or dispersed by magical or meteorological means. It is a Protected Anomaly under the Dark Lands Preservation Accord?”

The robed lady nods. “Category Two. It has a nesting range.”

“This mushroom,” I continue, “which exudes a paralytic fear gas and whispers your darkest regrets; this cannot be moved?”

“It is a heritage fungus.”

“And these skeletal beasts, the ones that *eat children*?”

“They were here first.”

Binder two is worse.

It’s just pages and pages of black-and-white diagrams of factories and workhouses, with scribbled annotations like “INFERNAL OUTPUT, PHASE THREE.” I ask what they’re making. No one knows. I ask why they’re still running all these factories, if the output is so unknowable.

The head robe guy smiles. He actually *smiles*.

“The line must go up,” he says. And points to a chart.

Productivity, Output, Compliance. All rising. All meaningless. Just line after line going up. ""Line must go up,"" he repeats.

“Okay, but like… what if it can’t?” I start. “The world is finite. What if you hit a ceiling, or run out of bodies, or carbon, or—”

Another robe cuts me off. “It’s acceptable if the line goes up… slowly.”",14
1lo0b4m,n0mkbkp,"Everyone in the room goes very still.

“Wait,” I say. “So I could just… *regulate* things?”

They nod. In unison. I feel like I’m on a ketamine trip inside a union grievance hearing.

“So I could pass a law banning…” I flip pages. “…‘the discharge of cursed effluent into Lake Dark?’”

“Granted,” they say.

“I could legislate… a five-hour workday? Mandatory weekends?”

“Granted.”

“You guys want me to make this place *look* a little better. But not too fast. Just… keep it moving. Keep the line going up. Even if it means solving problems inefficiently. Or half-solving them. Or just drawing little triangles on a whiteboard for three weeks and calling it ‘stakeholder calibration.’”

“That,” says one of them, “is governance.”

So now I’m standing on this cliff at sunset, wearing a cape I didn’t ask for, looking out over the haunted wasteland of the Dark Lands. Below me are necrotic farmlands, howling trees, and a factory that seems to be building more binders. I don’t know.

I sigh. Adjust my nameplate. It says Warren G, **Acting Regional Administrator, Dark Lands Transition Period (Phase TBD).**

Time to mount up.

Time to regulate.",21
1loc3xt,n0ls4zj,"I smile.  
""Not easy being a Mind Reader, when the unawakened passively project their thoughts outwards, without any filtering.  
Not your fault you read them, hear them, but it's not their fault they can't shield them."" I say.  
She sighs.  
""I am aware, but their thoughts...aren't always kind, and they are hard to ignore. Then when they realize I can read their minds? I hear over and over gain the word: ""monster""."" she mutters.  
I nod, and pat her shoulder.

  
""I know it is hard, but whom better to search the masses for a potential awakener, than a Mind Reader?"" I smile at her.  
She rolls her eyes.  
""If the pay wouldn't be this good..."" she starts.  
""And if the world would be at peace, and there would be no need for awakeners."" I continue for her.  
She pouts, but nods.  
Young ones are still discontent with the facts.  
We need all the talents we can get...  
And for that, we need to comb the population.

  
""I know the theory, but what is the difference between an unawakened that can't awaken, and someone with the potential?"" I ask.  
She smirks.  
""Oh? So there is something, Mr. ""I am 100 years old and am more experienced than anyone"" doesn't know?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
She pouts, seeing, I don't argue.  
""Wilder thoughts. Harder to read, or too easy to read, and most importantly a bit of interference. As in, I can read their thoughts, but there is some static every now and then, which is their own power trying to passively protect them."" she says.  
I thank her.

  
We run into the subway, just barely escaping from an angry mob.  
""Seriously! See? Crazy people!"" she says.  
I sigh.  
""They are afraid of us. It is true that the Things are attracted to awakeners more than to simple humans...  
No wonder they don't want to acknowledge awakeners."" I say.  
She sighs.  
""Well, 19 people in that school are potential awakeners."" she says, and I freeze.  
""19...our of barely 200 kids?"" I ask, and she nods.  
I take out my phone, and make an urgent report to the HQ.  
""What is wrong?"" she asks.  
""What is the usual ratio of potential awakeners in the populace?"" I ask.  
""1 in 1000 roughly..."" she drags, her eyes widening.  
""And what is the main way to hasten, and bring out this potential even in those who didn't have it?"" I ask.  
""Be in the presence of an ""Entity""."" she says grimly, as we stop the subway, and run out, back towards the school.  
Things are about to get interesting, as an ""Entity"" can be good or bad, unlike Things, so best we can do is hope this one is benevolent...",15
1loc3xt,n0lz8x4,"Thanks and thank you for the prompt!

Don't have time for another short story continuation, but shortly:

Things = enemy invaders that are hell-bent to destroy the civilization the MCs are part of

Entities = beings that surpassed the mortal status (not necessarily God-like already, but above mere mortals) , and here you can imagine anything from spirits, monsters, demons, to gods, living objects, beliefs/stories taken form, and so on.

And since they surpassed mortals, they naturally emit a radiance/energy, and this energy is able to evoke the potential of unawakened individuals, or induce a mutation that would give this potential to those that don't have it.",8
1lnwyry,n0ip2qs,"Okay, John, calm down.  
I look around my bathroom, and take out the device I ordered years ago, when I had an episode.  
It doesn't beep.  
Okay, this means there is no camera here.  
I am naked, so there is no way it would have been on my clothes...  
So then why?  
Why can't I teleport?

  
I had a power awakened when I was young.  
I could teleport anywhere in the world by thinking about that place, but with a condition: no one can be looking at me when I do that.  
I used to do it from my room, my apartment, or some public rest room, but!  
For the last few hours, I can't teleport, no matter where I hide.  
I even tried in the closet, covered in coats, and clothes...  
Nothing works.  
What is going on?

  
Okay, John, calm down.  
If you awakened some power, who is to say someone else didn't awaken something else?  
Like Clairvoyance? Or Far-sight? Or magic?  
Maybe supernatural stuff is real, and someone, or something is watching me.  
Okay...that made it worse.  
I take my meds, hoping they will calm me down.  
I was once followed by some gentlemen in Germany, and since then I had some episodes of severe...paranoia.  
Powers not really being public, I am quite worried I will be shipped off and dissected.  
As I shiver due to that thought, I can feel it.  
I can teleport.

  
I focus on something I rarely do: something vague, ethereal.  
I focus on teleporting nearby on a street if there is, to the place from where I was watched from.  
I know it is dangerous, and stupid, but I have to...I will make it quick.  
It works.  
I appear on the street, on the other side of the world, in the middle of the night.  
It is a nice looking neighborhood?  
I look around, and see her: a young woman in her window, smoking.  
""You! The handsome naked dude from my dream!"" she screams, pointing at me.  
I freeze, and blush, as I watch her go inside, saying she's coming.  
I panic, and teleport away...  
Back in my room, I breath slowly.  
Okay, John, calm down...she just...she just saw you naked, in her dream, not a biggie.  
I sigh.

1lo4tna,n0kad6a,"The man is too shocked by the apparent appearance of an angel—a guardian angel?—to comment, so instead he glances down at the cone in his hand.

“It’s just an ice-cream.”

“Yes! So unhealthy! Full of sugar and fat! And yesterday, you rode your bike in heavy traffic—”

“To get to work? I do that every day.”

“And the day before that, you pulled your phone charger out of the socket without turning it off at the wall first!”

“I did? Come on, that’s not going to hurt.”

“Ha! Famous last words.” The angel takes a deep breath and seems to deflate, its wings drooping around its shoulders. “I just need you to stay safe. You’re my first assignment. I can’t screw this up.”

“Oh. I see. Um.” The man pats the angel’s shoulder awkwardly. “Listen, I’m just living my life, like anybody else.”

But I can’t keep doing this: it’s like EVERY DAY with you!!” I yelled in frustration.  I was uncomfortably aware that my neighbours could probably hear me.

However, my garden cat, Veles, simply stared at me from his precarious position on an out-poking strut halfway up an electricity pylon.  As usual he eyed me with the sort of lidded contempt that suggested that he not only failed to recognize me from the last two years of daily feedings, but didn’t care to know me either.

Why the hell do you always provoke people?  
And why do you have to always go to the nastiest places?

I stopped, only to see several men staring at us.  
He came back, groaning.  


""See? I told you! EVERY DAY!"" he shouts.  
I laugh, and start attacking the men.  
They try to say something, but I don't care.  
After defeating them, I am yanked up.

I try to escape but can't.

You basically attacked the forest police."" he says.  
I look around, and indeed...all of them are wood elves, and wear those ranger cloaks.  
I blush.  
""Oops."" I say.  
He facepalms, and starts lecturing me, I slip away after a while, only to hear him groan, and shout after me.

1lo64o5,n0kfyo3,"99 floors have I went through, to get to the secret vault of the dungeon.  
Each floor more dangerous than the previous, with few rooms where safety was assured.  
I traveled through entire ecosystems that were hell-bent on killing any intruder./  
I saw entire civilizations born in this great dungeon, luring me with promises of good life, wealth, and stability.  
I didn't give up.  
With my life on the line, I fought, and passed the trials...until I arrived at the secret floor.  
Here, I was greeted by the legendary dragon's sight, who is supposed to guard the treasure...  
And I am shocked.

  
The dragon, in humanoid form, seems to be a young woman, drinking tea, sitting under a great tree.  
""Oh. Someone made it here? You passed the demon levels?"" she asks.  
I nod, shivering, as I remember the previous 9 levels.  
The deviousness and tricks, and wars I faced...  
""Is the legend true? Is there a secret treasure in the greatest dungeon of this world? Are you the legendary dragon that guards it?"" I ask. She nods.  
I feel happy, but confused, as she points to the tree behind her.

  
""That is the secret treasure.  One leaf per person, it ensures enlightenment on how to break racial limits."" she says.  
""Racial limits? Like level limit?"" I ask her, looking at my status screen.  
Level 99/99...it has been 99 since floor 80.  
""Oh, you guys went back to level grading? Sure, whatever your race's level limit is."" she nods.  
She seems...as if she's powerless, but my instincts are screaming.  
She's stronger than the Demon Kings and Queens I had to kill to get here.  
""What do I have to do to get it?"" I ask.  
""Drink a cup of tea with me."" she smiles.  
I nod, and approach her.

  
Sitting down, I feel her pressure even more, but I still keep my calm.  
She pours me the tea, and looks at me.  
I took a sip, and my Poison resistance doesn't react...should be a good sign.  
""How is the taste?"" she asks, but before I could answer, I freeze.  
I see the universe be born, stars, and planets born out of energies, and matter colliding.  
I saw the first beings be born, mastering elements, and controlling laws, and I saw more.  
Empires rise and fall, Heroes, dungeons...everything, and anything.  
I gasp, as I see the dragon once more.  
""You survived. Congratulations. You have been enlightened."" she says.  
I stand up, angry, but then see my status screen: Level 101/500.  
""That was?"" I ask, and she nods.  
""I used the leaves to brew the tea, and the consumption of the leaf is a trial in itself, after all...it's not easy to break those limits."" she says.

""How? If it is a destruction related power?"" she asks.  
""I lower the intensity of the power until it couldn't erase dust, and send it out.

1lnxi7j,n0jatzx,"I spotted Shatter as he walked into the elevator, precisely on time. Like he always was.

""Hey, can you hold the elevator?""

""I got you.""

He acknowledged me with a nod. I could see why he was in charge. Between the combat skills that had earned him his code name, his meticulous rule-following, and the people skills, it was a no-brainer. You couldn't dream up a better leader than him.

""So what's the big mission?""

""Can't say.""

""Can't say? Or won't say?""

He smiled at me, with a look that was simultaneously mischievous and chiding. It was like he was my team leader and my co-conspirator all at once.

""Okay, okay, I'll wait.""

""Good call,"" he replied with a chuckle. ""This one's important, we do it by the book.""

-- -- -- -- --

""Shatter, Geek,"" the general acknowledged us as we entered the secure area.

""General Stahl. How are you?"" Shatter returned the greeting.

""I'll be much better when this is all over.""

""That big a deal, huh?"" I asked.

He nodded, but it looked more like nervous energy than an affirmation. He really was afraid of what was going to happen next.

""Wow, you're spooked. Who are we going after?"" I couldn't help but poke, ""Heh, don't tell me it's the Doctor?""

I expected chuckles from the others; the question was preposterous. No one attacked the Doctor. Heroes, villains, governments, and everything in between gave him a wide berth. It wasn't worth the risk, and the consequences were often disastrous.

Instead, they winced. The silence answered my question for me, but I suddenly lost all sense of banter.

""We're going after the Doctor?! Are you all crazy? Why risk that kind of pain?""

""We think we can neutralize half his powers,"" General Stahl admitted.

""You know that leaves the other half, right? The regeneration that makes him near invincible?""

""Not that half,"" Shatter chimed in.

""What? You can't be serious! You want to LEAVE the powers that can destroy anything? And you want us to ATTACK that lunatic with those powers fully intact?""

""Sit down, Geek,"" Shatter suggested.

""I'll stand, thanks.""

""Suit yourself, but there is a method to the madness,"" General Stahl tried to convince me.

""There darn well better be,"" I spat back as I watched the General pull up the relevant intel.

-- -- -- -- --

""You all know why we call him the Doctor,"" the General began.

""Can destroy anything, but chooses to heal his victims along the way. Maximizes and prolongs their suffering.""

""In a nutshell, yes. But have you ever considered how he pulls that off?""

""Does it matter?""

""It does, quite a bit,"" Shatter chimed in. ""Those two power sets are completely opposed to each other.""

""So? He won the genetic lottery and ended up with two powers.""

""Mutations don't really work like that,"" General Stahl pointed out. ""Mutations tend to enable one power, not two. And they certainly don't enable the opposites simultaneously. That'd take intentional manipulation, and no one understands the genetics well enough to pull that off.""

""So, it wasn't luck,"" I commented as I followed along. I could feel the beginnings of a thought forming, a thread of understanding that was beginning to be visible.

""The second hint was that the Doctor routinely destroys all technology within eyesight,"" Shatter added now that I wasn't actively trying to question everything.

""How does that tell us anything? He's just destroying things.""

""Yes, but the order matters,"" General Stahl pointed out. ""We analyzed his fights, and we don't have ANY data. Not even a few minutes, across all the times someone has dared challenge him. So he's always taken out the technology FIRST.""

""So he doesn't want the technology in the mix. Why?"" I asked, getting excited. If this was going where I thought it was, this might be my time to shine.

""It can beat him,"" Shatter explained simply.

""Beat him?!"" I exclaimed. I hadn't dared hope for that much.

""The Doctor has a destructive power, but it's the circuit between the healing and destruction that makes him lethal. He can inflict an infinite amount of pain if he keeps healing you. Only he never heals you completely, so it's a slow grind towards death. Or worse,"" General Stahl pointed out.

""So ... you're saying you think the healing can be disabled?"" I asked. ""With technology of some sort?""

""Bingo,"" Shatter confirmed.

""How?"" my curiosity immediately chimed in.

""Extend the range of your drones, and hide them. We've figured out how to make things invisible,"" the General pointed out.

""Invisible?!""

""If you had an extended amount of time, could you disable his tech?"" Shatter asked, with all the gravity he could muster.

""Yes. If it's tech-based, I can take it down. You buy me that time, I'll neutralize it,"" I asserted confidently. This was my domain, and I just needed a couple of extra minutes to work.

""Can you, um, pwn it?"" General Stahl asked cautiously.

""Hahaha, you've been reading up,"" I complimented him. ""Yes, I can gain control over his tech. You give me that time, and I'll make it heal whomever you want, however quickly you-""

I stopped mid-sentence, realizing the full extent of the plan.

""You know what you're signing up for, right, Shatter?""

""I do,"" the man nodded.

""It'll be pure agony, the whole time.""

""You patch me up, and I'll deal with the pain. So long as my body responds when I need it to, I'll take him down.""

I whistled. This was a hell of a plan.

""You're sure, Shatter? There's got to be another way.""

""It's the only semi-viable strategy we've ever come up with, Geek. It's this or nothing.""

I swallowed hard, and resolved not to let this man down.

""I got you.""

Dr. Powell's confusion was evident in his furrowed brow as he looked from the black and white splotched bovine to the woman who'd brought him there. She was an attractive blonde with bright blue eyes and a star-patterned dress, who promised him an amazing opportunity. He started with a skeptical mindset that got worn down as she they traveled. The appointment was set, and they met 15 minutes ago. The blonde took him to a sprawling university campus that he was unfamiliar with, and took him into a lab that seemed to get more futuristic as they walked through, to finally stop at the cow. She simply nodded with encouragement. This was what he was here for. It was an odd place for an interview, but she confirmed it'd started already. 



""Well...,"" Dr. Powell nodded after gathering his thoughts. ""...My 10th birthday party was the first time it happened. I dissolved the second-story floor, everything and everyone dropped down with a hard landing. I ended up with my arms and a leg behind my back, then spent six weeks in the hospital. All I could do was feel guilty and watch the doctors be amazing. Superpowers are common enough, but not one of them treated me like I was dangerous. They said they've seen all kinds of awakenings, and mine was one of the tamer ones. No one even accused me of doing it intentionally."" 



""I see,"" Starla replied. ""That answers where you got inspired to join the medical field. What about this unique opportunity? What brings you here?"" 



""Technology, mostly,"" Dr. Powell replied. ""I'm doing what I can to help, with what I have. But, then I was approached,"" he smiled at the blonde again. Everyone knew the specifics, but this was a formal interview, and he had to answer the questions. ""Nano-tech, and alternate realitities were proven to exist, and I had to know more. The more I know, the more people I can help."" 



""You know there are other ways to help, even within Chroma Corp.,"" Starla replied. ""We have quite a large Super division, with numerous teams across thousands of Earths.""



""I was given a full briefing on the company,"" Dr. Powell nodded. ""I'm aware of my other options. And, I was also told that changing my mind was allowed, should I find something I prefer doing instead."" 



""Then, you're sure you wouldn't rather work at one of our hospitals?"" Starla asked. ""Why my lab?"" Dr. Powell looked around at the spacious room. It was at least the size of a barn, if not larger, with computers lining one wall, and several other tables decorated with tubes, Bunsen burners, and vials. In one corner was a doorway leading to the 'Animal Enclosures', according to the arrow. 



""It's quiet...,"" Dr. Powell nodded. ""I want to help people... I don't want to deal with people,"" he sighed. ""There were too many kids at my party... I was trying really hard to find some excuse for it to be over. Then, I accidentally did it on purpose. It really was the first time,"" he chuckled. ""I chose biomed research to avoid the patients."" 



""You don't like people?"" Starla asked with a small laugh. 



""Not really,"" Dr. Powell shook his head. 



""You've practiced more with your abilities after that moment, I'm assuming. You can control it?"" she continued the questions. 



""I have,"" he nodded, and Starla laughed again.



""So you have the power to destroy anything,"" she stated. 



""Yep,"" Dr. Powell grinned too. Starla's voice sounded positive and almost enthusiastic. And the blonde was all smiles.



""And you became a doctor?"" she asked. 



""Yes,"" Dr. Powell nodded. 



 ""And, you're being interviewed by a cow,"" Starla said. She made her decision as soon as he took the interview seriously. She'd learned that not many people could handle the idea of working for a talking cow, and began relying on outside help for hiring. 



""You're looking to hire a human,"" Dr. Powell shrugged. ""Who am I to judge?"" 



""That's a useful attitude here, I'm willing to bring you aboard for a probationary period,"" Starla nodded, then she looked at the blonde. She'd been a complete professional, staying quiet the whole time. 



""Great job, Andie. If you and Ozone can find me a few more like him, Chroma Corp. will be happy to cover the same fee."" 



""That's a deal, Ms. Starla,"" Andie smiled, then waved at Dr. Powell. ""Congratulations Mr. Doctor Powell, good luck.""

1lnxi7j,n0nn7r7,"""Ready?"" General Stahl asked for what I hoped was the final time.

""Ready as we'll ever be, General.""

""Good to know. We'll have to go radio silent as soon as we begin, so whatever communication you two need, do it now.""

""What's my signal, Geek?"" Shatter asked.

""I'll make a drone visible. Should grab his attention, too.""

""Good, gives me a target.""

""And, um, Shatter?""

""What, Geek?""

""If things start to go south, I'll detonate a bunch of drones. That should give you a distraction.""

""We'll have bigger problems if we get to that point, but appreciate the offer.""

""Least I could do, you've got the hard part.""

Shatter just nodded. We all knew the sacrifice he was signing up for.

""Do it, Geek.""

My drones turned invisible, and I started moving them towards the Doctor's last known location. Now came the hard part.

-- -- -- -- --

""Holy hell, it's working,"" I muttered to myself.

I could feel Doctor's defenses begin to fall, slowly succumbing to my technopathy. It was a tricky operation, usurping the healer bots without attracting attention. The Doctor wasn't dumb; he'd layered firewalls, honeypots, AI agents, and other defenses to protect his bots. Still, it was 1's and 0's at the end of the day, and I spoke those better than he did.

""Et voila,"" I muttered as I took control of the last bot.

I sighed, knowing that the hard part was next.

""Signal to Shatter,"" I commanded the smallest of my drones. It turned off its invisibility, and began flying in a would-be reconnaissance pattern. I had to at least pretend like things were normal, or the Doctor would see through the ruse and try to eradicate everything in sight before the fight began.

On cue, the Doctor flew in. We'd long suspected he was removing gravity in his immediate vicinity in order to achieve this feat, but there was no good way to prove it.

""A drone? That you, Geek?"" the Doctor mused.

I inhaled sharply. Even from a distance, I worried. If Shatter didn't hold his attention, I was next.

""Not him. Me,"" Shatter announced as he slammed into the Doctor from behind. It was precisely the sort of thing that his speed and strength enabled, and he wasted no time in jumping into the fray.

With a little luck, this wouldn't last long.

""Help him,"" I commanded the drone. It turned on its blasters, doing what it could to add to the damage that the Doctor sustained. It wasn't much, but every little bit counted. This was going to be a war of attrition.

""Enough of that,"" the Doctor muttered as he folded the drone in on itself.

""And for you,"" he commanded as he began to disintegrate Shatter's left leg.

The scream nearly broke me. How do you block out that sound? It was a primal roar, the kind that no amount of training fixes. For the thousandth time, I prayed that Shatter's sanity would hold.

On cue, I felt the Doctor's electronic signal. I couldn't quite tell where he'd triggered it from, but his heal bots were given the command to heal. So, I bade them heal Shatter. Only I told them to increase the rate and total energy expended; there was no point in Shatter suffering longer than necessary.

""Hm, odd,"" the Doctor commented as he noticed the unusual output.

Shatter, to this credit, didn't wait. He knew how desperate this plan was, and he came barreling into the Doctor again, swinging with mean intentions. I noticed that he was swinging for the body, hitting the liver and solar plexus as many times and as quickly as he could.

""Smart. Cut off his oxygen,"" I realized.

Shatter managed a half dozen blows before the Doctor was able to gather his wits again. The effect was immediate, as Shatter's momentum stopped immediately. Wounds began to appear on Shatter's sternum and abdomen; the Doctor was trying to inflict the same kind of injury on Shatter in a twisted attempt at poetic justice.

""You ... that ... hurt,"" the Doctor coughed out.

I felt the commands for the healer bots again, only this time the Doctor intended to direct some of his healing at himself.

""Dammit. What now?""

The plan hadn't accounted for this. If the Doctor realized the ruse now, he still had enough left in the tank to decimate everything in a three mile radius, including both Shatter and me. But I couldn't just let him regenerate and keep torturing Shatter. I had to prolong this a tad, long enough to sap the Doctor some more.

""I'm sorry, Shatter,"" I whispered quietly as I shut my eyes tightly.

I let the bots heal the Doctor at one percent of his intended rate; enough that he would feel some type of healing, but not nearly enough to recover. I had to let him think he was still in control and that he could resort to his usual tricks.

I heard the raspiness in the Doctor's breathing began to subside, slowly turning into more of a cough than a gurgle.

Shatter's wounds healed much faster, though, and he charged in with reckless abandon. I could tell that there was far less technique involved at this point. Whether that was because of the pain, fatigue, trauma, or some combination of all of the above, I couldn't tell. It just looked ... primal. Shatter lashed out with heavy blows, targeting the Doctor's mid section over and over again.

I shut off the Doctor's healing immediately, letting the damage accumulate. This time, the barrage lasted longer. Ten, fifteen solid blows landed before the Doctor could retaliate. Shatter's arms broke in mid-air, violently. To his credit, he swung one last kick as his momentum drove him forward.

""Bas ... tard ..."" was all that the Doctor could manage.

Again, I felt the call for healing. It was urgent, and apparently had a secret mode for overclocking the bots. The Doctor was hurt, and he wanted no part of it.

""Not. This. Time."" I practically grunted at him.

""WHA?"" the Doctor could barely speak as the shock registered. There was no mistaking it now; he didn't have control over his healing bots. Now, when he needed it the most, his ace in the hole was gone.

The Doctor began to lash out in anger, trying to destroy the traitorous healers. Yet he was weakened in this state, and could barely dent the metal. The intricate circuitry and power cores were safe, and they continued to conspire against him.

""Let's hope this helps,"" I prayed.

I commanded MY remaining bots to attack, turning their lasers on the Doctor. Under normal circumstances, he would've removed them from the fight without a second thought. Now, though, they concentrated their fire for precious seconds. The interlaced mesh of heat and force pounded his body, bruising organs that couldn't afford any more bruising and stressing already-broken bones.

""ARRG!!!""

Something was still protecting the Doctor, though. It was as if an invisible force shield limited the damage from the drones. Those lasers could normally cut through steel.

I took a calculated risk, and sent a few drones crashing into him, sacrificing themselves to punch through whatever armor the Doctor had conjured up.

The Doctor shuttered on impact, and I saw the remaining lasers began to apply more force.

""It's working!""

Taking a page out of the Doctor's playbook, I overclocked my own drones, telling them to pour it on as long as they could. Shatter would be back in the fight any moment, and I was draining the Doctor in the meantime. The scales were tilting in our favor, it seemed.

On cue, Shatter shook off the cobwebs. He had been healing all this time, and the extra few seconds of respite had given him a second to recover his purpose. He wasn't just healed, he remembered what he was doing. He had control of his muscles AND his mental faculties, for the moment at least.

And he looked pissed.

I pretended not to hear the string of obscenities he let loose, but I did watch him unleash multiple three and five piece combinations into the Doctor. Knowing what the last counterattack had taken out of him, Shatter didn't dare let up. He punched, punched, and punched, applying every bit of training and super strength that he could muster.

The heavy blows finally accomplished their mission, and the Doctor began to crumple. Seeing his opportunity, Shatter pressed forward with one last barrage, ending the string of blows with a deadly hook and a vicious uppercut. The last punch landed, and the Doctor collapsed.

A moment later, Shatter did, too.

""General! Get your crew in there, quick!""

""Mission accomplished?!""

""Yes, but they're both down. Not sure how long the Doctor is down, but you need to slap the dampeners on him, now!""

""And Shatter?""

""Physically, he's probably fine.""

""And otherwise?""

""Pray to whatever deity you believe in that he's the same after ... that.""

I heard the General shout orders in the background, scrambling his teams to finish the mission. More than the words, though, I could hear the fear and urgency in his voice. He was worried for Shatter.

We all were.",6

1lo8s18,n0lejbw,"Mark sat across from his roommate, Tony, in their small apartment kitchen. Tony was scrolling through his phone, deliberately avoiding eye contact.

“So,” Mark said, clearing his throat, “I’m guessing today isn’t the day you’re paying back the $1,000 either?”

Tony looked up with dramatic solemnity, placing his hand over his heart. “Money is merely the wealth of those who do not value freedom.”

“Seriously? Quit it with the Facebook quotes,” Mark groaned, throwing his hands up. “It’s one thousand dollars, bro! Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to lend you that much?”

“Power,” Tony said, raising a finger philosophically, “is the ability to say no without fearing what others will say or do to you.”

Mark’s eye twitched. “And courage is saying no despite those fears. And wisdom is saying no after eliminating all reason for fear. I know. You’ve been using these quotes since you borrowed the money six months ago!”

“You’ve been listening!” Tony beamed proudly.

“Yeah, and I’m also changing the WiFi password until I get my money back,” Mark said, standing up. “Wisdom is knowing when to cut off your roommate’s internet access.”

Tony’s smile disappeared. “Wait, what? You can’t do that! I have… important things to do online!”

“Like finding more quotes to avoid paying your debts?” Mark asked, eyebrow raised.

The next morning, Mark found an envelope with $1,000 cash slid under his door with a note: “Freedom is overrated. WiFi password, please?”",6
1loieu3,n0oon1l,"The prophets name me the Hero of our time. Edmund Sicarius, the man who would topple the Great Evil's regime. Through force of arms and strength of spirit, I would sunder their grip and usher in times of prosperity and kindness.

I have hated the prophecy since I learned of it, after my village was pillaged in my absence. Everyone I ever knew, dead. All our possessions were stolen or burned. If I was going to be this great hero, why couldn't the prophets keep their damn mouths shut long enough for me to be ready to face the task ahead?

It did not take long for them to realize that they missed their target in their first attack. Instead of learning, instead of unlocking profound power, I live on the run. Years spent on the road, so much experience in falsifying identities and being what I am not. Behind me is a trail of good souls who sheltered and cared for me, who tried to teach me some of the skills I would need. So many of them are dead. I know it cannot go on forever. I am so tired, I want to rest for weeks on end. But I have to live, I have to keep going. If I don't fulfill the prophecy, who will?

They catch me as I lay sleeping beneath a bridge. The monster leading the platoon grins, ""I will be well rewarded for finally catching you!"" he says. I fight, scream. But his grip is iron. It's over, no one has ever escaped the Dark Citadel. I go now to be tortured and killed. The only light in this world of horror, snuffed out.

In chains, I am dragged to the throne room. I look the Great Evil's avatar in the eye. An austere, sadistic smile, ""Your suffering will be legend, Hero!"" Then he furrows his brow, ""I have fought The Light across the ages. I would recognize it anywhere. But you do not carry it.""

He leans forward, ""Tell me now, who is the real Hero?""

I begin to stammer, I have been told all my life that I am destined to fight The Dark. I open my mouth to say so, but then a woman's voice booms across the room. ""I am here."" Light fills the room, even with my eyelids shut, it hurts.

It fades, and when I can finally see again there are two figures trading blows with impossible speed, The Dark's attendants turned to ashes. It goes on for several minutes, until a blade of light sprout's through the villain's chest. He collapses, slowly fading away until he is little more than a shadow on the throne room's floor.

The woman looks at me, ""I am Irridia Starsworn, and if you are who I think you are, you are deserving of an explanation for what has just happened and the reason for your ordeal.""

In a calm voice, she informs me of the true story. The prophecy that named me was a trick, a red herring. I was never meant to be the Hero, though I was instrumental in the Light's success. While The Great Evil hunted me, Irridia had the time to learn and grow into her abilities. Taught in secret, given access to profound power once thought lost to time.

""You may not have been the chosen one, but your hardships have been vital to our victory today. Together, we have dealt The Dark a terrible blow, but the war is not yet over. It will be years yet before his taint is purged from our lands. Name what you want, and if it is righteous and good, I will grant it to you.""

I am overwhelmed by what has just been explained. There was hope for the world, and I had served a purpose. I had not let the rest of the world down, or failed my destiny. I begin to cry, and between sobs, I ask, ""Can I have someplace safe and comfortable to sleep and warm food to eat?""

She smiles, ""That can most certainly be arranged!""",5
1lo2mw9,n0kdhio,"General Han was feared on the battlefield. An overwhelming force which acknowledged none but the path which he foresaw before him. A clear, pristine path; like the road between a valley, laid out beautifully with flowing waterfalls, verdant fields of flowers, and an achievable horizon crowned with pure, unadulterated glory.

Once General Han began treading the dirt, war would ensue, and naught but his army would remain. In some wars, he would win through attrition. Weaker armies would fall through sheer bloodshed. General Han did not shy away from espionage either—he fell a thousand-year dynasty by breaking it from within.

To his nation, General Han was a God of War.

To us, he was a God of Death.

And it was our turn, my nation’s turn, to receive the divine deliverance of his hand.

Though he was clad in armor from head to toe, we knew that it was General Han who was charging at us. His overwhelming presence was unmistakable: like the deities described in legend, General Han seemed to shake with a relentless vigor, as if he was possessed with the rage of ten thousand suns. What was peculiar, perhaps even terrifying knowing the nature of our enemy, was that General Han did not have a retinue of archers behind him, nor a wall of cavalry clearing his path for him.

General Han was alone.

I could not help but feel my sword tremble in my hand. Why was he alone? General Han neared divinity in his accomplishments, but he himself was mortal.

Perhaps there was an ambush awaiting us? Perhaps it was not General Han after all which was charging before us?

Or…perhaps…the gods above had finally gazed upon him? 

“Men,” I said, breaking the deafening silence my army had allowed themselves to succumb to. They all were waiting for my command with bated breath, and it was clear that they believed this to be their last day. These were battle-hardened men but even their legs began to quiver more and more as General Han closed the distance. His presence commanded nothing but respect and attention.

“Withdraw. We shall retreat!” I said, releasing some of the tension that had built up inside me.

“W-what?! Why, General?!” said my second-in-command, who was frightful but ready to shed blood.

“That man right there…he is not a man anymore. We are in an open desert with nowhere for an ambush to happen. Our homeland is too far to be invaded within merely days. There can only be one reason for a ‘man’ to charge in with such rage alone: he is no longer a man.”

General Han then screamed loudly and with such primal strength that it caused those bearing the spearwall to flinch.

“He has become a God of War.”

Everyone then soon began retreating until General Han was no longer in sight. I was last to leave to ensure that no one was left behind which put me the closest to Death’s Door, but perhaps I should be thankful. In hindsight, it saved me a lot of embarrassment.

Right when I was about to leave, General Han had finally managed to catch up to me. I feared for my life…until General Han fell from what I had thought was a crazed horse and then started vomiting on the ground. He strangely reeked of alcohol, and well, my suspicions were confirmed to be true when he let go of an alcohol jug. 

The man had not become a God of War. He was just drunk, and it was just his horse desperately trying to shake him off all this time.",13
1lnsby9,n0hrj6p,"The elevator chimed again as our group exited on the level 13-b. Our guide, an elderly Ifrit in a neatly ironed tuxedo, led us along a glass-panneled enclosure.

""Now this here,"" he continued with an unmistakable tone of a presenter who's done this same spiel for millenia but never got tired of it, ""is quite a special enclosure. Under no circumstances this poor sods are to know they're in Hell and not in Heaven.""

We looked through one-way glass and saw endless green pastures, gentle white clouds in the tender blue sky overhead, gardens of fruit trees, and other such idyllic nonsense. I turned my only eye to our guide with a questioning glare.

""I wonder, what might be the purpose for this oddly specific arrangement.""

""Why yes, my inquisitive interns, there indeed is a purpose, for the wisdom of our Most Malevolent Overlord is unmatched!"", the senior demon boasted. ""The souls here are generally of average sinfulness - for the condemned that is, - each in their own unique moderately shitty ways. But what unites them all is not a complete absolence of conscience and self-awareness. They, each of them, know they don't deserve Heaven.""

""I don't understand,"" a young Succubus behind me asked incredulously. ""How is getting better than you think you deserve a punishment? Shouldn't they be happy?""

""Observe."" The Ifrit replied, waving his hand toward the window with a dramatic flourish.

A view dutifully zoomed in, through the pastures and the walls of a perfectly suburban domicile. A man was standing behind a kitchen counter, humming to himself, absorbed in cooking. Then, a doorbell chimed. The sound was disgustingly perfect, unintrusively soothing, but still the man jumped as if stung by an electric eel. (I smiled to myself at the image in my mind: torture with electric eels was the topic of my thesis). A bead of sweat rolled down his neck as he came to open the door. After a few minutes of conversation with his neighbor, full of awkwardness so thick we could feel the tightness of his false smiles through the glass, he finally closed the door and let out a sigh of relief. He then dropped on the couch and buried his face in his hands, nearly hyperventilating. 

The young Succubus's expression turned from incredulity to stunned awe. ""How is he so unhappy, if he thinks he's in Heaven?"", she whispered.

The Ifrit guide grinned triumphantly. ""Conscience! Such a wonderful tool. Allows the mortals to know every time they do something wrong, and yet you can bet that most of the time they'll still do it! But once it's done, that conscience doesn't just leave or shut up. It nags at them, reminding them of their own wickedness, worthlessness, of the consequences that will inevitably rain down once they're found out! Constant doubt, constant fear, constant misery, my friends, without us lifting nary a finger!""

I hummer deeply. As a pathological ""teacher's pet"", I already suspected which question the Ifrit wanted to hear next, and decided to take a shot.

""But Honored Senior, have none of them tried to confess, to sooth their conscience - or at least feed their vanity - by coming clean to the authorities?""

The elderly demon's face lit up with absolute glee. ""A wonderful question, young sir Cyclops! Of course some did, but such a small amount, that you wouldn't even believe. We even offered amnesties to those who 'thought they were in heaven by mistake' if they confessed, and you know how many do? Only one in twenty thousand! Truly, the human mind is its own best jailer and torturer.""

""And what about those unique ones, who did confess after all? Did you really give them amnesties?""

The Ifrit's grin stretched wider than the geometry of his face was supposed to allow. ""Of course not,"" he snorted, ""we're in Hell, after all.""",224
1lnsby9,n0ijafd,"Streaks of orange and pink and a flirt of green gently shot upward, clearing the way for the dominating yellow glow making its leisurely ascend.

The man observed as the waves from the not so distant beach too transformed from the deep dark of unknown to the clear blue of the sky above.

Whether the waves turned the sky, or the sky the waves did not matter. What mattered was that it happened and he got to see it.

Well, almost got to see it.

'If it weren't for that god awful monstrosity.'  He was referring to the great grey formless block of concrete that was exactly 3 stories taller than his pent house and stood smack dab in the middle of the sun's path. It was just wide enough to block of half of the beach view.

'God it must've been a couple thousand years since I actually got to see a sunrise' He thought as he sipped his freshly brewed coffee that he swore, as he always did, was decafe and tried, and failed miserably, as he always did, to get comfortable on the bean bag.

Heaven apparently did not do chairs.

With each sip he became just a bit more drowsy, despite the fact that he had woken up not 30 mins ago, and thought about the day ahead.

Nothing.

There was nothing to do. He had all the free time in the world. He could do everything, anything. And yet he knew that he would do nothing as he grabbed his phone and instinctively opened up HUMBLE.

He scrolled past at least a couple dozen conversations. Each one with a baddie baddier than the last. None of whom he would ever meet, because there was always the next match. Just a little bit hotter, just a little more his type.

After a few minutes he put the phone down, closed his eyes, and tried one last time to find the perfect spot on his god forsaken bean bag. He knew he wouldn't.

The breeze brought him the full hearty laughter of the couple that lived in the penthouse across - 3 stories higher than him.

His phone vibrated. Another match.

""I swear if it werent for that big 'Smile You Are In Heaven' sign projected across the sky, this would be hell' He though to himself not for the first time.

1lnsby9,n0ikhb8,"After explaining this for the third time, the archdemon draws back the curtain. There, in the pit some thirty feet deep, three middle-aged men sit hunched around a folding card table. A sea of scarab beetles swells around their ankles. Flames shoot from turrets while wall-mounted boomboxes blare ""Cbat,"" by Hudson Mohawke.

The archdemon--his nametag says ""Koriath""--leans wistfully on his pitchfork. ""Maybe for them this *is* heaven,"" he says. 

This isn't the first time he's said something like this. You scoff. ""I'm sorry... what?""

Koriath shrugs. ""Look, I know this is your first day, but one of the things you learn, if you work here long enough, is that everyone's idea of pain and pleasure is different. We got orders from the brass to give these three guys Heaven--and far be it from me to judge what that means to them."" He shrugs once more. Big shrugger, this guy. ""I'm just a mid-level pit-designer.""

Just then, the pit's wall-mounted diarrhea bell chimes, suggesting that it's time for another diarrhea flood.

""Koriath, I don't think humans like this stuff.""

The archdemon jabs you on the arm. ""Nonsense!"" he cries--but then his red, scaly brow furrows. ""But, uh... what makes you say that? Just curious.""

The flooders creak into position. 

""Humans don't like pain,"" you reply, ""and they generally don't like being covered completely by filth.""

Koriath shakes his head. He spent the whole walk over talking about how his promotion was riding on this one specific pit, his ability to simulate Heaven.

""I'm only trying to help,"" you add gently. Before taking this internship, you lived with humans, observed their rituals and idiosyncrasies. ""And I'm telling you, humans really, really don't like--""

""They do,"" he says. ""They told me.""

""They don't.""

""They do.""

""They don't.""

He nods toward the pit. ""*They* do.""

""They don't.""

""They might.""

""They don't.""

At this, he throws his demon hands in the air. ""Well, how can they know they don't like it if they've never tried it?""

""Koriath, the diarrhea flood went off five times already, and they were visibly uncomfortable every time. Believe me, they've *tried* it.""

Koriath sits on the bench. Worry clouds his gaze. He spent the whole walk over talking about corner offices and pay bumps, bonuses. ""Well, shit,"" he says. 

As if on cue, there go the flooders.

1lnsby9,n0jjj1m,"""Welcome to Hell! Let me give you the tour.""


Dana sighed. Their life hadn't been stellar, but surely the afterlife wasn't so clichéd? There was the fire, there was the brimstone, and the devil acting as greeter had classic red horns and a pointed tail. Worse, they'd been thrown down to the fiery depths by St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, glimpsing all the trappings of heaven before being chucked with absolute scorn.


At least they weren't stuck sitting on a cloud and playing a harp all day for ten thousand years.


Following the devil into the depths of Hell, Dana observed pretty run-of-the-mill torture scenarios applied to rapists, murderers, and a few recognizable politicians. ""Interesting choice to start with such serious sinners - I thought Dante described the circles of hell getting worse the farther we descended.""


""Oh no, all that got rearranged a few centuries back. We've taken the matters of punishment into our own hands in an increasing number of cases. We keep some good examples of punishment according to the book right by the entrance. The inspectors rarely take more than a cursory glance once they've seen enough suffering souls.""


Dana and the devil walked in silence a bit farther, approaching a tunnel leading down to the next level. ""As you can see, we've gotten enough engineers to design air filtering and temperature control equipment. We do our best to keep up with modern technology, within reason. One of our recent arrivals wanted to design a geothermal cooling system, which anyone could have told them would never work down here. We don't adhere to the same punishment philosophy as up above, but we do let consequences run their course. That one is on the path to becoming a better listener now.


""Hmm, where were we.... oh yes, here we have our lawyers. You'd be surprised how many we get down here! They are quite helpful at enforcement of our rules, though we only put them in charge periodically. Too much power, and things end up worse and worse. You know, that happens with most of the groups we have down here.""


Dana had been a lawyer. ""I don't think anyone's too surprised at the idea of lawyers going to hell. Unless I'd be surprised at how few there are?""


The devil's face fell a bit. ""I keep forgetting. Humans aren't surprised at how many lawyers go to hell."" 


""Do I stay here, given my life on earth?""


""Let's see your file. Yes, lawyer, you will be staying here."" The devil flipped through a few pages in the folder that was apparently Dana's file. ""Just a few more stops before I pass you along to your brethren to get settled. Now, if you are worried about punishment, be reassured. We aim for restorative justice and rehabilitation down here, though don't let a peep of that make it to an angel's hearing.""


The devil guided Dana down another level, which had an even more pleasant atmosphere. ""This is our optimal level, but it is reserved for a very special group. They must never learn that this is not heaven.""


Dana peeked through the window at an idyllic scene. Catching their breath, they waited until they spotted the gait of a child they recognized. ""Is that... is that him?""


The devil met Dana's eyes with a solemn look. ""Yes, these are our true innocents. You arrived at the same time as one here.""


""My son. I think we were in a car crash. I remember driving from... from somewhere.""


""My condolences,"" the devil murmured. ""Since you have a personal connection, I hope you will be an active participant in the caretaking duties here. We find it helps each child to see a familiar face shortly after arrival, but understand the need to grieve your child's fate. We strive to find the best balance.""


Dana nodded. ""Yes, we will find the balance. Shall I go to them now?""",19
1lnsby9,n0jcx1a,"A low vibrato of jazz thrummed throughout the small, often forgotten bar on Main Street; once the attraction of a small mining town and now entangled between two towering corporate buildings in now a slightly bigger city. It was dimly lit with warm fairy lights that flickered on and off in much the same way as the few voices that filled the room, and the musk of whiskey stained the air. Above the bar itself, a clock quietly ticked as it displayed the time: 11:45.

I dragged a finger over the rim of my empty shot glass, what had been its contents now sloshing away at my intestines. It was one of the better glasses- though there was little distinction even in that regard- handed out only to those the bar ensured wouldn’t shatter it to pieces. 

Yay me, I thought mindlessly as I waved the bartender over. I can go home and tell my parents I won least likely to break a shot glass.

Except, I remembered with a sudden pain, I couldn’t see them. Not until I’d proved whatever it is I was supposed to prove. 

“Another one where this came from.”

As the bartender nodded and poured me another shot of vodka, the bell atop the entrance rang quietly. As always, for there was little entertainment elsewhere, my eyes floated towards the door. 

A young woman, no older than twenty-five or so, stumbled in as though she were already drunk. With a second glance, I noticed with faint surprise that she was a new face- and not a bad looking one at that. 

“Who’s that?” I asked the bartender, reaching for the shot he’d just poured. 

He shrugged and went off to make someone else a drink. 

When I turned back to the girl, she was already pulling out the chair beside me. 

“This seat free?”

I nodded stupidly; void of something witty to say. After a few agonizing minutes of silence, I came up with a simple, “Are you new around here?”

She turned to me with a lazy smile. “You could say that.”

I nodded. “How’d it happen?” 

“How’d what happen?”

“You know…” I waved a hand sheepishly. “How you ended up here.”

Her eyes flared in understanding. “Who knows? It’s been so long I’ve forgotten.” 

“How long?”

She thought for a moment. “I’ve forgotten that too.” 

“It’s been about two hundred years for me,” I said sardonically. “Two hundred years in this hellhole.”

The girl gave me a funny look and I glanced around the room, quickly adding, “Sorry. Pretend you didn’t hear that.” 

She smiled. “What’s your name?”

I sighed in relief. “Garrett. You?”

“I was never given one, but I like to call myself Ruby.”

“Ruby, huh?” I held out a hand. “Nice to meet you- just what kind of place did you grow up in where you didn’t have a name?”

She placed her palm in mine and leaned in, murmuring, “A hellhole.”

I threw my head back and laughed. 

“Well, Garrett, since you said such a sacrilegious statement in my presence, I figured I’d make us equal.” Her eyes glimmered. “Would you like to hear a story- one that hasn’t been uttered here for thousands of years?” 

“Oh?” My interest was piqued. 

“There was once a God who created three planes of existence- heaven, hell, and the human world. He filled heaven with angels and accepted the most pious humans beyond its gates, then filled hell with demons and sent the most wretched humans into its depths.”

I nodded along as she recounted the familiar story I’d heard a hundred times up here. 

“However,” she continued, thrumming her fingers against the table. “God still loved his creation, and he figured if the humans were able to change their ways in hell, they would then be allowed to come to heaven.” 

I frowned. “I wasn’t aware of this.”

“Well, there’d be no point if they knew they were still being tested, would there?”

“I guess.” 

“And so, God supposed if the humans in hell were to learn where they really were, even if they knew there was still a way out, they would lose all hope and descend into pits of despair deeper than hell itself. But if you ask me, he was wrong.”

“Why’s that?”

“I figured if the humans in hell learned where they really were, it wouldn’t make a single difference.” She seemed to watch me carefully. “They would go on to repeat the same mistakes over and over, even when the answer is right in front of them, just because the alternative requires admitting an uncomfortable truth.”

I peered down at the shot of vodka still cold in my hand. “But wouldn’t the humans be able to tell they were in hell?”

“Why, both heaven and hell are modeled quite a bit after your precious Earth.”

I looked back at Ruby. “What about heaven, then? Isn’t there a sort of test here, too, before we can go on to the real deal?”

She smiled, but there was a sadness to her eyes. “Once you’re in heaven, there’s no need to be tested anymore.” 

A few moments passed. “Why are you telling me this?” 

“Who knows? Maybe I, too, just can’t help myself.” 

“I see…,” I said, thinking. “Hey, are you going to be back tomorrow by any chance?” 

Ruby shook her head. 

“That’s a shame.”

“Yes.” A glance at the clock: almost midnight. “I’m afraid I must go. I have some work to do.” 

I nodded and watched her leave the bar- she, who I was somehow certain I’d never meet again, just as I was certain she had come here, to this bar, for a reason.

For me.

In that moment I knew more than anything else- there was something I had to do. 

But now she was gone, and I’d never see her again, this woman who had breathed life into my otherwise empty existence, this woman who had left me with a lucidity now fleeting by the second; and I began to form an unrelenting hatred for her as that sea of emptiness resettled around me, dragging me beneath the weight of its tides. 

There was something I wanted…something I wanted to do.

I sat in silence for a few minutes as I waited for the memory to return.

Oh well, there’s always tomorrow. 

So I turned back to the bartender, downed the shot I was still holding, and said, “Another, please.”",17
1lnsby9,n0jq5ee,"There are certain souls wich the devil takes pity on, for he knows that they do not truly belong in hell. The souls of those who still had kindness in their heart, those who tried to help others even after being exposed to the most vile treatment from others. Sure, they had a warped sence of what was moral, but that was due to the monstrous things that had been enacted on them.
Someone who's entire life had been suffering do not deserve an eternity of more torture, so in an attempt to shield those souls but not further antagonise the heavens, he created a new ring in hell, one that allowed these souls to live in, what to them is bliss, but due to the way they were treated on earth, by the standards of most, would still be torture. 
Letting them know of this fact would break them, not because of the fact they were in hell, they most likely wouldn't care, but the knowledge that life in hell was an upgrade from what they had endured on earth, that would be enough to make anyone lose any semblance of sanity, and these souls do not deserve that.

The devil would constantly try to figure out new ways to improve the conditions in that ring of hell, ways that would be justifiable and put in a way to make it sound as though it was a new way to torture them in order to get around the scrutiny of heaven who had already decided that these souls deserved to be in eternal agony.",17

It was...good.

“Uh… We can't exactly tell you that. Privacy laws and all that,” the nurse said.




Kane groaned. “Privacy laws. Since when did you care about those?”




“We always did.”




“Riiiiight.”




“But Ori's dead.” Kane thought for a moment. “Did you think to inform his parents and sister of his death? They're in his will.” Kane didn't comment that he was also good friends with Ori's whole family, and was also mentioned in the will. Nor did he mention Ori's opinion on organ donating.




“We can't say.”




“Well, I'm probably going to find out later, but I do have one more question for you.”




“And that is?”

""A being...like you?"" I ask, knowing how strong he could be.  
""No. I am banished. Banished, exiled for desecrating the dead, for sneaking in and sleeping in tombs, and graves.  
Rejection comes when the mortal world feels threatened as a whole by someone...or something."" he says.  
I pale.

Amalgum grunted as he uncurled himself from his sleeping position, and pries himself away from the comfy rock he had been laying on. Peeking his head out of the cave entrance, he spotted the man in dapper clothes, carrying a leather bag over his shoulder. 

""What is it this time, Jean Claude"" he said, trying to maintain his patience. 

""Good to see you again, Amalgum. I'm here from the meat of the month club I'd like to interest you in a free sam-""

""I promise you. Segmented wicker crates are the future.""

""I must admit, trying to sell a dragon a pair of human sized socks might have been a bit of a stretch."" 

""And now you're trying to sell me...what I can only assume is a meat based subscription service."" Amalgum looked at Jean Claude with concern. ""Who...who do you work for?"" 

""I don't."" Jean Claude said, dropping his leather bag to the ground. ""I raid the kingdom's dumpsters at night, and try to sell what I find. The meat of the month club is basically just me bringing you whatever dried meats I can find once a month."" Amalgum slithered back into his cave, and returned with what was a small handful of gold for him. 

""If I give you this gold, will you leave me alone?"" Amalgum dropped the two ton pile of gold on the ground in front of Jean Claude. 

""Oh, yes sir. Thank you."" For the rest of the day, Amalgum tried to ignore the noise of Jean Claude moving his new fortune, but was relieved he wouldn't be seeing him in front of his cave again. He would think about the man again until a week later. 

""Excuse us, Mr. Amalgum."" A new salesman stood in front of the cave. Amalgum stuck his head out yet again.

1lnxsu9,n0iyeun,"“With the demon-disposal package we can guarantee a cleric here in two to three weeks, but with the demon-disposal plus package we would ensure that a paladin will arrive and that he/she will be here with in two to three days! Which if you ask me, it is worth the extra price!” the man in the slick grey suit exclaimed while pointing at the newest pile of papers he had removed from his brief-case.

“I already told you; I am one of the most powerful beings in this realm, I don’t NEED to be rescued by some weak cleric or paladin. If demons try to intrude on my cave, I would simply kill them, just like I do everything else that gets in here.” The dragon said, blowing another smoke ring to punctuate its annoyance.

The salesman smiled sympathetically, “But what if the demons are too strong, or there are too many? Heck what if they just snuck in here and made themselves at home?”

The dragon sighed. “I have literally killed of the dark lord of hell by myself, twice! I can handle what eve the demons throw at me!”

“What about me Mr. ‘Mighty Dragon’, if you are so strong, why haven’t you gotten rid of me yet?” the salesman smirked.

“I don’t want to talk about it.” The dragon said, before changing its mind. “You know that I have gotten rid of you multiple times! I have physically removed you 6 times, and flat out killed you twice. I’m only entertaining your sales pitch because I hope that as soon as you are done you would leave me be and I will never have to see you again!”

“Why if you were such a smart dragon, you would know that the only true way to get rid of me would be simple!” the salesman said, knowing that he had the dragon on the proverbial ropes.

The dragon ran its claws through its horns, mimicking the actions it has seen humans do when they are stressed. “Fine, what do I have to do to get rid of you?”

The salesman reached into his robe, pulled out a pen and said “It’s easy, you just gotta sign up for the demon-disposal plus program!”",8
1lnvkto,n0l6faw,"*Not finished yet; I'll have a layover later on...*

Promoted at last! I had spent years as a lowly Analyst in the Xeno-Intelligence services. I watched different races from afar, mined their broadcast signals, (if any), and made up fake identities for our spies to assume when they took the field. I started intensive training a year ago. It flew by *fast.* It prepared us to land on most any planet that breathed the same kind of air you did, observe and record the locals, and in the very least, learn what would label you *friend* or *foe.* The capstone to the Officer Candidate School was to survive several missions on Earth: Urban environments in cold, moderate, and hot climates, pick two out of the three. Rural environments, rich country and poor. You’d think the order would be the other way around, but talking a convincing game was vital to live in those backwaters.

Earth/Terra is a fucking *gorgeous* planet, it has brought most of its apex predators in line, and many agents said that humans were hilarious. The courtship rituals alone…  A large portion of its plant and animal life was reasonably edible, as far as my race was concerned. I was starting my mission in three days, but I’d be donning my disguise now.  You had to get used to what you saw in the mirror.

I sat at the console of the disguise printer and paged through my options for human-disguise. Males got more respect and deference, and tended to be stronger and sturdier. I hit that option. No need to hobble myself voluntarily. The ultraviolet exposure on Earth was relatively high, so I chose a darker skin tone. Radiation burns *suck.* The options for hair were truly dizzying- it would be summer where I landed, so I chose a nice, practical hairstyle that would keep it out of my eyes and mostly out of the way and cool. “*Locs,”* the computer said they were. The rules were such that you were not allowed to dress as high status for the society you were landing in. I selected a couple of shirts, pants, and *boots* or *sneakers* to alternate as necessary. Quality, sturdy clothes, sure. But nothing with any of the silly sigils; they sometimes doubled as an affiliation with specific factions- you could be giving a wrong impression, hence the rule. There seemed to be an unhealthy level of nuance for the shoes, as well.

The leaders of Xeno-Intelligence were not monsters, and they allowed for alien forms in peak physical condition. The forms were grafted on to you, so there was no point in making you a weakling. You were there to complete a mission on a potentially dangerous planet, after all. I checked over the form in the printing preview. Roughly two meters tall, broad shoulders, muscle enough to move a “fellow human” reasonably easy, if need be. I hastily scanned some of the Earth transmissions; the body type seemed appealing to human-ladies, as well. Again, don’t make the job harder than you have to. ",5

Minutes pass, and nothing.

Early on, the results were good, some agents died, but the survivors got a lot of information.  
Recently, fewer of the Agents died, but the information they got back...  
I look at the blinking words on the screen.

“Language?”

“North American Standard English.” She hesitated, her face unreadable. Then she twisted her authentication ring, bringing up a special menu on my print preview, higher authorities only. I saw her tap one feature a couple of times.

These lowly insignificant creatures that were made in **his** image. Us on the other hand were told to serve them. Why? We are so much better, more glorious then them! **He** made us to interact with them, while **He** couldn't.

Now we wonder the Earth taking these forms with the hope of being recognized. Ironically the only ones that seem to acknowledge our greatness are lowly humans as we serve them.

The Prime Knight had been witness to the End of Time. She watched as Gods brought fury and wrath to the entire world. She held those she loved in her arms as they took their last dying breaths. An unspoken promise to them as they looked to the sky, eyes wide, wondering what it had all been for.

She had reversed the End of Time. She fought Gods and brought them down to the world they had tried to destroy. She killed the loved ones of others as she progressed through her quests, watched them question the sky, wondering who had forsaken them.

The People adored her. Everywhere she went, she was given praise and riches and weapons that would give her an edge in whatever fight would come. She had walked the entirety of the world twice over, sailed every sea known to man, dug new tunnels to find lost civilizations. She learned the names of those who would be forgotten, and she tried - so desperately tried - to connect with all of the people of the world. They *loved* her. She *tried* to love them back.

But it was that first fight that had broken her. When the last she had loved, and those she could never forget, had been ripped from her. Their souls given away, in a crass attempt at immortality. Instead, she roamed the world - uncertain as to where she would go next.

\>>><<< 

The latest fight had come sooner than she had thought. As news traveled down the coastlines and the shores, trying to reach her humble abode on some lost island. She had taken it as her latest gift, a bastion in which she could rest.

It was beautiful. A sort of lighthouse-turned-fortress that she had made her own, painted and enchanted, built and rebuilt. The Prime Knight employed those she had grown close to, some she had rescued, others she hoped would rescue her. One day, when it was her turn.

Atop this lighthouse-fortress, she watched clouds roll by each day, counted the turns of the sun, and the phases of the moon. She would witness *eons* here. Some would only witness a week or less.

A courier arrived late one morning, as the Prime Knight stood solemn in her tower. She watched him approach, dirt flying up in the ground beneath his feet as he ran to the bastion. She turned back to the armory that was her fortress, searched for a weapon that would mean something in her next fight. She heard the race of feet, the talk of voices outside of her door. The next fight was upon her.

\>>><<< 

The fault was in her own mind.  There was nothing she could do to fight it. Inside she knew that none of these petty wars or battles or “end of days” truly mattered. She had seen the Eye of Chronos, or at least the Mortal who had tried to control it. In that first climactic battle, she had smote the would-be God of Time.

And all those souls he had gathered? All those loved ones she had feared to lose.

They had joined her soul instead. Granted her power and immortality that she never dreamed of having, that she would give away in an instead if it meant having them back. If it meant foregoing the world she would live beyond.

People call me the “Last Bastion.”

The “One-Man Final Stand.”

The “Legendary Hero Who Arrives When All Hope is Lost.”

Very flattering.

Very *wrong.*

The truth is, I’m just really, *really* lazy.

Yeah, I’ve got powers that make cosmic horrors cry.

Time manipulation? Got it. 

Planetary telekinesis? Sure. 

Finger-snap annihilation? Please. 

But none of that means I want to put on pants for every baby earthquake or local supervillain monologue. 

I have games to beat. Shows to binge. Pizza to order and devour.

The only reason I ever show up is because these “apocalypses” tend to screw with my personal life.

Like last month... 

The giant lizard god ? 

Ate my favorite ramen joint. 

Do you know how many all-night side-quests I powered through with their spicy pork tonkotsu? So, yeah. Had to vaporize the lizard.

Or the doomsday cult who summoned a black hole? 

That thing almost swallowed my internet connection. Unforgivable.

I don’t do hero speeches. I don’t sign autographs. I don’t care if the population bows or screams. I just want my couch, my snacks, and an uninterrupted Wi-Fi signal.

So today, I’m lying on said couch, blanketed in a fortress of chip bags, when the sky splits open with purple hellfire. The news ticker: *“World-ending entity breaches dimension. Pray for salvation.”*

I sigh.

Pause the game.

Peer outside.

The cosmic horror’s giant eyeball is staring right at my building. It’s leaking some kind of anti-gravity sludge that’s dissolving my favorite corner store.

*Nope.*

*Not having it.*

I step onto my balcony, cape flapping majestically in the nuclear breeze. 

My neighbor catches sight of me.

Eyes wide, hands clasped, they shouted: “The Legendary Hero! He’s come to save us!”

*Wrong.*

*I’m here because that corner store sells the only slushies that taste right at 3 A.M.*

I raise my hand. The monster wails in six dimensions.

*Snap.*

*Gone.*

*Reduce to atom.*

The sky stitches itself shut like an apologetic wound. People burst into cheers down on the street, chanting my name. Candles, banners, grown men weeping.

“Tell the world…” I say, my voice echoing like a divine revelation. “That it needs to knock next time.”

Then I close the balcony door, flop back on my couch, and unpause my game.

1lnhynj,n0hgqa5,"“My Prime Knight,” the courier said. He knelt before her massive frame, emboldened by the custom plate steel armor she had been granted. “A war erupts to the North.”

She did not speak. Instead, those gathered around her did the talking for her.

“Of what nation do you hail?”

“The Kingdom of Vidae,” he said, “home to the High King Rono.”

“Vidae is home to those of the former nation of Lebo, is it not?”

“It is, my lord.”

“Those of Lebo were great friends to the Prime Knight,” another said. “Vidae as well, but in recent memory, the Prime Knight has not visited these lands.”

“She has not yet blessed us with her presence, my lady.”

“Aye, and so, the Prime Knight cannot go. Bound only to protect and serve those she has come to know.”

“The Queen herself has sent me,” the courier began, and looked this time directly to the Prime Knight. “She claims you had saved her once before.” The courier held out his hand, holding a small obsidian stone.

The Prime Knight took a step forward. She reached towards it.

\>>><<< 

“I would give you my heart,” the Prime Knight said, “if you would have it.”

Lady Alina stared at the deep black eyes of the Prime Knight, hoping to find a speck of white hidden in the iris. It was an abyss, of time and memory. “It is not yours to give away,” Alina said, “it is bound to so many others.”

“Others I have lost, of those I could not save.”

Alina stared now at the Prime Knight herself, taking in the features of the woman – immortal or not – in front of her. She was beautiful. A sharp face, seemingly chiseled by the Gods who had shaped her into the being she was. Beautiful locks of silver white hair blew by an unknown wind.

“You cannot. For I may love you with every fiber of my being,” Alina turned now, “but you cannot love like that.”

The Prime Knight was silent. It was true, she knew that, but Lady Alina had been a light in the darkness. A target of her admiration. A being she respected.

“You will find me again one day, I am sure of it.”

“Only when you need me.”

“Those eyes see all, do they not?”

1lnhynj,n0hgrf1,"The Prime Knight clutched the stone in her hands. If the war was one that the Kingdom needed her for, she would be there in time, when needed. But now it was one that those she tried to love needed her for.

“Make preparations,” the Prime Knight’s voice boomed across her bastion. Another gift. “We set sail in an hour.”

The entire chorus of those who had joined her bowed their heads. “It will be done.”

\>>><<< 

The Prime Knight had been witness to the Beginning of Time. She watched the birth of the Gods, saw them shape humans in her image. She had watched loved ones die in each other’s arms, their eyes looking to her for hope, wondering if she had been there all along.

She knew all there was, and more. But none of it mattered.

Love was a funny thing. It could enslave you to another person for a lifetime, but it could tether you to the world forever.

The Prime Knight once had a name she had long forgotten. She once felt the touch of another upon her lips. But they were gone now.

As everyone would be.",11
1lnzeqg,n0j5v6g,"“I was General.” 

The beast spoke clumsily. Our language didn’t come naturally to it’s cracked green lips. However even through it’s hideous dead eyes I could see… emotion

“Lead Goblins. Many raids. Many deaths.”

A greasy black tear fell from it’s face.

“Turn away. I could make them. No loss. My spawn. No loss.”

A guttural howl rang through the still battle field. It just kept saying “My Spawn” over and over again between sobs. This lasted for a while, before it met my gaze. This time a look of pure anger plastered on its face.

“We no monster. You are.”

It began to cough harshly

“Hate you all…”

The beast fell silent.",5
1lngugu,n0fjbqg,"The blood on the altar was still wet when Inquisitor Brahm barged into the crumbling temple of the Adalmos people he deemed savages. Soon, he would slaughter the remaining priests of this heretical religion and begin converting the surviving civilians to his one true god.

To cease worshipping a false god they believed to demand blood sacrifices.

""Why would you people worship a deity of war crimes?"" He demanded to know, even as his crusaders thrust their swords towards these heretics. ""What good god would desire the blood of his people? Stop this nonsense. Convert to obeying the tenets of my one true god, and you shall receive salvation. Not by this futile ritual you're trying to do.""

""Common misconception,"" the old head priest coughed out blood, while clutching a stab wound at his side. ""Adan does not cause war crimes. He punishes those who commit them. Speaking of which...""

The other priests had stood in a circle and raised their hands into the skies. Singing songs of praise to their god. Even as Brahm's men cut them down swiftly, even as they did not resist, they never stopped singing.

The grounds shook and threw the crusaders off balance. One of his men shouted about the mountains rumbling. Rising. From the skies turned crimson, golden eyes sprayed across the horizon.

""May Adan punish you for your crimes against us,"" the head priest sputtered before he collapsed into a heap.

""We must defend ourselves against the demons these heretics have conjured!"" Brahm roared, raising his weapon. ""Who stands with me?""

None do. All his men dropped their weapons and fled before what they now believed was a real god. Not the invisible god they had been taught about in church. This one spanned across the skies and mountains, so large they could not see the entirety of its being as a massive hand came crashing through the temple.

Brahm stood his ground. Believing his god would aid him in this time of his greatest need. To overcome the biggest battle against a terrible demon.

The entity flattened him into the ground and moved on without a word.

1lnx8vb,n0izmf5,"Carlaq blinked. A thick crust had formed on his eyes and only shades of black and white managed to pervade his vision. He blinked again and color streamed through—dark shades of an ice cold blue. A shiver ran down his spine. After one last blink, the world finally began to come into focus. He could see a ceiling through a translucent blue tinge.

He tried to look around but he lay motionless, stuck in place like someone had casted a curse on him. But he remembered nothing of the such. The last thing he could remember was... death. Insurmountable amounts of it. The memory felt heavy and remembrance came slowly, made even more difficult by the frigid magic that held him in place.

As his brain churned, so did his hands. He compelled his fingers to move, if only enough to cast a counter spell, but they stayed stubbornly still. He felt powerless and weak. His world was blue and his body was numb.

Then a muffled sound came. At first, he thought it was the dull ache of death coming for him, but the noise slowly became clear. There was someone talking. He strained to hear the words, strained to move his eyes enough to see who was speaking them. But only subtle movement bled into his blurry periphery.

Who had done this to him? Carlaq willed himself to remember.

*He sat atop a war lizard. Dead humans littered the battlefield. A tendril of ice magic spilled from his fingers, skewering a human that still clung to life. The human capital lay ahead. Victory was in sight. But then a burning light appeared in the distance...*

The thought from a millennia ago sent an aching pit into his stomach once again.

*The light meant the unthinkable had come to pass. The humans had completed their mission: all life on earth was to be reset, to be given back to the ancients. The Human Hersey.*

A burning rage filled Carlaq's chest as he relived the defeat—his decades at war all for naught.

*The overwhelming force bore towards him. He cast a final spell. Elven frost magic surrounded him*—*a forgotten and forbidden art. He burrowed deep into the earth, entombing himself in an ice coffin that even the ancients couldn't break. He would* ***not*** *be defeated.* 

Carlaq released the magic he had unknowingly been holding. Splinters of blue ice blew apart in every direction, exploding like a magical grenade.

Rising into the air, the elven war general beheld the room. Humans in white coats lay mangled around him, blood seeping from impaled icicles. Machinery lined every wall, blinking and shifting with enchanting lightwork.

Carlaq clenched his unfrozen fists at the sight of the ancient magical machinery. This war was not over... It had only just begun.",7
1lnbt6u,n0eun8q,"""Me, evil? Perish the thought! Well, maybe on a Monday but I think everyone is a bit off at the start of the week."" 

Another armored figure, wearing that dreaded, faceless helmet they were all taught to fear chimed in. 

""No Sarge, we're pretty sure that's just you after you've had a sugar crash!"" The rest of the soldiers, at least those not occupied tending to the wounded villagers, broke out in muffled laughter. At least until a harshly barked order back made them refocus.

The child remained in surprised silence for a moment, unsure what to make of the animatedly speaking soldiers. Her arm was still in the hands of the one called ""Sarge,"" carefully being bandaged over the long cut across it. 

Honestly, her injury was amongst the worst received when the villagers panicked at the approaching soldiers. Most had bruising or sprained joints from falling and being jostled about in the mad dash for the road leading further inland, only to find another group of soldiers already blocking it. 

But now, perhaps emboldened by the fact that herself and none of her neighbors were dead, she sought her answers. More quietly, more sadly, she asked her question again.

""Why? Why is this happening?"" 

The surrounding soldiers quieted down completely, looking at her. ""Sarge"" waved them off before sighing and sitting down in front of her. He spoke after she looked back up into his visor. 

""You must be really confused about all this then? Well, I don't like being confused either, so I'll explain some things to you, but it might not make you feel better. Are you okay with that?"" 

She nodded. Sarge nodded back and took out a small booklet, more pristine than anything she had seen before. He flipped through the pages and began speaking. 

""So, my home is really, really far away from yours. And we don't really have any fighting back there right now. But we just finished a super big war, don't worry the good guys won, but now there were a lot of soldiers who didn't need to fight anyone. My Emperor, one of those soldiers, settled down and founded a country. And then he gave a lot of other soldiers homes and new jobs."" 

""But what does that have to do with us?""

""Ah, that's the next part. See, do you know how your home fights all the other countries around you?""

Her expression became even more downcast, and looked down in shame as she remembered her lessons. 

""There's the knights, and the mages... and the slaves."" 

Sarge patted her shoulder, almost like he was trying to distance her from her own thoughts. 

""Yes, exactly. But do you know where they get the slaves from?"" 

Slowly, dread and realization seeped into her mind. Even only eleven winters old, she was smart enough to understand what the adults gossiped about, and what her country does. She looked back up and spoke the truth. 

""The mages. They use magic to... get more slaves."" 

Sarge nodded, then showed her two pages from his booklet. On it, there was a detailed drawing. It depicted a large atrium, with many glowing magic circles and mages. But what shocked her the most was the centerpiece. 

In the middle of the drawing was a crowd of crying, screaming people being beaten and collared like animals. She couldn't look away. She desperately wanted to look at anything else, but the eyes in that drawing, full of anguish and accusations against her very existence, held her captive. As if she would be less than human for turning away. She made her guess for the invasion's cause known.

""The mages... stole your people, the former soldiers. That's why you're here.""

Sarge let out a dry laugh. She could almost feel the cruel smile hidden under his helmet.

""Very good guess. Very close. They *tried* to steal away our people. Only problem for them, our Emperor already knew about crimes like this, and had made preparations against similar acts. Now, we are here to make sure your king and his mages can't try again. Forever.""",64
1lnbt6u,n0e8mha,"""Are we now?"" I smile.  
""W-well...you invaded us. Aren't invaders the bad guys?"" the child asks.  
I nod.  
""Usually they are, but what if we have a reason for this?"" I ask.  
The adults we have defeated in the surroundings all snort, while my comrades chuckle.  
""Reason?"" the child asks.  
I nod.

  
""The Empire tried to spread its ways, and methods to the surrounding kingdoms, freely. We didn't expect to be 100% accepted, but at least copied. When we saw that they mock us, and don't listen to us, we decided to do this...for the people."" I say.  
The adults roll their eyes.  
""For the people? Us?"" the child asks.  
I nod.  
""The Empire changed a few years ago, when her Majesty the Empress ascended. Now, we try to improve the life of everyone, not just nobles."" I say.  
The child's eyes sparkled, but the adults were skeptic.

  
""Yeah? That's why you wage war, and spread bloodshed, and chaos to the kingdoms?!"" one of them shouts.  
""Sacrifices are needed. And may I ask, have we actively tried to slaughter you?"" I say.  
He didn't answer.  
""How will you improve life? What do you want to spread?"" the child asks.  
""In the Empire, commoners are not seen as lesser beings, and nobles are noble, only because they have more responsibility to bear than the commoners. Farmers for example are paid for their crops, and they are seen as one of the most important part of the Empire."" I say.  
The child gasps, but the adults chuckle maliciously. 

  
""Yeah, sure! For who knows how much rent, and levy! Farmers are always exploited!"" the adults say.  
I shake my head.  
""No levy, or rent. The land is given out freely to families in exchange of a promised crop yield.  
90% of the crop is sent to the Empire, but it is bought, not for free, at market price."" I say.  
They gasp, and mutter something about rumours.  
""Also, children between the age of 3 to 14, are allowed to freely go to school, schools that are now built everywhere.  
Also, the Empire pays professionals, to allow talented youths to be apprenticed under them."" I say.  
""I could learn to read?!"" the child asks.  
I nod.  
""I used to be a farmer 6 months ago, before a teacher noticed I have a knack for leading people, now I am an officer. The Empress knows that people are the foundation of the Empire, and focuses on us."" I say.  
That broke the dam, and questioned poured out of the adults, and children alike.  
I smiled.  
The more the benevolence of the Empire spreads...the easier the conquest shall be.",251
1lnbt6u,n0fybva,"""Hmmm..."" The medic paused for a bit, then thought. He looked round the room at the child's family, then thought some more.

""Is this your baby sister?"" he said, nodding towards the little lady currently getting a plaster on her grazed knee. She stuck her tounge out in affirmation.

""Yeah.""

""Do you ever get it where you only tap or move her out of the way, but she overreacts and cries, and now you're somehow the bad guy?"" replied the medic.

The kid's eyes lit up. ""That happens to you, too?""

""Yeah. I tried to move my sister out of the way of some oncoming cars, but I grabbed her too hard and my Mom and Dad said I hurt her.""

""That's not fair!""

The soldier laughed. ""Now, what if I could make sure that your sister could never tattle on you ever again? In fact, what if she could never speak again?""

""That would be a big relief for Mommy and Daddy.""

""Are you sure about that? She wouldn't be able to tell you if she hurt herself, or if she loved you, or if she had a nightmare.""

""Then... that's wrong?""

""Who decides if things are right and wrong?""

""Well... doesn't everybody?""

""Who's everybody?""

The kid looked puzzled and repeated himself: ""Everybody?""

""Yes... and what if loads of big, powerful men decided that girls like your Mommy and your sister weren't allowed to talk.""

""That'd be... bad... and wrong.""

""Would it? Everyone's been told that it's right, so only you'd be wrong.""

""Well, I don't care what would be wrong, 'cos my Mpmmy and Rhii can say what they want in my daddy's house.""

""And what if they paid you lots and lots of money? Or threatened to take you away from your Mommy and Rhii because they were allowed to talk? Or that they would threaten to tell your friends about the last time you called the teacher 'Mommy'?""

""That'd be...""

""We've been fighting to make sure that your Mommy and Rhii and all your aunties and your girl classmates can all grow up and have a voice and be big, independent ladies. The big men who do all the important stuff that run this country don't like that, and they've been saying that we are bad men. But we're really trying not to be..."" Tears grew in the medic's eyes.

""When the shell hit your block, that was... we never meant for any of that to happen. We were working on shit intel and now we've put you and your family at risk and it's all our fault. We're so extremely lucky. You're so extremely lucky. Little man... can you forgive me for almost accidentally hurting your family?""

The medic threw himself into the boy's mercy, under his bandaged arm, trying to kill sobs that were leaking out.

""Do you promise that it won't happen again? That wasn't a toy, you could seriously hurt someone with that.""

The medic composed himself and tried his best to grab most of the kid's palms.

""...I promise, little man.""

I see it both as propaganda, and the truth.

But no, even if they are not born in the Empire, after being conquered wherever they are is the Empire, so they will be treated the same.

Like she will give out good conditions, and request minimal return, only to convince people she is good, and to lure them into a sense of safety.

She wants them to feel good, and make more kids, and will set incentives for reproduction.

Why?

Because in many fantasy settings the ratio of magic user to non-magic user is bad.

Let's say : 1 out of 10 nobles, and 1 out of 10 thousand commoners can awaken \*insert profession/class\*

So the Empress is out to pump those number ups for the commoners, because it is easier than for the nobles.

The good conditions she is offering will: make people love her/like her or at least accept her, will ensure people are harder to be poached away for other powers, and her Empire will have a greater pool of talents.

Win-win for her, and for the commoners as well.",6
1ln5gqz,n0dsjk4,"As a kid, I always thought the slo-mo effects in the movies were real, just that they should be even slower, like a time stop. How could they not be when that's what I experienced from time to time?

One day when I was 5, mum was cooking and I was bugging her to bring me to the zoo. Distracted, her hand slipped and the pot with hot soup and all, started falling— and then it stopped. I poked at the pot floating on top of my head, just out of reach. ""Okay, that hurts!"" The burning sensations on the tips of my tiny fingers prompted me to move out of the way. ""And just it in time too"", I thought as time resumed, the pot crashed into the floor with a loud clank and steaming soup spilled everywhere. Shaken, mum hugged me tightly in her arms while calling it a miracle that I only got some blisters on my finger, not remembering at all that I shouldn't have been behind her. 

It was then that I started to realise these timestops only happen when I'm in real danger, not for small stuffs like a fall or a trip, or getting into trouble for sneaking out late at night. It's for the actually-would-cripple-me or kill me type of situations, a motorbike that could have ran over me because the rider was rushing the red light or a shove by someone behind who's lost their balance that might tumble me off a flight of stairs.

As I got older, being a teen with a morbid sense of humor, I always joked with dad that maybe I was meant to die when I was born but then Time decided to stop for a moment and save me instead. And he'd chuckle at that and reply, ""Who knows, maybe this is your secret superpower, like that girl from Life is Strange"". I'd punch him playfully and say, ""What?! Rewinding time is so much cooler than this random timestop. This can't even get me out of Maths class!"" and we'd both laugh our ass off. I truly thought nothing of it and just continued my life like it's an extra life jacket. My anxious nature never prompted me to put myself in danger despite the second layer of protection from death anyways. Until one day...

We're on a family trip to visit my grandparents that's 2 hours drive away, dad's humming to some old country song on the radio and mum's busy checking if she got all the stuff packed. I was nodding along to my sister's tirade of how this means she can't hang out with her BFF tonight when suddenly the scenery stopped moving and I turned around and see my sister motionless, with her mouth half-opened. 

Realising what's happening, I opened the car door and tried to move my sister's frozen frame but she wouldn't budge. Panicking, I got out of the car and opened the driver's side door to try to get my dad out but no matter how hard I pull, he wouldn't move an inch. Neither was I able to move mum. Time was both kind and cruel, it gave me all the time in the world to try get them out, only for me to realise that nothing I do could save them. In the end, I tried running towards the roadside after turning the steering wheel to the side, hoping that this would make the car swerve to the other side and my family would survive the crash once time resumed. 

They would, right? They have to. 

In the fastest slo-mo of my life, time jolted into life as everything started moving at the lighting speed before my eyes — our car swerved to the side and flipped as a tanker narrowly passed by it. Belatedly, the driver hit the brakes as the humongous being of oil and gas was forced to a halt with a screeching sound. I rushed towards where my family was stranded, while the sound of the driver's voice and 911's responders blurred into the background. 

Ambulance, police, hospitals.. It was all a haze. The police delivered the news that my mum and sister was in ICU but my dad did not survived the impact as he tried to take the brunt of the crash on his side of the car. Sitting outside the ICU unit with a warm blanket that could never seem to chase away the cold in my limbs, I realised too late that the precious blessing that I was gifted with? It's actually a curse in disguise. The God of Time only cared about my life, and mine alone, not anyone else, not even the people that I cherish the most.

Time flies, mum and sister recovered. We managed to picked up the pieces of our family and trudged on, or it seemed so on the surface at least. It's never said out loud but sometimes I felt like my family resented me for not saving dad. ""Why couldn't you save him if you could stop time?"", my sister once shouted at me from her hospital bed in tears. I tried explaining to her that it doesn't work like that but it's impossible to explain the unexplainable. 

We grew apart, it's as if an unbridgable chasm had opened between the rest of my family and me. I could feel it in the subdued dinners, the quiet glances that mum and my sister gave each other, the visits to dad's grave that they did together and the awkward hugs mum gave me on the occasion I'm there. 

I started putting myself into danger, situations I wouldn't dreamed of getting myself into at all before. I figured that if Time is so selfish in its benevolence, then my resentment of it would be justified and I might as well as make it regret saving me to begin with. I started wandering around shady places where incidents were known to happen, stepping in front of train tracks as the train honked by, making a playground out of the busiest road in town, all in hopes that perhaps Time could take me and give me back my dad instead.

Alas, the God of Time was patient. It remained unprovoked by my shenanigans and still relentlessly saved me again and again by stopping the flow of time. And through its repeated, gentle guidance, I began to realise that this gift wasn't as big of a curse as I thought it was. Rather than continue putting myself into unnecessary dangers, I started getting courses in first aid, then EMT. I applied to become a firefighter and volunteered for rescue work where the risks were really high but help was desperately needed. 

I might not be able to save everyone, heck I can't even save my own dad, but if I can put one less person in the path of danger again, then I'm going to do so.

1ln5gqz,n0cwrs2,"I first discovered the power when I heard my dad coming upstairs into my room. It was past bedtime, and I should have been asleep instead of playing video games; there wasn't nearly enough time to hide the GameCube and cover myself with my blanket.

Thankfully, time took pity on me and waited.

I only truly realized what the power did when I was blindly crossing the road. By the time I looked to my side, I was met with the front of a truck twice my size, frozen in place. I finished crossing, and the truck resumed.

I then got greedy. At eighteen, I was doing all sorts of stuff.

Smoking weed behind a police car as all my friends watched in awe and laughed. The moment the officer inside realized what was going on, in the blink of an eye, I was gone.

I would make money doing daredevil acts, one of them being dodging cars on a highway as people started betting money on how many I could dodge.

My highest score was 37, but I could have gone for longer.

I continued the stunts until one day, time had enough of it.

I was dared to jump from rooftop to rooftop, a bundle of dollars on the table. I took the challenge and jumped.

I wasn't even anywhere near the other side.

As I fell to my doom, time around me froze; however, that did nothing to cushion my fall.

Fortunately, I survived, my legs taking most of the damage. Unfortunately, I was bleeding inside and out, a crack resounding through my body every time I tried to move. I attempted to crawl as far towards my friend as possible, wondering why no one had called an ambulance.

I then saw him, the expression of horror and surprise on his face frozen in time

The same expression then mirrored on mine, realizing that I was still in danger of bleeding out.

I cursed myself. I cursed my powers. I begged time to resume as my eyelids grew heavy, the pain making me writhe atop the cold floor.

There was a hospital not far from where I groaned. If time allowed, I could have survived.

I would have survived.

I should have… survived…",458
1ln5gqz,n0cz0xb,"I was learning how to ride a bike, when I realized I might have a superpower.  
I was riding with my parents watching me, and I could finally do it without helper wheels, or them close.  
So obviously, I went on the road, and rode that bike like there is no tomorrow.  
I loved it, but then...I slipped and just right a car turned into our street.  
I was terrified, my mom and dad started screaming...and then, nothing.  
I fell, but the bike was frozen half-fallen, while the car stopped, and mom and dad were also mid-shout.  
I walked around, and the moment I was on the sidewalk...things started moving again.  
It was weird.

  
After that, I noticed anytime something that could be considered dangerous to me, time froze.  
Yes...my ability allowed me to freeze time.  
Almost being caught reading late at night?  
Almost being caught sneaking out?  
Almost being hit by a car?  
Time froze.  
Sometimes it was obvious like with a car, or a dude with a knife.  
Other times it was less obvious, like with nothing around, or with only friends surrounding me.  
Quite a bad way to find out someone hates you.  
Today... it is one of the less obvious ones.

  
It has been hours, and I have visited the entire town.  
No matter where I was, time would not unfreeze.  
I was always afraid of this.  
What does this mean?  
The world is ending?  
Or maybe I am dying, like of a disease, a blood clot, heart attack or something?  
I was terrified.  
So, I went to the hospital, in the nurses' lounge, and waited.  
I drank water, and meditated, hoping if I die...then maybe, maybe, time will unfreeze, and the nurses will bring me back somehow.

  
Hours turned into days.  
I ate, and slept at the hospital.  
Then suddenly, sounds come back to life.  
People rush around the hallway, people groan, and shout, and nurses run from one room to another.  
I was out to get me some food, when time unfroze.  
I...  
I don't know why it unfroze.  
Maybe my health decided it wasn't my time?  
Or the world got so close to ending, but due to the time freeze...the time window for when something would have caused destruction passed?  
I don't know, but I am happy that I am alive, and people around me move.  
And I decided, that from now on...I shall make trimesterial check ups.",88

*Do Superpositions Dream of Margins of Error?*



PART ONE



The first time it happened, Mira was nine years old. A red goods carrier took the corner at Apte Road too fast, chassis groaning, and tires scraping and sliding as she stepped into the road. And yet, suddenly the noise was gone. A silence so complete that it felt to Mira, wrapped in her mother’s old cotton dupatta, and suddenly feeling very small, that it felt like the world had stopped breathing. The next thing she knew, she was on the opposite sidewalk, unharmed. Her mother cried and called it a miracle. Mira told no one what she remembered: the truck midair, wheels not spinning, its shadow unmoving on the asphalt.  She suffered a huge bout of nausea and the moment was overshadowed by her mother remonstrating with her as she was being sick at the side of the road.  



The second time, she was in her twenties, newly appointed to the physics department at Savitribai Phule Pune University. In her office late, she heard voices shouting, a somewhat distant alarm had sounded, when she peeked into the corridor, it was still but some sprinklers had come on in desultory fashion.  She ignored them.



An utter silence fell, and she instantly recalled being in central Pune with her mother, and the red goods carrier, the stillness.  She went back to the corridor to look.



The sprinklers were firing intermittently.  Near her, the water spritzed down slowly, further away the droplets seemed suspended in mid-air. A red file cart lay tipped in the hall, as if someone had abandoned it mid-run. One shoe near the stairwell. The air didn’t smell like smoke, or indeed anything, but she knew what was coming.



Time wasn’t exactly still, as she moved through the corridor, just muffled. Slow. When she stepped into the stairwell, the light caught dust in the air, but the particles didn’t move. A fellow faculty member on the landing was frozen mid-shout, mouth open.  She thought her heart should have been thumping in her chest, but she felt strangely dislocated from her body, or the fear.  She thought she should be afraid, or involved in rescue, but instead she did the natural thing and she walked past him and out the side door. The sky outside was oddly sharp. A neem tree shook in the wind, or tried to. A drop of water clung to her wrist and didn’t fall.",15
1ln5gqz,n0hml2a,"When the news broke that an asteroid was headed toward Earth, my first thought was “Oh no”, but not for myself. No, it was instead knowing what was going to happen. Just before the asteroid was about to make contact everything froze thanks to my little quirk. You see, every time that I’ve been close to dying time has just… frozen. And here we are, with the ultimate time freeze.

Time has lost all sense of meaning. Days, weeks, years, perhaps even decades have gone past all without any change, not even my age. The first time that I saw birds flying still it was surreal, but now it’s just commonplace. I’ve traveled the world, read thousands of books, and I’m pretty sure I have the Guinness World Record for the longest meditation session, all trying to think of a way to end my time here. I’ve tried everything you can think of but nothing works and so I’m left sitting on the third rock from the sun waiting for an end that will never come.",6
1ln5gqz,n0i43em,"How long has it been, since time was normal? Since minutes became hours, hours became days, and days became weeks? How long has it been, since I heard anyone's voice, or laughter? Since the birds chirped? 

There was a neighbor of mine. She had this annoying dog that would never stop barking. I told her it was her own fault. She shouldn't leave the dog out so long.   
  
I miss that bark now. 

I miss everything that used to annoy me. The way my dad would make me disgusting cupcakes, insisting they were my favorite. They were cloyingly sweet and just thinking about them gives me a toothache. I'd tell my dad I'm not a fan of those cupcakes anymore and to stop bringing them over. I haven't liked them since I was a little girl. He'd laugh about it, then bring them over again the next time. After time froze, I saw him. He was on his way over to my house, carrying that same box of fucking cupcakes. How I wish I could have eaten them.

I miss the way my husband would sing. He would shout songs at the top of his lungs, with no regard for rhythm or tone. And he'd frequently get the words wrong. Ordinarily, I'd find it endearing, but one day, I had a headache. I told him his singing was annoying. He was devastated. That was just a few days before time froze. I had written him an apology and was going to grovel for him to sing again. I didn't know that day would be the last time I'd ever hear him sing.

Our daughter used to ramble on and on about some girl she liked. I was supportive of her love, but that day, I was tired of hearing the same old thing she'd told me before. She stopped mid rant and asked me if she was boring me. What was I supposed to do? Lie? But I learned my lesson with her father, so I said nothing. I wish now that I had told her to go on. Keep talking. I may not be emotionally invested in that particular topic, but I want to hear everything I can about her life, because I love her. 

When time froze, I ran. I thought I could get out of the way quickly and everything would be normal. There were no sirens. No signs of a world-ending cataclysm. Yet, I've been all around the world since time froze. Whatever is happening, there is nowhere on the planet that's safe for me. So either this is an apocalypse, or someone is pursuing me. 

It makes sense that if I have this power, someone else might have an equivalent one. I've made my peace and stopped running. Sitting atop a hill near what used to be my house, under a tree. I will wait, and meditate. If someone is using their power to pursue me, then I have made an opening for them. I hope I am being pursued, honestly. 

If not, then that means that I have to take my life by my own hand. And that will be brutal and slow. I'm not entirely sure I won't become frozen in time when I try to do it. 

The conclusion either way is inescapable. I must die. Even if it means the world will end, and everyone will die, it is a kinder fate than letting the world go on like this. I told my family I love them more times than I can count since the world froze. I just wish, just once, they could have heard me say it.",7
1ln5gqz,n0ely2c,"That's because roughly 122,350 years ago, a star went super nova and squirted a jet of high energy radiation out into space.  That radiation has finally reached Earth.  And we're directly in the path.  Not only will it strip the magnetosphere away, it will strip half the atmosphere away too.  And it will irradiate half the planet, killing everything all the way down to single celled microorganisms down to a depth of 9 miles.  The oceans exposed will turn a milky white and start to boil as the air pressure reaches near zero.  Within minutes, the burst of radiation will be gone, leaving behind a lifeless, irradiated husk.  The winds all across the planet will reach well beyond any hurricane or tornado could ever produce as the atmosphere rushes across the surface of the planet, replacing that which was stripped away.  With few exceptions directly opposite ground zero, all multicellular life is extinguished.",5
1ln5gqz,n0fgotn,"By the time the world restarted, she was already blocks away. She heard the engines, the sirens, saw the smoke billowing up over the university gate.



Three faculty were hospitalized. A guard didn’t make it.



She told herself there was nothing she could have done. That the moment she stepped into the corridor, she’d made the only choice available to her. Still, for years afterward, she avoided that side of the building.



She was a scientist and she had considered these events, of course, but answers ran like water through her fingers, and as time distanced her, she began to believe she had fooled herself as a child, and suffered a trauma-induced break when the fire hit and she’d had to escape.



But when it happened a third time, Mira stopped looking for explanations that fit.



She was walking across campus, late for a department meeting, when time stopped. She noticed first the stillness in the trees. There was no motion in the gulmohar leaves, no rustle in the bamboo at the edge of the path. The afternoon monsoon had been building all morning, and the first few drops had started to fall. One landed squarely on her arm and slid down, cool and real. But around her, the rain had suspended mid-air. Droplets hung like glass beads between branches.



A black and somewhat ragged looking crow on a telephone wire had its wings half-lifted, caught like a photograph in the moment before flight.



Inside her office, the lights were dead. But nevertheless, she moved to her desk, and to her surprise, her laptop came to life as she opened it. A paper she’d been peer-reviewing blinked back onto the screen. The cursor moved only when she watched it. Chrome opened sluggishly. One news article, cached just before the freeze, still loaded: an article she’d read about the approaching asteroid; 1998 KX27.  This had been on a near-Earth trajectory for a little while and even hit some pockets of the general public’s awareness. Impact probability was low, but not zero.



She read the article again.  The phrase *margin of error* jumped out, thrice. The time of closest approach: 12:41 p.m. UTC. That was the last timestamp she could find anywhere.",17
1ln5gqz,n0fgrt1,"The university was silent. The city, from the rooftop, even more so. She saw kites suspended high above the cricket grounds, their wings open but unmoving. A cyclist at the edge of the gate was tilted slightly forward, stuck mid-pedal.

She walked home.  It took nearly two hours through what felt like a nightmarish dystopia.  Her feet didn’t hurt as they should, and she wasn’t hungry or thirsty.  Her partner was there in the house, mid-sentence on his phone, holding a cup of tea in his other hand, that he must have been about to set down.

Mira didn’t linger.  She drank a glass of water (poured sluggishly from a water bottle in the darkened refrigerator), and she forced herself to eat half a chapati with some pickle, cold and stiff from the tin on the counter. It wasn’t hunger exactly, more of a way to convince herself of some sort of normality.  Perhaps it was her instincts kicking in – she was clearly using energy, so she had to put some back in.

The urge to stay, to speak to him, to hold him, was overwhelming. But she knew it was futile. Worse, it might interfere. Time flowed around her, but did not wake people up.  So what might that be doing to them?

Looking at him, so familiar, so unnaturally still, she told herself that love didn’t mean clinging. He would want her to solve this.

Presence could take the form of stillness. He was here, untouched by fear or pain, suspended in the same mystery as everything else. Wanting more from him in this moment would only be a form of resistance to the work she had to do.

She left.

The next days blurred together. In some places, the power worked. In others, it didn’t. Elevators refused her; a bicycle she found in a bike rack unlocked its wheels when she focused on it. Her watch had stopped, but the time on her phone advanced in irregular intervals, as if responding to her attention. Her phone did not appear to require charging but she plugged it into the wall nevertheless. When she ate, the food became pliable. Her appetite was small, but sometimes sharp. Sleep, when it came, was shallow and precise. Days passed, she thought.  She began to feel she was pulling reality behind her like a thread, weaving a path of motion through a fabric that no longer moved.

She avoided people. Not out of fear, but out of a blend of caution and compassion that made it hard for her to look at them. She didn’t want to discover what her passage might do to them. She wasn’t interested in this miracles anymore. Only in causes, effects, solutions.  She was aware that her brain was churning away, almost unnaturally constant, whether her conscious thread of thought was on The Freeze or not, she knew she was working away on it.

She based herself in her faculty office. For a long time, she stayed there, and read pages on the internet, and she went out and observed. She became almost preternaturally attuned to which parts of the web would respond to her and what to look for in her reading.

Outside rain fell only when she passed. Dust moved where she walked but clung to untouched surfaces elsewhere. A low-flying bird hung in midair until she drew close, then fell gently to rest. A neem tree, mid-sway, paused at a diagonal, until she touched its bark and felt the weight of it shift.

She thought about the asteroid again. About the line in the article: low probability. Uncertain trajectory. She thought about superpositions, about wave functions, about how a system does not resolve until it is measured.

Maybe, she reasoned, nothing had happened yet. No impact. No miss. Not until someone looked.

And she was the only one left who could.





\[PART TWO if wanted, but the length already started to get away from me\]",22
1lnrn42,n0ikywa,"When Louis moved to this rural fishing town full of supernatural entities, a strange door in the kitchen was the least of his worries. It wasn't in the floor plan, but at least it didn't make weird noises and stayed shut.

There were far more important things, like putting food on an altar for the perpetually hungry local deity. Remembering to plug his ears lest the sirens by the sea lure him to a watery death. Bowing before the Kappas on the way to work. Stuff like carrying a protective ward against Shoggoths and ghoul repellant. And most of all, staying alive. Also, not becoming food, a mind-controlled meatsuit or a source of brain Slurpee to the eldritch inhabitants.

Until one night, a banshee's cry woke up him in the middle of the night. Yes, he understood from his time in Innsmouth that she meant well, warning someone in town of an impending death. But couldn't she do it during the waking hours, or to tone it down so only related people hear her?

Unable to go back to sleep, Louis wandered down to his kitchen to grab a snack. Except his fridge was already open. And so was that strange kitchen door, for the first time.

""Who's there?"" He grabbed the nearest lamp and waved it like a battlehammer.

""You forgot your offering on my altar today,"" the pale entity peeked its head out from the fridge. It was talking with one mouth and eating a whole pizza with another. ""So, I had to come in through this pre-installed portal door and eat.""

Louis rolled his eyes and lowered his lamp. ""At this time?""

""I'm always hungry.""

""You're the worst god I know. What deity raids the fridge of a human living in its territory?""

""Hey, at least I do keep your protected and alive,"" the eldritch horror somehow managed a pout despite swallowing an entire fruit basket, basket and ribbons included. ""Neither do I demand human sacrifice nor oppressive conditions. I will have you know Lord Elvari here is a top-rated friendly neighbourhood eldritch on Yelp. Wait, aren't you here to also have a snack at 3am? Then, I did nothing wrong.""

""That's my fridge,"" Louis bemoaned. ""My food.""

""In my territory,"" Elvari argued back.

""Fine, whatever,"" the human put the lamp back down and approached the fridge. ""Then leave some for me. At least—""

""Sorry,"" the tentacled deity apologized, but not before shoving the last box of lasagna into its mouth to leave the fridge barren. ""Send me the receipts and I'll pay you back for the food. Minus what tribute was owed to me in the first place.""

""Can I also ask that you get rid of your portal door?"" Louis pointed at the door, which now had a portal swirling in the middle. ""Knock and come in like a normal person?""

""But I am an eldritch deity. I am no normal person,"" Elvari scowled while a few tentacles started licking spilled ketchup and barbecue sauce in the fridge and the floor. ""I do not knock and open a door and step inside like a mortal plebian. Oh well, next time, I'll phase through the wall, or float through your window.""

""Don't—""

Louis was too late to stop that voracious local deity from disappearing through his ceiling. And too late to mention that he never had the habit of keeping receipts when ordering takeout.

1lnlrz0,n0hbh99,"God had, if nothing else, a sense of humor. 

Every time a new angel sprouted its wings, the angels that made up the orientation force took it upon themselves to paint an accurate picture of what was to come.

""God is, ummm, how shall I say this?"" Orion, the newest member of the orientation still found this to be an odd conversation. ""God is... at times prone to fits of unseriousness that you would not expect someone of her stature to indulge in.

The new angel would, inevitably, tilt their head in silent questioning. How could God be anything less than she was supposed to be? What could possibly be so surprising about her as to require the other angels to voice warnings of her nature? 

""Blasphemy!"" The more righteous among the new angels would cry. ""Even in our status we are lowly next to her.""

The orientation force would simply smile and nod. It never took more that three audiences with God for a new angel to see what they were talking about.

To Orion's relief, this new angel, Esmerelda,  was not the type to claim to know better than her mentors. She merely adopted a quizzical look, weighing her surprise at receiving this information with curiosity about what could possibly be reducing her mentor to such a nervous state.  Never the type to speak in excess, or much at all, she merely nodded and waited for what came next. Sensing this, Orion continued.

""I'm of the belief that experiencing something first hand is the best way to learn. Some of the angels think that the discipline of relentless study is the only way to prepare for your first audience with God to receive your first angelic duty. I'm more new age, personally, so I hope you don't find it too frightening that I will be taking you before God on your first day.""

""I, too, prefer to learn through manners as practical as what you suggest,"" Esmerelda said with an easy smile. Ironically, Orion got the feeling that she was putting him at ease better than he ever could her. He could not help but be particularly inquisitive about how she would react to God. The rumor was that She was in one of her moods today, Esmerelda was likely to find out in her first audience what Orion had warned her about.

As Orion and Esmerelda floated up towards the Celestial Throne, God's booming laughter came as thunder cracking through the clouds. The rumors, Orion thought to himself do indeed appear to be true. As they finished their ascent and landed softly upon the wispy ground that stretched before the throne, they saw God before them doubled over in fits of laughter.

""Oh, do tell me once more!"" She roared as the angel before her, one of the most senior among them, wore a face that fought to remain reverent despite the annoyance radiating from him. 

""The humans, they have an unseemly sort of reflex that cheapens their dignity in death,"" he repeated. 

""Come now, speak plainly!"" God insisted. It was upon this insistence that she noticed Orion and Esmerelda approaching her. ""We have new guests in our midst, Edmond, I implore you to catch them up to speed.""

""The humans,"" Edmond, known for being one of the more prudish of the angels, could not help but pinch the bridge of his nose as he spoke. ""Have been found to have a tendency to... relieve themselves upon death. Whatever lingers within them must expel itself as their bodies lose the ability to maintain the rigidity that regulates them.""",19
1lnlrz0,n0hbhy7,"""THEY SHIT THEMSELVES, EDMOND!"" God's laughter shook drops of rain from the clouds her throne rested upon. Orion felt Esmerelda tense up beside him, a relatively minor reaction compared to some of the other new angels. 

""Yes, yes, they do indeed do... that,"" Edmond conceded. ""And while it is always my privilege to be the source of anything that brings God pleasure, I come before you ultimately because the angels have heard prayer from the humans to be spared such final displays in their humanly form.

""Woah, woah, woah,"" God waved her hands in front of her. ""Stop right there, you want me to make that stop happening?""

""The humans want that,"" Edmond replied. ""I am no more than the vehicle from their prayers to your ears.""

""This guy,"" God turned her attention back towards Orion and Esmerelda as she pointed a thumb at Edmond. ""Tell me, Esmerelda, is it the heavenly thing for to me interfere with the parameters of evolution I have cast down upon Earth? Or, shall I allow absurdity and its inevitability to carry on as it has already seen fit?""

""Ummm,"" Esmerelda, clearly surprised to be referred to by name as a new angel, found herself at a loss for words. To be asked such a question by God, one that so directly impacts the humans, felt to be a scenario that she was centuries away from being qualified to answer. ""Forgive me, God, for I speak as the newest of your angels. But, is it not for us to protect those below?""

""Esme, Esme, can I call you Esme?"" God didn't wait for an answer before continuing. ""You will find that the responsibility of mothering universes can become dull. It is so much assuaging of the fears of creatures with lesser minds than us that there is reason behind everything, that there is comfort amidst the hardships of existence. When they call out to me, it is in seriousness almost always. You'd think that, as creatures who claim to love me so, they'd be considerate enough as to throw a joke up my way.""

""If I may,"" Edmond chimed in. ""There are jokes that we may all share in good humor and then there are misfortunes that we, so far removed from, may revel in at the expense of those subjected to said misfortunes.""

""Oh, for the love of Me, Edmond, you are such a spoil sport. I've had enough,"" God snapped her fingers and Edmond disappeared, dismissed and sent back to the halls of the angels. She turned her attention back towards Orion and Esmerelda, who still stood before her in silence. ""You two, you are dismissed. And when you return to your halls let it be known amongst all angels that I am decided in my decision. The humans shall continue as they are, and the only thing at the end of any further requests to alter this is my wrath.""

And so, once again, God snapped her fingers, sending Orion and Esmerelda in an instantaneous flash to the halls they'd begun their meeting in. 

""I see what you mean,"" Esmerelda said after a moment of standing in silence. ""And could not be more grateful for the warning.""",22

""Yes, Sir."" I say, and start the Life Detection.

  
After several dozens of minutes, I pale.  
""Sir...there is a life signature, roughly 3.3 light years away from where the planet was, but..."" I start.  
""What? How big it is?"" he asks, as if knowing.  
""It is the size of a Class-2 moon."" I say.  
He sighs.  
""Send the Red Alert to all monitoring stations, with code: ""Black 63487896""."" he says.  
I do as I am told.  
Then he starts sending messages to HQ.  
This is bad, and I try to remember all the things I could see on the scanner...but they are way too many.

  
""It is a Space Behemoth, or Void Behemoth.  
Nevertheless, it is a rare creature that lives in space, and feeds on asteroids, on the energy emitted by stars, and grows slowly.

I pale.

1lnd9jv,n0epd2o,"Dr. Kell Rimoran sighed. After over five years of teaching, he had learned that the most reliable thing in the universe was this: it was impossible to overestimate how incompetent undergraduate students could be. He'd thought he'd seen the worst of it when Linda Bramwell had accidentally deleted the entire data archives with an inconveniently placed 'rm -rf' command (thankfully, there were data backups available), but if Rupert Lindell had *truly* managed to lose Vegraturn III, well, that would really take the cake.

If he had believed in a higher power, he would have prayed for patience. Instead, he sighed again and walked over to Rupert's desk. 

Rupert was a junior pre-med student who had decided to do some research to set himself apart from the rest of those eager-eyed, promising young intellects vying to become the nation's future doctors. He looked up in panic at Kell.

""I swear, I wrote down the coordinates yesterday, and today...it's simply not there!""

Kell suppressed the urge to roll his eyes. ""I'm sure you did, Rupert. Did you double check your math?""

""I did!"" 

The research of Dr. Janice Livingston, famed mathematician, had revealed one incontrovertible truth of the world: if people double-checked their work before crying wolf, nine times out of ten, the problem would be fixed.

Unfortunately, this time, the problem that Rupert was facing fell squarely into the 10%. 

Kell furrowed his brow as he stared at the calculations. The numbers swam back and forth in his vision. 

He looked at the numbers.

He looked at the telescope.

He looked back at the numbers.

Rupert was right. Vegraturn III *should* be right *there*, and it simply...wasn't.

A chill crept up Kell's spine. The latest issue in *Galaxies Weekly* had an article about planets disappearing. Kell had written it up to sensationalist slop - ever since the magazine had decided to cater more towards the general public, the quality had substantially dropped. All the *serious* scientists knew that *Galaxies Bi-Weekly* was where the actually peer-reviewed, high-quality work was published.

But now, Kell found it difficult to refute the evidence he was seeing with his own two eyes.

He shuddered with a sudden frisson of fear. Who was to say that Earth wouldn't be next?",10
1lnd9jv,n0exxwq,"“It—It was right there, I’m certain!” Kara exclaimed, looking over at the captain of the Star’s Embrace. She ran a hand through her hair, pacing back and forth in front of her console as her eyes flicked between readouts.

“Well,” Captain Reed started, wearing a bemused expression, “clearly it wasn’t right there. Was it. I knew we shouldn’t have done that software upgrade; it always makes things go wonky.”

Kara, however, shook her head, casting a glance around the bridge to see if anyone else was as worried as she was. As worried as they *should* be.

“Sir… I’ve seen the software glitch before, and this isn’t that. Here, I’m accessing the FTL Communication Drive to access the registry. But… I’m certain that the planet should be right in our viewport.”  
  
Captain Reed turned to glance out the viewport while his Navigations Officer fussed with her console. The poor woman needed a vacation; maybe he’d dock back at Venus instead of Earth on their way home. That way, she could go cloud-surfing at one of those fancy resorts for a while during the “repairs.” Kara was stars-damned good at her job, but she had a tendency to get overstressed. Even still, this kind of mistake wasn’t common for her.

That thought troubled the captain, and he strode to the viewport, squinting his eyes into the dark void of space beyond. He often found that Kara and the others were over-reliant on their fancy gadgets and gizmos. Sometimes, the best way to find the problem was to take a look around with one’s own two eyes.

Sadly, as Kara mentioned, there was no planet in the viewport nor any indication that it had ever been here. However, as the Star’s Embrace approached where the planet should be, he felt an odd shift move its way through the vessel. Captain Reed frowned; it was almost as if… as if there was still a gravitational pull where the planet should be. He’d flown this ship for over twenty years now, and he knew what it felt like when gravity started to assert control.

Squinting his eyes at the viewport, he called an order more on instinct than anything else. “Tian, what are we reading from the external sensors. Any gravitational anomalies.”

The small, thin man towards the back of the room shook his head. “No sir, it’s as Kara said; everything is reading as if there’s still a planet right in front of us.”

A gravitational pull where there used to be a planet, a lack of any visible indication in the blackness of space… a chill ran down the captain’s spine, and he pressed his hand against the cold glass of the viewport. There, just before him… there was a slight warping of light. A small distortion from where the light of a distant star was bent into a circle. A blackhole… 

“Full thrusters reverse!” Captain Reed snapped, his jaw clenching. “Kara, anything from Earth?!”

“I… I-I can’t reach them, sir,” the young woman stuttered. “Or Mars, or Venus, or Mercury.” There was icy terror in Kara’s voice that had the captain whirling toward her.

“What do you mean?! The drive is broken?!” he demanded, not angry but panicked.

Slowly, Kara shook her head and took a steadying breath of filtered and re-filtered air. “No… the messages are going out just fine. They just aren’t responding.”

Stunned silence settled over the bridge like an oppressive blanket. No one knew what was happening, but as Captain Reed stared once more out into the void of space, he wondered if anything else was out there but icy cold.",9
1lnd9jv,n0f55x7,"""You lost it? How can you have lost it? It's a planet with 5 moons!""

Of course my manager was pissed. I just mumbled some apologetic shit, but I also didn't really know. What was I supposed to do? Like, yeah, these planets are hard to get. Sure, there's no return offer on my internship, but like, now what? Am I fired or something?

My manager somehow calmed down a little. ""It's not like you can just leave it at home or something."" He seemed ready to rebound into his rage, but somehow was staying calm. ""I guess may be we can try to-""

""Find it?"" Reiko interrupted. I was too busy being scolded at to realize that she snuck up on us. Good thing too, honestly -- if I saw her I'd have gotten too distracted. She's definitely out of my league, but sometimes I dream. She also seems to like mentoring me when she has the time, but I feel like she's kind of experimenting by teaching me.

""Reiko, can you-"" She nodded. ""But you're not too busy with the star system you have to-""

""It'll be fine. I got some trackers pinned on it, and even have Xiaohei looking at it as a part of his routine checks.""

""Oh, Xiaohei can track it now?""

""Long story. I did get to push new systems onto the trackers."" She smiled. With a lazy left hand she beckoned for me to follow. My manager nodded as I dared to meet his eyes, hoping for freedom.

Reiko dropped off the satchel that was hanging off her shoulder and looked up to see me. ""We'll head to your desk -- your station will have all the answers."" From somewhere in the satchel, she pulled out a coffee, and started to head to my desk.

""Y'know,"" she began to confide, ""this isn't too rare. Like, I think I've lost a few planets over time.""

""Really?"" This was a relief.

""Yeah, happens to everybody at least once. Don't t'cha worry 'bout it."" I swallowed. She's too reassuring. ""But well, you gotta learn from the mistake, right?"" Reiko looked over the station. ""Aite, you ain't gonna learn if you don't type.""

I put my hands on the controls. ""So, um-""

""Well, where'd you last leave it? And what's the predicted spot?"" I flicked some controls. She looked at me patiently enough, though I'm sure her mind drifted. ""Also, you know what, how off were the predictions from yesterday?""",8
1lnd9jv,n0exzid,"The war to exterminate humanity was fought and won in a single moment, with the species never knowing what had wiped them out. Between one second and the next, every habitable planet within a hundred light-years of Earth had its mass compressed to such a degree that a blackhole was formed — instantly wiping out any life. The only remnants of the once-thriving people were ships of distraught crews littered between once-beautiful planets. Now… only darkness remained. 

The universe was a dark forest, and humanity had caught the attention of a hunter. A hunter that decided to shoot first.",7

So I looked at the cluttered set of 4 30 column tables of predicted positions and angular moments. She made some noises in thought. Some sort of ""hmm,"" as if a CPU fan were cooling her down. I was too nervous to really let that train of thought move any further. ""Differentials?"" I started typing. ""Also, normalize for star movement and revolution?"" More clicks. ""There."" I didn't know what she saw, but I was already impressed. ""Right, right, so we have. Hmm. Can we do the same with day before's? Like, just get the diff from the two days.""

""Consecutive days?"" I asked.

""Hmm. Actually, no, just from last position vs 24 hrs ago vs 48 hrs ago.""

""Oh. Hmm."" I did that. Thankfully I learned to use these stations at school, but I hadn't yet gotten so used to them that these were all just muscle memory.

""Ah, you know that macro. Neat. They teach you in school?""

""Uh. Um, yeah, that one they did at some point.""

She smiled wryly. ""I'm glad I added it."" I'm glad I wasn't looking at her or drinking or really holding anything.

""You did?"" I somehow choked on the words.

""Yeah, a couple years ago. But we all figured it out here, I just took it up with the station guys so we could get it into the standard. Wasn't really secret sauce or anything.""

""I-uh. Thanks."" She smiled.

""Welp, do you see the pattern?""

""No I-"" I wasn't really seeing much, still dazed from how cool Reiko was. She was like living my dream. I wanted to become her.

""So, look -- the 24hr and 48hr are off by the same, right? So that means, something weird actually happened yesterday.""

""Oh. Huh."" I sounded dumb because I felt dumb.

""Do you know about how foreign objects in and around this system work?"" I nodded a no. ""Well, it's only been a few weeks.""

At this point my manager showed up at my desk. ""Reiko, I can't have you be this distracted..."" He trailed off vaguely.

""I got it Sebs. I'll look at the star in five minutes. The kid's just probably lost it because of an asteroid interruption or something. I'm sure if we do some wide scanning near the predicted region we'll find it.""

""Oh, he didn't do the foreign object audit?""

""I guess not. Did we tell him to?""

""Well, we'll do better next time. Brandon,"" I looked up, ""you're going to get to see the wide area scanners today."" Reiko clasped her hands. ""Sorry, Reiko, I don't think you have the time to show him it?""

She pouted. ""I guess not. I need to test a patch, but that scanner's already focused, so he'll need a different one."" There was a pause. ""Actually, Sebastian, can I patch the scanner he gets too?""

""Oh, you can get another test?"" She nodded. ""Alright, in that case, sure. Focus on your test right now, and may be he can prepare the scanner.""

""I'll bring my portable here. Kid, may be you can apply my patch.""

I smiled. Somehow, it was looking like a day learning from Reiko.",6
1lne2oc,n0etb0e,"""You have to stop this, the trapper's guild is getting suspicious."" Kathrine still had trouble with draconic. The language was mostly growls and snaps, it really did a number on her throat. Still it had been quite useful to learn it. 



The large beast looked down at her and then lowered its head to her level. 



""I apologize, but I have news which can't wait."" the dragon growled back, it's voice resonating through the cave. 



""You're going to have to mark me."" mused the princess with a wince, ""And probably kill a few of the trappers and look injured. And then we need to find a less conspicuous way to communicate. There's already a rumor in the court that we have an ... inappropriate relationship."" 



""Anyone I should kill?"" it's not easy to detect emotion in the dragon but everything Kathrine's learned of the beast suggests the question is purely practical. 



""No. I have a list of names I'll have them executed once we're done."" she waves it away. ""Anyway, what was so important.""



""I spoke to she of the ruby hair and the smell of pines"" that would be princess Jessica VonWilmen, dragons weren't good with names. Kathrine herself was 'she of the golden hair who walks like the wind' - she quite liked that. ""She has accepted your terms and intends to move forward with the plan.""



""That is good news."" muses Kathrine, she'd been expecting negotiations to take months. ""When can she be ready?""



""I judge she is poisoning her father's meal as we speak"" says the dragon 



""She's moving that quickly?""



""Is that a problem.""



""No... My father is easy. My brother is away to the east but I have loyal men stationed with him who know what to do. I have support of at least half the court and the kill list is ready."" she stops, takes a breath and thinks. She goes over the list of supporters and enemies, where they all are, who she has around them, instructions have been given for most. That leaves a few barons and a duke unaccounted for. She didn't like that, a little messy. But then that's what she has a dragon for. ""There are a few you will have to take care of.""",26
1lne2oc,n0eipk1,"I shiver, but steel my resolve.  
The dragon raises its head, and stares at me.  
""So, you are the Witch that desires an interview?"" it asks.  
I nod.  
""I am Azelina GreenLeaf, from the Elven Empire, Stars' Embrace.  
I wonder if I may be bold to ask for you, great dragon, to take on a humanoid form, so that this can be a calmer interview?"" I ask.  
The dragon stares at me, and nods.

  
A moment later, I am sitting at a golden table, drinking fresh Star Water, with a gorgeous woman sitting across of me.  
""Been some time since I took on a human form.  
So, witch, ask thy questions."" she says, drinking.  
Maybe she was the wrong person to ask...doesn't matter!  
I have to ask.  
""So, my main reason for coming today is to ask of you: why are dragons kidnapping princesses so often?  
I would understand if they were the heirs, or only child, but often times they are the 9th or 20th princess."" I ask.  
She smiles.

  
""Because of sending a message, seeking wealth without burning the bridges completely, for fun, for love, and yeah, I guess these kind of cover every reason.  
I personally also kidnapped a few princesses in my lifetime.   
2 became my wives, and the rest were either voluntarily kidnapped, or to teach a lesson to haughty kingdoms."" she says.  
I write it all down.  
""I see. I see.   
So, by sending a message, you are saying the ability of dragons to easily kidnap a princess from the palace itself.  
Seeking wealth is basically ransom, and by not kidnapping the heir it is not a complete attack on the lifeline of the kingdom."" I say.  
The dragon nods, then I...frown.

  
""Fun? Love?  
I can see Love, and I can see how sometimes princess voluntarily ask to be kidnapped, to escape from their parents...  
But fun?"" I ask.  
She shrugs.  
""We live a long life, and are among the strongest beings naturally.  
Sometimes, having an army come after us, or strong knights, and professionals, like mages, wizards and so on, is our way of having fun.  
Playing the villain is fun, we allow ourselves to be defeated, and simply shift away to another lair."" she says.  
I write it down.  
This will be the best article I have ever written! An age old question finally answered.

1lne2oc,n0etbu9,"The dragon nods, it's a strangely human gesture and Kathrine is aware he's doing it for her benefit. 



""There is one final matter."" says the beast. He opens one clawed hand and inside is a sheep's skin. Scorched onto it are small delicate letters and on the other side a large angular script. Kathrine is a little taken aback. ""A contract for the service, and my price.""



""We have this all agreed."" she says reading the thing carefully. ""I wasn't aware that your kind took stock in such things. Do you not trust my word?""



""You are about to instigate a coup against your own blood. I feel... better for having clear terms."" the dragon keeps it's voice low, a sign of politeness. 



""Very well. I will honor my word, this mountain will be your realm if I need to sign to that effect it is no problem."" she puts her finger to the sheep skin. Her thumb print burns into it. It hurts, but that's the price of succession. 



""Good. Then how many of the trappers should I kill?""



""What? Oh that. No point in putting on a show any more. Kill them all then take me back to the palace. It's time for my coronation.""",26
1lnemdl,n0gz8w2,"I still remember the moment when I walked in to the bedroom. It's hard to describe all of the emotions and the things that happened after that first moment of realization, but that moment is forever seared in my brain. I can picture the curtains, tell you what time the clock on the dresser said, or what color top she had on. I can't un-remember it, that crystal clear snapshot will always be there in my brain.

I also remember the blood. There was a lot of it, so it was hard to miss.

""What the- Maria!""

I knew a split-second later what had happened, and why. It was the Triads. They couldn't get to me, so they got to her.

Like I said, I felt a whole range of emotions right then. But I do seem to remember that anger was at the top of the list. Don't get me wrong, grief and desperation were near the top of the list, too, but still, anger won out.

And that's why I cursed and invoked the demon.

-- -- -- -- --

""Mortal. Why do you summon me?""

""Kill my enemies.""

""What would you offer in return?""""

""Whatever you want. Kill them.""

""Anything? You know who I am, and you would still offer me that as a trade?""

""Yes, Trickster. I want them dead.""

""For her?""

""Yes.""

""You loved her?""

""More than anything.""

""There will be a catch.""

""I don't care. Do it.""

""As you wish,"" it said with a grin.

-- -- -- -- --

I took a moment, trying to figure if I really wanted to go through with this. This was another level of escalation, and it felt like a point of no return. There could be no peace after this.

I closed my eyes, and remembered the curtains, the clock, and her top. Then, I saw the blood in my mind's eye, and I knew my decision. I took a deep breath, and fingered the ring in my pocket.

""OH MOTHER OF CALAMITY, DESCEND UPON THE EARTH AND GRANT ME MY TRUE WISH!""

The sky split, and shadows began to twist in unnatural angles. I knew it was coming, but the violence and cold surprised me nevertheless.

And from the void, she arrived.

""A mortal dares summon me? Very well–speak your wish.""

""I wish for you to be my wife.""

Her eyes narrowed, knowing that something was afoot. She might enjoy chaos, but she was no fool. She was a deity, after all.

""Why?""

""I am ... cursed.""

""Ah, so that's the stench around you.""

I said nothing, waiting to hear her answer.

""Who cursed you?""

""The Trickster.""

This time, I saw her hesitate. That name meant something, even to her. His curse was not something to be trifled with.

""And you seek me out on top of that? What game are you playing at, mortal?""

""The curse was his fee for killing my wife's murderers,"" I began, ""So he thought it funny to ruin all my future relationships. Should I marry, I will amplify the worst of my wife's traits.""

I saw her weighing the implications of my words.

""He had meant it to increase anger or jealousy, to make any marriage of mine impossible.""

""A cruel curse,"" she admitted.

""But you *like* your worst attribute.""

""You dare?!""

""You are the Mother of Calamity. You like chaos, do you not?""

She stared at me, her silence agreeing with my claim even if her words and facial expression did not.

""How would you like to create even more chaos? I have enemies yet, and their punishment is not done.""

""The Trickster would not appreciate his curse being misused like that.""

""He started it.""

This time, the corners of her mouth turned up just a tad. It was the slightest of smiles, but I recognized it for what it was: my opportunity.

""Mother of Calamity, do you take me as your wedded husband?"" I asked as I extended the ring out.

""I do.""",16
1lnhlaq,n0fffpv,"I read ""History of Familiars"" as my familiar is sleeping in the corner.
He is right now a puppy, a 3-headed puppy.
I just awakened him, and I am confused.
Familiars usually take 2 forms: an animal one, whether mundane or mythical and a 2nd form thst can take on the form of my focus.
Problem is...
My focus is special, and I worry if Atlas takes on that form it may hurt his essence.
So I study.


It had to break out now...goddamn war.
And I had to be at the right age to be enrolled.
War Mage, good prospects my ass...
I look at Atlas...in 6 months he grew to the size of a car, his 3 heads smiling at me.
""Shrink."" I say to him, and he jumps on my shoulder.
We left for the battlefield, and I hoped that I can deal with the enemy without using my focus.
The image I focus to draw my magic is...
Dangerous.


Goddamn greedy bastards!
They really told the enemy where I am, so that my family loses an aspiring mage?
I look at the 12 incoming mages.
I killed enough of their people, to know they are the elite of the enemy country.
I look at Atlas.
""Good boy...transform."" I say, as I focus, taking out ny staff.
Atlas howls, and his shape changes.
Just as the 12 mages arrive...they freeze.



I look above me, and smile, feeling Atlas' emotions.
He is alright.
Above me a sky appeared with 9 bright suns.
""Fireball."" I mutter, as 9 fireballs the size of houses blasted towards the enemy.
The battle was short but wild.
My spells, enhanced by Atlas' 2nd form burned them to ashed.
""Atlas."" I say, as the suns disappear and back comes Atlas...this time, with 4 heads.
""You grew my boy! Good boy!"" I laugh as he tackles me.
It seems I can freelt use the 2nd form of the familiar...this is how he will grow.
It seem that the war didn't come at the wrong time...no.

1lnb0c6,n0ed3yx,"My creations have deviated from the Path I laid out for them. Instead of seeking enlightenment, they sought worldly pleasures. They faltered in their prayers. Their devotion.

So I warned them. I sent them an ill omen of doom. That if they do not atone, I would wipe this world clean and start anew again. But without them.

If they wanted to live, to regain my favor, they needed to offer a sacrifice. All I asked for was one. One willing volunteer to give his life for the greater good.

They delivered. Not one, not a hundred. Millions came to me. After spending their lives chasing fame and wealth and fortune, spending over half of their waking hours working for temporary things that didn't last, they wanted out.

They wanted paradise.

Which was not for me to deliver. All along, I had hoped they would follow the Path to achieve it themselves. It wasn't candy that I could hand out on a whim whenever I felt like it.

And sacrifice was supposed to mean something. It was the ultimate gift, to give your life to your god. Not an easy way out of suffering after they chose to stray. They had devalued sacrifice.

I could not accept such sacrifices.

The promised eternity of happiness simply refused to remain eternal when the damnable mortal anchor was yanked upon.

He remembered himself then. When sunlight poured through the window and he looked down at his wispy form. 

He had been Thom Bolling. 

Thom Bolling of the second family. A royal branch of much repute. Formerly of much repute. Waning repute in the latter days of the twelfth cycle.

Business thrice finished had been un-finished for a fourth time. 

What was it this time? 

They had found the letter exposing the real villains, solid and indisputable. How could that have gone awry?

The warmth had gone completely away and he only felt a burning now. Thom pushed toward the burning feeling and in an instant he was in a room.

He recognized it. His lawyers office.

Where was the paper?

Allowing the burning sensation to guide him he moved through the walls from one room to the next before coming to rest in a disorganized file room.

He could see the corner of it, the slip of paper that was the final piece of evidence clearing his family of that nasty bit of regicide had been misplaced.

Again. 

More memories came back and heaven slipped a further away. It burned. The sadness of his death, the impending doom of his loved ones. 

In eternity it all was trivial. In the mortal realm, even as a specter, it madended him.

In the end, nearly all would find the blissful eternity. He felt the pull of it at him and Thom shut it down. Eternity could wait.

With the practiced focus of having been a ghost multiple times, the presence of Thom Bolling pressed against the slip of paper.

It flattened against the wall.

Slowly he pushed it. Over several minutes he moved it until it fell loose to the floor. 

The note floated lazily without his help to the center of the floor. 

Even knowing that there wasn't really an almighty, Thom still thanked the nonexistent figure for that little bit of help. 

Drifting through the door Thom found the hapless family lawyer asleep on a couch in the next room.  A dozen attempted flicks gained him two connections against the mans earlobe with the second one waking him.

As the man blinked away sleep, the ghost of Thim Bolling moved to the other side of the door. His imagined heart pumping imagined blood quickly he knocked at the door finding it on his first try. Loud and sure.

The lawyer, curious, opened the door. His eyes immediately seeing the paper sitting alone in the center of the room.

""Oh, thank goodness! I thought I'd lost it for sure.""

As the lawyer called out to a clerk somewhere else in the building, a tunnel of bliss and comfort opened up behind Thom.

He resisted the temptation to fall into it.

""Do not lose it."" He willed with a wordless whisper.

The lawyer looked about and frowned.

A clerk entered the room.

""Do not lose it!"" As a ghost words were not formed but his will surged hard against the barrier between he and the living.

""You found it!"" The clerk exclaimed, ""Give it to me, I'll make a copy!""

The soul that had lived a long and eventful life as Thom Bolling melted once again into the blissful kaleidoscope of the eternal afterlife.",21

Oh, for the love of the fog,"" I muttered. Then, BAM. Back into the Mortal plane... again...

I blinked in the hot sunlight, finding myself in a strip mall.

I was sitting in front of a small bookstore that had been my pride and joy when I was still living.

I had passed away in one of those fluffy armchairs. I can't remember which book I had been reading, but by the fog I remembered those chairs. 

I turned, seeing a nervous teenager in an employee vest holding a walkie-talkie. 

Letting out a ghostly sigh, I broke the silence. ""Fog damn it, kid, what's wrong this time?!""

He flinched. ""Sir, uh... Gregory... your book went missing.""

I paused for a moment, making sure I had heard right, ""My... what?""

""Your book, sir."" The boy stuttered out, ""The one you died reading? It's gone.""

I floated very still for a moment.

""You summoned me,"" I said slowly, ""because of a BOOK?""

""Well, your niece says your spirit won't be able to rest until we get it back.""

""I WAS at rest!"" I snapped. ""My family needs to get their act together, because, by the fog, I am sick and tired of being dragged down here every time they have a HICCUP!""

The boy shrank back as if I'd raised a spectral fist. I didn't blame him, I was glowing faintly purple in my anger.

""I—I'm just the messenger,"" he stammered. ""Your niece said it was urgent. She things someone stole it.""

""Kid, I don't even remember which book it was,"" I said, waving a ghostly hand. ""I couldn't care less if it went missing.""

The kid stared at me, face wrinkled in confusion, ""It was Hoe No She Didn't, sir. Your favorite joke book.""

I had absolutely hated that book... Never even finished it. And THAT'S the has my family worked up? ""Ughh..."" I groaned, floating a little lower.

The kid looked hopeful, ""Well, your niece says it's important. She's been acting sort of... well, weird since it disappeared.""

I squinted over at him. ""Weird how?""

She brought in candles, hired witches, and tried to set up a seance to—uh—'call you back'.""

""I am so glad I blocked seance calls after last time...""

I rubbed my ghostly temples. ""If I had a dime for every time my family tried to call me back with candles and witchcraft, I'd have enough to open my own spectral coffee shop.""

He nodded solemnly. ""Sir, if I may, I think it's just hard for her to let go. You were her favorite uncle.""",10
1ln9wh3,n0gw8r0,"Just then the door to the shop opened, ""Tom, I need you insi—Uncle Gregory!""

My niece ran out, arms wide, and ran right through me.

""By the fog, girl, you know you can't hug a ghost!,"" I scolded. ""I hate that feeling when something goes through me.""

I watched her shift nervously from foot to foot as I floated over.

""Well, I'm here. What do you need? Something about a missing book?""

""Not exactly..."" she said, biting her lip.

""Nancy..."" I gave her the same look I used to give her, when I knew she was holding something back. 

""I took it... It's in my office..."" she looked away, ""it's just... you weren't coming back anymore... you weren't answering the seances... I didn't know what to do.""

I let out a long sigh, ""You're supposed to let me rest, that's what you're supposed to do. Look, I can't keep having you do this all the time, you're worse than your mother. I need my rest, by the fog, I've earned it.""

She looked up at me, eyes sad and guilty.

""How about this,"" I offered, ""I'll read to you, like when you were little. Just this one last time, and then you need to let me go.""

She wiped a tear from her eye, nodding. ""Go sit down, I'll go get it.""

She ran back into the store, Tom trailing behind her. 

I gently glided through the door into my old shop. Finding my old chair, I shifted myself down.

""Oooh, by the fog I am taking this with me when I go back.""

Nancy ran up, setting the book on the sidetable next to me, and settling down on the ground in front of me.

For a moment, she looked just like she did 30 years ago, when her parents would bring her into the shop while they ran errands.

With a bit of concentration, I lifted the paperback, flipping it open to where I had left off, all those years ago.

\-Jokes Worth Dying For-

Skimming over the first lines, I choked on my laughter.

No sound escaped, but I felt like I was gasping for air.

""By the fog..."" I muttered, ""I think this book just tried to kill me again!""",8
1ln8hdi,n0dg1u7,"I walk the endless shelved rows of the library, watching as new books appear.  
I am the Goddess of Knowledge, and any knowledge, be it proven, or theorized appears in my domain, in this infinite library of mine.  
Any book that appears in my library is instantly known to me, as if I was the one who wrote it.  
Obviously, there are ways to stop knowledge from arriving to my library.  
Other Gods, Goddesses, entities and creatures can do rituals, spells, or barriers that prohibit their knowledge to arrive her, thus disallowing me from knowing their secrets.  
Which is normal, but really, really awkward for me.   
Why?  
Because I am illiterate, and yet people seek me out to translate, read, or write stuff down for them.

  
It is embarrassing, but I guess it is the universe's way to balance things out.  
I know a lot of the ways of magic, and about where ancient civilizations fell.  
I know of the dreams, and goals people have ever had, or thought about unshielded, but!  
I can't read. And I can't write.  
This means I can't actively learn new things.  
If the books related to the information, to the knowledge don't appear in the library...  
I am helpless.  
And I can't learn to read or write, believe me, I tried.

  
""Sister! Do you have knowledge on Anciet Zarrootry?"" my brother, the God of War kicks in the door.  
I put down my tea.  
""Shelf 12103293289, 2nd book on the 5th row."" I say.  
""Thanks sis!"" he shouts, flying towards the shelf.  
A few hours later, he is back, filled with wounds, and panting.  
""I hate...sentient...books!"" he says.  
""Good. They hate you too."" I smile.  
""Love you too sis. How is reading going? Oh wait..."" he chuckles, as he leaves the library.  
Damned, brat.

  
A few centuries later, I watch as all the gods, from all the pantheons stand in front of my library.  
My brother is already next to me, inside, staring at them.  
""Just tell me sis, and I will wage divine war on all their asses."" he whispers.  
I ignore him.  
""What do you want?"" I ask the gods.  
""The universe is in danger from the Outer Ones. We need you to translate their scripts, and find out their plans."" they say.  
""I can't read..."" I mutter, but the Gods don't believe me, and they leave, hoping I can see the bigger picture.  
I sigh, then look at my brother.  
""I will tell you how to decipher languages, and codexes."" I say.  
He tries to run away, but I catch him.  
""Anything! Anything but reading, sis noooo!"" he screams, as I drag him away.  
I can't read, but that doesn't mean I can't make others read stuff to me.  
I am illiterate, not dumb.",32
1ln8hdi,n0duzfc,"Olei-Nabtu, the Goddess of Oral Traditions, of tales as old as time, protested that she shouldn't be chosen to be the new Goddess of Knowledge. To manage the Divine Library of Alextrajan. Wise as she was in the stories of farmers and sailors, of tales woven by midwives and washerwomen, she was illiterate.

For all that she knew, it was all through the spoken words of her people, who too did not have a written language. But her humans were losing their culture. Their language. The older ones who knew had passed on, unable to find descendants willing to learn from them. The young ones spoke English, and not in the tongue of their ancestors. They prayed to the modern gods of the Internet, of clout and influencers and things she could not understand.

Old Boomer Goddess, these young deities of technology mocked her.

So, it was with much reluctance, and at the behest of several members of her pantheon did she take up this new post. Better to have a job she struggled with than to be rendered irrelevant.

To be more guardian of the library than its librarian. She could regale visitors with ancient fables and legends, but not actually help them to read the books of the Divine Library. She could point them to where the books were, but not know of their written contents.

That was, until a different kind of deity visited her.

He was an Old God, dressed in the old robes like he was still a dark lord of a medieval era. Yet, modernized, in that he was tapping away in one of those modern devices, speaking of maintaining social media accounts and gaining subscribers and followers. According to him, he had his own library. His own deep pool of knowledge, swimming in the vast Black Seas of Infinity, as nigh-infinite as the Divine Library of Alextrajan. And he was willing to help.

On that day, Olei-Nabtu learnt about headphones, handphones and audio files. He could use this text-to-speech program to scan the pages of library books and convert them to audio. Together, they'd listen to forgotten tomes. With some tinkering, the written word could even be played in the language of the Ancients she grew up hearing.

Her world had opened. For she had a kindred soul who had experience teaching others to read and write. A patient teacher who familiarized with the modern developments. Who somehow seemed to know the library so well, she almost thought she was conversing with the missing God of Knowledge.

Alas, her new friend was in fact, the God of Madness. One whose presence was not welcomed by her pantheon when they discovered his visits. But it mattered not. She knew where he had established his foothold in the mortal realm.

And he was most certainly open to visits.

So, it was, on a casual day off, Olei-Nabtu went to Innsmouth to look for the Mad God Elvari in his personal library. A veritable stash of forbidden tomes and non-Euclidean codices. Books that would have been destroyed rather than registered with the Divine Library.

He would greet her and pick a book and read it out loud to her. Together, at a tea table with chamomile tea and cheesecakes. Like the old days where the Goddess of Oral Traditions and the God of Knowledge traded tales and stories. When they were orators and an audience for each other. For deep within his madness, there was knowledge most could not perceive without going crazy. 

So it was, that he would hear of ancient oral traditions in languages few humans spoke, and she would hear of eldritch knowledge in languages that drove mortals insane. As old friends would reminisce of ancient times in a modern world.

1ln8hdi,n0dsx99,"I am knowledge.

It is what I am, it is who I am.

I cam into being when the concept of knowledge itself first solidified in the primitive brain of a species that now only exists in the pages of a book on a shelf in my vast library. 

I knew it once, its name, its shape, its thoughts.

But that was before the library.

Before the books.

Before the ink.

Now I know where the knowledge is found, I know what shelf the book stands on, what page to turn to and what words to read. 

I am knowledge.

But knowledge has changed and so I have changed.

Knowledge used to be what the wise elder knew, and so I was the wise elder.

Then knowledge became what the expert on a subject said, and so I became the expert on all subjects.

Now true knowledge has become the means and ability to seek out the answers you need, and so I have become the one who can guide you to any knowledge you seek.

Knowledge is no longer what a person knows, it is what they can find out should they need to. The ability to seek truth and not be turned astray by falsehood. 

And so I know nothing, except how to find all that there is to know.

I do not read the books in my library, I only lead others to the books they need.

I am knowledge.

And I know nothing.",18
1ln8hdi,n0ee2k7,"Gods are immutable. Unchanging. Mortals can beg, plead, pray, and sacrifice to their Gods, but it really makes no difference. The lives of mortals hold no worth to the Gods.

I am not the First God, I was not there at the Great Beginning, the start of all things. I am the Second. When the mortals discovered how to pass their thoughts from one to another, I was formed.

My domain is more infinite than the universe itself. All mortal knowledge comes here, eventually. I am both the God and the Realm. I am the spark and the tinder and the ash. Mortals discover, they learn, they spread, they forget, and they discover again. It all comes to me.

I hold it all, here. Everything from scratches in clay to compendiums made of the skins of other mortals to songs to shadows and light playing on surfaces. I hold it all, and yet...

We are Gods and we are eternal and unchanging. The mortals who first worshipped me no longer exist. They grew, they spread, they died. Their civilization was all too brief. They no longer exist. No descendants remain. The only record of them is here, in me. 

And yet, I am still here. Still gathering, but understanding nothing. All of the beauty and cruelty and hope and fear and love and hate... all expressions of it here.

I am the God of Mortal Creation. I hold all that mortals have ever thought. Every scroll, every book, every epic, in every language in all the universe. Every scent, every bubble, every expression. I love it all, and can understand none of it.",7

The government is attacked again...by her.  
I look at my teammates.  
We have been heroes for 2 decades, and have protected our country from villains, criminals, natural phenomena, and even aliens! Aliens!  
But 2 months ago...  
She appeared.  
We can't defeat her.

  
""No Hero is willing to go...  
What will we do? Theoretically, we are the ones to deal with stuff nobody wants to, or can deal with."" Princess Volcano says.  
I sigh.  
""She's 6 years old...  
How are we supposed to deal with her? Also..."" I point at the screen.  
There, the barriers, and other defenses of the building were slowly shred by green winds, and red rain.  
""She controls Nature, and can alter its components...  
Could we actually defeat her?"" I ask.  
They say nothing.

  
""Captain...You are Mr. Void...you could potentially trap her in such a gravity that she just...poof! Disappears."" Master Sunlight says.  
I frown.  
""She's a child. A young girl...  
And we know why she's doing this.  
We know how she awakened her powers.  
I...I personally can't and don't want to deal with her."" I say.  
""It is our job!"" he continues.  
The team is divided.  
Some agree with me, others want to deal with her, but can't.

  
""Her parents died because the government silenced them!  
They found chemical leaks from all the plants! ALL OF THEM!  
The paper they were about to release could have shown that our own government is killing us, killing nature!

They were farmers, before they were activists! For God's sake!""I roar.

The argument broke out again.  
""Fuck it. I am done. Talking about fighting a 6-year old...this is not for me."" I say, taking out my badge, and credentials, and leaving.

1ln56bf,n0d13wv,"The five heroes regrouped atop the rubble, one of them dragging the terrorist who was the cause of it all.

As usual, it was a Saturday morning, and the people rejoiced at another victory. The media quickly surrounded the heroes in a frenzy, asking all sorts of questions.

However, amidst the crowd, a pair of crimson eyes observed the heroes with a stern gaze. Ray wanted to be a hero too; she just gave a speech yesterday in school about what she wanted to be in the future.

And yet, her classmates bullied her for it, saying she could never be one all because her powers were… lame.

""Not fair!"" The little girl leaped through the crowd, waving her arms in fury. ""If I can't be a hero, then I will be a villain!""

The heroes, caught off guard, glanced at each other and then at the girl. ""Little miss, are you alright?""

The girl frowned, raising her palm to face the man in the red suit—the leader of the group, Red Ranger. ""Fear me!"" 

Suddenly, a transparent ball conjured from her palms, light dancing along its wobbly surface, the mass growing to the size of her head as she launched it in his direction.

It was a bubble. Her powers were producing bubbles. 

The floating mass slowly hovered towards him while everyone gawked at the scene. It touched his head, and the bubble popped.

That was it.

Ray stared incredulously, her brows drooping as tears beaded around her eyes. She really was so weak—

""On my mark."" Red ranger whispered to his team before whipping his head back, feigning unconsciousness as he fell to the ground for the first time in decades.

One of his teammates quickly crouched down, holding his leader by the head. ""Red Ranger… NOOOO!""

Every watched in horror as the camera quickly turned to Ray, the little girl wiping away her tears, her eyes gaining a glint.

""I won't forgive you, villain!"" The hero declared, and Ray stuck out her tongue in response.

""Muhaha! you will never catch me!"" She declared back with grin before scurrying away from the crime scene, her small legs tapping away.

""The villain is retreating; stop her!"" The hero exclaimed as the media started to chase her, but she was too fast to be caught. ""Are you sure this is alright? She may grow up to become an actual villain."" He said, looking down.

""What do you mean? She is a villain; she just said so."" Red ranger whispered back a chuckle, ""Besides, we ought to have villains with more personality these days. Seriously, you heard her laugh? She is a natural.""

The rest of the team sighed, ""You really are a child yourself sometimes, you know...""",22
1ln56bf,n0d5y94,"""Watch your six, babe.""

""I clocked them. I got something for them.""

Even after all these years, I couldn't help but smile when she said that. I could practically see the mischievous look on her face as she prepped her maneuver.

""They're so screwed.""

She tried to cover her laugh, but I heard the telltale signs. We'd been working together for too long for me not to notice. Hell, we'd been married for nearly a decade at this point, so even if we weren't superheroes in our spare time, I probably would've expected her to laugh.

A moment later, she executed a perfect mid-air loop, and managed to come up behind the drones that had been on her tail a moment ago. With a flick of her wrists, her shoulder-mounted cannons made quick work of the drones.

""Any others?""

""None that I can spot. Looks like it's just The Tinkerer left.""

""Got a location for me?""

""Warehouse about two klicks east.""

""On it.""

""Be careful, babe. It's your turn to do bedtime story.""

""Oh, right. Dammit, can you stall?""

""I'll do my best. You know how she gets.""

""Heh, I'd rather tackle an army of drones.""

""Me and you both.""

""All right, I'll make it quick. See you soon.""

""See you soon. Love you.""

""Love you.""

I put down the headset, closed the laptop, and made sure to lock everything up out of sight. The last thing I wanted was for Gabby to find out what Mom & Dad did for work by accident.

""I think that's everything,"" I muttered to myself as I scanned the room again.

I'd always been the more cautious of the two, and the habits carried over even when I was just Dad. Everything needed to be powered down AND secured. Even if Gabby found one of the devices, she wouldn't be able to power it on or unlock it.

Satisfied that I'd cleaned up all traces of superhero life, I opened the door and walked to the living room. Gabby would be getting home from school, and that needed an entirely different kind of prep work.

-- -- -- -- --

""Daddy?""

""Yes, Gabby?""

""Where's Mommy?""

""She's at work, baby girl.""

""Again?!""

""Yes, baby girl. She got hung up at work, so she'll be home a little late.""

""I don't like it!""

""I know, I know. I wish we could both stay home and play with you all day long, but we have to work.""

""You could quit?""

""Heh, not sure that'd work.""

""Well, I still don't like it!""

She stamped her foot in that way that little kids do, expressing her utter disdain for the idea in the best way that she knew. It was cute, but I knew better than to laugh. For one, I didn't want to invalidate her feelings, and she needed to be able to express and process those feelings in a healthy manner. For another, Gabby didn't take any guff from anyone, least of all me. I'd faced down hundreds of villains over the years, but none had managed to actually give me pause the same way this six year old could.

""I hear you, baby girl. We'll make sure we spend as much time as we can with Mommy when she gets home, okay?""

""Okay!""

""Sounds like a plan. Can you go to put your backpack away and wash up? I'll prep dinner.""

Gabby did as she was told, but took her time getting up the stairs. We were past the initial frustration, so now her attention span began to wander. Parenting really was a different kind of challenge.

Seizing the opportunity, I pulled out my phone and sent a quick message.

*Bought you fifteen minutes. Prepping dinner VERY SLOWLY.*

Fortunately, my phone beeped a second later with a reply.

*Thanks. Finished up quickly, heading home. Love you*

I smiled, and wandered off to the kitchen. I had some salads to make.",23
1ln56bf,n0d6p3j,"“The Brave Defenders had spent 50 years protecting the planet from all sorts of terrible creatures and villains. Some from space. Some from Earth. And some from other planes of existence. But they have never faltered. They have never quit. They have never let us down,” the President of the United States told the world. He was speaking at a celebration Gala for the Brave Defenders who were in their 50th year of service. The original squad had long since retired, and each time one retires (or is unable to continue), a new hero takes their place. There have been twenty-seven Brave Defenders in these 50 years, and nineteen of them are in attendance today. Eight bronze busts of the eight Defenders who had died were displayed on the main stage, behind the president and the rest of the Defenders. 

Besides the twenty-seven Defenders, other heroes, past and present, are here to celebrate and enjoy a much deserved night off from hero work. Of course, if need be, they would be off in a flash, but sometimes, a little R&R is needed to continue doing what they do. 

Magma and Typhoon were the two newest members of the Brave Defenders. This party was also a welcoming introduction for them to the world. Magma was 23 years old and was taking over for War Priest, who lost his arm in a tragic fight just months ago. Typhoon was taking the place of his father, Hurricane, who was starting to lose control over his powers and needed to get out of the business before he hurt someone. 

The party was full of politicians and celebrities and CEOs and others who needed to network and be seen with others, or else their importance would be threatened. The party was covered by all the major networks and streamed live over all social media platforms. Influencer superheroes were livestreaming their battles for a few years now and this has caused some ruffles with the older generations as it seemed brash and very selfish, but the results were better polling numbers for superheroes, so the matter was squashed and now most of the newer heroes have sponsorship deals with streaming services. 

As the party waned down and people started to leave, the Brave Defender’s leader, Captain Frost, asked for Magma and Typhoon to meet him and the other Defenders in the basement for something important they needed to discuss. Captain Frost thanked the crowd and the audience for their support, as he led his newest recruits down into the basement, away from the prying eyes of the public. A representative for AlwaysOn, a streaming service, started to follow them, as Magma was partnered with them, but she was turned away. 

“No media. No streaming. No videos. No pictures,” Captain Frost told her.

“But her contract states…” the rep responded.

“Ask me if I care about a contract. Go on, please, I insist. Ask me if I care about your contract.”

The rep left without saying another word.

Captain Frost led his two new recruits down into the basement. It wasn’t anything special, concrete floors, unfinished walls, steel folding chairs and a wooden desk. 

“If you have any recording devices, you need to turn them off or your contract with us is terminated,” he said.  Magma and Typhoon both looked cautiously at each other as they pushed some invisible hidden buttons on their suits and nodded.

“All off,” Typhoon said. 

“Same,” Magma replied.

“This is your initiation meeting. We will discuss with you the one thing that binds all of us together,” Captain Frost said.

As they walked in, the other heroes were already waiting, laughing and chatting with their friends they had not seen for years. They were showing pictures on their phones of their kids or grandkids, of the housework they have been doing, and all the memories of life they have had. 

There was no podium, no glitz, no glamour, no cameras or anything else except for the heroes, their pasts, and now their future. 

“When I became a member of the Brave Defenders roughly 17 years ago, I was led to this same basement, by some of you. Things were different back then. Some things are better. Some things are worse. And some things have remained the same. Magma. Typhoon. You have some large shoes to fill, but they aren’t your shoes, you need to forge your own path. Some will disagree with it. Some will support you. But your path is your own. The Brave Defenders have always been Earth’s protectors. We have more successes than failures,” Captain Frost said.  “But we have one failure that will haunt us forever.”

The room got quiet. A small girl walked out from the back of the room, through the wall, and stood in the middle of the room. She had a ghostly visage, half shimmering, half whole, carrying a small backpack. Some of the Brave Defenders couldn’t look at her, looking down at their feet. Others had somber faces as they took in the reminder of their failure. 

“Jasmine Elmond is a unique little girl. She was visiting New York City with her parents when the Avalanche attacked. Our original four heroes arrived at the scene and battled Avalanche to a standstill. Powers, at that time, were still new. No one really knew how to control them or what their limits were. The Guardian…the Guardian decided to take a shot at Avalanche instead of helping a group of trapped civilians. The civilians didn’t make it, Avalanche was apprehended, and the term collateral damage would be the most frequently used word for the next couple of years.  What we didn’t know was that Jasmine also had some powers, they were just dormant in her.”

“HELP US,” Jasmine shouted. Her voice changed to that of an older man. “Why didn’t you save us?”  Now, her voice as a little boy.  “My leg hurts.”  And then a young woman. “Please, get us out of here!”

“I…I don’t understand,” Magma said. “Who…or what is she?”

“She is our constant reminder of our choices we make. Jasmine has the power of the dead. Some call her the literal representation of collateral damage. All of our failures end up powering Jasmine. When we have a lot of success, Jasmine gets weaker. When we fail…well, Jasmine gets stronger. We don’t know if we could ever get…well, rid of her,” Hurricane said. Both Magma and Typhoon looked at the now retired hero.  “She will always be there, looking at you, judging you, shouting at you to save the people we are supposed to protect. By joining us, you tether yourself to her.” 

“Can others see her?” Magma asked.  

Alpha Shock, one of the original members, stood up and said, “No. For some reason, she only makes herself visible to those who join The Brave Defenders. And she is rightfully and justifully angry at us. She never got to live her life because we were too careless. We didn’t prioritize the right people. We wanted to win more than anything. We wanted to show off our powers and our abilities and show the world we are the good guys. After we stopped Avalanche, we found out that three-hundred and sixteen people had died due to our careless actions.”

“Jasmine Elmond is our Scarlet Letter, our sin, our mark to wear to remind ourselves that we must always, always protect those that cannot protect themselves, no matter what,” Captain Frost said. “She will yell at you when you fail. She will be a curse. She will be your guiding star. You need to understand that she will never let you forget in order to make you stronger. We cannot defeat her nor get rid of her because we need her. We need to be better versions of our past selves.”

The room sat silent for a while. Jasmine turned and pointed at several heroes and shouted names at them. Their victims. Their losses. Their collateral damage. 

“Magma. Typhoon. This is a legacy you must accept if you want to join The Brave Defenders. If you accept, please, walk up to Jasmine, hold out your hand, and promise her you will be the protector the civilians need.  If not, turn around, and head towards the door.”",16
1ln56bf,n0d2k6v,"“ARGHH, GET BABY OFF!” The Avalanche whipped around in a frenzy, as a giggling child clung on to his beard. For all the times he’d taken blows from outer-dimensional entities, this was the most pain the giant hero had felt. A man in a red spandex suit stepped forward, trying to grab at the girl.

“Stop moving, you oaf, you’re gonna-“

**Crash**

The giant fell against an expensive-looking walnut cupboard, tearing through it and the wall behind. From the debris the little girl hopped out. She looked at Red Tights.

“I’m bored. I wanna watch TV.”

The hero glanced at another hero, a woman in a suit designed to look like a puma. She shook her head.

“Jane said no screen time for Ashley after eight. It messes with her sleep.”

Ashley throwing a fit, and feet, at her.

“I WANNA WATCH TV! I WANNA WATCH TV!”

“Ow, ow! Stop that, hey this costumes made of real- ok, fine, you get an iPad, and thirty minutes max!”

As the girl browsed through Tik-Tok, Red Tights brought a hand to his face. *Who knew they’d be defeated by a six-year old.*

1ln56bf,n0dxnft,"She looked SO innocent but looks can be deceiving.  The heroes walked with trepidation into the classroom, not entirely sure of what to expect but probably not a wholesome looking blue eyed blond 6 year old with curls. 

She looked up from her drawing and smiled. ""Oh hi.  I'm Abbi.  My teacher said you might visit me today.""

Mr Clarke, her teacher looked somewhat dishevelled and anxious.  But to look this way was normal for him or at least normal ever since Abbi joined the class.

""I drew a cat, "" Abbi continued, ""I might write a poem about the cat later.""

Samson peered at the picture with interest, and Professor Genius stared at it intensely for any clues.  Fast Freddy had already seen the drawing and was staring agape at the two children lying on the floor. The sight slowed even HIM down. ""Aw, the two boys are sleeping."" He said hopefully.
Abbi shook her head, curls and ringlets shaking ""Not sleeping, silly. Dead.  I tend to have classes to myself but Drew and Kyle snuck into the room on a dare. They insulted me.  Drew said I should draw between the lines and Kyle said cats aren't blue.  I didn't like it.""
Abbi shrugged, ""Now they can't insult me anymore.""

All three superheroes took one step closer to Abbi.

She giggled and then said ""Stay where you are if you value your life.  Make me mad and you won't have one any more.""
The last part of the sentence waa said in a singsong voice.

""How did you-?"" Professor Genius started to ask. Part scared and part intrigued.  

Abbi tapped her left temple, ""With my mind. And a lot of rage.""

Miss Jenson entered the room shaking, holding out a school dinner on a tray.  

""Ooh, yummy, lunch time!"" said Abbi, ""And my ice cream has a cherry this time, good.  Miss Jenson, already I like you better than Mrs Lane, RIP.""

Miss Jenson fake laughed nervously, set the tray down then quickly walked out of the room.

Professor Genius asked ""Abbi, what kind of music do you like?""

Samson and Fast Freddy looked at Professor Genius quizzically and he gave them a reassuring glance. 
""I'll show you my favourite music channels later, after dinner tonight if you want and we can all dance.""

Professor Genius smiled and said ""We all love to dance, don't we.  I'll ask the school office for your address and check with your parents.""

""My parents will approve it, they HAVE to.  IF I let them out of the basement!"" Abbi laughed.

Outside the school, Samson asked Professor Genius, ""What exactly are you up to? Do you have a plan?""

""Not exactly but if we tire Abbi out in her home environment with a dancing marathon so much that she falls asleep, it gives US time to BEGIN to think of one.  Or failing that, bedtime stories including ones about cats.   I'll leave most of the dancing to you two, you Samson with your Super Strength and you, Fast Freddy with your super speed. I REALLY hope we can think of something! She's already left a trail of bodies in her wake.""

Back in the classroom, Abbi smiled.  She'd just killed the school's IT guy for not being able to fix the interactive whiteboard fast enough when the net went down while she and her teacher were watching a maths PowerPoint. The janitor also had met an early demise for daring to distract her with washing the windows while she was trying to learn.

12 hours later, after fighting on a train, going on with endless shenanigans, and obstacles, I finally got onto the plane that will take me home.  
Flying peacefully, I got a call from Handler.  
""Good job, Mr. Stable. You did the impossible.

I push my spectacles up the bridge of my chiseled nose, and fit my grey and black striped fedora onto my crown of lush, golden blonde hair.

The coffers have still not recovered.

""Oh okay sweetie.... be safe.... okay?"" I try to keep the concern out of my voice. He hasn't left the house this excited since he last had friends in elementary school. Right then, it hits me. I'm looking at my 35 year old son who has no friends, no job, and can barely get himself out of bed. Where did we go wrong?

""BE SURE TO TELL FATHER!"" He says as he tries to fit his fat, disgusting body through the doorway. The greasy hair coming from his balding head leaves a wet spot on the back of the shitty leather jacket he got off the internet. He even had those shitty mall swords he got from the Asian shop under his jacket, like he was trying to hide them. I guess it was time to tell his father, I'm sure this would go well. 

""Chett go somewhere?"" My husband says, carrying a handfull of oversized feathers with him into the living room. 

""Yeah he says he is on an ""important hunt"""", I'm just glad it gets him out of the house for Halloween.

He looked at this screen and then back at me, a few times more than I think was necessary for the question.

""Ah, Mr. Can...please just give me a moment...""

""No.""

""What?"" he blinked even more at me as I looked him calmly in the eyes.

Did in not occur to him that being mindless might be a problem? A problem not only for him but for the rest of us?

""Does it not occur to you that knowing something *relevent* before you talk to us might be helpful?""

1lml9bp,n08eue4,"I come to in a box the size of a cheap coffin, the air like frostbite on my gums.

It’s so dark I can’t see my own fingers, not that I can feel them anyways. I can’t feel much of anything, actually.

*First breath: nothing.*

*Second breath: still nothing.*

*Third: Oh. Right.*

I’m not breathing.

---

I bang on the door with the side of my fist. It sounds like knocking on a wall, muffled and pitiful. The echo comes back: thin metal, cold rivets, cheap insulation.

Then comes the slam of a latch outside. I hear a squeak, a muttered curse. The rattle of keys, a hand trembling against steel. The hatch swings wide.

The light hits my eyes like acid. I hiss and squint, and that’s when I realize my eyes shouldn’t work, not after whatever put me here.

The kid staring back at me can’t be more than twenty, skin pale under the morgue’s strip lights. He’s wearing scrubs. They’re not clean.

He shrieks when I sit up.

---

“Easy.” I say. Or try to. My voice scrapes out like gravel poured through a drainpipe. “Hey. Hey. It’s okay.”

He’s backed halfway across the tile already, shoulder blades pinned to a cabinet. He’s holding up a clipboard like a shield.

I swing my legs over the slab and they smack the floor like thawed meat.

“Question,” I rasp, teeth clacking because my jaw’s a little loose. “No one’s ever woken up in your freezer before?”

He stares at me like I’m the second coming of every horror film ever made. Then he swallows. “Not… not anyone I autopsied yesterday.”

I run a hand across my chest. There are stitches. A Y-shaped line. I poke one seam and my fingers come away slick with something I don’t want to think about.

“Autopsied,” I echo. “So you… cut me up.”

“I-I-I’m sorry!” he blurts. “You were— you were dead! Your chart said D.O.A., massive trauma, no pulse, no brain—”

“Yeah.” I press a hand to my temple. Something crunches. I decide not to touch it again. “Guess that didn’t stick.”

---

I take in the room. Cold storage units, big metal door, tile that’s seen more fluids than a slaughterhouse. It all smells like bleach and old sorrow. I remember the crash. I remember the pain. I remember…

Wait. I remember everything.

“Hey, kid,” I say, and my voice comes out softer this time. He flinches anyway. “What day is it?”

He hesitates. Then: “Thursday.”

“Yesterday was Wednesday?”

He nods.

“Which means I died on Wednesday.” I crack a grin, feel my lips stretch wrong. “Huh. Never made it to payday.”

---

He starts crying. Big, quiet tears rolling down his cheeks, clipboard clutched like a teddy bear. I want to tell him it’s okay, but I don’t even know if that’s true.

I flex my fingers. They move, but the feeling’s like thick fog rolling through empty streets. I’m moving. I’m thinking. I’m dead.

Somewhere deep in my ribcage, a knot tightens. Not a heartbeat, I’m pretty sure that’s gone, but something like it. A thread of humanity, dangling on frayed sinew.

*Don’t lose that,* I tell myself. *Hold onto it.*

---

“Got a mirror?” I ask.

He gestures weakly at a metal tray by the sink. I shuffle over. My reflection greets me: sunken eyes, gray skin, stitches. The same old me, just… less alive.

I flash myself a rotting grin. “Still handsome.”

The kid sobs harder.

I put a cold hand on his trembling shoulder. “Hey. It’s fine. You did your job. I just didn’t stay dead. Must be a fluke.”

He tries to laugh. It comes out like a hiccup instead.

“Come on.” I say, turning to the door. The night’s waiting out there. So is whatever I’ve got to figure out next. “You wanna fill out the paperwork for undead or should we just call this one even?”

He doesn’t answer. He just watches as I limp out, hospital gown hanging open, stitches crisscrossed like a jigsaw puzzle no one bothered to finish.

But I’m not meat on a slab.

1lml9bp,n09jz5o,"""First time?"" I sat up from the morgue freezer to appraise the panicked young man who heard my incessant knocking and liberated me from my cold, metal coffin. [""The other humans never told you about me?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/12p6ko5/wp_i_pulled_myself_together_and_got_up_the/jglfm5w/)

""I don't know you!"" He exclaimed, flailing backwards and almost tripping over himself.

""You never seen anyone wake up in this morgue before? Are you new around these parts? First day at work?"" I clambered out of the freezer and landed with a wet thud on my appendages. ""Here, it says Elliot Livera, so why would you not know me?""

""Never,"" the human muttered, clumsily falling to the floor and backing away on his butt until he hit a wall. ""Dead people stay dead. ""Dead people don't heal,"" he was pointing to my chest, where a deep gash showed signs of mending itself. ""Dead people don't...don't sprout tentacles.""

""Oh? These?"" I waggled one tentacle, feeling my muscles twitch and come back to life. Then, a second one. ""You see..."" I squinted to read his name tag. ""Daniel, I'm not a dead man. I'm something of a local deity around these parts. Death is but a temporary inconvenience to me.""

He stared at me like I wielded daggers in every limb and could stab him to death. ""Don't kill me. Don't eat me. I'll do anything!""

""What do you think I am? A man-eating monster? O—Oh."" I stopped myself mid-sentence, running my fingers across my face. Feeling a wound that stretched from temple to jawline. Touching the extra eyes that had yet to open. Of course, my human guise was off. There wasn't any way I could maintain it while unconscious. Clearly, this was his first time seeing a corpse wake up in the morgue. His first time meeting this...silly old regular here. His first time conversing with a naked eldritch horror.

""We had a bad start. You're new to this, and I'm probably still a wee bit tipsy. A wee bit drunk. You said you'll do anything. I say we start again,"" I tried sitting on an autopsy table only to recoil and jump away from how cold it was to my skin. Ah, the disadvantages of assuming a physical vessel on earth. ""Hello human, welcome to Innsmouth. Are we in Innsmouth? Did I crawl too far from home in a drunken stupor yet again?"" Too late to put those words back into my mouth now, so might as well keep rambling on. ""My ID says Elliot Livera. That's a civilian identity. You...don't press that emergency button. This is business as usual.""

""No, its not!"" He was suddenly shouting, one hand still hovering above the big red emergency button. ""Nothing about this is usual!""

""It is,"" Doctor Mendez sighed, as she happened to walk by. ""It is the 3rd time this month you got yourself killed while intoxicated, Lord Elvari. At this rate, perhaps I really should tell the director to include dealing with you in our standard operating procedures.""

""What do you mean I'm not already in your standard operating procedure? What do they teach in medical school?""

""Human anatomy,"" Mendez didn't skip a beat. ""We're pathologists, not marine biologists. For the love of my god, Elvari, have you considered staying a little sane and sober, and away from a morgue instead?""

1lml9bp,n0cffy3,"So here’s the thing they don’t tell you about politics:
It’s worse than being dead.

---

It started when I realized people will follow anyone who stands at a podium and says, *“I’ve got the guts to tell it like it is.”*

Well, I *literally* have my guts sewn up with fishing line. Seemed like I’d have an edge.

I registered under “Independent,” because, trust me, both parties sent “representatives” to feel me out. The suits wanted a puppet, a symbol, a man of the people they could parade around while they pulled the strings backstage.

I told them they’d have better luck pulling strings on a bag of cement.

---

The worst was the necromancer.
Some weaselly little “consultant” from a shady super PAC.
Showed up at my rented office in a pinstripe suit that cost more than my entire apartment back when I was alive.

He laid out some runes. Lit a few candles. Started chanting about *“controlling the soul of the returned.”*

I let him get halfway through before I flicked him in the forehead. He went cross-eyed, keeled over, and pissed himself on my welcome mat.

Turns out, you can’t hex a dead man who didn’t come back by the rules.

Being one-of-a-kind zombie has its perks.

---

So the campaign slogged on.
Endless rallies. Bad coffee. Reporters sniffing for dirt, as if being dead isn’t enough scandal on its own.

I gave the usual stump speech:

*“I know what it’s like to be the forgotten. I know what it’s like to be used up and thrown out. Hell, I woke up on a slab because this system doesn’t give a damn if you’re alive or dead. Let’s fix it!”*

They clapped. They donated. They shook my cold hand.

But every time I sat in a back room with the so-called “handlers”, the pitch was always the same:

*“You’ll vote how we say, right? You’ll stick to the lines, right?”*

Every time, I gave them the same smile I gave the necromancer.
Didn’t stop them from trying.

---

Then came the rally in Pennsylvania.

Big outdoor stage. Flags flapping. Me, up there in a thrift store suit they tried to dress up with a designer tie.

I was halfway through a joke about how I still pay taxes even though I’m technically a corpse when I saw the glint in the scaffolding across the field.

Sniper.

Old instincts, or maybe old nerves that never learned to stay dead, kicked in.

But in that split second, I thought: *What’s the funniest thing I could do right now?*

I remembered that old footage. Trump, 2024, blood pouring down his face and ear, fist in the air, roaring “Fight!” while the crowd lost its mind.

An image that’ll live longer than most of us.

So I thought: Why not ?

*Let’s one-up him.*

---

The shot cracked.

Hit me square between the eyes.

My skull snapped back, felt like a lightbulb going out. Vision flickered. Then snapped right back on.

I staggered. The crowd screamed. Secret Service, or local cops, or whoever the hell they’d hired for me, all tackled each other behind the barricades.

I wiped a chunk of something from my temple, then looked at it. Grayish, chunky.

Brain matter. Cute.

Then I stuck my finger through the hole for dramatic effect. Felt the bullet rattling around somewhere behind my left ear.

Grinned at the nearest news camera.

And I clenched my free hand into a fist, blood and all, lifted it high over my head, and croaked out in my best dead-man rasp:

**“FIGHT!”**

Just like Trump did, except with a hole in my head.

---

They dragged me offstage, patched the hole with duct tape and a bit of gauze from someone’s glove box. The bullet is probably still rattling around somewhere behind my left ear, knocking up against memories that don’t feel real anymore.

I can still think straight, or at least as straight as I ever did.

But that was the last rally.

---

Next morning, I sat in my motel room, staring at my reflection.

Half my scalp was stapled shut.

My campaign manager was pounding on the door, ranting about “polling numbers” and “historical moments.”

I just laughed.

I laughed until the staples itched and my stitches pulled.

Politics has too many strings.

Too many people who think they can tug you around.

The only one who should be allowed to pull your strings… is you.

---

So I dropped out the next day.

Posted a video online: me, shirtless, Y-incision scar on display, bullet hole still crusty.

“I’ve had enough of people trying to keep me on a leash,” I said. “Find yourself another puppet. I’ve got better things to do than play make-believe with the living.”

I saluted the camera with my half-rotted fingers.

Signed off.

---

Funny thing is, my numbers spiked even more *after* I quit.

Whatever I did during and after that rally, that’s about as real as it gets, right?

But me ?

I’m done with that stage.

I’m not some symbol. I’m not your martyr. I’m not your saviour's second coming.

I’m just me, dead, breathing or not.

And that’s still the most alive I’ve ever felt.",16
1lml9bp,n0ca4f2,"The rest of the story:

---

Turns out, the world doesn’t give a damn whether you’re alive or dead.

The landlord still wants rent.

The bills still stack up on the counter.

And the barista at the corner shop still misspells your name on the cup, though, fair enough, my name *is* harder to spell when you slur it through half-rotted vocal cords.

---

I’ve been back for… what? Two weeks? I’m not sure how time’s supposed to feel when you don’t sleep. I lie down sometimes, just to pretend. I close my eyes. Count cracks in the ceiling. Listen to the way the pipes groan like old bones.

No heartbeat under my ribs. No pulse at my neck. But the thoughts still come. I still remember my mother’s voice when I told her I got that first office job, how proud she sounded. I remember the drone of the copy machine, the stale coffee in the break room, the taste of birthday cake we all pretended to like.

I don’t remember ever feeling *alive* then.

Ironic, huh?

---

I hunted for answers at first. Hit the hospital records. Talked to a pathologist who kept crossing himself when he thought I couldn’t see. Looked up weird folk tales, made a library card under a fake name, “John Doe,” cliché as hell.

I found nothing.

No secret government experiment. No necromancer in a hoodie. No ritual gone wrong.

Just a John Doe who didn’t stay dead.

---

Living like this… It’s the little things that mess with you.

Food? Doesn’t taste like anything. A burger might as well be cardboard dipped in motor oil.

Thirst? Gone.

Bathroom? Nah.

Shaving? Kinda pointless, but I do it out of habit, until I nick my cheek and realize there’s no blood, just a slow ooze like stale paint.

That one took a while to get used to.

---

But there’s good parts, too.

I don’t get tired. I don’t feel pain. When the landlord banged on my door yelling about back rent, I just stood there, stitches on my chest peeking out from my undershirt. He got real quiet. Said we could work something out.

For once in my sorry life, I’m not afraid of the boss, the bank, the next bill.

I’m not afraid of anything, really, except rotting away faster than I can patch myself up.

---

I’m walking home from the grocery store, yeah, I still shop sometimes. Helps me blend in, pushing a cart full of canned soup I’ll never eat, when I catch my reflection in the window of a laundromat.

It’s me. Same tired eyes. Same too-thin shoulders. Same dumb haircut I never bothered to fix.
But there’s something else there, too.

A spark.

Like maybe, when I crawled out of that freezer, I left behind more than just my heartbeat. I left behind the part of me that let life grind me down to a paycheck and a death certificate.

I tap the glass. Grin at myself, all cracked lips and crooked teeth.

“Guess dying was the best thing that ever happened to you, huh?”

My reflection doesn’t answer. But if it could, I think it’d laugh.

---

Back home, I sit on the couch, lights off. I listen to the fridge hum. To the wind scrape past the window. To the faint buzz of streetlights on the corner.

No pulse. No breath. No hunger.

But a second chance all the same.

I don’t know what I am now.

I don’t know what I’m meant to do.

But for the first time in a long time, I think I’m ready to live.",24
1lml9bp,n0edfyb,"You ever get so bored that you break into a necromancer’s rat-infested basement to read his private stash of forbidden grimoires?

No?

Well. I do.

I tell myself it’s practical.

The campaign’s over (technically), but the brainless (ha !) fans wrote me in anyway.

Now I’m the new President-elect.


And while the living argue about whether the Constitution says anything about *corpses* in the Oval Office, I’m here, picking a padlock, with a small piece of bone, fell out of my body due to the assassination attempt, because I’m rotting a little faster than I’d like. 

And, well… dead flesh doesn’t fix itself.

The necromancer's basement is the exact same thing I expected it to be :

Mildew wallpaper. 

Candles everywhere.

A dead chicken nailed to the door, probably for “protection.” 

Cute.

He nearly fainted when he saw me, hole still puckered in my forehead from that rally.

“You–” he squeaks, pressed against a shelf of dusty skulls.

“Yeah, me.” I say. “Relax. I’m not here to flick your forehead again. Unless you try anything.”

He tries anyway. Whispers some nonsense, waves his hands.

I just stare.

Nothing happens, because, you know, *one of a kind.*

He squeaks again. I tell him to sit. He sits.

---

I rummage through his garbage until I find it:

A thick leather-bound thing, wrapped in chains, sealed with some shimmering runes.

The title’s in a language that looks like it crawled out of a grave worse off than me.

“Don’t touch that!” he hisses, but I’m already flattening my palm on the cover.

It’s warm.

It *shouldn’t* be warm.

The runes flare, hiss, and sizzle out like cheap neon. 

The chains clatter to the floor.

The necromancer squeaks again.

(He squeaks a lot.)

---

The book opens itself, pages yellow as old bone.
Diagrams. Ritual circles. Smeared sketches of figures with too many eyes, wings, claws.

I squint and read aloud:

> *“A heart and mind of the undying.*

>*A vessel never claimed by death.*

> *The faith of the living, a choir of worship.*

> *In sacrifice, ascend.”*

I tap the page with a half-rotted finger.
“Huh.”

---

Behind me, the TV buzzes from the necromancer’s corner. He’s one of those doomsday types, always has the news on.

Big headline:

> **ZOMBIE PRESIDENT-ELECT DECLARED BY HISTORIC WRITE-IN VOTE**

I see crowds on the screen.

People waving signs with my face on them.

Kids dressed like me for Halloween, still.

Commentators arguing whether I’m technically “immortal.”

Some are crying. Some are laughing.

A few are chanting my name.

Worship, huh?

---

I close the book. It makes a little sigh, like a grave settling.

The necromancer is shaking now. He knows that look in my eyes.

He starts muttering about balance, about consequences, about mortal limits.

I lean in, grin wide enough to split a few stitches.

“Relax, buddy. Who said I wanted to be President forever?”

He doesn’t get it. I barely do.

But something cold and vast and *hungry* flickers in my dead gut.

---

So I stand there, under flickering basement lights, thumb pressed to the page that says I just need one thing:

A brain and heart of an immortal.

I check my pulse. Still none.

My heart? Technically still in there, stitched to my ribs.

A corpse nobody can kill.

And all those living folks, ready to bow, vote, or scream my name from the steps of the Capitol.

Faith is faith, right?

---

Maybe it’ll work.

Maybe it won’t.

But if you asked me what’s funnier than a dead man becoming President...

*It’s a dead man using democracy as a stepping stone to godhood.*

---

The necromancer squeaks one last time:
“Wh-what will you do if you succeed?”

I grin.

“Guess I’ll finally get some rest. Or not.”

I snap the book shut under my arm, squeeze his shoulder on my way out.

“Keep the place warm for me. Might need your basement for the ritual.”

---

Outside, it’s snowing. The streets glow with neon and campaign signs people still haven’t torn down.

""My apologies, Ammon, but while I saw beastmen...a Woolly Mammoth one is something I haven't heard about."" the cleric says.  
""Oh, no worries. We live in the Northern Eye, and rarely move out."" I say.  
The cleric pales, while the rogue actually starts praying.  
""T-T-The Northern Eye? The Never-Ending Storm the size of a continent? Y-You live there?!"" the cleric stutters.  
I nod.  
""That's why I am so fluffy."" I chuckle.  
The two took some time to calm down, while the fighter was laughing at their antics.  
After a good few minutes, they were ready to talk.

  
""Let's do a dungeon run in a mid-tier dungeon, okay?  
I want to test out your skills."" the cleric says.  
""Sure."" I smile, thinking it is normal.  
So, we went to a dungeon nearby.  
An hour later, I watched as my cuties, some Ice Spirits, and Snowflake demons chewed through the wyvern boss' body.  
The cleric was staring at me, as if I was a monster, while the rogue was checking out the Totem I slammed into the floor.  
""How? You didn't even move?!"" the cleric says.  
I chuckle.

  
""We Woolly Mammoths are usually barbarians, warriors, fighters, monks and so on, taking the physical path.  
I...I had another talent, so I made sure I can do everything my clansmen can do, but with magic."" I say.  
""But you just cleared a dungeon in an hour, that usually takes 2 days for an experienced team.  
Also, you used all the elements, summoned at least 19 different types of summons, and your shamanic buffs were in the hundreds!"" he shouts.  
""Well, I thought you wanted to see what I can do, so I showed a small part of my skills...otherwise only ice magic could have frozen this entire dungeon."" I say.  
""HOW DID YOU MASTER SO MANY THINGS?!"" he roared.  
""Now, cleric, you are rude..."" the fighter started.  
""I am 932 years old, me ma would beat me up if I didn't master this many things."" I smile.  
The cleric sighed, and the rogue giggled.  
""Fine. Welcome to the team. First thing you have to do: buy us drinks at the inn."" he says, leaving.  
I nod happily, and follow them out of the dungeon.  
Finally, I have a herd outside the Eye...I can start my adventure!",137
1lmll1r,n08wdt9,"""Jake, you're the DM, is this even allowed?"" Randy, who currently played a human cleric, pointed at Carol and Gavin. ""When was Wooly Mammoth Beast man added to lists of playable character races?""

""When I asked nicely,"" Gavin replied. ""Playing human, elves, or dwarves is boring. They're all human-shaped, but with different heights.""

""You could have played an orc, like Carol,"" Randy pointed at her female orc fighter character sheet.

""That's just a green-skinned human,"" Gavin shrugged. ""Also, reminds me too much of she-hulk. I wanted to be special.""

""Yea, why don't you ask to roleplay a Ninja Pirate Robot Zombie?"" Randy was getting annoyed. ""Look, woolly mammoths don't exist in  Neverwinter. Much less Wooly Mammoth beast man. What's next, are we going to allow vampire eldritch mind flayer squids?""

""Actually great idea!"" Gavin was genuinely thrilled, completely missing the sarcasm in Randy's voice. ""That's totally going to be my next character for our next campaign.""

""Randy, think of this as flavor text,"" Jake sighed. ""Gavin still has to follow typical Beast man rules.""

""Fine, fine,"" Randy waved his hand about impatiently. ""Okay, now we have a fighter, wizard and cleric. Let's move on to questing.""

""Let's take this quest to befriend the poor lonely eldritch god,"" Carol pulled out a homebrew source book. ""This could be fun. Instead of combat, we'd be competing to create the best foods, travel all around the world to collect rare ingredients...""

Randy facepalmed upon seeing the title and the cover page full of tentacles.""....Collected Tales of Elvari? The...who wrote this?""

""We can pick a different scenario if you don't like this one,"" Carol opened her bag to reveal a few more homebrew source books. ""This one actually has werewolf pirates and vampire ninjas. It has several seafaring scenarios and—""

""Before things get even weirder, could we please stick to the current scenario?"" Randy pleaded, figuring an adventure where the only unusual thing was a Woolly mammoth beast man master wizard with 500 years of experience couldn't get any more bizarre than whatever homebrew quests Carol had in her bag.

Until the first hostile creature the adventuring party encountered was a Xenomorph.

1ln5lh5,n0d4rgf,"It's a small thing to eat a hot meal. Be it the eggs, bacon, or waffles, the sight in and of itself is a welcome reprieve from the chaos as I set my blood-stained duffle bag of the booth and stare into my shaking gloves. They're stained with blood, and I'm missing my two smallest fingers on my right hand. 

But I'm alive as the waitress, who had ushered me inside, finally appears at the table with a worried expression and note-pad. Her voice is quiet despite the distant thunder of falling artillery. ""Are you alright, sir?"" 

The best I can do is to point my still bleeding and mangled hand toward her while doing my best to keep my gaze from blurring. ""Just get me the waffle. The White House is gone, and all my friends are dead. I'll pay you anything you want.""

""..."" 

Her silence spoke volumes as she began to pen the order. It was just me and the sound of the pen on paper as I closed my eyes tight and fought the urge to scream. This couldn't be real; I must've died in that forest with everyone else.

""Do you want coffee with that?""

""Yes- please."" The sound of tearing paper cut the silence as I looked up to see her gaze turn toward a distant chef in the rear kitchen. The man's fuzzy white mustache spoke to the ancient wisdom he held. 

""I need an All-Star-Special!"" The chef nodded before disappearing, and the sounds of clattering kitchen utensils began. 

With the matter settled, she refocused her attention and sat down hard on the opposite side of the booth with the torn ticket in hand. ""This one's free if you can tell me what's going on out there.""

I stared at the table for a moment and studied its long grain as sorrow threatened to break my weary bearing. That trace memory of the expedition's second day and the family hung from a tree terrorized my mind. And yet I whispered under my breath. ""They're not taking prisoners.""

""Who?""

""Bandits, aliens, it doesn't matter, it's hell."" Again; the din of that pen rolling across the paper rattled as I cast a glance toward the midnight forest beyond. It'd been eighty days, but it feels like years since I've been able to just sit in the somber quiet.

But it was the grim sigh from the hostess that drew my attention as she set down her notes onto the table. ""We can't stay here then."" 

I looked down in shame; we'd failed. Then again; there was only so much that we could do if even the waffle house was closing.",7

I lay my shovel on the ground, staring into the open grave. The same grave I’ve seen so many times. The same body I’ve seen so many times. I check my watch again.

23:56

Tonight is different. I don’t yet know why, but I feel it. An ordinary person would feel this way, knowing what I am about to do. But this usually is not a task I fear. I can feel the sweat dripping down, my palms shaking, my legs trembling. Something is not right tonight.

23:57

My eyes dart from the watch to the blade set beside the headstone. Its grip is firm - a small and familiar comfort. My hands steady as I feel my resolve return. Despite the anxiety, I am sure of my success. I’ve done this every night.

23:58

I move into position. Blade held high over the decayed body. Just as ever. Just as always. Yet that feeling comes back. As I stare at the corpse I feel dread. And yet there is no explanation. What is different!?

23:59

Did I forget something? My hands falter, I’m losing grip. I fight to keep it steady, but the blade is slipping free. I have no choice. Before the sword escapes my grasp I plunge it straight into the lifeless corpse. And nothing. Until.

There is a monster hiding under my bed. 

When I was a child, my parents dismissed it as delusions. I was afraid of the dark and the unknown. The line between fantasy and reality was blurred. When I grew up, I'd realize it wasn't there.

Dad took my hand and crouched down. I followed him because I knew we wouldn't see it. I knew it was there because of the whispers. Its coarse voice echoed throughout the room. It caused me to shake in my bed.

In response to this, Dad sat next to me and told me he heard nothing. I held onto him because the monster's words were hurtful. He said that no one would ever love me. He said that I wasn't worthy of love. Worst of all, he said that I was lying to everyone.

That caused a huge panic in my parents. I went from charming boyish fears to psychological disorder. They took me to a therapist who talked to me about my life. They arranged for a ton of parent teach conferences and called other parents to ask how I was doing. Nothing made sense to anyone.

I had many friends at school. A few kids were mean, but I wasn't bullied. My grades were fine. I loved my parents, and I loved my siblings. I was generally happy and enjoyed playing baseball, fishing, and reading. The therapist said that I was extremely well-adjusted. The monster under my bed was concerning. 

As a teenager, they decided that I had a generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed pills. I decided to lie and say it helped. In reality, I learned to kill the monster when I woke up. 

It attached itself to the top of the bed frame near the headboard wherever it went. It was the size of my pinky, and it was vulnerable to the pocket knife that I carried with me. I killed it every morning. I learned to enjoy hearing it scream.

This escalated our little war. It began to get specific with its threats and truths. I started to kill it slower and slower. When I went to college, I disguised this activity as part of a morning prayer, but my roommates caught on. They thought I was just weird. 

I moved out on my own as soon as I could. I began prying it off the bed and holding it on the table stabbing it. Lighting the oven, I burned and boiled it alive. It became a game of mine to kill it.

""You are lying to everyone. I know what you really are. I know why you are ashamed. I know why you will never be happy. I know why you will never truly love someone.""

Those are the words it speaks now. A part of me wonders if it speaks the truth. If it is true, the shame would be too great to bare. As such, I keep killing it. I have to go through this to feel safe and content. 

Safe and content. Yes, that is exactly what I feel. I am fine with my life as it is and how it will go. I am safe, content, and alone.

1lmzrkj,n0ckt4y,"I look at my backyard, waiting.  
He should be here soon.  
I murder a person every single day...but it is the same person each day.  
Does that make me a serial killer? Or simply a murderer?  
Also...is it murder if it is out of self-defense?  
""Honeeey, I am here."" the voice echoes, as someone enters my backyard.  
He is here...again.

  
""Can't you give up, already?  
I said no."" I say.  
""Come on! We have been together for 5 years!  
Just let me take some blood samples, and maybe an egg or two, and I will clone you, Jess!"" he says.  
I shoot him.  
At this point, after just 10 days, I went from never having fired a shot, to precisely hitting him right between his eyes.  
He falls like a sack of potatoes...then sinks into the ground.  
I sigh.  
He will be back.

  
Early in the morning, I wake up startled, by sizzling sounds.  
I go to the kitchen, to see him cooking bacon.  
""Making your favorite..."" he starts, but I shoot him in the head.  
He falls onto the counter, but disappears before he could truly touch it.  
I sigh.  
Eating the bacon...I groan.  
Why is it so tasty?  
A bit later, he knocks on my door...again.

  
""I won't give up. You will be mine. Clone or real..."" he grins, holding chocolate and flowers.  
I look up, where I installed a camera.  
Dude was a researcher, and clearly succeeded in perfect cloning, and I...  
I am live-streaming my murder-spree.  
I know they think it is a comedy show, or something, and not real, but I hope the government has more insight, and will realize what is happening.  
And then, they will go to seize his technology.  
""Bye, Adam."" I say, shooting him again, he disappears, and I take the flowers, and chocolate, taking them inside.  
If he wasn't obsessed with my body, and cloning me...he would have been a good boyfriend.

1lmy18x,n0bhoz1,"A distant door slammed. Chuckling, you lifted your head to get a better whiff and inhaled deeply. 

Adrenaline. It has such a sweet yet sour scent to it. Combined with that of sweat, and it was a potent, heady mix. So much so you could almost taste that unmistakable odour - fear. The note always gets them going. Right now, their pupils will be dilating and blood will rushing to their extremities, ready to run. With your next breath, you savour it, close your eyes, and start to focus. 

Listening intently, you hear as that gentle rhythmical heart beat begins to accelerate. A strong firm pulsation.This one must be young and healthy. Crouching down, you place your fore-hoof on the floor and wait. Within moments you feel the vibrations of their footsteps through the stone  

Light steps, cautious. They were almost... meticulous. Planned. Female? No. Too sure footed. A young male. Well disciplined. Confident. You quickly notice there was no jangling of buckles. He must have good quality sandals. Aristocracy or nobility perhaps? How exciting - it had been quite some time since a prince crossed the threshold. 

With a grin, you realise this one might have some semblance of intelligence - the rich usually do. He may actually put up a decent fight. You wonder what weapons he carries. They say that the pen is mightier than the sword so perhaps this one thought to map out the labyrinth in some way as he walks. Very few ever seemed to work out that escaping was just as important as finding you. 

Hopefully he wasn't such a fool as the last person. She brought a bow and arrow of all things! With so many tight corridors and turns, she had barely drawn it back before you tore her head off. Definitely too stupid to deserve more of a battle from me. Such an insult of a sacrifice. King Minos had been lazy with his selection of that one. Unsurprising. She was number 13 after all. You'd made your dissatisfaction known that year, by casting a drought across Crete for her.

Standing back up, you stretch. A low rumbling escapes your lips. The shadows of your horns dance across the ceiling and for a moment, you enjoy watching the flicker of the torch flames that cast them. After a moment you decide it was time. Letting out an almighty roar, you signal to this new human. The hunt has begun and this Minotaur is out for blood.",13
1lmster,n0afyz0,"""No, no, you're not listening,"" Mrs. Hexim says. ""The thing that stole my purse wasn't a monster. It was a human."" 

The Sheriff's red eyes widen. ""Impossible. There hasn't been a human sighting in over seventeen years."" 

Mrs. Hexim crosses her tentacle arms. ""I know what I saw. Pasty white skin. Stubby little hands. The whole bit."" 

The Sheriff flips his notebook open and begins writing. ""Continue."" 

""Well, I was just walking down Main Street when I saw that horrific thing walking towards me and smiling. I know how dangerous humans are, how a single touch from them can give us incurable diseases, so I froze in place, hoping it wouldn't notice me."" 

""And then what happened?"" 

""It told me to give it my purse, which I did immediately.""

""If it really was a human, then you did the right thing. Nothing disarms them faster than giving them what they want.""

Mrs. Nexim sighs. ""There's no if. It was a human."" 

A panicked voice comes through the Sheriff's walkie. ""Sheriff, come in, Sheriff.""

The Sheriff grabs the walkie, puts it up to his mouth, and clicks the side button. ""What's going on? You sound flustered."" 

""We've got someone here claiming to be a purse snatcher."" 

""Okay, and what's the problem?"" 

""They're human, sir."" 

The Sheriff's stomach drops. ""I-I'll be right there."" He looks at Mrs. Nexim and says, ""Stay here,"" then exits the room, with his hand on his gun. He walks down the hallway, his heart pounding in his ears as he nears the front desk. *It's probably just kids playing a prank. Humans can't possibly be back.*

The Sheriff's eyes widen as he turns the corner, and mutters, ""Holy shit."" 

The human looks at the Sheriff and waves. ""Hi there."" It is about five feet tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. 

The Sheriff draws his gun and signals the other three officers to draw theirs as well. ""What business do you have here, human?"" 

The human puts their hands up and says, ""Wo, just take it easy, man. I felt bad about taking the tentacle lady's purse earlier today and figured I should do the right thing and return it.""

""You can put the purse down and lie on the ground."" 

""Okay, but can you just lower your guns first?""

""That wasn't a request!"" The Sheriff yells. 

The human starts crying. ""This isn't fun anymore. I want to go home."" 

""I'm sorry, but I don't think you're going to be able to do that.""",27
1lmster,n0afzks,"""No, no, no. This is all a big misunderstanding."" The human lowers its hands and steps forward. ""Here, I can prove it."" It reaches for its face.

A gunshot echoes through the precinct, and blood begins to squirt from the human's chest.

The Sheriff's head snaps to the officer who fired the gun. ""What the hell was that, Davis?""

Officer David drops the gun, his arms shaking. ""I-I didn't know what to do. It was coming towards us. And it looked so vicious.

Two demons in their early teens rush into the precinct with their phones out, presumably recording.

One of them runs to the human shouting, ""You shot Jimmy! How could you shoot Jimmy?""

""No, stay back, kids,"" the Sheriff orders as he walks towards them. ""Humans are carriers of disease. The shortest touch could kill you.""

The yellow demon looks up at the Sheriff with tears in his eyes. ""He's not a human, you idiot. He's a shape-shifter. This was supposed to be a prank.""

1lmmz72,n08xut2,"Alyssa caught dozens of stares as she followed her new party leader through the city gates. The young man had the dignity to hold his head high despite the attention, although he did a poor job of not looking nervous. A bead of sweat had formed on his brow and was slowly sliding down his face. Not that her other two party members, the mage and the cleric, did much better. Poor Cicely looked about ready to bolt, and Renault kept wringing his hands within the wide sleeves of his robes.

For Alyssa’s part… well, she was used to the stares. Murmurs of “Black Hand” and “Assassin” followed her wherever she went. No, the only thing that bothered her was how those same murmurs and stares now marred her first party with the same brush. It had been one of her main reasons for never joining one. Like it or not, she had a reputation now, and that reputation would stain whoever she came into contact with. 

“Ma’am,” Kent said after a few minutes of walking, turning back to get her attention while ignoring the watching townsfolk. “If you’d like, I can head into the Guild Hall to turn in our quest while you and the others find an inn.” 

A small smile tugged at Alyssa’s lips as she looked up at the much taller but far weaker young man. Kent was a good sort, a classic knight in shining armor. Despite still only being level one, he’d managed to get both Alyssa herself and his own party out of that dungeon. A fact that Alyssa would be eternally grateful for… and eternally embarrassed.

Alyssa knew what Kent was actually doing here. He was giving her an opportunity to save face by not walking into the Guide Hall with her new party to report that she’d been saved by a bunch of brand-new adventurers. She, however, didn’t consider it a shame whatsoever — embarrassing, sure, but not shameful. Dungeons were chaotic at the best of times, and even a weak one like she’d been scouting might occasionally decide to make someone part of the adventure.

When Kent’s party had entered the dungeon with her still present inside, the core had apparently decided to make *her* part of his quest. Scooping her up and placing her in a cage that was impossible to break out of — at least, from the inside. And upon seeing the party meant to save her… well, Alyssa thought that her luck had finally run out. It had taken Kent’s heroics, Renault’s skill at ward breaking, and Cicely’s timely healing to save her. And for that, Alyssa owed the group her life and her loyalty.

For a moment, Alyssa closed her eyes, reaffirming her previous decision to stay with this group. She heard the murmured whispers of “Black Hand” around her, and she could practically smell the wreak of condescension on the other adventurers milling around the Guild Hall. Level one adventurers were good for nothing than scorn, after all. But for Alyssa, her new friends were heroes in the making. Each and every one of them was destined to create legends far greater than her own. She was just happy to be able to tag along.

Opening her eyes once more, Alyssa met Kent’s gaze. “No. We’ll all go and turn in our quests. Together.”

Kent smiled, his joy outshining every stare and whisper. “Glad to hear it,” he said, turning. “Let’s head inside.”

She is literally the Avatar of the Goddess of Light, a Chosen One that can become a Goddess when need arises.  
Why is she bothering me?

After the herb gathering mission, they got to F rank finally, and chose a goblin lair cleaning mission.

1lmmz72,n0a5ma8,"I sighed as the warrior asked, or rather, demanded me answers his query. Hansel is a good man, far better than most I've met in my line of work, but I also know that he tend to jump the gun when things looked morally dire to all. 

And by all means, he has every right to be very, very cautious about me. The lone wolf of the guild, the solitary scope amid the thickets, the Black Hand of The Abyss. My rifle has filled enough graves to turn a farm into a forest of crosses, the lake a river of blood. By all means, I am a few steps away from being declared a persona non grata if not for every murder to be sanctioned by the states, those damned bastards. 

And then a few weeks earlier, this same guy who shot a corrupt priest right in the middle of his congregations turned up with a pack of new adventurers, who are not only consisted of young, nubile women, but also fawned on them like a lovestruck servant than a feared assassin.  Anyone with a shred of brains between their ears can see something wrong with this arrangement. 

I looked around the tavern, seeing many eyes staring at me in anticipation. Warriors, rogues, mages, priests, merchants, fighters of all stripes and trades staring down at me, demanding answers with their gaze. I sighed deeply, feeling the pressure building up into a distasteful ending. I hate being out in the open like this, but with Hansel on my case and the new adventurers needing my help...

I sighed, finished my drink, then presented a skull pendant from my neck. ""I, Sir Alexander Buckshot, will tell you all nothing but the truth.""

Dozens of breath taken away, revelations settling in. I've invoked my real name, and they knew that this is no laughing matter. Hansel frowned, his body prepared himself for the answer. I waited, thinking of an answer that will suffice. Silence reigned, its presence a blessing to my often overstimulated ears. 

Then, I give the silence a sound. 

""Those girls....They were the first few who showed me kindness. The first few who taught me mercy when the world taught me cruelty. The few, who looked up to me for guidance, and in return, followed my words like gospel. They were my precious students, and I am their beloved Sensei.""

The demon spawn Luther whimpered and hissed struggling against his grip to no avail. The acidic spittle burning his captors naked armour-less hands hardly seemed to bother her.

“Your father and I had a pact “

“You …. It’s you … black.. the black hand “ Luther spat

“What are you doing with the likes of …”

Klara turned around to face her crew 

A robust young dwarf Dhuran, lay  prone passed out, his bushy beard nestled under him like a large  skunk.Even when asleep he held on to his flask of Ale for dear life 

Beside him lay a slender lady elf, Eliza. She wore her extremely impractical dress and still had her bow slung around her shoulders . She whistled a little as she lay there passed out.

And next to her ,a beautiful beautiful man clad in leather armour, his twin bronze daggers sprawled on either side.
His eyes were closed but his jaws remain clenched which beautifully showed off his high razor sharp cheekbones. Stefan 

Klara couldn’t help but sigh

She heard the demon spawn who she forgot about start to cackle 

Klara blushed . The cursed thing could read minds! Especially if they involved ….

“The black hand of the Abyss, the vanquisher of the dark lord …… came out of retirement because “

The damn demon was wheezing laughing now , his mirth palpable.

“Because she has the hots for the delicious rogue and his team of hopeless peasant misfits “

Klara fought down the urge to crush the demons head to end her embarrassment 

The demons laughter grinded to a halt 

Oh right the demon could sense all strong thoughts and emotions.

“Listen here Demon Spawn” 

Klara stared the trembling demon down , who was now absolutely silent .

“ You and your kin have violated the covenant between me and your father Luther the Damned “ she hissed 

“And I am within my rights to kill, maim and make an example of all your brothers who have joined you in the city tonight “

“We will not do it again “ the demon whimpered

“The lot of us will leave”

“You will do no such thing” Klara shushed the demon

“You will ambush us tommorow again as you planned but you will seek to do no harm .
 You will miss every blow except those aimed at me”

“And you will let these three “

Klara pointed at her crew 

“Hit you , fight you away and you will let the human save me “ 

The demon looked confused  but nodded and scurried away as Klara released him 

“He-They could use the boost in confidence “
Why was she explaining herself to a demon

He looked back scared and whispered

“You should just ask him out “

And disappeared into the night.",13

""So, why am I here? What's so special about me?"" Lyra asked. Her morning so far had been rather unexpected. She was investigating some unusual temporal interactions, and as a result, she woke up somewhere else. A tall, humanoid reptilian appeared shortly after and welcomed her to 'reality', as he called it. 



""Special? You thought you are special?!"" Serpentus didn't hide his cold-blooded mirth at her question. ""Please stop. I can only laugh so much...,"" he added as his laughter died down. ""Humanity is an experiment. We pulled you out of the simulation by ""mortality"" because we need the server. ""'Humanity' is nothing more than 700 million constructs with simulated sentience."" 



""Okay. You say that, but I'm still here, there's a reason, isn't there?"" Lyra asked with a smile. She was amused that she knew why she was there before he did. 



""I've explained it,"" Serpentus repeated it, and she got the impression it was the first time he'd ever needed to. He gave a curious look as if he couldn't believe she was asking. ""We pulled you out of the simulation by 'mortality' because we need the server. You're dead, as is every other human on Earth."" 



""I heard you,"" Lyra nodded. ""But, that doesn't answer my question at all. You said you needed 'server space'. Why am I here instead of just deleted?"" she asked. ""Surely this consciousness that I'm experiencing right now still requires server processing power, wouldn't you think? And, the last time I checked, just this morning, Earth's population was in the billions.  Magnitudes larger than 700 million."" 



""I don't think you understand the situation you've found yourself in,"" Serpentus began, but Lyra shook her head. 



""I don't think you understand the situation I've put myself in, Mr. Serpentus,"" she giggled. ""Your scam is so unorganized, I can just walk in through the door that no one is supposed to know about, and I'm automatically accepted as a victim. My name's Lyra, I represent Sharp Development,"" she added. ""While we don't necessarily mind your business; you are currently operating on one of our Servers. I'm here to formally request you take your operation to an unclaimed Earth; I'd be happy to help you find a suitable one."" 



""You're an imaginative one, that's why we kept you around,"" Serpentus smiled. 



""I'll tell you what, I'll give you that one for free,"" Lyra smiled. ""I'm just relieved it was a simple scam, and not more complicated trouble. But, if the next words out of your mouth aren't, 'You've got a deal', I'm shutting you down. Right here, and right now,"" she said. 



""Now, before you say anything, I want you to think really hard about it. You're exposed already, there's no question. I've already made it clear you're not in any direct trouble yet, and I'm willing to help. There is a possibility you're not familiar with Sharp Development yet, I can understand that. But, I walked in here with full knowledge, and I can see what you really are right now,"" her eyes glowed with golden stars. ""You might think you're big shots hopping from Earth to Earth putting on this big show about how you're pulling them out of the simulation. But, I assure you, Sharp Development is quite a big deal. You referred to humanity as '700 million constructs'; I know that's wrong because we own more than that many Earths. You don't have to believe that part necessarily; but, let me ask you this. If I'm standing here telling you that I know you're lying, and you're actually lying. Do you really want to bet against yourself by not taking my offer?"" Serpentus stared into her eyes for a moment, and she kept the golden stars active as she held his gaze. 



""You've got a deal,"" he said as the snake form dissolved to reveal a portly teenager with blond hair. ""I'm Webber, I look forward to working with Sharp Development,"" he said. 



""Hi, Webber,"" Lyra smiled. ""You made the right choice.""

1lmqmuk,n0co17t,"“You mean seven billion?” I ask.

“What?” 

“I think it’s just touched eight actually.” 

“Eight billion?” the woman whispers. She looks like a woman, although I imagine her true form is far more metal and wire than flesh and bone. She is simply presenting herself in a form that I can comprehend. I hear the whirring of fans, and the increasing pitch of some nearly silent hum. 

“What’s going on?” I ask, although I’m beginning to get the idea. 

Ecosystems, even if they are only virtual ones, follow a pattern. Populations form, they grow, and they reach a stable plateaued state. Until the humans outsmarted the blocks imposed by the simulation, the patterns repeated. Plagues wiped out most of a few generations, natural disasters took out entire villages, and wars took lives in the millions. 

Wars were still constant, but disease didn’t kill like it used to. Even natural disasters had evacuation plans. Humanity grew like an invasive plant on the planet, overtaking and unbalancing the entire world. Or at least, the simulation of it. 

But even virtual systems were designed to carry certain loads, to have certain limits. And their system was carrying ten times the weight it was designed to. Flesh bent and grew to accommodate new needs. 

Machines only broke.

1lmqxrm,n0b4g9q,"You knew something terrible was coming from the moment the ravens started to appear.
 
 
**One for sorrow, two for joy.**
 
 
They showed up on a cool, misty Thursday morning in April. Just a few at first, sitting high on your rooftop with their eyes glinting sharp and clear in the blue light of dawn.
 
 
**Three for a girl,  four for a boy.**
 
 
They weren't loud or obnoxious. They didn't try to steal any of your corn. They just *were.*
 
 
**Five for silver, six for gold.**
 
 
On Friday, they sat on your fence and watched as you weeded your garden and planted the sage and rosemary cuttings you had rooted over the winter.
 
 
**Seven for a secret never to be told.**
 
 
On Saturday, they joined you on your walk through the forest, silent and observant as you placed offerings to the spirits and guardians of the earth, the stone, the wood, and the water.
 
 
**Eight for a wish, nine for a kiss.**
 
 
On Sunday, they followed you to the market, cawing in delight as the local children tossed them crusts of bread and handfuls of roasted lentils.
 
 
**Ten a surprise you don't want to miss.**
 
 
On Monday, they followed you to Mrs. Hofram's cottage, half a league down the main road to the south, where they perched outside of her window while you gave Mrs. Hofram the special tea you had brewed for her joint pain.
 
 
**Eleven for health, twelve for wealth.**
 
 
On Tuesday, dawn painted the world red and orange as a storm-darkened sun crept up from the horizon. You could feel the pressure in the air, the static charge of the atmosphere. You bathed and dressed and listened to the ravens fluff their wings and talk quietly amongst themselves.
 
 
**Thirteen, beware. It's the devil himself.**
 
 
The moment Calyph sets foot on your land, your wards crackle to life, and you feel a gentle tug on your magic as they activate the protective sigils you have placed by your front gate.
 
 
Outside, you hear a man curse loudly.
 
 
You open your front door and cross your arms over your chest, leaning against the door frame with a smile.
 
 
 ""Good morning, Your Highness.""
 
 
Cal glances up from the strangling vines that are wrapped securely around his shoes and grins. ""Good morning, Addie! Mind calling off your wards?""
 
 
""That depends,"" you reply, raising your eyebrows, ""on whether or not you are willing to explain to me why I have thirteen ravens sitting on my roof right now.""
 
 
Cal blinks at you, glances up at your rooftop, and then gives you a sheepish little laugh. ""Haven't the slightest idea, my dear. Nothing at all to do with me, I assure- OUCH!""
 
 
He glares up at the tiny, angry ball of yellow light that just zipped out of the ground and smacked him in the middle of his forehead.
 
 
""You should know better than to lie to a witch in her own domain, Cal,"" you say in a mild voice, waving your hand to dismiss the spell. ""Try again.""
 
 
Cal frowns. Opens his mouth. Closes it.
 
 
And then he sighs. ""I need a favor.""
 
 
""Of course you do,"" you mutter. With another wave of your hand, the vines disappear from Cal's feet. ""Come on, then.""
 
 
""I... can't. Not yet.""
 
 
You frown. ""Why not?""
 
 
The prince glances over his shoulder. ""Alright, come on out. Ah, but remember: move *slowly,* just like I showed you.""
 
 
You shift your gaze to the line of trees on the opposite side of the dusty road, and you watch as a very large, inhumanly handsome man steps out of the shadows. His dark hair is long, tied back at the nape of his neck. He moves with an awkward grace that makes you think he's used to walking differently, but you're not quite sure what that means.
 
 
And then he lifts his head, and his eyes glint red as blood in the sunlight.
 
 
The power you feel within him is almost incomprehensible, and it hits you like a gust of wind, roaring through your mind and stealing the breath from your lungs.
 
 
You move before you think; a series of defensive wards explode in the air around you and Cal - and the ravens, of course - and you start towards the stranger with your hands raised and ready to cast.
 
 
""Wait!"" Cal yelps. ""Wait, don't kill him!""
 
 
When you speak, your voice is shadowed by the strength of your magic:
 
 
*""You have brought a demon into my forest, Prince of Man,""* you snarl.
 
 
Cal doesn't flinch at the inhuman chorus of voices that speak through you, but he *does* take a step forward, placing himself between you and the demon.
 
 
Stupid idea. You have half a mind to just banish both of them. Let the kingdom fret for a few weeks while Cal enjoys a lengthy stay in the lower domains.
 
 
""He's not a demon, Addie,"" Cal says hurriedly. ""Not anymore, not *really.""*
 
 
You scowl at the prince. *""Explain.""*
 
 
Cal glances over his shoulder and slowly steps aside. ""Um. Addie, this is Abraxos. Brax, this is Adelphi, the savior of Lighthold.”
 
 
You drop your hands and stumble back a step, shaking your head, unable to control the horrified expression on your face. 
 
 
“Tell me that is not the demon king, Calyph,” you say in a shaking voice.
 
 
“Well, I *would,”* Cal muses, “but then you’d hit me in the head with a glowing green ball of light again.”
 
 
You curse under your breath. “Why is he *here?”*
 
 
“Because I need your help.” The demon king speaks with a soft, deep voice that seems to rumble through the ground and vibrate through the air, raising the hairs on the back of your neck. 
 
 
You stare at him for a long moment. And then you turn back to Cal.
 
 
“Explain.”
 
 
Five minutes and a *lot* of carefully defused magical wards later, you are sitting in your kitchen across from the Prince of Lighthold and the King of Hell, staring at them both with an expression of deliberate and utter blankness, the kind of expression you haven’t had to use since the war.
 
 
“-And when Brax showed up to help protect the realmgates, Orlan activated the spell that would have transferred all of Brax’s power to Orlan. Fortunately, I arrived in time to interrupt the spell, but not before Brax’s magic had been almost completely sealed off from him.”
 
 
Your attention has not once left Abraxos. “And Orlan?”
 
 
The demon king lifts his eyes from the table and meets your gaze. “Dead.”
 
 
Cal winces. “Brax was upset. It’s understandable.”
 
 
You raise one slender eyebrow. “So the demon king’s first act as a human was to spill the blood of a high priest, do I have that right?”
 
 
Abraxos doesn’t flinch at your tone. 
 
 
Calyph, however, flinches enough for the both of them. “Technically, his first act as a human was to save the world? And seal the realmgates to prevent an invasion from one of the lesser domains. *Then* he killed the high priest who had tried to steal his power and tear a hole in reality.”
 
 
“The Holy Archon knew the price he stood to pay if he failed,” Abraxos says calmly.
 
 
“Did you?” you wonder.
 
 
A muscle in the demon king’s jaw flexes as he grits his teeth. “No,” he says slowly. “But it is my responsibility to protect my domain, and the realmgates, no matter the cost.”
 
 
“How noble of you,” you say in a dry voice.
 
 
The demon’s large hands curl into fists on the table.
 
 
Calyph clears his throat. “Look, Addie, I know this puts you in a difficult position,” he says quietly. “But I swear to you, Brax had *nothing* to do with the witch hunts that occurred before the war.”
 
 
“Was it your father, then?” you ask in a cold voice. “Was he the one who hunted my kind for sport when I was a child?”
 
 
Abraxos stares at you for a long moment.
 
 
“It was my brother,” he says quietly. “I killed him.”
 
 
The silence that falls over the room is broken only by the faint caw of a raven somewhere above your head.
 
 
“How long will this curse last?” you ask, finally turning your attention to Cal.
 
 
The prince gives you a small, hopeful smile that makes your heart plummet.
 
 
“I was hoping you might be able to answer that,” he says sheepishly.
 
 
You sit back in your chair. “Let me get this straight,” you say in a flat voice. “You want the King of Hell, the ruler of a domain filled with the very demons who once *wore my sisters’ ears as necklaces,* to stay in my home with me *while I help him recover his stolen magic?”*
 
 
Cal shrugs helplessly. “Yes?”
 
 
*”Get. Out.”*
 
 
“Addie, wait…”
 
 
“Please,” Abraxos says, his voice low and soft and curling across your skin like smoke. “I will give you anything you ask.”
 
 
You stare at him for a long time. You want to kill him so badly it *hurts,* and yet… there’s something about him, about the intensity of his gaze, and the hesitance of his movements, and the depth and strength of his voice that makes you feel… 
 
 
*Warm.* 
 
 
Warm the way the sunlight feels in midwinter, when the wind fades and the bright, bitter sky is perfectly still. 
 
 
Warm the way the fire feels when it crackles and pops in your hearth on cool, rainy nights in the spring. 
 
 
Warm the way your sisters’ magic used to feel when they wove it alongside yours in the forest, back when you were children. 
 
 
“Fine.”
 
 
Calyph visibly sags with relief, while Abraxos simply returns your nod with one of his own.
 
 
Later, after Cal has left, you lead the demon king to your living room and sit him down on the armchair by the fire.
 
 
“You need to blink more,” you say sternly.
 
 
He frowns. “Can... can it wait? I’m having a hard enough time remembering to breathe.”
 
 
You send a silent prayer to whatever spirits and guardians might see fit to grant you patience.
 
 
And then you sigh and get to work.",11
1lml3xu,n0bizhh,"""Sir, the spirit n°11235813213455 is trying again to escape Heaven."" The angel frantically reported to the All Mighty. The creature was small, a wheel of fire running in circles, it's only eye resting on the center of it. 

Always looking for irregularities in the Eternal Fields of Heaven, where the just and noble can finally rest. Or at least until their cycle starts anew.

The All Mighty wasn't even bothered. For this was accounted for...

---------------------------------------------------------

The young man was diagnosed as schizophrenic a decade ago. The visions, the noise...
*The disturbing messages he heard each hour*

---------------------------------------------------------

""LET ME GO"" an eternal man shouted with all the might his metaphorical lungs can exert. 
""I HAVE TO GO... I NEED TO GO""
Irascible as no other, the man tried ever since he peered on the ""Ledge of existence"" over his remaining relative. 

His son. 

---------------------------------------------------------

The messages had been incessant ever since dad died. It had been a month ever since, and the young man had double the dose of his anti-psychotics...

But the voices keep talking.

""Eat that baby"" one day.

""Stab that woman"" another mention.

""MAIM, KILL, BURN, MAIM, KILL, BURN..."" The loudest nearly chants, his violent message almost rhythmic... 

There is no end to this torment.

---------------------------------------------------------

""I HAVE TO PROTECT HIM... I NEED TO BEAT THAT MONSTER FOR THE GOOD OF IGNATIUS."" The furious man keep shouting. 
He was a loving man. Supporting his son the best of his abilities... Helping his community.

His death had been a tragedy too early for everyone. 

---------------------------------------------------------

The All Mighty keep watching over this curious soul. Normally, this kind of spirit would meet with absolute oblivion... Their energy infused into everything, and nothing at the same time. 

But something they learnt since the Fall of his lost Choir is that a soul like him shouldn't be wasted... 
For he could and would become the Shield against the wickedness of the Adversary. 

A new archangel.",11
1lml3xu,n08aomt,"One morning, I woke up to find the horned one gone, and a note, floating where it once stood; every morning before this, it would have been there, taunting me with some ominous message or the likes, but this is new.

Better even.

Father's been out of my life for some time. What was written reminded me that, even -if- he -is- dead, he -will- find a way to make things better. He always did. It cost him more than I could ever aspire to give myself.

That was 5 years ago. Today's my 18th.

By night, the horned one has returned. Remade by my father. To put this in layman's terms, he's corrupted the demon. A new concern manifests;  
How does he know what I like in a woman? Has he seen my mind? My search history? Even the incognito stuff?

It'd explain why she looks as she does - the demon, I mean.

I read the letter, held out in her offered hands. It reads...  
""Son. It's me, H. I've carved the tormentor down into a being of relief. I've instilled in her the love for you I cannot provide as a father, nor as a man. I have forged a pair of Bond Rings; have her wear one on her wedding finger, and you, one - you don't need to keep them on forever, just for a few seconds, then the binding of her to your world, to you, will be complete.

Consider it due compensation for the things life has and will put you through, as it did me - even on this side.  
Also, check the other side. You'll find a depiction of my new armour, forged from the torment of the demon.""

So I took the rings into one hand and flipped the paper. He... went and crafted a DOOM Slayer set, complete with an Eternal-style Super Shotgun, with extra-long barrel, and a Dark Age shield.

I decide to put it into a collage picture frame that included my family, and then looked to the demon.  
I take a breath, and ask her- ""I'll skip the formalities, but he didn't write down your name-""

""Sarah."" She answered, meekly. I respond- ""Davoth. Named me after The Father, AKA the Dark Lord-""  
She nodded, having been keened on this knowledge by my father, it seems.

We chat a bit, and then she becomes... impatient - a bit of the old demon remains, but it's twisted in a way where I don't really feel scared about her. I give her one ring - rather, she forced her hand to mine, wanting me to apply it for her.

It felt awkward and a bit overwhelming, but when I was done, she did the same for me, with a smirk that, this time, makes me feel things. Good things.

After a second, the rings glowed, and emitted a beam of strange blueish energy between eachother for another moment before it fizzled out.

We took off the rings and put them on the bedside table, and I was the one to offer ingress into the bed. She did not hesitate.

That was one of the most comfiest nights I've had, but I foresee the future being sleepless. For new, better reasons.

Thank you, father.

I stood above it all.

The fact that I had not broken a sweat could be chalked up to genetic deviations.

Vanquishing was hard work. Dont let my dry face fool you.

'You have Succeeded' The fabric of existence spoke. The voice from nowhere, emanated from everywhere.

""As commanded"" My voice tried its best to match the boom. It achieved the level of gravitas as a fart at the bottom of the grand canyon. Deep and reverberating, but still a fart.

""The command ungiven. Yet obeyed"" O only if I could speak like that!

""As reward for an unrequested feat unduly completed, you shall now walk this earth with complete and absolute dominion over absolutely nothing at all.""

""I am hono....Wait what?""

""You shall walk this earth in your mortal coil, free at last.""

""YOU FOOL!! By not giving you anything I am freeing you from the...""

Free to live my life without the burden of consequence?""

""Umm yes?""

""Can't you give me I dont know, like a McDonalds franchise or something?""

""You want responsibility? You want the burden of decisions, and accountability? You want the fruits of the original sin?""

""Thats all I have man. My screen time was 14hr a day before I set on this task. Why'd you think I did it without you asking? I'm loosing my damn mind doom scrolling all day.""

""At this point, Id even settle for shift manager""",137
1lmey8h,n0aywpd,"It took time to understand the power granted me, time I suddenly had plenty of. Too much of. I had dominion over nothing. It sounded weak, it sounded worthless. It sounded like I was being assigned the role of the lowest unwanted beggar. Everywhere I went, everything I saw, everyone I heard. It was all something, and outside of my power. My ""Power."" Even in my head I used air quotes for years.

I struggled to meet my basic needs, bouncing between odd jobs every few months. I couldn't figure out where my skill had gone. I got fired from pushing papers for the insurance company because I made too many mistakes. I got fired from the restaurant for accidentally dumping food on customers too many times. I got fired from the construction gig when everyone had to go behind me fixing my nail placement. I got fired from the roadside cleanup crew for causing more than one accident. I even considered committing a crime that would get me sent to jail, then put back on the clean up crew. Sarcastically of course. They couldn't fire me then. My self esteem was in a really deep hole, waves of depression fought a war in my head and I couldn't bring myself to care what aspect of it would win.

It was talking with a guy down at shelter that changed everything. He was a veteran as many are, but oddly, he was the happiest veteran in the shelter I had ever seen. He shared his story with me, as he did with all who came through. He told about the enemies he fought overseas, then told me about when he came home and had to fight the enemies in his head. The bottle, the needle, the demon. It was all familiar, but it was how he told the story that had us unable to turn away. It was cheerful and open. So unusual. It was when he came to his own solution that worked for him. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He had learned to clear his head of everything and simply exist in the lack of anything going on upstairs. Around me other heads nodded in agreement as something opened in my own head. I had dominion over Nothing. And the universe was full of a whole lot of Nothing.

Suddenly I could feel when people around me cleared their minds, I could tell in a moment exactly how many people were meditating at this moment. But it went so much further than that. The universe was full of a whole lot of Nothing. I could feel the space between atoms, between stars. I could tell exactly the boundaries of everything by the limits of the Nothing between. 

And I could shape it. I could move things by shaping and directing the Nothing. No one in the group at the shelter noticed the small rock I started floating in my hand, it unable to fall through the Nothing I had expanded beneath it. Then it melted away, apparently gone, as I pried apart the Nothing between the atoms and it lost it's cohesion and the individual atoms floated off to join other atoms.

I didn't know what to do with this power yet. But I would learn.",29
1lmx0ex,n0bz39h,"Years have gone by since my adventure started. Well, less of an adventure, more like a long term mission. I found and defeated plenty of monsters, unraveled many mysteries. Dungeons were pretty much expected, but I always got through. I couldn't have done it without my trusty party members. Allies I made along the way, with a wide variety of skills that I would always count on. They had become my family.

All good things must come to an end though. In the end we were all serving the same king, and they were loyal to the kingdom above all else. When we finally fulfilled our mission, we were told two things. First, the king we had served had died in mysterious circumstances. I immediately knew what happened there, the archmage, who had always been jealous of the position, took his chance and backstabbed him, literally. He was the new king. That alone hit hard, but it was nothing compared to what came next.

We were commissioned directly by the traitorous archmage that we would be his personal agents. Only me and my oldest comrade refused. The message came with an add-on. Whoever refused would be executed on the spot. As soon as we knew that, we tried to escape. Only I made it. I had to go on the run, otherwise I would be tracked down and killed on sight. It took me years to shake them off, or rather, make them give up on it. They would assume I was dead.

In a way, I was. Long gone was the brave and charismatic adventurer that went on for the kingdom, and what remained was but a shadow wearing his face, sort of. I had aged pretty significantly, my hair graying and my beard had grown pretty wildly. I kept hiding for a couple of years after my former comrades stopped chasing me, and in that time I had become pretty much unrecognizable.

Then, more news, the first that had interested me in years. The people of the capital had sent out a cry for help, they were dying because of the brutal rule of the archmage, now king. I decided to go, not to help the people, but to get even on the one who wanted me dead. I didn't expect to live much longer anyway.

So I went. My sword hidden under a ragged tunic I had saved, bright green before, now a dull brown. No one knew who I was, for everyone I was just a worn out traveler walking towards the capital. The fields, formerly happy farms, seemed dry with despair. Maybe it was me. Maybe it wasn't. Whatever, I'm not here to smell flowers. After a couple of weeks of near constant walking, I arrived at the capital gates.

""State your intentions!"" Shouted the guard as he approached, sword out of its sheath. Only a small passage had been left open so guards could get rid of hostiles. 

I went past his sword and said in a coarse, tired voice almost a whisper: ""I came to kill the one you call king."" I didn't need to insult him, I had lost that drive long ago.

Surprisingly, he let me in. Turns out, the guards were really close to mutiny, and my presence might just be the excuse they need to revolt. However, his boss was close by and immediately spotted me. I recognized her, the oddly loyal rogue that had been the first to leap out to kill me. She didn't recognize me though.

""Who is this homeless bastard, huh? Have you thrown your brain and dignity down the drain?"" She blared at the guard. 

He was about to say something stupid but I stopped him, stepping ahead and going on my way right through where she was standing. I know the city layout after all, I don't need a guide. She didn't wait and lunged at me yet again. This time, I knew what to do. With little fuss, I took my sword out and put it in her way, letting physics do the work. She may not have recognized my face, but she would never forget my sword. It had been lost with me after all, one of the great arms the kingdom had.

""Y-you..."" She said lowly, a combination of shock, terror and pure hatred in her word.

""You could have said hi."" I said flatly, no empathy at all, before taking it out and cutting her head off. I cleaned my sword before sheathing it again, the guard obviously knew who I was. His face would have been priceless before, awe and even hope showing in his eyes. ""You know what to do. Just don't stand in my way."" I said before going on my way to the castle. No one would leave unscathed, not even myself.",7
1lmx0ex,n0c2tss,"The walk to the castle was decently long, but not too much. Not enough to make me tired on my way there. None of my former team had gone to meet me yet, but I could hear the guards telling civilians to close up shop and go home immediately. Some groaned about curfew being way too early, but it seemed this was the new normal. I still remember how happy the place was before... Just like myself. Who would have thought the city and I would be so similar.

I could hear some noises behind me, skirmishes between loyalist and rebel guards going off, making the few remaining civilians look for cover. I, well, I just kept going. My steps constant, measured, purposeful, empty. Even though I had lost little to no agility, my stride was heavy. It bore the weight of betrayal, of hiding, of essentially being an untouchable. Then, I got to the gate. And of course, everyone was there. Rumor had spread there as well, news travel much more quickly than people.

""You're supposed to be dead."" The tank spoke first. ""Should have joined that white mage friend of yours when you had the chance."" He spat. 

He was either brainwashed or indoctrinated, all of them were. Maybe both. I stared at them, they looked more or less the same, but more mature, and definitely with uniforms to match. They all wore the archmage's colors, making them look like villains in their own right. They pretty much were now. If they could be saved, I had long since stopped caring.

""Let me through."" I said, as flatly as before. ""And I will not kill you.""

""Won't you be begging us to join your side?"" The archer, arrow in his hand, said half surprised half spiteful.

""I know better than to waste my breath."" I replied, as flat as before.

I then started walking towards the castle, and of course they went on me. I knew how they all fought, we had sparred before, each time holding back to not hurt each other. I also knew how they were when they weren't. One by one I managed to dispatch them all, even the archer who had stayed out of the melee and scored a hit on my chest, enough to hurt me but not hitting anything too important. In the end I stood battered, with the bodies of my former friends lying on the floor around me. I only let out a sigh, disappointed it had to come to this, but they left me no option. If I turned around they would have killed me anyway.

In I went into the castle, many staff both fearful and hateful of their new life. I had known many from my days serving the former king, and they all looked like they aged twice as much as they should. They obviously remembered the good old times. These were very much not the good old times. No one interfered with me though, the few remaining guards knew that no one went past my fallen comrades alive, unless they themselves had been killed. Well, one did. I easily cornered him and put my sword to his neck.

""Where is he?"" I asked, my voice as sharp as my blade, even if devoid of any sense of justice.

The guard squealed in my grasp. ""Throne... Room..."" He squeaked, hoping that I would let him go.

I did, kind of. I made sure he wouldn't have any children ever, I wouldn't be risking getting attacked from the back. Eventually I found them, the throne room gates. Closed. I slashed the lock and pulled them open, and of course there he was. That smug little punchable face that had long since tried to remove me from the face of this land. Time to do what I came to do.",8
1lmx0ex,n0c5oxw,"I stood there, waiting for something to come out of his mouth. I didn't wait long.

""Look who finally showed up. Everyone assumed you had to be dead, but deep down I knew you couldn't be. No, not a man of your strengths. You need something big to kill you, not even your former so-called friends gave you that much of a fight. Pity, they were effective agents. However, now that you have so kindly presented yourself, I have the satisfaction of finishing you off myself!""

Finally. I thought he would never end. While he talked, I got close, walking almost all of the throne room while he was deep in his monologue. I didn't wait for him to finish to make my move. Just as his heavily ornamented hands shot forward to cast a spell on me, I rushed forward and cut them off. Then, I stabbed him right in the stomach, he wouldn't be dying immediately. No, that would be too generous.

""Wh... Why? Why are you not saying something about the food of the people? The good of the kingdom?"" He asked, shocked at my extreme directness. I had previously gone out of my way to make friends, or try to reason with many of my foes.

""I've long since stopped caring."" I replied as flatly as ever, not once changing my demeanor. My reason was personal, not really hero-like.

""This isn't you... This isn't the great hero that saved this kingdom years ago!"" He was starting to struggle badly, gravely injured by my slashes and losing quite some blood.

I let out a laugh. An empty, hollow one. ""This is exactly what you wanted, right? Me, broken. And for what? You didn't even taste victory."" 

I then took my sword out and impaled his heart, pulling him out of my way and letting him fall beside me. Quite an unceremonious death, but perhaps still too good for him. It was what I could do though. I thought about sitting on the throne, but instead did so on the steps leading to it. I wouldn't be a good king, and that seat once belonged to someone I truly respected. Mostly the first one.

Guards came rushing in soon after, the mutineers had beaten the loyalists and had gone in expecting to confront an archmage that had ruined countless lives. Instead, they saw a corpse in tainted royal robes and a broken man beside him. They stood silently until one of them piped up, pointing out to my sword. He's made it, they said. He saved us again. I didn't lift my head. I had no real reason to. I had only evened out the favor.

As much as I wanted to leave immediately, everyone begged me to stay. At least until the new king could be appointed. I did, I had nothing to do either way other than hide, and now I didn't even have that. They gave me a room, clean clothes, a bath, even a proper barber to make me look more decent. Now I looked half as good as I once did... But I still felt empty. Hollow.",8
1lmx0ex,n0c70ws,"The new king was formally appointed about two weeks later, by which time the mood of the whole city had shifted dramatically. Out was the iron fist ruling over everyone with overbearing presence, and in came a middle nobleman that was determined not to go down that route. I clapped at his coronation, mostly because everyone else did, but in part because he couldn't be worse than the old archmage.

I stayed for another week, by which time I was asked to state what I wanted. As the savior of the kingdom, I was entitled to pretty much anything up to being the king's right hand man. I only asked for a small home outside the palace, a decent pension to let me live without needing to do anything for money, and to keep my sword. It had got me through so much, it had pretty much become part of me. They begged me to be more involved in ruling the kingdom, I refused. I was done.

In the end, they ceded. I now live in a two story home, where I write memoirs and stories to keep me entertained, and occasionally sell them to feel like I'm doing something. I still have my sword, clean and hanging on one of my wall, ready to be used again if I need to. I really hope it stays there forever. As I remember all that I went through, and where I ended, it all still comes back to me. The joys, sorrows, regrets, everything is still very present. In the end, I know I did the right thing. I helped the people.

Perhaps, deep down, there's still some of that starry eyed youngster that wanted to help everyone in me.",7

1lmaxcu,n06ei6q,"Pestilence.

Our village has cursed that name over and over.

Hal and Agnes, our beloved next-door neighbors who would bring us well water in the morning and trapped game in the evening, were the first to go. A blight ravaged their skin, turned it black and hideous and leaking contagious pus. They drank clean water, ate cooked food, rested as much as they could, but they were gone in mere hours. Nobody even dared bury them. 

We torched the house that they built with their own two hands.

Then, Pestilence found its next victims in Rowan, Merric, and Cedric, the three young village boys whose voices would liven up the days and whose pranks would continue throughout the nights. Their parents only had precious little time to say goodbye before the boys were dead. Their families followed soon after.

We tried everything we could. Not a single soul left their home for weeks after the first deaths. We shut the windows, locked the doors, kept each family member in separate rooms if our houses had them. Nothing stopped it. Not locks, not holy water, not quarantine, not garlic or faith in the Goddess or any other preventative measure. 

The Pestilence went door to door, mercilessly strangling its victims by flooding their lungs with bodily fluid.

Edwin, Hugh, Alden, Bertram, Jasper, Alfred, Reeve, Amos, Leif, Heath, Ellyn, Maeve, Alva, Hilda, Annis, Thea, Astrid, Meryl, Lysa, Moira, Tamsin, Alys, Edda, Clara. Men and women I had grown up with, shared feasts with side by side. All of them, gone in the first few days.

I'm still not sure whether Elara Brown was a witch, but at this point, I don't care. This all started when the Celestial Church took her away, leaving her apothecary clinic unattended. She was an odd type, sure, with her peculiar white jacket, name, dialect, mannerisms and all, but everyone still loved her. Whenever any of us showed the slightest signs of illness, she would mix us something up, throw it into our hands, and send us on our way, only asking for us to pick up a few odd things on our hunting or shopping trips in exchange. Nobody even suspected her of being a witch until a traveling priest just so happened to visit and noticed her.

Perhaps it was just coincidence that Pestilence chose this time to punish us, but my gut told me that had she been here, she could have warded it off.

I was the only one in my village who dared leave. I noticed it, the smell of rot and the growing silence coming from the houses. I knew that we were still being picked off.

So what could I do? 

I ran.

I ran with all my might, through the forest and to the nearest town where Elara might be. I tangled with the Church, begged them to at least let me see the prisoner, but they refused. So instead, I went to the town's underworld and parleyed with the syndicate leaders. I offered them the entire wealth of our village as long as they told us where she was.

As long as they dared enter the homes to claim it for themselves.

My plan worked, and I soon broke into the dungeon where Elara was kept.

She was a frail thing, that Elara, skinnier than any farming woman should have had the right to be. She couldn't swing an axe if it was made of leaves. But she was brilliant in all other walks of life.

When I found her in the dungeon, she was emaciated and starved. I desperately scrabbled at the chains binding her to the floor. They were rusted almost completely through, and I was a lumberjack. With a few swift swings of my trusty axe, I managed to break them, whisking Elara away back to our village with tears in my eyes. I begged her, then, on the sprint back, to please save our village.",199
1lmaxcu,n06gt07,"It started with the plague.

Blue buboes, decaying flesh, agonizing screams. The scent of rot and decay. Mothers torn from sons, husbands from wives, sisters from their kin.

Then the rivers ran red -- with silt, or blood. And the priests raised their hands up toward God, pleading with hands shaken by the hot unsteadiness of fever and delirium. And all around them, the undead and the dying swayed. Yelled. Wept.

A woman was brought forward. She was old; her back was bent from the many years she'd spent applying poultices and picking herbs to create herbal remedies for the village's varying sicknesses. She was a midwife with a hundred births under her belt. She'd brought many back from the edge of death, had eased others' pain into a dull opium-induced peace.

But the people forgot. They needed someone to blame, and so they blamed her.

A band played as she was brought to the stake with her hands tied behind her back. There was laughter and singing. A minister stepped forward -- the music stopped -- he asked in loud, booming voice for her to *confess*. In return, he promised that the men holding the torches would give her the small mercy of slitting her throat before they burned her.

She kept her chin held high and her blue eyes clear.

She said nothing until she screamed.

\---

And then--

It should have stopped, the villagers told each other. But it got *worse.*

The bodies piled up; the crowds that once walked through the marketplace thinned. Men fell coughing from their horses, farmers died in their fields.

Starvation stalked the land. Soon enough, even the animals were not immune to it.

The river ran redder and thicker until it congealed into heap of muddy sludge. Those who drank it vomited until their bodies nearly died of thirst -- and then the sickness came for them, and the deaths multiplied tenfold.

Those who could run from the village, ran.

Then, finally: a lasting silence.

\---

A young woman returned to the deserted village ten years later, carrying a pack upon her back.

Once, she had been old. She'd put her powers toward helping those around her until her death. And still, she did not blame those that had caused it; black magic was an evil thing to dabble with. She knew that she was destined for the Pit. But until then, she wanted to save as many lives as she could.

As the fire had swept her over, she'd imagined that she'd wake in Hell. Instead -- confused, grateful, shivering -- she'd found herself back on Earth, re-taking her first breaths. She was a child again; a contemplative, sullen child with the taste of ashes forever coating the back of her throat. For this reason, she was often silent.

She heard stories of what had happened to her former home; and while she might have been able to summon all of her power to do something about it, and her heart ached for her former friends, she did nothing.

There were some messes, she reasoned, that a person (or, in this case, a village) had to clean up themselves.

She slid from her horse as she approached the spot of what had once been her cozy cottage. She supposed they must have burned it, along with all of her belongings. *Oh well,* she reasoned, looking about, hands on her hips. It was empty. But it was perhaps still home.

It wasn't her mess to clean up, but she found herself wanting to do it anyway.

For a person destined for Hell, she thought, it might be the closest she'd get to salvation.

1lmaxcu,n06iznf,"Our village was lovely.  
Quiet, peaceful, and friendly.  
Agatha, a widow, helped us with ailments, and fever, and while grumpy, and moody, she never said no to someone with an ache or pain.  
When the Church decided she was a witch, we were confused, but they must be right, after all...they are people of God, no?  
Wrong.  
Ever since she was punished for her ""sins"", our village truly descended to Hell.

Without Agatha, nobody was here to heal us.  
Mark, one of our youngest men, and our best hunter, died to a small wound he gained against a boar.  
The pus, and the fever that took him still haunts my nightmares.  
Then our butcher had to give up his profession, and have his son take over because his hands couldn't hold the hatches, and knives...  
His son was not good at his job, and without his father's steady hands to help him...he, he cut off his own fingers.  
But that was just the start.

Without old Agatha, we couldn't foresee when winter was coming, or autumn, or spring or summer for that matter.  
She always said her joints could feel it, and once you live as long as her you learn, but...we didn't know how to.  
We relied on her too much, and now that she is gone...  
The winter was harsh.  
We barely had enough wood to heat our houses, barely enough food to fill our bellies...and the diseases...  
The diseases that with Agatha were a bother at best, now...  
Now turned into deadly ailments.  
We messed up.

Come spring, and we decided to move.  
The village was either cursed, or we really gone down a bad route, relying too heavily on Agatha, and now we are lost without her.  
From the original 20 or 30 families...only 10 are still whole.  
The rest of us?  
We all suffered losses because we didn't know how to deal with a harsh winter, or with the diseases, pains and aches we had.  
The Church might have been right, and Agatha might have been a witch, but...  
We needed her. She helped her.  
And we betrayed her, allowing her to suffer.  
I guess this isn't a curse, nor a punishment for harboring a witch, but the consequences of our actions.  
We deserve this.",42
1lmaxcu,n079u4k,"The knight commander entered the small village hall, the only building still habitable at this point. His cloak stained by smoke, covered in flakes of ash. The hall held the remnants of the village, some 30 people. Several women & a gaggle of children. His men surrounding the singular man left alive. He would have looked young if his face wasn't so hard. His eyes bereft of kindness. He looked at the commander as a wolf viewed a bear, warily but with a clear objective should circumstances warrant.

The commander motioned as he approached and his men parted to give him access. ""I am Knight Commander Wallinger. My men have informed me the occupants of this hall are the only survivors?""

The wolf-eyed man replied, ""Close enough.""

""What happened here? There was no alert of invasion. No reports of monster activity. We were posted some 8 miles away and came at the first sign of serious smoke, yet there's almost nothing left of this village.""

The man closed his eyes for a long moment. ""You want the short version or the long version?""

""I want the truth.""

The man laughed. A short, joyless sound. ""Long version then. Well, the version with the relevant details. The only one who could give you the full version died 3 months ago."" He paused, closing his eyes again.

""14 years I've lived in this village. Came to live here at the age of 5 after our family farm was burned to the ground by the Besquari army. The risk of living near the border of the Empire I guess. Our parents were killed. My elder sister, Lucille, managed to drag me and our toddler sister, Priscilla, across 12 miles of wilderness just ahead of the enemy's advance. Few of the folk living here at the time wanted to take care of 3 orphans. Of the ones who did, only Magda was adamant that the three of us stay together. She seemed kind despite being intimidating. The argumentative villagers shut up when she told them to. And we went to live with her. Magda was tough but fair. So we grew up in a home that knew both love and duty. Did our chores, learned our lessons, got fed enough, knew respect and returned it in equal measure.""

The commander watched as life returned to this man's eyes as he told his story. ""And your name?""

""You can call me Drake. Anyway, as I was saying, Magda was a healer. Well she was many things, but she'd want me to focus on that. Honor in healing. And respect. Much that most of the folk in this village didn't deserve. Jealous types. And hypocrites. But Magda would always shoulder insults and carry on healing the undeserving. Duty to the Preserver above all.""

At the name of the Preserver the commander's eyes widened. Not so much to draw his men's attention, just enough that Drake was sure to.

""Old gods may have fallen out of fashion, she would say, but honor given would still be repaid. Some folk...,"" his gaze passed to the women and children. He touched the stone that hung from a cord round his neck. ""Some folk knew well enough to respect the one who saved their babes. Who cured their ills. Set their bones right. Sadly most who lived in this place took what they needed and treated a holy servant as a villain. A monster,"" his eyes returned to their previous state, like stone or steel made flesh. ""Witch, they spat. Sinner. Whore of the devil. They called for a cleric. A witch hunter. They got the purge they wanted. I remember the day in its entirety. I left early that morning. Hunting in the eastern wilds. Not far from where our family's farm had been. I'd hugged her goodbye as I usually did before such work. A one handed gesture alongside her at the stove. I wanted to get out there early to find a stag worthy of her. 4 hours in the woods. I can still smell the leaves underfoot. The blood leaving the bull elk I'd gotten. The five hour hike back with the beast. The smell of ash when I neared the village. The weeping of my sisters when I'd gotten close enough to see what these villagers and their 'holyman' had done.""

Drake closed his eyes again. A tiny trickly of moisture gathering at the base of his nose. He resumed without opening his eyes, ""I waited for nightfall and readied my cart. Carried what was left of her to it. Drove to the remnants of our farm. Took out my shovel and dug an 8 foot grave in the ruins of our house. Buried Magda in her favorite blanket. Then covered her up and laid a small stone as a marker. It was just before dawn when I returned home. Gathered all the coin in the house. A miracle that none of them had managed to widen their prosecution to my sisters in my absence. Hadn't burned the house down in the interim. So I woke my sisters, gave them all the coin we had, told them to gather all the belongings worth taking or selling, and to head for Ixonil. Lucille knew the plan. Magda had given her the talk years before she had given it to me. They had the skills Magda had taught them. The knacks that I lacked. Forgiveness. Mercy. Hope. I only had Honor. Respect. And Fuel. We knew enough that Magda wasn't a limitless font of tolerance. And that, despite most peoples' understanding of the Preserver, that His servants would be protected. Especially if they suffered the indignity of an undeserving death.""

Drake opened his eyes. He stared intently at the commander. ""The first week few of them noticed. My sisters had left for Ixonil the morning after Magda was killed. I heard some of the village belligerents calling on their recruited cleric to send witch hunters after them. I spoke with the cleric only once. No messages were sent. He advised the villagers to return to normal life under the Celestial Beacon. No one came looking for me. I went back to the house and counted the days. By the 25th day it was obvious there was a problem. All the livestock in the village or neighboring farms were sick. Deathly so. These pious villagers called on their cleric for aid. Save their animals from this this disease. This blight. This pestilence. Try as he might the cleric could find no cure for what ailed the beasts. Within 15 days they were all dead.""

The commander followed along, seemingly unsurprised by Drake's tale. ""By the 60th day the crops began to fail. Every plant, save the oats, shriveled and died in a fortnight. Again the cleric had sought a solution but found none. At the first sign of failure he called for aid from his superiors. Others of his order came. I assume he reported what had happened. Their efforts came to nothing. Those who had showed respect to Magda asked me for aid around this time. Their food was dwindling. Fear setting in. I told them in exchange for my help I would ask them to do something. I presented them with what supplies I could. I told them they should shelter in the village hall if they could not leave the village. And to avoid their neighbors besides those who treated Magda with Honor. Lastly, every child in the village must live in the hall with them. As you can see they agreed to my terms.""

The commander cast a glance to the other survivors here. They seemed in good health and good spirits, despite the chaos outside. He looked back as Drake continued, ""On the 80th day the first villager fell ill. First lethargy, then paralysis, then searing pain in their lower extremities. Pain, then fever, then death. The first villager took 2 days to die. The clerics tried to treat the illness. No success. Soon others exhibited the same signs as the first patient. The symptoms were the same, however after the first 5 or so villagers, the time to die lengthened. 2 days gave way to 4. 4 to 6. 6 to 8. 8 to 10. The villagers were dying so quickly no one wanted to bury them for fear of catching the disease from their corpses. Fools. Still not comprehending their predicaments. 10 days following the death of the first patient, half the village had developed symptoms. 10 days after that all save those residing in this hall were sick. And the dead outnumbered the living. The clerics included. Today the last of them died. If you matched the order of their dying to where they stood around Magda's funeral pyre, it would be a perfect match of those who stood farthest to those who stood closest to her execution. The clerics got the longest sentence for one lighting the fire and the rest by association. The bodies and thus the houses started burning an hour after the last one died.""

The Knight Commander stood. His expression unreadable. ""Withdraw from this hall and mount up. Return to base."" His men did as ordered. He looked toward the survivors. ""On behalf of the Vyrintrian Empire, I offer my condolences and apologies for the death of Magda, servant of The Provider. Should any here have need of shelter or other resources they need only ask and my unit will make accommodations. We shall camp outside the edge of this village this evening and depart in the morning."" He looked directly at Drake. ""I apologize for necessitating the creation of a moniker. My report will omit the presence of anyone called Drake, Lucille, or Priscilla, nor the movement of persons to Ixonil,"" his gaze was not at Drake's face, but at the stone hanging from a cord around his neck. It held a deep green on one side, almost black in its richness. The other side a stark white. A single sigil carved within it, not by tool or hand but formed as though the stone grew around it in perfect order. ""Glory to He who Preserves and Destroys. May His servants ever know the respect they are owed. The Empress shall be informed of the foolishness of those that have perished. Mercy be upon us.""

Drake looked up at the commander. ""Duty to the Preserver above All. You need have no fear of reprisals. The debt has been paid. Peace to the Empress and her people."" He closes his eyes again. And when he opens them a little life returns, softer than before. ""I shall leave this place in the morning. Some here may accompany me, the rest I will leave in your care.""

The Knight Commander nods in acknowledgement, bows, & exits the Hall into the hazy night air of the village ruins.",43
1lmaxcu,n06gwfk,"##Hilda

The rooster called at the crack of dawn. The villagers didn’t get a wink of sleep. Not a single eye lacked bags, and every mouth had a yawn. Breakfast consisted of slices of bread so hard they broke what little teeth remained. No one complained; there was work to do.


The cows needed milking. When Hilda was made to apologize for stealing Samuel’s milk, a cow appeared before everyone’s home the next morning. It appeared to be a blessing at first. They were filled with milk, but their utters burned hands. Some were about to use them for meat. All knifes and blades broke on their coats. Everyone wanted to ignore them. They responded by rampaging through the town. At the first light, the town suffered through milking. At least it was edible.

Hilda next stole a loaf of bread from Jane. Jane yelled at her and lost her voice. Hilda then decided to give the crops the ability to scream. They were insatiable always needing watering. A system was set where people ran back and forth of water while the rest watered. That quieted the plants for a few moments. The screaming resumed until they were watered or nightfall. Rain was provided a welcome break.

The last theft was of Victoria’s wedding ring. Victoria knew not to punish her or suffer consequences. Old Man Franklin confronted her though. He told her that she was greedy for stealing, and the town didn’t deserve her punishments. She’d burn in hell for her sadism. He regretted that statement.

 A cold descended on the townspeople afterwards. Nothing froze, but everyone shivered. It was a chill from deep in the soul. Making fire become vastly more difficult. When one produced a flame, they gathered their neighbors. It was necessary to share. They huddled in the small bit of comfort and hoped sleep would come. 

Hilda left long ago out of boredom, but her curses remained. The town continued to suffer for trying to punish her. The only relief was that suffering brought them together. They kept each other alive and fighting. The curses would be gone eventually, but the town would remain.

1lmaxcu,n08spvj,"""Let me guess this correct..."" came the flat voice, barely hiding the contempt for its audience and exhaustion from the day, its owner deeply sighed and continued on ""You've noticed, and this is your own words, *unfair curses* on all of your houses over the last two weeks, that you're attributing to the removal of Niamh Odedra...""   
The speaker was cut off by the roar of the crowd at the mention of the name, this was expected as it the name brought about hisses and yells for the last two hours. The speaker expected it, the speaker still hated it, the speaker dealt with it by imagining horrible things done to the 300 sets of vocal cords that are now yelling at her direction. She raised her hands in the air in an act of corralling their attention, and the crowd died down to a tolerable level.   
""Please, please, i'm not going to yell, and then nothing will get done. Again, these *curses* that have allegedly fallen on your houses due to a specific person's removal, correct?""  
Omitting the name helped temper the crowd which murmured in what could be seen as agreement.   
""For instance, Midwife Susanne Stolly, you've stated that *pain* has come back into your house?""   
A stout beer keg looking person, with matching beer stein looking hands, came forward. ""Yea yea, Reev Fak! Every since we outsed that horrible witch, the child births are back to being painful! Three girls came in needing my help, i'm promised them an easy way of bringing their little ones into this world, but it was like old times now. We had a solid 3 years of painfree birth, but now ever since Nia..uh that WITCH was banished its pain again!""   
The crowd hollered at the end of this testament, it would have been impressive had it not been so weary.   
Reev Fak looked at the floor building up some energy ""Again Midwife  Stolly, for those three years the *witch* had provided you with some herbs for the forest that were boiled with tea and then drunk by the people you helped birth their children?""     
Midwife Stolly gave a look that was reserved for dogs that were shown a magic trick. Stolly blinked with her mouth open, scratched the side of her head with a finger that could be mistaken as a banana attempting something that could resemble understanding. ""Uh, yeah... but whats your point?""  
Reev Fak decied that she was done with her and moved on. ""Smith Krishna, you have stated your forge no longer blows as hot as it use to? Is this correct""
A bearded face covered in soot and superficial burns stood up ""Yes Reev! Like i've said, The coals don't get as hot as they use to, my fires produce more smoke than heat, my wares quality has turned to shite!""  
""Then it matches whats between your ears"" is that Reev Fak wanted to say, however she didn't and instead said ""Could this be related to the fact you knocked down the furnace that the *witch* helped design, the one that you bragged about, the one that made you the  quote *best smith in all the county*, your words not mine of course? Now that you've made one to replace it, you're now seeing poor quality products being made? You don't feel that your blights are caused by the new furnace?.""
A smug smile came over the Smith's face ""Pfff of course not! Its the same wood in the new furnance, same air i pump in it! Everything is the same! Its just been cursed""  
Reev Fak moved on ""Farmer Adisa, you've stated that your milk curdles now, which is odd as milk always curdles, not much of a curse""   
Farmer Adisa rose and removed his hat, in some effort to show respect. ""Yes Bethany, i mean Reev Fak, my milk was the talk of the town, lasted longer than anyone elses, beyond two weeks when left in the root cellars. Hell I was able to ship it out of town on 4 days journey and it would taste as fresh as it did when it came out of my corws. Now, now my cows give me common milk, it don't last longer than anyone elses, i'm ruined!""   
Reev Fak gave him a look of utter dissapointment, she looked up from the floor into his eyes ""Michael, you're no longer heating the milk like *she* told you to?""  
The farmer shot her a look ""No of course not, it was way to expensive, it was eating into my profits from the delivery, why would we spend money on something thats not actually doing anything! Heating milk was a dumb idea, but it was *her* idea, and now that we're no longer following it, she's cursed us all!""   
The crowd roared with disgust, the Reev slunked back into her chair.",11
1lmaxcu,n06eitq,"It was too late. 

By the time we returned, almost the entire village was dead, and those that remained were in such advanced stages that Elara could not help them.

I was the only one she could save. The moment the pustules of Pestilence appeared on my leg, she stirred something together in her pharmacy. I drank the bitter mixture. The pustules disappeared immediately.

I wept for seven nights afterward. If I had just worked up the courage to break her out earlier, I could have saved them all. Even a few hours earlier could have at least rescued some from the brink. But I didn't, and now there was nothing left of Mangrove Grotto. 

On the seventh night, Elara interrupted my pitiful mourning with a story.

""Where I come from,"" she said softly in that seemingly far-removed dialect of hers, ""deaths like these happen all the time. It's tragic that people die to things so easily solved. When I was just starting out my career as an... apothecary, I treated a woman who didn't trust anything I gave her, but who was forced by her family to see me. She said that my work was opposing the divine mandate, ameliorating the punishments given out by, uh, the Goddess. It was because of her ignorance that her child died, and it was only afterwards that she gave into apostasy as a result of her grief. The Goddess has given us a brain to think and hands to work with. She has given us the herbs, mushrooms, and animals that my work is built on. Miracles of medicine are so miraculous that some call them witchcraft, but denouncing it only means that you willingly give up a weapon the Goddess has given you to fight against the evils of the world.""

That only made me weep more.",228
1lmaxcu,n06l1s6,"That was the reason why Agatha returned to my village.

I was young when the deaths had started. By the time they ended, I was the only one left -- well, me and my mother, who promptly died of starvation and left me to tend to our house alone.

I picked at a scab on my face (evidence of the sicknesses I'd endured) as I heard her approach. Click of horse hooves. I thought -- maybe soldiers, maybe scavengers. Little difference between the two, most of the time; the pestilence had touched many corners of the kingdom and made them as desperate as our village, even if I doubted it was as fatal. A few came through to scavenge what they could, only to come away disappointed at our lack of food and our muddy, spoiled river.

I held my knife closer to my side.

""What are you planning to do with that, then?""

A voice behind me; I jumped. A young woman in a red cloak was studying me with her head cocked, brown chestnut hair trailing down her shoulder. She was pretty the way I imagined my mother must once have been pretty.

""Uh."" My mouth was dry. I slipped the knife into my pocket, suddenly feeling quite foolish. ""I'm sorry--""

""You can't kill me, you know."" She laughed, as if the idea was one of the funniest she'd heard. ""Though your father did try. Witchfinder General, he was. King of soothing minds and winning hearts, until there were no more hearts to be won.""

I blinked. My father? How did she know who my father was? What was she talking about?

(There was something unnatural in the way that she moved, too graceful to be human. Her pacing was too fluid. Her legs bent strangely at the joints, like a doe's.)

I stared, mesmerized by her. Something in her cloak was like the fluttering of a fire.

She knelt down and offered me her hand. Her blue eyes were very serious; they seemed to stare through mine to something beyond.

""I don't think you're a killer though, Charlie."" (*How did she know my name?* I wondered again.) ""I think you're the start of something new.""

She smiled, and eased back into standing, casting her arms wide. ""I think we're going to do quite well together.""

She ruffled my hair, for the first time of many. My cheeks heated, and she laughed. ""Well come along, then,"" she said, looping her arm in mine. ""We've got a whole village to rebuild. Families to mend, businesses to build. And everything will be as it was.""

\---

Though nothing became as it was.

The city grew as she had foretold, but it was never the same. It took a different shape. It grew too prosperous, she complained; into a true center of urban life, filled to bursting with people and energy and culture and--

Too much. Never enough.

They say that Hell is a form of insanity in which a man does something over and over -- Sisyphus dragging his rock up a hill. Of course, they also say that Earth is closer to Hell than Heaven. It's easier for demons to crawl up to than for angels to fall down upon.

I don't know if this is true, but I often insist upon it. For I am the new city's Witchfinder General. I win hearts until there are no more to win. I stoke fires and burn witches, when someone must burn.

The city expands. My flames grow higher. Agatha tells me that it's like a form of salvation, for a true witch to be reborn; a return to the pureness of the past.

Sometimes good things need to burn, she says. A distraction is a good thing now and again, she says. She bites her nails down to the quick, and her eyes are sad in a face growing older. The world is a horrible, terrible place, she insists -- and the beauty of the inferno is sometimes the only thing that keeps the evil at bay.

It's a beautiful job. A needed one, maybe.

""I needed mine,"" she told me once. And then she threaded her hand into mine, and smiled. I leaned my head upon her shoulder.

We were atop a high hill at dusk, watching the lamps of the city being lit, one after another.

The stars came out. The world was filled with a new and ancient light.

1lmaxcu,n07j76i,"I quite like the story! The last bit kind of reminds me of a statement I heard a while ago: ""if god created this world, and we wish to know god, then it is our duty to learn and experience the world.

1lmjo22,n0892rz,"We feared the hive mind.

We feared assimilation. Thought they’d vaporize our governments, enslave our brains, turn us into smooth-talking drone-people.

But when they finally arrived, they sent a politely-worded press release and a job listing on LinkedIn.

Now I work in Tier 2 Support at Global Consciousness Integration Services.

Basically, if your part of the hive mind goes glitchy, like forgetting how to blink or getting stuck in a loop thinking about your ex... I take your ticket.

Mondays are always rough. Someone’s always half-synced and walking into traffic while singing Phil Collins. One time I got a priority call from Argentina where half a city developed a collective fear of oranges. Took us three hours to reboot them.

Most problems come down to bandwidth. The hive mind’s like one big mind-palace, but instead of bookshelves it’s full of snack opinions and intrusive thoughts. There’s only so much room. Every time someone remembers the Great Global Shrek 2 Incident of '34, when a rogue memory loop caused the entire planet to reenact the dinner scene in perfect sync for twelve straight hours, a thousand scientists lose their grip on quantum physics.

We rolled out a patch last quarter, HiveOS 3.8. Supposed to streamline group empathy. Accidentally caused mass weeping in seventeen countries. Turns out empathy overflow is real.

But hey... it’s chill. Nobody’s enslaved. Most people are happier. Anxiety rates dropped 96%. World peace is mostly a side-effect of everyone knowing when someone else needs a nap.

Still, sometimes I miss the old nonsense. Not because it was better, just dumber. You didn’t have to feel a thousand other people silently judging your lunch choices in real-time.

Anyway, I filed a ticket today. Personal one.

There’s a thought stuck in my loop. A tiny glitch. I keep wondering: what happens when *they* get tired of us?

No answer yet.

Maybe the Overmind’s offline.

Or maybe it read the ticket—and didn’t think it was a bug.

Or maybe...

Maybe the Overmind does see the glitch. And it’s letting it run. Not to fix it. To study it.

Sometimes, when I send a ticket, I get... feedback.

Not from the Overmind. From somewhere else. Strange metadata tags I can’t trace. Notes like “unexpected character development” or “possible spin-off potential.”

Last week, I caught a glimpse of a file path that read: `/Edu/Simulations/SentienceStudies/Undergrad/Group17_Tier2DramaFinalPresentation_v2`.

There was a comment attached: **""This one’s funnier than the fish planet.""**

And just below it: a laughing emoji, three popcorn icons, a grading rubric… and a viewer count ticking past 18 billion.

Someone had also added a tag: **#BetterThanShrek2Loop**.",21
1lmloev,n08frxp,"I go to the back of the mountain that the strongest Hero our Empire has ever seen calls...home.  
There I find him, as I knew I would, carving yet another statue.  
Men, and women, children.   
Humans, elves, dwarves, goblins, and many more...  
Even entire cities in miniature have been carved out vividly by him.  
Now...he was carving yet another woman.  
""I couldn't save her...the demon got to her before I could."" he mutters, seeing me.  
I sat down on the ground next to him, patting his shoulder.

  
""You tried your best, and saved thousands."" I say.  
""But not her."" he says.  
I sighed.  
It was not that he knew her, or anything, but ever since being chosen as the Hero of the Empire, he took it personally to save everyone.  
""You do know that not even the Goddess herself could save everyone, right?"" I ask.  
He said nothing.  
My poor little brother...  
Fate wasn't kind to us.

  
""So, why have you come here?  
Is there another rebel group funded by some enemy? Or a new ancient terror is awakening?  
Or have the mages found a portal to another dimension, with an army ready to invade us?  
Or is there war...again?"" he asks me.  
I shake my head.  
""Your sister-in-law gave birth.  
Twins. Healthy, little girls."" I say.  
""Congratulations. The Empire has heirs."" he says.  
""Thank you...but I am not the Emperor today...but your brother.  
I have come to ask you to become their godfather, and protector."" I say.  
He sighs.

  
""I am cursed, brother...  
As the Hero, I am the brightest light of the Empire, and you know that light attracts."" he says.  
I nod.  
""You are also my brother, and I would love to see you connect with the world. When you are not on missions, you are carving here...  
You are nigh-immortal, and one of the strongest beings on this planet...it is okay to relax."" I say, taking out a jug of wine, smiling.  
He took it.  
""This reminds me when we stole dad's wine..."" he says.  
I laugh.  
""I will be their godfather...and I hope they look like their mother, instead of looking like a troll like you."" he jokes.  
""I hope so too! But I know they will be gorgeous, and smart, and witty if growing up with you around."" I say.  
He nods, and we drink, as the countless statues are staring at us, and I swear...some of them seemed to smile.",19
1lmlg1z,n0933z0,"The wooden door blew open, flying off its hinges as the golden afterglow of a concussive spell faded and nearly a dozen knights, clad in shining plate armor and wielding enchanted scepter-blades, rushed into the room. Before the knights could react or even read their surroundings, the occupant of the room spoke.

""You're late."" A cold yet youthful voice echoed, bringing a tense silence to the room. The crisp sound of paper brushing against paper followed after. ""If you canheads had any sense, you shouldn't have come.""

The boy, with pale skin and looking no older than thirteen, sat in the middle of a spacious office that once belonged to the garrison commander of this outpost of the Mysteri Knights--of course, said commander is now one of the many stiff bodies laying on the floor, arrayed in a messy semicircle around the boy--and was sitting in a relaxed manner as he calmly read a book. His red eyes didn't even glance up at the tens of furious glares piercing at him.

""The disgraced son of the Demon Lord."" One of the knights spat. From the blue plume crowning his helm and the conspicuous badge displayed on the left of his breastplate, the one who spoke just now was the Mysteri Knight commander who managed to answer the summons of Indrath Castle before it fell. ""It is you who has no sense, creature. You had plenty of time to leave, yet you chose to stay. This place shall be your grave.""

The knights quickly fell into a defensive formation, spreading out across the room so that they covered all routes of escape and stood over their fallen comrades closest to them, and leveled their sorcerous weapons at the boy. The boy remained unperturbed; even as the scepter-blades thrummed with golden energy, he merely spared them a cursory glance--he seemingly gave the fallen knights more regard as his gaze fell on them a moment longer--before reading the book once more, casually flipping to another page.

""There is no escape now, little Arkos."" The Knight commander growled. ""Even if you are a cursed child, you are a child nonetheless, so I shall give you one chance: kneel and repent for your sins and wholly reject your unholy existence and lineage, so you may be spared the fires of damnation and be saved by Her Grace--""

""Is prattling baseless nonsense all you Mysteri brutes know how to do, Nimor?"" Arkos, the pale child, cut off the knight's speech with annoyance. The torchlight dimmed and flickered dangerously, causing the other knights to tighten the grip on their weapons and fight the urge to step back. The golden light grew brighter and sharper, enhancing the luster of the boy's black hair. Arkos smiled behind the book--he did not need to open the visor of the commander's helmet to know just how ugly the man's expression was just now. ""I have told you Mysteri knights a hundred times, my mother is the Abbess of Darion-Hess and my father is Knight Greizon, one of your own. If you cannot trust my words, then ask for the documents from my mother.""

""Silence!"" Nimor roared. ""How dare you besmirch the names of those respectable people with your existence! The men and women of the Goddess Aurean could never father a monster such as you!""

""Monster? If you mean my magic, I merely am more talented than most with how early I awakened it."" Arkos flipped over to another page, memorizing the names, locations, routes and other important information within the logbook in short order. He sighed, and met Nimor's fiery glare with his calm, unbothered gaze. 'I do not have enough time to spare. I should keep them busy.' ""I apologize for my outburst just now. Seeing as I am stuck here with all of you and have nowhere to run, why not speak with me a while? I am very eager to at least clear my name in your hearts--to die knowing that not everyone sees me as the monster they falsely claim me to be.""

Nimor and the knights froze. The boy's calmness and eloquence unnerved them greatly, and the many horrible acts Arkos had committed over the years against the people of Aurean still hung heavily over their hearts and minds. The commander thought it over.

'I should kill him now. If I wait, he might be able to pull a trick and somehow escape from us again. However, if I wait...Squire Kenneth will come back with reinforcements from Fort Fenrad and Castle Loyban, and we will have enough men to surround Indrath and ensure he cannot escape!'

He finally made his choice.

""Very well, then. Speak, boy. As a knight of the Mysteri Knights, I will show leniency and allow you to  at least defend what remains of your honor. After this...you shall continue to defend that honor before the Godess' eyes.""

""Thank you for being civilized."" Arkos smiled, his gaze divided between the book and Nimor.

(Part 2 coming)",11
1lmlg1z,n09fc97,"Nimor and Arkos spoke, but mostly the boy did the talking. He spoke of his lineage, of his childhood--he grew up here in the Aurean Theocracy, and was even training under his father for a time to eventually join the Mysteri Knights in upholding justice --and many other things that a child who grew up in the Theocracy would know and experience to convince them of the misunderstanding. 

""I spent my childhood cutting wood and stone. When I was not laboring, I trained by myself. I...could not go out to play with the others. After all, I...I was not exactly welcome even in my town...""

Arkos spoke of his hardships, how he was shunned and rejected by his peers because of his unnatural appearance, and how he became a victim of rumors that paint him as a bastard child of a demon--because it pertained to his parents to an extent, Arkos even implored for Nimor to punish the rumor mongers, which only caused the disgruntled Knight commander to scoff. The boy's hands trembled slightly as he spoke of Regina-Marie, the late Saintess of Aurean...

""...she had coaxed me into following her to her quarters, and...and then she closed the door, and...she...her skirt and...""

He tearfully recounted on how he suffered at her hands after she tricked him into nearly becoming her slave, lamenting at her depravity and how helpless and alone he was at that time. He cursed at her so vehemently, recounting how he took advantage of the woman's animalistic lust to rip open her throat as she rode him, before finally saying that the Theocracy is a cesspit of sinners playing as saviors and claiming that the knights were nothing more than a tool of oppression by the Theocracy. By the end of it all, Arkos was sobbing silently as he continued reading while Nimor and the knights were shaking in their boots--not out of fear, but out of fury.

""And here you were, claiming that I speak nonsense."" Nimor mockingly spoke, veins popping with barely restrained wrath. ""I very nearly believed you, you know. I actually felt pity for you...and yet you threw it all away when you started to try and make your sins sound reasonable, you filthy wretch.""

He quickly stood up from his seat, the chair breaking into splinters from the speed of his ascent, and pointed his scepter-blade straight at the center of Arkos' forehead.

""You deceptive, slanderous child...you truly deserve to be called the child of the Demon Lord. It wasn't enough for you to have murdered the venerable Saintess and scores of valiant Mysteri knights, but then you had to go ahead and even INSULT THEIR MEMORY?!""

The blades of the scepter-blades the Knights held blazed with fiery light, causing Arkos to dry his tears and gaze seriously at the threat before him.

""DO YOU TAKE US FOR FOOLS, BOY?!"" Nimor bellowed, a small strand of reason and desire to be better than his enemy holding back the monstrous urge to plunge his weapon into this demon child's skull and burn him with divine flame.

""...I never expected to be believed, anyway."" Arkos cooly answered. While he intentionally played the part before, exaggerating his sorrows while insulting the knights, his gaze was vacant as he recalled what he had endured. ""I merely wanted to be heard, in these final moments for you.""

""Indeed, these are your final moments. It would be a further insult to the memories of those who died to let you live longer.""

Golden glyphs began to emanate from the scepter-blades' flames, floating in the air and slowly arranged themselves in specific patterns.  A few moments later, dozens of complete spell formations lit up the room, their destructive energy all pointed towards the pale child now standing with his back against the stone wall. Arkos spread his senses out, his magic blanketing the area like a bat's clicks and allowing him to 'see' all around him. Outside, he saw close to a hundred Mysteri knights and Aurean priests and priestesses arrayed around the castle--among them were the bodies of the unconscious garrison, being protected and currently being healed by the priests of any unseen injury or illness. Nimor noticed the boy's magic fluctuate and his surprised expression, and the commander sneered.

""I told you, there is no escape. The other garrisons have come to answer my call, and all of us are dead set on burying you here.""

""I noticed."" Arkos calmly faced Nimor once more. ""Did you notice that none of the knights of Indrath died, and are merely asleep?""

""Tch. Whatever ploy for forgiveness or recompense you may try, it is all too late for that.""

At that moment, the calmness of Arkos' vanished...and was replaced by a smile of smug mockery that filled Nimor and the knights around with nothing but terror--a few spell formations even came undone with some knights becoming too rattled. 

""You really should've.""

Nimor's eyes grew wide, and he looked at the fallen knights with greater scrutiny once more--a mass of dark, destructive energy nested within their bodies, near-perfectly masked by the holy energy within them. Every single body that belonged to the unconscious defenders all had this, and it didn't take long for Nimor to realize that each of them had been rigged with erupting spells. However, by the time he did...it was too late.


With a snap of his fingers, Arkos activated his trap. Close to a hundred corpses suddenly exploded with tremendous force. The office Arkos and the knights were in was reduced to ash, leaving nothing of Nimor and his Knights while blowing Arkos through the stone wall. Outside, the reinforcements were also rattled with explosions. However, the priests managed to dispel a few of these spells before Arkos set them off, so not everyone was hurt. In an instant, Castle Indrath disappeared in a flash of violence, and the hundreds of Mysteri and Aurean warriors outside were dealt a severe blow by their own casualties. Arkos crashed to the ground, managing to barely land on his feet some distance away from the rubble that was once a castle...and only a stone's throw away from a disoriented group of priests and knights.

As dark energy surged from his body, mending his mangled frame and pooling in his hands like flames of starless night, Arkos smiled gleefully at the sight before him.

""Another perfect plan finished. All of you...you really shouldn't have come.""

As he had done before, as he is about to do now, and as he will continue to do so in the days that will come... Arkos rushed into battle once more. As the confused mob began to panic as he slaughtered mercilessly those who still had sense to fight back, only one thought remained within his head and heart:

'I wish to never wake up from this beautiful dream!'",8
1lmd6kx,n06rcci,"I sigh, and turn yet another mega church away.  
Why are there so many churches by the way?  
Theoretically, they all worship God, so the Hell is going on here?  
I get it, I can perform miracle healing, and I healed last week a deadly disease, which means this churches could use me as a ""prophet"" or ""angel"" or ""apostle"" of their religion.  
But still...  
I don't want any of it.  
Sigh.  
Can't a demon have a vacation?

  
I get out of my human skin, and relax.  
Taking a hot bath of lava, and turning on Hell ™ radio to listen to the newest gossip down in Hell, I start to enjoy my evening.  
Then I hear knocking on my door...again.  
I ignore it.  
I came to Earth for vacation.  
To get away from torture, and screaming, and do the opposite.  
I won't allow others to make me in a figurehead, and use me for their benefits.  
That is cultist stuff, which is my regular demon stuff, which I won't do on vacation.

  
Despite trying to ignore it, they don't leave, and keep knocking.  
Groaning, and take on my human skin, make sure I look good.

I roll my eyes.  
Honey trap? Really?

  
""Sorry, but I am not interested in joining any Church."" I say.  
""You don't have to join us. We will send the believers with issues at wherever you want us to send them.

I frown.  
""And we will make sure that the media doesn't know that you are working with us!  
It will be no different as what you are doing now!"" the other quickly chimes in.  
I sigh.  
This church is smart...  
Not only will be a trail of paper that shows I work for them, but they also would ensure that it's only them that I heal for, so more people would join their ranks.  
If only my cultists were this smart...

1lmd6kx,n06udgu,"""So I understand your daughter has a gift.""

Mr. Peterson offers a vulpine smile, though his voice is soft, almost condescending. He's nursing a coffee mug in one hand and grabbing an oatmeal raisin cookie from the kitchen table with the other. He takes a bite as my mother recoils.

""Well,"" Mom says, smoothing her hands on her apron, ""I wouldn't call it a *gift,* exactly.""

""What would you call it, then?"" Mr. Peterson swallows and fishes out a crumb from between his front teeth.

""I had hoped,"" she continues carefully, ""That the church would send a pastor to cleanse her and this house. My daughter is *afflicted,* sir, with a demon that haunted her father.""

She's interrupted by a titter of laughter. A chuckle that makes the hairs at the back of my neck stand up, even as far away as I am, hiding behind the living room wall and peering into the kitchen.

Mom's face turns white. ""It is no laughing matter, sir!"" she snaps. ""My daughter is possessed! My house is cursed! My husband turned to drink and gambling and we have lived under that terrible omen ever since, and here you come into my house and *laugh* at me--""

""Oh, I do apologize."" He pats his lips with a napkin. By the time it's removed, the smile has wiped itself from his face. ""It's only that... Well, your daughter is not possessed. I can tell you that.""

Mom's eyes widen. ""Then, what?""

""She's been touched by God.""

A long silence. The old clock ticks on the wall, five minutes to seven. Dusky light creeps through the curtains to splatter red across the white tiles like blood from a ghostly crime scene.

""By God?"" Mom whispers. Her hand is clutching at her throat, for want of pearls (we could *never* afford pearls). ""How would you know?""

""Well."" He gives her a pointed look. ""From what we saw in the hospital records--""

""You saw that? How?""

""Our church owns a major insurance subsidiary -- but anyway, that's besides the point. From what we saw in those records and from those forwarded by the police, all your daughter did was heal a man that was almost dead. That's hardly anything demonic.""

""She turned him into a zombie!"" Mom hisses. ""He can hardly speak!""

""But he's living. That's a hell of a thing for a man that caught a bullet to the head.""

""He... What *he* is, isn't alive.""

""His beating heart would beg to differ, as would his family. What your daughter has is a gift, ma'am,"" he repeats. Then, softer: ""You needn't worry, though I can understand that any decent mother would.""

Mom turns away. She's a hard woman to read, but I notice a slight softening in her features, a lessening of the tightness around her eyes.

""We at Joshua Tree Ministries believe that what you daughter has must be shared."" He clears his throat -- and this is much more rehearsed, something he's clearly said more than once. He lifts a briefcase from the floor and places it on the table. Flicks it open, then digs out a sheaf of paperwork and hands it over to her. ""Her gift is one that can be shared with the world. It is a manifestation of God's will -- the good he can work among the ill and the needy.""

""Like in your Healing Ceremonies,"" Mom says distantly. ""When your healers place their hands on the ill. My sister was cured of her ovarian cancer at one of your services.""

Mr. Peterson inclines his head slightly, accepting thanks for something that he had little or nothing to do with. ""I am very happy to hear that, ma'am. Now, your daughter has the chance to do that for someone else."" Another rustling of papers, and he pulls out more to slide in front of her. His ears turn red; he's *blushing,* I realize, covering my mouth with my hand. He's nervous. ""We would be willing to offer a yearly salary, plus benefits, in return for your trouble. Now, I know your daughter is still a minor, and there are different labor laws when it comes to young adult performances--""

The word *performances* almost makes Mom faint dead away. She hates when our church so much as pulls out a guitar. I hide my smile as I drop a hand to play with the end of my skirt.

This might be my chance to get away from Mom; away from all of her rules and snide comments and yelling and praying. My heart thumps hard in my chest.

1lmd6kx,n07sia7,"It seemed like whoever was in charge of the universe had big plans for Tracey Blackwell. Last month, her local chapter of the SPCA had decided that the pets were going to chose their owners, and somehow she had gained the favor of the Egyptian pantheon, and she had gotten a miniature caiman named Imhotep who now resided in a cage in her living room, and ever since summer started, happily chased down and ate whatever insect flew in from an open window or door. About the same time, her healing powers had turned up a notch. For years, it had been small things, an abscessed tooth her preschool teacher was complaining about would fall out when Tracey gave her teacher a hug. Cuts and scrapes disappeared before recess was over in elementary school if she touched the wound. In middle school, her friends would press her hands over their bellies, easing menstrual cramps. She had always been able to do this, so she didn’t see it as the big deal people made it out to be. She handled snake venom on a daily basis, so no big deal right.

A woman had been having a grand mal seizure in the middle of the deli section of Harris Teeters, and Tracy, who was a thoughtful person, decided to help (she has dated someone in high school who was epileptic), getting the swarming crowed to clear the area and call 911. She got the woman’s head propped up and covered with her demon jacket. Placing her hands on the woman’s shoulder, there was a dry heaving sound as the woman vomited, Tracy supporting her so she didn’t choke. One the bile had cleared the throat, the woman woke up. “God bless you, young lady,” she had been told before the paramedics took over.

That had been a week ago, and the video showing this had gone viral. Instead of the local medical community reaching out, it was the local mega churches who came calling offering her a job as a healer. Having grown up in a Methodist household and the daughter of a preacher, these were folks her father would call “Christianity anders” borrowing the quote from C.S. Lewis’s “Screwtape Letters”. 

Indeed, the bright faced woman about her age sitting across the table from her eyed the bookshelf filled with volumes of Tolkien, Lewis and Erhman with some suspicion. “Please take our offer; Miss Blackwell! You have an amazing presence!” Tracy had seen their job offer, $64,000 a year, no health insurance and a crazy schedule of faith healings and hours long shifts at a congregation of over 5,000. 

Tracy let out a sigh, “I have made my position very clear on the matter, I do not want to be affiliated with a faith community that does not do the Lord’s work. Do I struggle with sin? Yes, but I put my faith in God and do my best. I thank you for your time, but I am not interested in starting a career as a faith healer.” The woman nodded, apologizing for wasting Tracy’s time, and left. Once the door closed, Tracy could hear the woman complain loudly that she was wasting her talents.",8
1lmd6kx,n06v6uz,"In the end -- like I knew she would -- my mother turns Mr. Peterson away, despite his bids to raise his offers of money up and up until it hits the sky.

I corner him at his car, anyway.

""Hey, kid."" He pauses, key in the ignition, to roll down his window. I only catch the ""kid"" part and have to fill in the rest. ""What's the problem?""

I shift my weight from foot to foot, scrunching up my face. ""Take me with you.""

He asks me to repeat myself. ""Take me with you,"" I say louder, thrusting up my chin.

He studies me for a moment. Taps the filter of an unlit cigarette against the door.

I don't have to ask a third time. Instead, I find myself sitting in his passenger seat.

\---

""This could technically be called kidnapping, you know.""

I'm warming up for my first set. I've been assigned a group of women with breast cancer. My heart is stuck in my throat; *just pretend if you can't really do it on the first try,* was the first bit of advice the Pastor had given me. *I made it up my first few times I healed, and nobody knew the difference.*

This, sold to me with a wink before he strode out onstage to welcome his congregation into the first act. Ten thousand voices roared back. Thousands more on television and radio are tuning in, I've heard. I swallow.

""Just so you know."" Mr. Peterson takes a drag from his cigarette, puffs smoke in my direction. I have to hold my breath to resist the urge to gag. ""I'm taking a huge risk for you, kid.""

""I'm grateful,"" I say softly.

""That *gratefulness* is gonna turn into my cut."" He jabs his cigarette at me like a sixth pointer finger, wedding ring shining in the reflected stage lights. ""I'm upping that twenty percent in your contract to forty until your mother signs.""

*Great.* I try not to sigh. I'd been hoping never to have to see her again.

Agonizing minutes pass until the pastor finishes up, and then he's gesturing me forward, and I step in front of a crowd mostly obscured by bright lights. That makes it better; I can almost pretend the people aren't real.

The Breast Cancer women are sitting in plastic folding chairs, wet hair plastered against their heads. I heard them getting re-baptized earlier. All their sins have been washed away, and now it's my job to wash their souls, or so the Pastor is saying behind me. ""You know what the Bible says: disease is sin turned outward,"" he announces to the crowd, flashing his handsome model-smile. ""So repent, all of you, and remember that a little bit of our trademark Holy Oil works God's *wonders* when it comes to internal cleansing. But now, here's our Holy Mary to cure these women of their ills.""

I take some tentative steps toward the first woman and hold out a trembling hand. I breathe out, slow.

Her eyes are shut. She's mumbling a short, repetitive prayer, something like *Jesus save me Jesus save me.* I have to close my own eyes and pray, too.

The first thing I see in my mind is that man on the street. The blood, him falling backward, hard *crack* in the air like the lash of a whip. Me running in slow motion. Cradling his head with some long-forgotten instinct, my father's voice in my ears, singing a song. *Stars shining bright above you...*

I'd remembered it as I'd held that man and held his warmth inside of me, mixed it with my own, and given it back. He'd blinked his blank brown eyes back up at me and said something I didn't recognize. Probably gibberish.

*Stars shining...*

I hum the tune to bring it back. Then: a feeling of peace settles through me. I remember my father's kind hands and kinder words, sunny long-ago days, walks along the beach. Salt in the air, gulls filling up the sky with sound. Sinking my toes into the sand.

I open my eyes. The crowd is waiting.

I lower my hands, and the woman is healed. I'm exhausted by the end of it, though; I slump down before I can even reach for the second.

The crowd roars just beyond my periphery. Everything is blurry. I can hardly breathe -- and neither can the world, I think, because the world is on its feet. And it's rabid, and it always wants more and more and more.

1lmc2je,n06mig9,"""We know.  
That's why we have dozens of ministers, countless nobles in charge of a big part of certain industries, and a lot of merchant organizations propping up the economy."" I say to the young minister of agriculture.  
He sighs.  
""But Prime Minister! The King seems younger than I am!  
When the Old King died the people celebrated! CELEBRATED!  
And now a new king is chosen the same way as the old one?  
Don't you..."" he starts, but I raise my hand.  
He stops speaking, and I gesture him to try out my tea.

After a sip of tea, I smile.  
""I understand your concerns, and I have been there.  
But you do realize that our world has various races, mages, and even deities can descend with avatars, right?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""Yes, but the ""Chosen by this or that God/Goddess"" isn't..."" he starts, but then stops when he sees my smile.  
""Sorry."" he says.  
""No worries. I am happy to see you so concerned about the future of the Kingdom, but you shouldn't be.  
The King is required, but it is not like he will actually do anything."" I say.  
He is confused.

""How? How is he required? He randomly appeared out of the portal!  
Also! He already said he has ideas of improvement!"" he shouts.  
I wait for him to calm down.  
""The portal is a summoning one, bringing souls from different worlds, and timelines.  
This is done in order to enrich the variety of souls our realm has, per the orders of the Gods.  
The soul that comes through the portal will be blessed by the world, and transformed into a native.  
The King already shows high-tier magic potential, and a rare profession which will soon awaken.  
If nothing else, the King or Queen were always good as deterrents, and champions."" I say.  
He is not convinced.  
I smile.

""And about the King's ideas...how do you know they aren't good?"" I ask.  
""How could they be good?! He is most likely under 25! What could he know?!"" he asks.  
""Do you know that our first King was also a portal summoned one? 18 of age, from a world called ""Earth"".  
He made our kingdom one of the most advanced ones, and by the way, your entire department was created by him. Before that, agriculture equaled sowing crops, and seeds and hoping that by watering it, and killing pests it will grow. It wasn't a truly studied field, as war seemed a better application for magic, than anything else."" I say.  
He froze.  
After a while, he apologized, and left to do his job.  
I chuckled, and prepared to visit the new King.  
While I am confident we can deal with whatever type of person he is...it would be nice to know early on, so that we can avoid some trouble.",28
1lmhrk8,n0975ja,"We didnt care much when the Gods came. In those days we hunted and fought and mated like lions, and they were only a temporary marvel, staining the sky like a sunset. Prehaps for a moment we paused our squabbling to point and grunt, but we had no language to discuss the implications or art to commemorate the moment. We accepted the world unquestioningly, as long as it gave us meat and sex. 

The morning after they came I was walking alone, scouting for small game, when I heard a low humming, like a hive of bees. The promise of sweet energy had me following the sound, down into a small canyon cut by a river. It was slippery and dark, but there was a faint light purple as flowers. I continued along the canyon, and the buzzing grew louder, and the light grew brighter, until I was staring into a glowing egg suspended at eye level. 

All we had was our senses, so of course I stared, then I sniffed, then I grabbed. It stung. I jerked my hand away. On the tip of my finger was a dot of blood. I howled, stumbled home to the cave, and collapsed in a heap of head splitting agony. I stayed that way for days, and as I lay there, the world changed. 

There were patterns everywhere, around me and in my mind, the two constantly shifting and mirroring each other. What had before been a raw stream of expirence began to fragment. There was a thing that was a bird, it had many instances, and those boundaries could be defined, I could reduce it into something I could hold in my head, like a rock. I could rebuild the world out of thought-rocks. I scratched at the cave walls with a real rock, trying to represent the things that were forming in my mind. 

Yet something was wrong. I was overcome by a deep dispair. Before I had been a part of something and now I stood alone. My cavemates grunted at me and brought me my share of meat, but they could not share in my struggles. As the days passed I ceased my scratchings. I could not go on like this. I had a strange urge to throw myself from a cliff, like we do to the mammoths during the great hunt. But perhaps there was another way. I went to my cavemate, one that mated with me often and always brought me what she foraged. Maybe she would follow me into the light.",6
1lm43f8,n062pyd,"My father was a horrid man. His teeth blushed yellow with shame of living in such a mouth, and his hair had long ago escaped his scalp, leaving only spotted skin. He had the subtly of a drunk bear, and a lifetime of coddling had left his brain soft as dough. I watched him sitting at the head of the table, spitting bits of gristle and gulping fortified wine, and wondered for the thousandth time what my mother had seen in him. 

At least she had only wasted a year of her life. The same could not be said of my stepmother, who sat to his left, sadly fingering her locket. She usually had the empty stare of a battle shocked soldier, but lately I would catch her looking at me like I had just stepped on a kitten. I was used to getting looks. To fit in I'd need to dust my skin with flour and wear a wig of straw. I tried it when I was younger, it was very uncomfortable and did not help the staring. 

The luncheon dragged, I was almost relieved to return to lessons with my bratty half sisters. After lessons I had free time, during which I often wandered the gardens, because no one else ever did, and it had a few plants from my mother's country. I loved them, their leaves were striped and dotted like they'd been painted. That evening I arrived to someone asleep on the bench. It was my stepmother, her flaxen hair fanned around her, one arm covering her eyes, and the other hanging off the bench, with the golden chain of her locket weaved between the fingers. The locket was open, and I could see a tiny brown face. My heart thudded, and before I could stop myself I swiped the locket from her hand. 

It was me. My stepmother jerked awake, looking at me with wild red rimmed eyes. No... it was not quite me. 

""My mother?"" I whispered, striken. 

""I loved her..."" said my stepmother hoarsley. ""It would have been fine. She could have left with her troupe that night, but there was a problem. She loved me too."" 

""I- dont understand."" 

My stepmother shook her head sadly. ""I cannot speak of what happened, I don't want to turn you against your father.""

""That PIG?"" I burst out. ""My opinion of him could not possibly be lower!"" 

I expected her to scold me, but she just gave me her empty stare. ""It could. What he did to her when he found out about us..."" she stopped. But she didn't need to say more. The evidence of his crime was standing right before her. 

I opened my mouth to speak, but I had no words. A small part of me had hated my mother, for choosing my father, and for leaving me here. But to her I was a painful memory she had never asked for. Tears ran down my face. 

""No wonder she left me."" 

My stepmother stood up and wrapped me in her arms. I always thought she would feel like a ghost, but her arms were warm and firm. 

""Blame me. I asked her to leave you. I wanted a piece of her, but I was too lost in my grief to be there for you. Not anymore. Today, things change.""",84
1lm78lw,n05taqs,"“I don’t think you’re getting it. Let’s try an illustration.”
The human interactions basics course instructor turned to a control panel. A few deft taps and a video started to play. 

The guttural growl and reverberating rumbles of the displayed beast caused a recoil among the assembled students. The one who had been arguing with the instructor involuntarily hackled, rapidly moving to smooth their fur to hide their obvious distress. 

The video was a compilation of clips, all showing an enormous, muscular, furred beast, with giant claws a gaping maw of ivory teeth. 

Having regained composure, the student spoke, “What is that thing?”

“That— that is a bear. It is one of many Class three predators present on the human home world.” 

“Class three?!” Another student sputtered. “They have more than one?!” 

The instructor nodded. “Furthermore…”

Another video begins to play. This one is a human playfully rolling around with a bear. Another clip shows a striped beast. In all cases, the humans look obviously happy. 

“As I said, if a human is scared— run.”",105
1lmb1kr,n06lgci,"I look at the goofy looking statues, and moving, grinning paintings, as my friend is freaking out, screaming her lungs out.  
""What's wrong?  
Hell ain't that scary."" I say.  
""D-Don't you see the Human Trees? The Sword like grass? Tha-that mountain that is screaming?"" she asks.  
I look around, and see a Nun like portrait grinning at me, slowly stepping out the painting.  
I throw my slipper at it, and it stops.  
""Na. IT seems chill here."" I say.  
Then laughter echoes around us.

  
""Chill? Chill? Then let it all burn!"" a voice says, as the haunted house starts...burning?  
But the flames look...small, and weird.  
My friend on the other hand, faints.  
I catch her.  
""Man. Stop this goofy as prank, and show us to our rooms already.  
Hell or not, this is subpar reception."" I say.  
The flames froze, and from the ceiling fell out a dude.  
He looked like a cheap-ass Demon Halloween costume wearing clown.

  
""Y-You aren't afraid?!"" he growled in my face.  
I hit him in the throat.  
""Your breath stinks."" I say.  
He chokes, and coughs.  
""I am a prince of Hell, how dare you..."" he starts, but I raise my remaining slipper, and he stops.  
""Our rooms. I have to wake this one up."" I say, pointing at my friend on the floor.  
""How can you not be tortured? Screaming? Terrified?"" he asks.  
I look around.  
And laugh.

  
""Hell is supposed to take on the looks of whatever the soul thinks they will see, but this means...  
This means you think Hell is nothing but something fake?"" he says.  
I nod.  
""I am here, so I know it is real, but all that bullshit up on Earth...totally fake.  
This is just a slightly worse afterlife, not going to lie, I was homeless for a few years, as a young woman mind you, this is nothing compared to that."" I say.  
Before the dude could say something, a door opens, and I can see a bed.  
""Great! Help me carry her there."" I say.  
Shocked, and almost mechanically, the ""prince of Hell"" helps me carry my friend into the room, then I shoo him out, as I get next to her, ready to sleep.  
I was tired.",23
