1ljtyzu,mzmppty,"I look as the two time travelers freeze.  
""In my world, there is no society, no order, no peace.  
Wars are continuously waged by surviving groups, for resources and remnants of technology."" the first one says.  
""If you kill him, the world will become worse, time will shatter, and randomly be altered.  
One day we are living in an utopia, the next an apocalypse, the next we are monkeys, the next we are reptiles...  
And we remember it all."" the 2nd one says.  
I take out popcorn, and start munching on it.  
The two don't like it.

  
""See? He deserves to die! He has to die!"" the 1st one groans.  
""No! No matter how much of an asshole he is, he can't die!"" the 2nd one stops him.  
I slurp on my soda.  
""You never heard about the butterfly effect?"" I ask.  
They both look at me.  
""You know, the smartest time travel I can think of, is somewhat of a combination between Dragon Ball and Doctor Who?  
Branching timelines, and fixed points that can't be changed or else..."" I say.  
They laugh.

  
""The Doctor changed the historical things so often, that..."" they start.  
""Not the biggest ones. And sometimes he saved people whom went ahead and created a better future.  
Also, theoretically, he is...they are? The Doctor is from a civilization that created time travel, and studied it for many, many years.  
You guys though? You are humans."" I say.  
""Doesn't matter. Your life choices will create the apocalypse of my world..."" the 1st one says, taking out a weapon.  
The 2nd jumps in.  
The 2 struggle a bit, before disappearing, and a 3rd person appearing.  
A young woman, dressed in a white suit, that looks like an uniform.

  
""Came to erase my memory?"" I ask her, slurping my soda.  
She nods.  
""You stopped those 2 from ever gaining access to time travel?"" I ask.  
""Those 2, and more."" she says taking out a device.  
""So, we do have a Time Agency of some sorts."" I say.  
She nods.  
""We aren't stupid. Time travel's implications were clear when they were created, and branching timelines, and changing events is too chaotic for us to allow it.  
It is a studied process, but it is prohibited to time travel."" she says, as the device lights up.  
I nod, and thank her, before the device almost blinds me.  
""Hmm...I should finish that article."" I mutter, as I suddenly feel inspired.  
I clean myself of the popcorn, and go to my study, where an article titled: ""The 4th dimension's possibilities..."" awaits me.",111
1ljtyzu,mzn5302,"Standing in the second future, I wished we had not even come here.

Adaema had gone first. Happy to share his future...a future in which if I survived would be one of the most horrible things that could happen to Mankind.

Ever.

""You would not even wish my future on a broke, tick dog,"" he had said.

It had been a terrible place. No sun. A landscape of ruined buildings and deep shadows that...clawed...was all I could see around me. Above us, from the burning red-black clouds, came strange, sickly green tentacles and insect limbs reach out toward...

I am not sure what he meant by that comment but I would not want to be that dog.

E. Bunny just looked at me, his furry head, truly a child of a *furmeet,* almost making me choice the future that was  Adaema's, most likely the worst, right now.

Good thing I hadn't.

Really. it was a great thing. Hands down.

I could not look away from what laid out in front of me, a strange, surreal world that stretched in all direction, a sea of...? A sea of...of what?

Bunnies...fluffy, white bunnies...everywhere...

1ljpk06,mzm2hr0,"As Jameson followed the scientist through the lab, he was gesturing at a wall filled with tubes; each containing a tiny red dot of a pill suspended in saline. 

""After two years of work, we've done it. We've got them in six varieties, to cover every possible customer. This one right here? If you've got type O- blood, you swallow it. It attaches to your digestive tract. Over the next few months, your reflexes go up five-fold, your muscle density, healing, three-fold. By the end of the first year, you can lift ten times as much as a non-meta  with your build, your muscles will stop low-caliber rounds... overall, an excellent equalizer against some sort of alien like a Jotun.""

""That's.... a year? That's garbage.""

""But... it works perfectly. We produce reliable results every time, with our AB+ version getting the best results.""

""The problem is that we want a serum with only temporary effects. Something we can sell with a monthly subscription service. Works fast, fades faster.""

The man gave a slow nod. ""...You saw the kind of numbers Reflex was giving Wayson's stock, and want in.""

""No matter what we sell these for.... its one and done. Wayson sells his super-reflex serum one injector at a time. Ten thousand a pop. The military is buying them like crazy, and thats just for a minute or so. If you can make this less permanent, but still stack in effect... like, say... make the nodule die in a month, and the effects reverse after too long without... we can start out-selling him.""

""...That's.... his stuff kills people who don't have excellent health. Addictive. Has to be carefully controlled. Honestly, people who've been on our stuff for a month or two would do amazing; they'd work well together.""

""Fuck that. Add something to it that kills people that take it with Reflex. And get to work on making it temporary. I want a solution by next quarter.""

The scientist watched the executive stepping out of the lab, and gave a slow nod... glancing at his interns, and turning to walk into his private bathroom; the only room on the floor that he regularly swept for bugs. Any other room in the building, they'd be... extremely suspicious of such activity.

He lifted his cell phone, and settled in; turning on a privacy field.

""Director Thomes. This is Doctor Watkins, from Arsenault Biotech... you tried to hire me a while back, and gave me your card. We've got a possible solution to help get our troops ready for the next alien invasion... but my CEO wants to sabotage it to help get monthly sales. I have nothing against profits.... but I was just ordered to introduce deadly flaws that could get your people killed.""

On the other end, a man who'd been protecting his country from superhuman and alien threats for decades gave a slow nod. ""Interesting. Sounds like attempted murder to me, and considering he's planning to sell to us, treason as well. Work as usual for now. I'll have someone there within the hour.""",185
1ljpk06,mznumzy,"Monthly subscription doesn’t really have to work fast. 

It may encourage users to buy more months. 

Imagine a poor dude getting superpower for take revenge. He would’ve bought 1 month, but because it’s slow, he has to buy 13 months and wait for his power to peak. 

Peak late-stage capitalism",9
1ljpk06,mznma0r,"I belive the problem was the effect being permanent. They want something that's fast and temporary so they can sell it as an reoccurring subscription.


From context in that last conversation, I'm guessing the ""Director"" is very high ranking in whatever they have for a government system. (Talk of ""treason"".)",16
1ljpk06,mznul6w,"That sounds like ""director of national intelligence"" sort of words.  Assuming superhero shit, they probably have a trial-in-absentia system worked out that they can use to debate the ethics of headbagging someone without having to bring them to the courtroom by headbagging them just to have the discussion.

1ljjgil,mzkdr23,"“…and *he* never truly cared about you either,” she finished with a twisted smirk.


I tried to muster up some semblance of hatred, or mild disdain at least. But all that came to me was gratitude. The woman before me, clad in fancy black attire that made her look just a little taller, actually paid attention to me. Insults or not, that was more than I could say for most everyone in my life. Hell, even some *friends* didn’t talk to me as much as she just did.


“I, um…appreciate what you said about…” I muttered, trying to find my voice.


The woman before me raised an eyebrow. Maybe she thought this was some pitiful attempt at banter before the ‘hero magically broke free of the chains binding them to the chair and beat the villain to a pulp’ or whatever.


“Yeah, the whole ‘your meaningless, insignificant husk of a life isn’t even worth my time’ was, uh, I don’t know. It made me feel seen, I guess.”


“What?” I-no! Listen to me, *hero*” - that last word oozed from her tongue like venom. “You don’t matter, and I’m only talking to you so you understand just how much pain you will feel when I’m done with you.”


I should have felt fear in that moment, but there was only one thing on my mind: was that a hint of *embarrassment* I heard? 


As if reading my thoughts, I felt the chains tighten. The cushionless chair grated against my legs, but one singular thought passed through my brain:


*This would be fun.*",120
1ljjgil,mzkjxft,"The Professor looks at the tears in Ms. Thunder's eyes and laughs. ""It's nice to finally see your tough facade break-- Wait, why are you smiling?"" 

""I'm just so happy."" 

The Professor's eyes narrow. ""Happy? You've spent the last three hours tied up, listening to me insult everything about you. Your lack of friends, lame family, boring hobbies, and even your deepest insecurities. How the hell are you happy?""

""It's just that no one has ever paid that much attention to me before. It must have taken you months of digging to uncover everything you did."" 

""More like years,"" the Professor mutters. 

""See. That's what I'm talking about. Dedicating years of your life to someone like me. It's probably the greatest romantic gesture I've ever received."" 

""R-romanatic gesture?"" The Professor stutters. ""You've got this all wrong. You're my mortal enemy. Neither of us can live while the other survives."" 

""Alright, Mr. Potter."" Ms. Thunder chuckles, then leans forward and whispers, ""It's okay. I'm into you, too."" 

The Professor gulps as he looks down at Ms. Thunder and truly takes her in for the first time. Her long, dark hair. Her piercing eyes. And lips that look so soft and inviting. *It can't be true. I don't like Ms. Thunder.* 

""I can see it written all over your face, so stop fighting it and untie me. I want to hug my new boyfriend."" 

The Professor kneels in front of Ms. Thunder and says, ""Prove it."" 

Ms. Thunder leans forward and smiles. ""Gladly."" 

*Is this really happening? Am I going to kiss someone I've been enemies with for over five years?* The Professor leans forward and places his hand on the side of Ms. Thunder's face, pulling her close. Their lips lock, sending a jolt of electricity through the Professor's entire body that sends him flying backwards, through a wall. 

After a moment, he emerges from the cloud of dust with a large smile on his face. ""Holy shit, did you feel those sparks flying?"" 

 ""Yeah, that's a side effect of kissing me."" Ms. Thunder titters. ""Most people hate it."" 

""Hate it? But it was the best kiss of my life."" The Professor runs over to Ms. Thunder and unties her. ""I know we're different, but maybe you're right. Maybe we are perfect for each other."" 

""There's just one problem,"" Ms. Thunder says as she stands. 

The Professor's brows furrow. ""What's that?"" 

""You're still a villain. I can't date someone who hurts people."" 

The Professor's stomach drops. *She's right. There's no way she could be with someone like me. But maybe I could change. Maybe this is my defining moment.* The Professor gulps. ""What if I changed? Stopped hurting people. Then would you want to be with me?"" 

Ms. Thunder smiles. ""I would want nothing more."" 

The Professor smiles back. ""Then it's settled. I'm putting this whole super villain thing to bed. From this point forward, I'm going to live a life I'll be proud of.""",67
1ljjgil,mzmlyj3,"""I... um... yeah. You're right."" Looking down at her feet, Cerise quietly spoke to her captor, her orange eyes hidden by her hair. ""Excuse you? What do you mean 'I'm right?' You aren't supposed to agree!"" Said captor, The Overlord of Darkness, approached her, his eyes aglow with confused anger and incredulity. Grabbing her chin, he forces Cerise to meet his gaze, ""I just meticulously dismantled every aspect of your life. Friends, family, hobbies, the very notion that you are some ""Chosen One"" destined to slay me. Where is your anger? Where is your fighting spirit Hero!?"" With a roar, he grabs the collar of her dress and effortlessly throws her across the room.

""Aagh!"" With a cry, Cerise slams into the far wall, the stone cracking and shifting from the impact. She falls to the ground, pulling her knees to her chest as she bites back tears from the pain. As the Overlord approaches her, she lifts her head up, only enough to look him in the eyes, and quietly mutters ""I don't have any fight... those who you call my family only treat me well as to appease the prophecy. My friends all grew distant long ago, only spending time with me in hopes of being remembered as the friends of the Chosen Hero."" Here, Cerise's eyes begin to water. ""My hobbies were only things that others bid me do. I never was allowed a moment of time for myself. And..."" her voice cracks as she wipes her nose, "" and as for me being some ""Chosen One""..."" She sniffles, her tears beginning to fall freely now. ""I never wanted to be here! I never wanted to be some great warrior, or all powerful sorceress. One day I'm living with my family, going to school, making friends... and the next some old lady in a divine robe shows up and tells me I've been chosen by fate."" Cerise curls back into her legs, hiding her face now.

""I didn't want any of this... Just, kill me and get it over with. let someone else get picked."" The Overlord stares at her for a moment, waiting for the trap to spring... surely this was some kind of trick, some grand plan to get him to fall into a false sense of superiority. Right? When he finds that the Chosen One has broken into a sobbing heap on his floor, his monologue of insults and verbal abuse seemingly having proven successful, he finds himself feeling... empty. This Chosen One was no great warrior, no equal worthy of his wrath. She was some kid, one who apparently was distanced and abandoned by her family for daring to have been chosen against her will for a purpose she didn't want.

For a moment, he looks from her, then to his spear, it's dark essence oozing off the tip, slowly coalescing into a scythe's blade. Looking back at her, he shudders, a long dormant memory surfacing, one of a sad boy, crying alone in a burnt down home as he lay over the corpses of his family. ""Damn it all."" Hearing his words, Cerise flinches, hugging her legs and trying to hold her breath. Trying, but failing as she hiccups, her crying resuming thereafter. The Overlord walks out of the room, his armoured footsteps growing distant before falling silent. Cerise, lies there, finding that she was so unwanted not even the Overlord would kill her. She continues to cry, eventually passing out, alone in the cold stone throne room of the Dark Tower.",17
1ljjgil,mzkjy0u,"Ms. Thunder runs over and hugs the Professor. ""You don't know how happy I am to hear that. Now, what do you say, we get out of here? Maybe grab some dinner or something.""

The Professor grabs Ms. Thunder's hand, and the duo walks out of the laboratory hand in hand. As they're walking, the Professor says, ""This isn't all some ploy, right? Like we're not walking into a SWAT team, are we?""

""Of course not."" Ms. Thunder lets out an awkward laugh. ""That would be so uncool."" She raises her wrist to her mouth, pretending to scratch her lip, and whispers, ""Call off the snipers.""

......

Xenarak walks back in, now disarmed and much quieter. He finds that the Chosen One, no, Cerise, had fallen asleep. Her dress stained from her tears and snot. ""...damn you to hell, Fate. Why don't you try sending a real hero to stop me?"" Without another word, he picks the girl up, and begins to carry her deeper into the tower. 

As he walks down the halls of his home, one of the shadows begins to move, stepping off the wall and approaching him. \*Tell me. What do you plan to do with her? She cannot be allowed to live, you know.\* The shadow, eerily similar to Xenarak himself, spoke in a windy, drawn out voice, as though the very air was trying to talk.

""Shut it. As of now, she is to be considered my guest. Anything that happens to her, WILL happen to you and anyone else who approaches her without MY say so. Got it?"" Xenarak stared the shadow down, his eyes still aglow with a red flame. the shadow bowed, before wordlessly retreating back into the corners of the hall. ""Now then... I need to do some reading into that whole prophecy malarkey. See just what it is you are destined to do."" Reaching a door near the end of the hall, Xenarak merely tilts his head, the shadows rushing to pull the door open for him. 

Inside was a grand study. The walls fully lined with bookshelves, save the far wall, where a grand fireplace stood. Gently, he set Cerise down in the armchair, and with a wave of his hand the fireplace crackled to life. As the magical flames warmed up, he looked at her, and at just how small she looked in his chair. Had it always been so large? Or was this girl really so small? Shaking his head, he motioned for the shadows to approach him. As they did, he pulled on them, twisting their shape and size until the shadows of the room had taken on a new form: that of a very large rabbit. ""You will sit with her, and keep her warm. Do not harm her, if you value your existence."" The shadowy rabbit silently moved onto the girl, curling into her lap and falling asleep, one deep red eye slowly traveling along its body, keeping ever vigilant of the room. Xenarak nodded, ""Good. Now, where were my scrolls on that damn prophecy...""

Many hours passed as Xenarak read, and researched, and studied. Scroll after scroll, tome after tome, he even found an old grimoire of his with some spells he had long forgotten. However, after cross-referencing so many works, he had found his conclusion. He conjured up a deck of cards, and approached Cerise. Finding her to still be asleep, he lightly poked her cheek. ""Hey, Hero. Cerise, wake up. I have a proposition for you."" Cerise stirred lightly, moving away from his touch before her mind seemingly took notice of the strange creature on her lap. with a start she pushed the rabbit away and leapt from the chair.

""Ahh! No, I'm sorry! I... wait. Who... who are you?"" Cerise looked around, taking in the sight of the study, the books, the fireplace, she stared at the shadowy rabbit that had curled itself up at her feet, gently kicking it only to see it look up at her with two eyes that moved independent from the body. ""Where am I?"" She looked at Xenarak again, taking in his eyes, barely an ember of flame within them. Dark bags weighed heavy under them, and his face wore a natural frown that somehow felt more tired than sad. Xenarak spoke up, his voice calm. ""I am Xenarak, the Overlord of Darkness. We are in my Grand Study, and as I said. I have a proposition for you, if you'll hear me out.""",21
1ljjgil,mzmm1gw,"At this, Cerise flinched, instinctively moving back before remembering the fireplace behind her. The magical flames feeling hot to the touch, but otherwise leaving her unharmed. ""I... I'm not that old, you know. My body is worth much off your time. Unless, you're into that, but-"" before she could finish, Xenarak spoke over her, his voice practically sucking the words out of her throat. ""No! No, human... sigh. Cerise, you are the Chosen of Fate, destined to best me and bring peace to the land. I do not desire your body, I am not some lech. Rather, I offer you the ability to free yourself of this undesired fate."" Xenarak shows her the deck of cards holding them out for her to take one. ""If you can successfully hide your card from me, you will have beaten me. In doing so, your Fate will have been met, and you would be free to do as you wish. Failing to do so, in turn, would mean I have bested you, which would make you a fallen hero. A fallen hero who, in the eyes of Fate, is not worthy of serving the side of 'good' and 'justice'."" Cerise stares at him, pulling a single card from the deck and clutching it to her chest. ""So the choice is yours, Cerise. You may take that card and run, be forced to live with your Fate. You may try and hide that card, and thus best me and be free to return to your so called friends and family, or... you can 'hide' the card, and become a fallen hero. Stay here, and join me and my brethren in the dark. The choice, is yours."" 

Cerise looks up at him, tears welling in her eyes anew. Now though, rather than tears of sorrow and self-loathing, these were... happy? Joyous? ""Why?"" She stammers out, her voice hitching in her throat as she chokes back her tears. ""Why are you being so nice to me?"" Xenarak looks down at her, at her card, ""You seem like someone who could use a safe place to shelter. A friend. You, remind me of someone from long ago, and I would be remiss if I didn't try and do right by him."" Cerise ponders his words before not so subtly putting her card just below the very top most card of the deck. Bashfully, she hides her face in her hands, her rabbit companion nudging her legs as it attempts to comfort her. ""Are you certain of your decision, child?"" Xenarak asks, wanting to make absolutely certain she was okay with what he was to do. A simple nod is her only response. with a subtle grin, Xenarak grabs her card, revealing it to her. ""So then, it would seem I have successfully drawn your card, hero. Thus I have bested you in a single combat duel. You are not worthy of your Fate, and must now live out your days as a fallen hero. A disgrace to the divine above. I offer you a home here in my tower, if you so wish."" Cerise looks up at him, smiling. She leaps forward, jumping into a hug with him, crying into his chest. ""Thank you. Thank you for caring about me..."" 

As Xenarak looks down, the visage of his past melts away, and he stares at Cerise's small form. ""You are welcome, child.""",26
1ljussf,mzmu5jc,"Yet another knight is tossed out...by the princess.  
""Humph, they don't see gold even when not blind!  
Men!"" she mutters.  
I try to calm her down.  
""Sister, relax...  
I thank you for this, but..."" I start.  
She turns around and stares at me.  
""Look at you! Gorgeous! Tall! Big bosoms, and a wide hip!  
Why the hell do they care about those horns, or the tail?"" she says.  
I blush.

  
I watch her walk around, and send yet another message to her father, the king, that she is still trapped by the ""evil"" dragonness.  
It is a lie.  
She, the princess, I saved when she ran away from an arranged marriage a decade ago, and we became sisters.  
Now...she is pretending to be trapped in my tower, trying to find me a nice husband.  
Knights, wizards and many professionals have came.  
None passed her test?  
Why?  
Because the test is first to not attack me on sight, but...  
I look at myself.  
How could that ever happen?

  
I watch the wizard being thrown at by his beard.  
""Ugh...wizards and beards, what the hell is going on there?  
And I thought this one is promising, as he actually didn't attack you on sight, but...  
He flirted with me?! When you are here?"" she says.  
I smile.  
""It's okay, sister.  
Let's go an eat."" I say.  
Her actions warm my heart, but...  
The word ""sister"" starts to feel...odd.

  
We eat dinner, and go underground to take a hot bath.  
She talks, and talks about her plans for her kingdom, when she takes over, about how she will make me the kingdom's guardian, and so on.  
""What about a family? A husband?"" I ask her.  
She snorts.  
""What man could ever be good enough for me?  
Maybe a woman like you."" she winks, standing up, leaving the waters.  
""Yes please!"" I say too quickly, too eager.  
I blush, as she laughs, and leaves.  
I submerge in the hot waters almost completely, staring at her leaving figure...  
""If only she would truly consider it...  
We would be so perfect together...we already are...."" I mutter, hoping one day I will get the courage to confess, before...before it is too late, and this little boss sister of mine, weds me to someone.",22
1ljw6tc,mznv2in,"I couldn’t *believe* how well dinner was going, the food, the conversation, the atmosphere – even though all of the waiters were sims... I could ignore it this time, it just felt right…I couldn’t help but ask her, “So...should we take this back to my place, or yours – whatever you prefer!” I did my best to hold a flirty and smug expression; not my forte.

“Oh…Mark, I-“, she started, her expression suddenly flush with worry, “I would, I…I really do want to but…I can’t. I don’t…I’m just, synthetically integrated you know…and”

I cut her off, “Wait – what?!”

“Yah, you know, I did this so long ago, and I just didn’t get the parts, I didn’t think something like this would happen! You know, I’m still married and I just - “

“Hold on just a FUCKING minute – what the fuck are you saying?!”

“Mark!, what’s wrong?”

“I can’t fucking believe this! Like, what the FUCK?” I immediately stood up.

“Mark, please wait!”, she reached out her hand to stop me.

“DON’T….don’t fucking touch me please….” I grabbed a fistful of cash, some amount, any, I didn’t care, and threw it onto the table so I could stormed out.

Outside of the restaurant was typical cold autumn evening for the bay. Despite walking as fast as I thought I could, I didn’t get far until I just slumped into a wall. I can’t fucking believe this. Not this time! NOT – THIS-FUCKING-TIME. I really liked her…

“fuck….” I whispered to myself, burrowing my head into my hands. Why….just why is EVERYONE doing IT?

Miraculously my phone buzzed. Gary.

Thank fucking god, GARY!

“Gary, for fucks sake, thank you” I blurted as I picked up.

“Shit Mark, is everything okay? I was just calling to see if the date was going well, honestly hoped you wouldn’t pick up.”

“No man...”I said in a hoarse voice “It kind fucking …ugh man I just – you wanna get a drink?”

“McAlester’s on 52^(nd)?”

“Yes, ***please!***”, I said in relief.

“Alright, I’ll be there in 15.”

\-",17
1ljw6tc,mznv3v5,"The cab ride over was unusually slow, I hoped that Gary wouldn’t be stuck waiting. I hated being late with him. He was the only ***real friend*** that I had left. I made sure to never take that lightly.

Our newest manifold is the lightest, strongest, and most capable yet. Perpetuity of conscious, an infinity of possibilities…schedule an integration with us today…”*

“DAMN, could you shut off this thing? Or like change the channel or something?” I complained to the cab driver.

“HA! I wish, but somethin’s gott’a subsidize yah cheap fair ain’t it?” I could tell he was trying at some sort of eastern accent…it wasn’t working

“Fine, we’re almost there anyways…” I hissed, as the cab driver glared at me from his rear view.

1ljw6tc,mznv832,"The bar was usually packed for a Tuesday night – Fucking sims, now they found this place! Gotta ruin just about fucking everything. Couldn’t they just stick to their fancy night clubs downtown? Jee-

“Mark!” Gary motioned from the deep inside the bar. I practically sprinted over, just excited to see my best friend…to hang out with someone REAL.

“Fucking GARY! Man! AHHH! I needed to see you bro!” I reach out and gave him a hug – not my usual – but I needed it to night. He felt oddly stiff, it was usually me that was the uptight one.

“Hey Mark, come on…have a seat – what happened?”

He made a glance at the Bartender, not the guy who was usually here…

“Agghhh, Mary man…MARY, ugh what the fuck?” I lamented.

“Mark….use your words – haha”, he responded warmly.

“We were having a really good night – I mean really good!”

“uh uh…”

“And like, even BEFORE tonight, our conversations, I really haven’t connected with someone like this in a LONG time - ”

“yep…that’s true, you arree a bit of a pick-…lonely uhhh wolf”

I glared at him a bit

“You gonna let me finish…?”

“yes Yes…go ahead”

The bartender dropped off our usual drinks, no idea how because I’d never seen him before, but I happily jumped at mine, I needed…SOMETHING.

“Look, 3 dates in almost 2 years, and she’s a FUCKING SIM Gary…a SIM! Like- what the fuck man?! Why me?? Agghhh” I took a big sip.

Gary nursed his a drink a little, “Mark…I mean” I gave me a patronizing look, “Is it REALLY all that bad?”

“Duuuude!”

“This…is the society we’re in now. I feel like, everyone has become…***comfortable*** with it Mark. We don’t want to be like those old men we learned about in school who couldn’t adapt with the times.”

“Naw man, I don’t need a history lesson right now. It’s just NOT right. I feel like everyone around me has just GIVEN-UP.” I started counting on my hand, “My parents, my sister – bro – Lisa, Alan…TED! TED man?! Like he was ALWAYS anti-what everyone else was doing!”

“ah…” Gary sighed in a resigned matter, and took a bigger sip of his drink.

“It’s like me and you are the only ones left man, we’re the LAST hold outs!” I took another big sip of my drink, “We ***KNOW*** what it ***means*** to be REAL - ”

He cut me off , “You remember Mike from football?”

“Mike…oh! BIG MIKE?!”

“Yah! Big Mike!”",15
1ljw6tc,mznva2z,"“Man!! I totally forgot, it’s been so many years! Ahhh! He was so good man, had to be the best quarter back to ever come out of our small town! I still can’t believe what happened, they did him dirty…”

“Yup, blew out his knee, and UCLA revoked his scholarship.” He took another sip.

“ugh, so fucked! What’s he up to now? Do you know?” I asked, almost excited to hear about an old friend from back home we forgot.

“I actually spoke to his mom last week when I went back to see the folks”

“oh, yah?!”

“Mark he…didn’t take losing the scholarship well, football was really his identity…”

“Shit man, well fuck it – let’s go back and cheer him, up! Do something with him! All these years man, I can’t believe I forgot! I’m no better than these fucking sims”

He winced a little, “Mark he…he didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean?” I asked almost rudely.

“The whole…losing UCLA, he…jumped into the ridge shortly after we all left for school”

“what the FUCK? Why…why weren’t we ever told about this? The FUCK?” The room, started to turn.

“His mother told me they felt ashamed, that they didn’t…that they **couldn’t** see the signs.”

“man…what the fuck.”

“That’s not even the point of this story though…” He looked down at his drink pensively. “The year after his accident, UCLA allowed SIMS to join and play on scholarships. It was actually supposed to happen his year but, it was delayed because the Coach was holding out on some… technicality.”

“So…what the fuck does that have to do with anything?” Everything came into focus suddenly. I could feel a bit of anger boiling up inside me.

“Well…the POINT Mark, if he could have had access to that, if he could have integrated…maybe things could have been – Better.”

“what?!” I gasped.

“Maybe, he could have played, maybe he could literally be sitting next to us having a drink – right - now.”

I finished me drink and just glared straight into his eyes. “That’s actually fucked Gary.”",11
1ljw6tc,mznvawi,"“Mark…”

“No, like why the FUCK would you tell me that? YOU KNOW WHAT I’M GOING THROUGH! WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BRING THIS UP?!”

‘People’ started to look over at us, I was making a scene.

“GARY, FUCK THIS MAN, I CAN’T RIGHT NOW. I LOVE YOU BRO, BUT FUCK THIS”

“Mark!” He yelled after me as I marched out of the bar.

The cold outside snapped me out of almost instantly, damn it was chilly for October…I turned to go back in, and Gary was already out next to me.

“I’m sorry man,” I whined to him.

“It’s okay, let’s just, call it a night..” He responded carefully.

“Ah I’ll go in and pay for the drinks, I don’t wanna burn this spot…”

He stopped me, “Its ok, I took care of it.”

“What do you mean? I didn’t *see* you pay, and I walked out like 5 seconds ago”

“I paid, don’t worry”, he said more firmly.

Then it clicked…it all fucking clicked.

“No…NO GARY! FUCK NO!”

“Mark…I – I’ve been meaning to-“

I cut him off, “You were the LAST – REAL – FUCKING PERSON IN MY LIFE GARY!”

“Mark, THIS is the future, you have to get with the times. Your parents **begged** me to talk to you about integrating.”

“MY PARENTS?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Gary! You’re supposed to be MY FRIEND! FUCK MY PARENTS.”

“Mark, respectfully, as you friend, you literally the only one who’s holding out, and you’ve never really had a good reason…” he chided.

“Gary…I need you to just…just…hear something right now.”

“Yes Mark?”, he responded impatiently.

“FUUUUUUCK YOOOOOU GARY!”, I then stormed off.

I fell to my knees. “What’s the point…?” I whispered…to no one.

I didn’t…I didn’t BELIEVE in integration, and I don’t see why I had to defend that. I don’t UNDERSTAND why I seemed to LITERALLY be the ONLY person who felt this way.

And maybe that was the problem…maybe this is why I have been struggling since all of this started 10 years ago.

I don’t belong in this time, and I-DON’T-KNOW-WHY.

I wish I could have been born before technology made us this way…Maybe that’s possible…something about reincarnation we learned in high school…?

My eyes started to burn, yah it had been a while…As my vision blurred in that stingy hot wetness, I saw the train barrier lights start to flash.

“Iconic” I said to myself, as I watch the barrier come down, a small spotlight approaching from the left.

“Impulsive” I said to myself, almost rallying this new…***idea.***

\- APTOS HEADQUARTERS 11:52pm -

“Trial 041 has terminated…unsuccessfully” Announced the small test android.

“AGAIN?! You FAIL TO DELIVER RESULTS!” boomed the MANAGER as he stared at the monitors, surprisingly upset given the 40 failed trials before.

“Surprising that the appeal from a childhood best friend was non-functional-”

“IRRELEVANT, YOU MUST FIND A WAY! YOU HAVE 8 MORE CHANCES!”

“My apologies, we will culture another embryo.” The android lamented.

“AGH! This takes TOO LONG! 30 YEARS. 30 YEARS! EVERY TIME 30 YEARS!” his voice echoed through the lab, shaking the equipment. “Figure it out before you use all 50 embryos, or I will have decommissioned and replaced…”

The MANAGER abruptly stood up and reached for the door.

“Sir?”

“WHAT?!”

“Why do our experiment number aliases not align with the sample labeling? This would indicate an error in our experiment logic” the android prompted carefully.

“Your purpose is NOT to ask questions, but to run experiments.” He responded shortly has he swiftly left the lab and slammed the door behind him.

The android, seemingly unphased, picked up vial “#50342” from the tray and took it to the culturing unit.",10
1lk1j9a,mzoabyh,"I struggle to defeat one of the villains with my swordsmanship.  
The others smile, and help me out.  
""Come, Sword Girl, I will treat you to some ice-cream."" the captain says, as they all fly away.  
I follow on my sword.  
It is a bit upsetting, that I am considered the weakest in my team.  
If only they knew...  
That I can transform anything into a sword.

  
After the ice-cream, we had another call.  
A villain group attacked a governmental facility.  
When we arrive, there are at least a hundred villains waiting for us.  
""You don't get to stop the boss this time."" they roar, attacking us.  
The fight is miserable.  
I watch as we defeat them one by one, but they are too many.  
Soon, we start to tire out.  
And I am almost the first to die.

  
""Agh!"" the captain roars, taking an ice-blast for me.  
""Captain!"" I shout, catching him.  
""Run! They are too many! This was bad intel!"" he says to me.  
I sigh.  
""What now, little girl? Want to play with our ""swords""?"" the villain grin as they push back the other members towards the captain and me.  
""I am sorry."" I mutter.  
Before the captain could say anything, screams echo beautifully, as blood blossoms around us.  
The villains' left hands turned into swords, and flew out towards me.  
All the villains collapse.

  
""S-Sword girl?"" Captain stutters.  
I focus on the facility, from where a Titan form steps out.  
""You? You stopped my fellow brothers?  
Heh...too late though, I succeeded in awakening my power for the 4th time, now, I am invincible!"" it roars as it takes a step towards us. The ground shakes.  
My teammates launch attacks at the villain, but he is too big.  
""Sword."" I mutter, as its left leg turns into a sword, and it collapses.  
My team stares at me incredulously.  
""S-sorry... It is dangerous, and hard to control...and...and..."" I stutter.  
""THAT WAS AWESOME!"" they shout, hugging me.  
I freeze.  
""You aren't mad?"" I ask.  
They laugh, and shrug it off, as if it isn't a big deal, then start teasing the Captain for having the hots for me.  
I blush...and as we fly away, I feel warm...I am lucky to be in this team.",16
1lk0jmx,mzo9h3a,"I watch Miss Lia obliterate the villains.  
The rest of the team has long gone home.  
Not only is she the heiress to one of a major biotech corporation, but she is also a genius, who is a super superhero fangirl.  
She used her wits, and the company's resources to augment herself to join us.  
We are the best superteam of this planet...  
She did such a good job augmenting herself, that she made the rest of us obsolete.  
She overpowers all of us.  
Now, she is done with the villains.

  
""Done, Captain Moonlight! How did I do?!"" she beams at me.  
I smile, and pat her head.  
""Good job, Miss Lia."" I say.  
She pouts.  
""Sorry, Mistress Gene."" I say.  
She nods.  
""Where is the rest of the team?"" she asks.  
""Let's go. I will take you to a secret place of mine."" I say, as we fly away, just as the law enforcement arrives to apprehend the villains.

  
A few dozen minutes later, we are atop a hill, eating delicious ice-cream.  
""Is it that bad?"" she asks.  
I sigh.  
""You don't have to sugarcoat it.  
I have been helping dad with company stuff since I was 7. I fired my first employee at 9."" she says.  
""It's not firing, Miss Lia, but you do understand that you managed to augment yourself so well, that you can adapt to any situation?  
You require no team. You are the team."" I say.  
She sighs, as she looks down.

  
""I just wanted to be with my heroes...  
You guys saved me once...when the villains broke into one of our laboratories, trying to steal some viruses."" she says.  
Oh. I didn't know that.  
""You can hang out with us, you know?  
The Hero Association allows and even promotes inter-hero team activities.  
You can create your own team, and we could have joint missions."" I say.  
""Really?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Great! I am going to create one right now! Sparkling Genes!"" she laughs, flying away.  
I chuckle as I watch her leave.  
""Does this mean she accepted being kicked out of our team?"" I mutter, before I finish my ice-cream, and fly away as well.",5
1ljcvh3,mzixh62,"""What now?"" I ask.  
The old man sighs.  
""I want to sell the shop to you."" he says.  
I freeze.  
This is a shop that wasn't here yesterday.  
A thing out of fantasy tropes that I really, really love.  
These places always have things never seen before, and magic so strong, and so closely tied to Fate, that few dare to mess with them.  
But now...I am offered one?

  
""Why?"" I ask.  
""I want to retire."" he simply says.  
I nod.  
He does look...weary.  
""What would be the price? What would be my responsibilities? How much freedom one has with a Mysterious little shop like this?"" I ask.  
He smiles.  
""Good questions.  
The price would be your willingness to take over."" he says.  
Oh boy...  
This is bad.

  
""Again, why? Why would that be enough of a price for a place that has souls, magic, and superpowers, and more as merchandise?"" I ask, gesturing around.  
He laughs.  
""Because other than youthful dreamers, nobody would accept the status of being the owner of such a place.  
The Shop never stays for long, never stops for anyone, and it is up to Fate whom finds it, and what wares are in it when it is found.  
Sometimes, there are items given by other customers, other times the items are from the dreams and nightmares of the universe.  
The Shop was, is and will be, but at the same time, it wasn't, isn't and won't be here, ever, and forever."" he says.  
I sigh.  
""My responsibilities then?"" I ask.  
He smiles.

  
""Be here. Welcome the customers, and with the help of the Shop get stronger, so stronger places can be visited."" he says.  
""I also have to be strong?"" I ask.  
""The Shop can protect itself, and the owner, but not always.  
And sometimes, you have to run errands, also, having strength is never bad."" he says.  
I agree.  
Thinking back on my life here...  
""I accept. I voluntarily accept being the new owner of this Shop, and accept the tasks, and responsibilities that come with it."" I say.  
He smiles.  
""The Shop is yours. Good luck."" he says, disappearing, and I feel it. The Shop.  
I am connected to it, and I can feel its desires and its rules, and indeed soon...it moves through space, and time, and my journey begins.",172
1ljcvh3,mzjdv3i,"I always wanted a shop of curiosity of my own. 
So when the old timer made me an offer to buy this shop I jumped at it. 

Did not think twice. Swiped my VISA card. Pricked my thumb. Signed the paperwork in my own blood even placed a bloody thumb print next to my signature. 

The shop and all it contains is mine. 
I did not even notice the wording. 

All the shop contains are mine. 

All that the shop contains, are mine too, care for, house, feed, protect, repair, restore, rescue, restrict, find new homes for, keep safe, blah blah blah ….. it continues down the page.  

Geese old timer, get out much.  

I fold and slide my copy of the papers into my pocket. 

I walk up and down the isles, amazed at all the wonderful things in the shop. 

I trip over a tortoise 🐢 I had not noticed before.  I spring back up to my feet. 
“Sorry big fella I missed you there. No bad feelings I hope?” I say aloud 

The Tortoise spoke “ no problemo friendo , could you please give me some sweet prickly pear cactus?” 

I stumbled backwards, “you can talk?”

The tortoise spoke again “You can talk too. But can you get me cactus friendo?”

I looked around, “I didn’t see any cactus, do you know where it is?”

Tortoise replied, “friendo if I knew where it was, I would not be asking you for it. You are the new owner are you not. ?”",59
1ljcvh3,mzjgegl,"""Wo, wo, wo. I just came in looking for a way to curse my annoying neighbors. I don't need a whole store.""

The old man shrugs. ""Too bad. I already signed over the magical contract to your name. And it's legally binding.""

""How is that possible? You don't even know my name.""

""It's embroidered on your shirt, Jeanie.""

Jeanie sighs. *Shit.*

The old man pulls out a bundle of keys from his back pocket. ""You'll be needing these.""

Jeanie's eyes widen. ""Why the hell are there so many?""

""Well, we house about seventy different types of magical creatures. And then there is the octa-locked front and back doors.""

""Octa-locked? Like eight locks? Are you worried about burglars or something?""

""Oh, yes, very much so. We usually have three to seven break-in attempts per week.""

Jeanie leans against the front desk. ""So let me get this straight. I am now the store owner responsible for the feeding and caretaking of seventy different magical creatures, *and* there are weekly break-in attempts?""

The old man raises a finger. ""Violent break-ins.""

Jeanie sighs. ""Please tell me the store is at least profitable.""

The old man laughs. ""Nope. We've been in the red for over fifteen years.""

Jeanie's eyes narrow. ""How the hell are you still open?""

The old man smiles. ""Grit, determination, and a whole bunch of loans I don't intend to pay back."" He places the keys in Jeanie's hand.

""Is there anything else about this hell-scape of a store that you've forgotten to tell me about?""

The old man taps a finger against his chin. ""Yes, there is one thing. Follow me.""

Jeanie follows the old man into a back room and down a long flight of stairs. After a few minutes, they arrive in a room lit by torches. There is a large ""X"" on the ground in the center of the room.

""What the hell is this?"" Jeanie asks.

""This is the ancient Krizoan resting site. If you don't offer it a human sacrifice once per month, it will stir from its slumber and wreak havoc upon the world.""

""There's no way I can handle--."" Jeanie turns around and sees that the old man has disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a signed contract of ownership transfer on the ground. She sighs and looks down at the ""X."" ""At least this will solve my neighbor problem.""

I walk back to the front. After several minutes I finally find the front of the store and the checkout counter.  
Dang I didn’t think this place was that big. 
I almost tripped on the tortoise again. 
I squeak out of fright, then ask, “how did you get here so fast? You are a Tortoise? “

The Tortoise said “ don’t be rude, I took the direct route. While you lolly gagged up and down the isles. A guy could starve to death “ 

At that moment a cat jumped on the counter, said “BOO!”

I fainted 

I felt something cold on my forehead. I slowly opened my eyes. A beautiful glowing blue woman kneeled over me. Her hand was on my forehead. 

The blue woman said, “he is coming to, now everyone be nice, I warning all of you.”

I tried to sit up. She places a cool hand on my chest. 

“Just wait a minute you smacked your head when you fainted “ she spoke softly with a delicate tone. 

I stared into her deep blue eyes. I felt myself slipping in, like sliding of a boat into the deep blue ocean. It was so calming, peaceful. 
I whispered “who are you beautiful?”

She adverted her eyes, “I am Aerial , I have healed your head. You can stand now “.

I stood with help from Aerial, “my name is Jeff and I am…”

The cat says “ The meowing new owner, so sorry I frightened you. I just wanted some attention. Back and chin rubbing you understand. “

Aerial said, “ that is Felix he can be a bit naughty at times “

Aerial motions to the tortoise, “has Bob properly introduced himself?”

I say, “that’s right he is very hungry for prickly pear cactus. No he didn’t tell me his name. Where do I find cactus?”

Aerial says “there’s a number on the side of the register, call that ask for Bob special, they will deliver it. And charge to store account. “

Felix is tapping his paw above a note taped to the register. 

Aerial continued, “but Bob only gets that once a week. Normally he eats carrots, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, a wide variety of vegetables. “ 

Bob snorts, “he did not need to know that “

I make the call. 

I turn to my new friends, care to show me around? Give me the 411 on the shop? 

Aerial grabs the crook of my arm, “my pleasure cutie “

Felix jumped off the counter, “I know where all the cool stuff is “ he rubs against my leg then runs ahead. 

Bob says “I am waiting right here for my food “",50

The shutters open.  
""Morning, House."" I say.  
The window opens as well, with a slow creak.  
""Yeah, it is early."" I mutter, getting out of the bed.  
The door to the bathroom opens, and the shower starts running.  
""Thanks."" I mutter to my sentient house, before starting my day.

  
I go downstairs, and make myself some breakfast.  
The fridge door opens, and then so does the microwave.  
When I am about to sit down, the chair is pulled out.  
""Thank, House.  
How are you today?"" I ask.  
The cupboards slam softly.  
""I see. Well, it is a long day for me as well, but let's do our best."" I say.  
The cupboards slam thrice.  
I chuckle.

  
As I leave for work, I see the window in my room closing.  
I chuckle.  
My roommates are still asleep, not that they would get this treatment from House.  
First, I was also scared, and House tended to play pranks on me, but...  
I got used to it, I started to be polite with House, buy some gifts, and guess what?  
House started to like me.  
Now, I don't have to worry about keys, socks, or anything going missing, because House has my back.

1ljcfp8,mzkdam3,"""Hey, where's my shoe?"" Ava called out in confusion. 

A soft chuckle, barely audible unless you were listening, escaped the walls. The girl looked around frantically, maybe panicking a bit. She had a bus to catch to work. She had her phone, her purse, her socks, her pants, her shirt. But one shoe had mysteriously vanished. Well, I say mysteriously, but we know what really happened.

I leaned close and whispered softly, taking a moment to pat the wall lightly. ""Yeah, I like having her around too, she's a cupcake. But enough messing around. We don't need her getting fired, then she won't be able to come over and sing to you."" 

After a long moment, a panel of floor slid open, sounding like a sad sigh. Inside was the missing shoe. Ava knelt down to pick it up and put it on, and gently closed the floor panel. Her gaze was filled with confusion, and I chuckled lightly. Within moments, the girl was ready to go. 

The house sighed softly again, this time sounding like an old creak. He was great at not letting on that he was sapient, and I could hear the annoyance in the sound. He was gonna miss her. So was I, for that matter. Only a few seconds had passed since Ava had left, and the house shuddered slightly in sadness. He liked her as much as I did. 

Oh, but he HATED my brother. My brother was a loud, rude, ignorant, arrogant, sack of . . . Hey, relax, I hate the guy too. I'm trying to tell a story. But I'll watch my mouth, okay? Anyway, my brother, he come over one day, right? And the house knew right away, he hated the guy too. Hid the car, the car keys, phone, shoes, socks, coffeecup. If my brother set it down, the house hid it. Coffeecup came back crushed, keys came back mangled, car came back with no paint, no gas, and no engine fluids. Shoes were shredded, socks had holes chewed in them. Then the Piece Of Resistance. Yeah, buddy, I know it's French. But I don't speak French. Anyway, icing on the cake, phone came back, totally wiped. Yeah, House can be a dick to people he doesn't like. Eats and destroys their stuff.

But when he does like you, he only hides a single shoe. Like he did with Ava. It's an attempt to convince her to stay a little longer. Hey, look. Your shoe is missing. House, did you do it again? He must like you too, nobody's ever stopped to bring him a present. Yeah, feel free to stick around a bit, makes House happy when people stay. Just make sure to thank him if he does something. He really likes that. 

So yeah, House is sapient, and a good friend. We get along most of the time. He likes it when people sing sometimes.",37
1ljcfp8,mzjxupu,"I heard Asa before I was awake enough to open my eyes.

A soft purring and warmth moves against my side, the light touch of sharp claws on my skin as the large paw pushed me gently away from the wall of the longhouse, letting the morning chill in under my blanket. I turned toward the central fire, wrapping myself in the fur-covered skin of a *roshvalr* as I wake up.

The sounds of the family starting the day filled the longhouse as I slowly come up from sleep to fully awake. I start identifying the different sounds as the Family beginning their day. The other Elders and Adults, the ones not out on the hunt were already moving about getting slower members up and talking about the day with each other. I hear them as they tell the children and youngling what tasks that needed to be done before anything else happened, they were sent to lessons, or just to play.

*Fire and food first,* I thought as I heard a slap and yip as one of the child must not have been moving fast enough.

Asa was not one for slow responses. She very much took care of the Family.

""Where is my great knife?"" I heard Smemel asking with anger in his voice. From the way the light danced, he must have just come in from outside the longhouse.

*He should have been on the hunt*...I think.

Smiling in the dim morning light that was beginning to filter into the longhouse, I think, *Asa,* and shake my head, sitting up.

Asa never really warmed up to Smemel. He may have married my granddaughter, Hevlel, but Asa never liked him to start with. He was a member of the Elks-Run-Far tribe and was grumpy most of the time. Not his fault that Asa does not like him but she remembers his people. Even I remembered the raid when I was young that had burned the storage room of the longhouse and left us hungry for a season. Smemel had not even been born yet but Asa held a grudge and she had a long memory.

If she did not like you, she let you know it.

*I wonder what Smemel did this time.*",14
1ljcfp8,mzjxxzm,"I know his knife will be someplace he can see but will not be able to get at...most likely because of his size... He was big...bigger than most of the Family.

Soon the sound of children bring wood in and piling it up cracked around the longhouse, Huen and Inger were fighting again about where and how to pile the wood for Mehaen, my eldest daughter. Mehaen, who was preparing the morning meal, was humming to herself as she worked. She did love taking care of us and morning was when she shined. Stoking the fire, getting the younger children out from under foot, and starting the morning meal for those of us left in the village.

I felt the air change subtly as Asa helped Mehaen with the fire. Asa loved Mehaen almost as much as she loved me.

My belly make noise when the sizzle of the *roshvalr* meat reaches me as it begins to cook.

Touching the totem on a string at my throat, I call up my magic to warm the bones and ease the muscle aches of my far too many thaws. I feel Asa push a bit of her essence into my magic along with me, making it easier and less tiring for me. Her essence still reminds me of the soft fur of a baby *yule* as it sleeps against me.

It makes me remember the first time I saw Asa. A memory warm and comforting to me.

She had appeared as a light brown *yule* and is one of my first memories of life here in the longhouse, with my Family, with the Tribe. So many seasons ago.

Grandfather Soot had just finished the calling to the spirits of these new lands, asking to protect and keep our Family in the place we had found. We had followed the *hrosshvalr* as the snow had gone from our old hunting grounds and away from the new tribes pushing into our lands. Before that I remember only dim things about my life.

I do remember that day very well.

While all the older family members were watching or participated in the ritual, I was still too young and all I really remember is that I was eating dry-salted elk meat against the wall of the longhouse. the meat had fallen onto the ground, slipping out of my hands as I had covered it with drooled, and could no longer hold onto it.

A *yule,* about my size had drifted out of the smoke of the ritual, glowing with the light of a new day, all yellow and orange, to bite the meat from the ground. She then had held it for me until I took it.

No one else seems to see her.

I remember giggling at the way the smoke drifted through her, making swirls of her fur as it moved across and into her transparent body.

Her eyes had held stars that twinkled at me in my memory. I have trusted her since that day, taking the piece of meat, covered in dirt, breaking it in half and sharing it with her.

I may be an Elder and the Shaman of the Family but Asa, Spirit of our Longhouse, keeps us safe. Protecting us.

No one but me can see or hear her but they do all feel her...

...Everyday.

*yule*: snow cat, large predator  
*roshvalr*: furry walrus, very big",16

1ljsm1g,mzmrx6x,"I look at the young woman in front of me, pouting, and frowning.  
""So, you are really the Devil?"" she asks.  
""A devil. Not The Devil, the Devil isn't even a devil, but a fallen angel.  
He makes deals but not for souls, for favors."" I say.  
She makes a disgusted face.  
""So you do steal souls."" she says.  
I laugh.  
""Claim souls. The deals I make are legit."" I say.  
She snorts.

  
""Yeah, tricking people, and stealing their soul is ""legit""."" she says.  
""Not tricking, and not that simple.  
Claiming the soul is only step 2, of my business plan, the first one is highlighting problems for a society."" I say.  
She frowns.  
""What do you mean? You start wars or something?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Something like that and more.  
Conflicts, wars, economical problems, social unrest, highlighting difference...  
Problems in general."" I say.  
""Why?"" she asks.  
I smile.

  
""It is rather dumb for a devil to think there are so many narcissistic, greedy individuals, that can be convinced to give their souls for personal gain.  
That's meh, a no-brainer to realize it is difficult, but...  
Convincing people to sell their soul for the gain of their whole society? For greatness? For changing the world for the better?  
Now that is easier. Not simple, but easier."" I say.  
""So you mess with mortals, to make sure they need your help to make a change? To survive?"" she asks.  
""Something like that. Though, I just make sure they notice these problems.  
I emphasize them, or spread rumors to exaggerate them, I don't create them per se."" I say.  
She nods.  
""Acceptable."" she says.  
I smile.

  
""So this means, you agree?  
You will marry me?"" I ask her.  
""Yes, I will marry you.  
I fancy marrying someone whom saves people."" she smiles.  
I freeze.  
""What?"" I ask.  
""Well, sure, you create troubles, or make them bigger than it should, and take souls from people for the solution, but...they solve it right?"" she asks, as she walks up to me.  
I nod.  
""Then, for the price of hundreds, thousands of souls...an entire society is rid of a problem, be it a disease, a war or something else. You are a hero."" she sits on my lap.  
I am confused...me? A Hero? She calls me a Hero? I am a devil, and I...  
""My little hero devil."" she kisses me, and I forget about it all.  
She accepts me, and that is enough",9
1ljm3qp,mzlyr49,"The room was silent except for the buzzing of the communicator from random interstellar waves and events affecting the weak signal. That thing had been the result of hundreds of years of inventing and innovation and hard work by millions of people, and it was incredible, don’t get me wrong–I mean, it could communicate with aliens and automatically translate our speech both ways and do it in seconds, at that–but you’d think they’d find a way to block out signal breaks and interruptions. I guess the closest thing to it would be “snow,” an ancient thing that occurred on televisions in the 21st century. Oh, I’m getting distracted.

“So,” the high general finally spoke into his microphone, sitting up straighter, “No communication? But the dinosaurs have been dead for millions of years.”

The communicator was quiet except for the aforementioned “snow” for a while before the robotic voice of the translation came through. The extraterrestrials apparently spoke like us, with sound waves, but at a pitch we couldn’t hear, so an AI voice had been slapped on to read the translation.

“Yes, communication was considered a disturbance. And we are aware that the groups of species you call “dinosaurs” have been extinct for a long time, but we still consider your planet fragile. Carbon-based life forms are easily wiped out entirely by our presence. After millenia of accidentally destroying ecosystems using carbon on habitable planets by coming to live on or in them, we have learned our lesson and now protect them.”

“How are you so dangerous to carbon-based life forms?” One of the top modern biologists inquired immediately, twirling a pen in her fingers. The communicator chirped back after a few seconds, “Because we, and most life in the galaxy, are filled and covered with a protein that breaks down carbon into many hydrogen atoms and uses it to self-replicate.”

With that happy thought, I glanced down at my notes to ask the next pressing question before someone else did.

“Well, how will we work with you and other living things across the galaxy if we can easily be destroyed by you?”

“Well, we can simply not.”



Of course, we did not ‘simply not.’

Humans were desperate for alien products and tech. They had the perfect solution to the massive medical device blackouts occurring every few decades, and we needed to get our hands on them. So we negotiated and argued and negotiated again with the extraterrestrials until we were approved to take one shipment from any desired civilization every 1/64488 clusteric rotations–a standard measure based on the average orbital speed of stars in the Milky Way’s halo–equivalent to once every 300 Earth years. The first shipment came in mostly containing dead alien matter from various species so that we may study them. Of course, the decontamination protocols did not work.

When the first group of researchers to handle the shipment started getting severely ill and dying in droves, we tried to lock it all down. Even the aliens, who may have felt pity, told us how to denature the protein and save ourselves. Alas, it was too little too late. Maybe we should’ve just stayed as a nature preserve.",9
1ljm3qp,mzmwuek,"(Part 1 of 3)
Move, move, move! All operators, report to stations! I want all cockpits sealed and synced before the delegation sets foot on this deck! Crew leads, confirm armor integrity and reactor status within the next five, no excuses. I don’t care if your boot’s untied or your neural link is itching, get in and get linked!”

This isn’t combat, but it’s just as critical. The President’s expecting a launch-ready demonstration, and Sarge isn’t gonna be the one holding up the protocol.

“You were selected because you are the best. So show it. I want clean launches, stable syncs, and zero fumbling on the ramp. Let’s go, let’s go! One-two, one-two!” I got into the elevator shaft and watched as I dropped down into the right knee. I was picked as the right-jointed leg support since I excelled at gyroscope stability. The floors went by so fast it started to look like I was going up rather than down. As the floors sprinted past, I thought back to Contact Day.

The day we learned we weren’t alone. And the day we really learned how small we really are. The first day we picked up the signal, it was just noise. We had put more and more satellites and ways to communicate, both out and in, but nothing ever worked. That is, until the day we picked up a deep, almost undetected roar, followed by a flash of light. The light was a normal anomaly, but the sound was picked up by one of our newer satellites. We adjusted the feed and heard what sounded like, what could only be described as, some form of intelligent language or communication.

When our top scientists finally deciphered it, we made out the message. It was a signal of caution.

[Attention: Unauthorized Entry Prohibited.
Planetary Biosphere.
Preservation Class: Zeta-Glass.
Fragile apex species.
Observation Only.]

It didn’t take long for the world to unite. Just like that, we put all our best minds and technology together, almost overnight. Then came one of the most unsettling discoveries. Using what can only be described as space carbon dating, we found that the message actually originated almost 200 million years ago. That meant the warning wasn’t about us. It was about the creatures that ruled Earth long before us.. the dinosaurs. The message had been hovering around our planet for the last 200 million years to warn passing alien lifeforms that this planet was home to something in need of protecting. They called the dinosaurs fragile. Dinosaurs. The towering, apex monsters we once thought were the pinnacle of Earth’s evolutionary fury, they saw them as delicate. That’s when it dawned on us. If the dinosaurs were glass… what are we?

After we put out our first signal at that same frequency, you know the usual “Hello? Is anyone out there?” in every language, along with the top 100 hits, history briefings, images of babies, plants, and art. It took only 3 days. The world was waiting on its toes when we got a response. It was incredible, almost like they were showing off. First an assortment of different responses that said yes in our language and what we assume would be some of theirs. They responded with a brief history. How brief, I can only imagine, considering 200 million years ago they were advanced enough to basically throw up a digital interstellar warning label.

I won’t bother trying to explain it all. It wouldn’t provide any clearer answers than what we’ve come to believe, an ever-expanding universe, clusters, stars are the stars of the show, you know. Here’s where it gets real interesting though. They where cosmically and utterly massive. 

You see, history remembers gods as larger-than-life beings because they were literally larger-than-life beings. Some had cosmic powers we can only describe as Lovecraftian, or biblically massive. Just… unimaginably large-scale entities. There’ve been some instances where they had to intervene because we were invaded and ruled by these massive creatures, they ended up being worshipped, understandably so. Some projected themselves into minds and dreams.

It was decided by a universal federation—made up of what I imagine God or Zeus to be—something described as a tentacle monster that apparently doesn’t even exist in our dimension. A multi limbed and multi headed all knowing something And an enormously, unexplainably massive reptile-like creature with a shell that held all versions or variations of life or something. Along with a few other hard to explain and describe entities.Apparently, there are hundreds of these huge space snakes just like.. slithering out there. Oh, you know black holes? Well, apparently they’re the result of… where something sat. Something big. Like… cosmically big. You see cosmic gods don’t use chairs, they just kind of.. settle. And wherever they do, the whole damn galaxy just kind of… Well, anyway. Just a whole lot more questions than answers. Go to your local library. Read a book.

Thus ensued the building. We made it big. We made it strong. It could travel through space and time. Unifying and utilizing the advancements given to us, we made a suit. It’s almost an insult to call it a “suit.” It was… everything we could have done. The head, where main control was, was out of our atmosphere. There were space stations surrounding it. We had every conceivable thing we could need to travel anywhere. It was a ship. A presence. A cosmic force that could destroy our own world with the push of a button. And here I was. At the knee. 

We took off, slow at first, just to get off the ground. We didn’t want to completely scorch a crater into the Earth while lifting off. It wasn’t until we got past the moon a half hour later that we shot into full power, and the stars disappeared.",7
1ljhs4v,mzk9jin,"Some doors are designed to be one-use only. The door to E wing had been welded shut thirty years ago, and -- up until now -- there had been no plans to open it.

Grady did the cutting himself. It wasn't in his skillset, but they'd given him a crash-course in using the cutter an hour ago. Every additional person involved was another potential victim if it went wrong.

E wing was large, mostly empty, and automated. Once he was through the main doors, Grady found himself surrounded by machinery, the pipes and wires that managed all of E wings processes and kept the sole inmate alive. The site was entirely isolated -- no external water, power, or anything else supply -- with the closest other buildings a mile away, twice the needed distance just for safety. Panels on the roof kept it powered, and only rainfall ever added to the internal water supply. All food -- nutrient solution rather than actual meals -- was produced and processed in the aquaculture tank.

""I know you know I'm here. I think the only reason I've still got control of myself is because you're curious.""

The inmate -- floating in a lead-lined sensory deprivation chamber, in a medically-induced coma that prevented movement but could not dampen powers -- did not respond.

""We want to make a deal. We want to talk about your release.""

He felt his own hand move without him telling it to, reaching into his suit jacket to retrieve a pack of cigarettes. His right hand moved as well, thumbing the lighter. Puppeteer was listening.

He coughed on the first inhale, hadn't smoked since he was a teenager. ""Just a show of good faith. We're willing to negotiate.

""There's a new villain in town. Thought he was a hero at first, but now people are dying. Too many people. We can't stop him -- physically invulnerable, teleporting, nearly the perfect storm.

""Deal's this: we turn off the safeguards, let you out. You take care of him for us -- permanently -- and then we let you leave. No warrants, no bounty, no chasing. As long as you get off this continent and don't come back, we're happy.""

His hand moved again, tapping the back of his head, just below the right ear. ""Ah, no. That one stays. Otherwise we'd just have two problems. Once you're out, that's our only weapon. You of all people should understand the concept of an implanted failsafe.""

Grady's shoulders shrugged. His hands moved to point both index fingers at himself.

""We knew whoever walked in probably wasn't walking out as themselves, either way. I volunteered. I was close to retiring anyway, and we thought you'd probably hear me out."" He sighed. ""I'm okay with it. Said my goodbyes and everything. Line of duty.""

He felt the control settle on him, each muscle twitching as Puppeteer took over fully. He couldn't feel, couldn't move, and yet his limbs were moving. His legs walked him over to the tank, booted up the dormant controller and started the draining process. He thought terror, thought panic, but without the sensations to accompany it.

Grady heard his own voice without feeling his lips and tongue move. ""We have a deal.""",47
1ljhs4v,mzkndoi,"The mayor stared through the two-way mirror at the volunteers. Ten women -- all short, pretty, and dark-haired -- each one dressed in the same blue-and-gold outfit. ""Grady, this plan is insane.""

""Yes, Sir. But I'm confident that it will work.""

""Why are they all dressed as cheerleaders? Why do they look the same?""

""Target selection, Sir. The first three puppeteer incidents all started at football games, and they all started with the cheer teams. I think he's got a type.""

""And brunette?""

""That's more of a hunch. Victim profiles show a slight pattern. And--"" He paused. ""He took Ruiz, but shot Eriksson, Sir.""

""He shot her?""

""I don't think it's important whose hand was on the trigger, Sir. He pulled it.""

Grady crossed behind the mayor to the intercom unit. ""Ladies, if you could all take your pill now, please? The bus will leave in ten minutes.""

Ten cheerleaders each swallowed one large grey pill, washing it down with water from white plastic cups. None of them spoke, but nervous smiles scattered around the room.

""We'll leave in ten minutes. Twenty to drive to the edge of his zone. Thirty for the polymer coating on each pill to dissolve. Give it an hour to take effect, and then you can send in the cavalry.""

""And what if he knows? What if it doesn't work on him?""

""There's no suggestion that he can read thoughts, Sir. Just sense and control bodies -- all recovered victims agreed on this. We also know he feels what they should feel; he's reacted to injuries and tear gas before. It'll work.""

""But if it doesn't, agent? What if he doesn't take the bait? What if he delays taking control until the drug is out of their systems? No plan is perfect, and definitely not a plan with this much risk!""

""Sir, it's the perfect bait, and he's not expecting anything; he'll think it's Christmas come early. If it doesn't work now, Sir, then it won't in the future. He'll be more cautious then. This is our one shot, and I think it's worth trying. If I fail, you can take my badge.""

""I will agent. Believe me, if this madness doesn't pay off, then losing your badge will be the least of your worries."" The mayor turned from the window to glare at the younger man. ""Are you really okay with this? Sending ten young women to death or worse on a hunch? Using civilians to do your job while you sit safely behind a screen?""

""No, Sir."" Grady pulled a blue-and-gold baseball cap from his back pocket and placed it on his head. ""That's why I'm driving the bus.""",41
1ljafqz,mzj09vt,"""The Riddle of the Thornless Rose""

They came from five kingdoms and three queendoms, from cloisters and calderas, dressed in silk, steel, and suspicion. Each hopeful woman arrived at the castle not by decree, but by dare. For the wizard had made a game of it. A riddle spoken at the midsummer feast, etched in silver upon the king’s own banner, carried by ravens to corners of the known world.

""To wear the crown, she must not kneel,
But speak with fire the cold may feel.
She cannot break, nor bind his name,
Yet must endure his storm and flame.
If she commands, he will not bend..
But if she listens, he may ascend.
Show not your sword, nor hide your grace..
Bring the king to his quietest place.""

The king was furious, of course.

""This is not a game,"" he hissed in the Great Hall after the crowd had cheered the riddle’s recital. ""My marriage is not a scavenger hunt.""

The wizard, bald as a stone and twice as stubborn, simply smirked into his goblet of honeyed wine. ""It is not a hunt, Your Majesty.. it is a sieve. Let fools fail at riddles, and may one wise soul earn your heart.""

""I don't need my heart earned.""

""No.. but you do need to share it. And you, my dear friend, would sooner open a vein than speak of what truly weighs on your mind.""

Silence fell like frost between them. The king turned away. The wizard did not press.

----------------------------------------------♡-----------------------------------------------

The first suitor spoke in metaphors. A lioness from the Western steppes, teeth like flint, with a laugh too sharp to be trusted.

""I will make you strong, Your Majesty,"" she boasted. ""Stronger than your enemies, stronger than yourself.""

The king thanked her and passed her along to the stewards.

The second tried seduction. Velvet dress, scented wrists, kisses behind curtains.

""I will soothe you, my king,"" she purred. ""Let me bear the weight so you may rest.""

He did not rest. He sent her home on a chariot before dawn.

The third tried reason. She quoted scriptures, spoke of dynasties, of children and balance.

The king nodded and drifted in thought. That night, the wizard found him on the battlements, unsleeping.

""I’m not made for softness,"" the king muttered. ""I was raised on campaign maps, not lullabies. Every time someone tells me I can be at peace, I feel like they’ve mistaken me for someone else.""

""And yet you ache to be known,"" the wizard said, placing a blanket over his shoulders.

""I ache to be safe. Without being told I'm safe.""

The wizard said nothing. The riddle, after all, was already written.

----------------------------------------------♡-----------------------------------------------

She arrived with no retinue. No gown. Just boots, calloused hands, and a letter of recommendation from the head gardener. She smelled of rosemary and frost.

""Are you here for the riddle?"" the steward asked.

""No,"" she said. ""I’m here to see the king.""

""You understand only those who solve the riddle are granted audience?""

She nodded. ""Then let me answer it.""

They brought her before the king, who studied her like an unfinished poem.

""Speak,"" he said.

""The answer to your riddle is a mirror,"" she said. ""But not one made of glass. A mirror made of patience. Someone who reflects what you give, not to flatter you.. but to let you see yourself.""

The court waited for laughter or scorn. Neither came.

""That’s not an answer,"" the king said softly.

""No,"" she said, just as soft. ""It’s a reflection.""

He said nothing. Nor did the wizard, who was watching closely from the dais.

""Tell me, then,"" the king said. ""Do you see yourself as my equal?""

""No,"" she replied. ""I see myself as your shelter. And you mine.""

There was no applause. Just stillness.

The wizard smiled into his wine again. Not the smirk of triumph, but something gentler. Sadder.


----------------------------------------------♡-----------------------------------------------

By winter, the halls echoed with smaller footsteps. Laughter climbed ivy-covered walls. The king was still iron.. but now, he let himself rust just a little in the rain, knowing someone would dry him without comment. The wizard found he could finally retire to the observatory and not worry who would keep the king warm through a long storm.

And somewhere in the garden, a rose bloomed. No thorns.

No need.

1lj149u,mzgeqlo,"The armies behind me come to a halt, as I fly up.  
The Demon Queen's armies also come to a halt, as she flies up as well.  
The armies mutter, and with my hearing, I can make out that they all think, both sides, that we are ready to discuss before the last big battle.  
They are wrong.  
""Alice?"" I ask.  
""John?"" she mutters.  
Then I cast a stealth spell, and she casts a mist spell around us...  
And we hug.

  
After hugging the soul out of each other, and doing something else as well, we let go of each other.  
""How? This...I thought..."" I mutter, checking her out.  
She is a mountain demon, a royal demon standing tall, and proud, with horns and everything.  
""You gave your life to save me, but as you pushed me away, another car came hurriedly trying to bypass the obvious stop that will come out of the accident...  
He hit me. And I was reincarnated as the princess of the demons."" she says.  
I pale.  
""I...I killed you?"" I mutter.  
She hugs me.  
""No! No! It was fate! Fate for us to reunite...my dear Hero!"" she says.

  
After a while, I manage to calm down, and we float in the skies, cuddling.  
""Heh...I reincarnate as the Hero, and you as the Demon Queen I have to kill. Can it be considered that I killed you our last lives, and it is done?"" I say.  
She giggles, and pinches me.  
""One: you didn't kill me, and two: I doubt it works that way. But we have to solve this somehow."" she says.  
I nod, and ask her about the demons' situation.  
She tells me how the Demon Empire is in a wasteland where barely anything grows, and demons have to resort to stealing, and attacking if they want to live.  
I also tell her about how the humans, and the other demi-humans see the demons.  
We both sigh.

  
""It will be hard, won't it?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""Thousands of years of rivalry, and wars will be hard to be bypassed. But together we can do it."" I smile.  
""How?"" she asks.  
""The wars took a toll on both our forces, and while we are ready for the last battle...the people back home are terrified."" I say.  
""Same...not all demons love violence."" she says.  
""So, Alice, or rather Queen Lebeth von Argent, will you marry me, and bring peace upon the lands?"" I ask.  
She squeals.  
""YES!"" she says, kissing me.  
We discuss a bit more how to say this to our people, but it is worth a try, and if it doesn't work the nice way, well...  
The Hero is the strongest entity of the Allied forces, while the Demon Queen is the Queen, so if the nice approach doesn't work, we can use the forceful one.",248
1lj149u,mzlyie2,"Harld breathed out, seeing the castle before him. 25 years. It took 25 years to get him here - a shot back to earth. Medieval fantasy was far less fun to live than the modern day he reincarnated from. The spirit promised when it yanked his soul into this body - kill the Demon Queen, return immediately and safely back to earth should he wish it. He’d rather forget his formative years in this world- far more expectations with less convenience than a modern day child. If his previous life wasn’t filled with education and a life of martial arts, getting to this land would have been far more difficult. 



Graduated with honors, heroic levels of magic and skill. His accolades allowed him a leading position - as captain to a elite squad against the Demon Queen. 



Standing behind the ramparts of her castle a demon yelled, 



“Be afraid! I am Lord Paul, Demon of Red!” Harld chuckled at the passionate speech from the blue demon standing on goat hooves. His robes of purple with a red jeweled diadem on his forehead. Lord Paul waved his scepter. A magic circle, spun into shape. Harld lifted his sword and leapt toward the brightening circle.



A quick glance upon the spell structure was the clue to the spell’s demise. Magic, a phenomenon of superimposing realities into the shared one, a program that set conditions that was a domino into a desired effect. And like a domino, the slash of Harld’s sword disrupted the cascading font of power that would have decimated his army. 



However, the power of the strategic spell remained from the ruptured circle, and Harld replaced that decimated esoteric receptacle with his sword. He could feel the weight of the multiple reality stacking upon his sword and he could barely contain the power. Harld swung with hasty slash toward the wall where Lord Paul stood. A slash arm-span wide crashed into the wall through the caster compromising the siege before it truly began.



A silence emanated on both sides as Harld stood landing at the base o the broken wall, his armor and skin smoking from the power he just unleashed. He stood and pointed his sword to the castle - “For the Hearthlands!” He roared. His voice was a herald snapping armies back into focus. And the cries of blood and death begun. Its time to go back home

1lj76rp,mzhkby5,"Okay.  
I stare at the little creature, that is struggling to stand on 2 legs, all fluffy, white furred, with cute golden eyes.  
It is as tall as a 13-14 year old kid, when standing upright.  
It has a cute voice, and beady eyes.  
It is busy bringing plates, and the pie to the table.  
But...  
I have been sent to execute it.  
And its promise to ""never murder anyone again"" doesn't really make me feel good.

  
""You know that I won't eat it, right?"" I ask the creature, as it tries to sit on the chair.  
It stares at me, pouting.  
""But it was so hard to make that woman into a pie..."" it muttered.  
I freeze, my hand on my sword, and a spell already readied.  
""Don't worry!  
I promised that I won't murder anyone again."" it giggles.  
I feel dizzy.  
Damn.  
Its voice is a spell!

  
I cast a fireball, and destroy the pie, and table.  
The creature easily dodges it.  
""Seriously? You humans always preach about civilization, and whatnot...  
But you always attack first, and ask questions later!"" it says.  
""You are eating my kind!"" I say.  
""And you are eating my kind, and many other species.  
What is wrong?"" it tilts its head.  
I freeze.  
It is not wrong, but also...not right.

  
I attack it, but nothing works.  
My blade doesn't even scratch its fur.  
My spells are dodged.  
""This is boring.  
Hunting villagers that can't fight back, and are running away is more fun."" it giggles...and disappears.

I start running towards the closest village, hoping I will reach in time.

Its cuteness made me lower my guard.",59
1lj76rp,mzhzbm5,"""Another one who comes to try and slay me?"" I asked, laying my tea set and a plate of cheesecake on the table. ""You should know you won't succeed. If anyone did, we wouldn't be talking.""

""I know,"" the human replied, putting his weapon to one side. ""So, my plan is to pretend to fail at this job so nobody else takes it. The Monster Hunter's Association will catch on and send someone else to replace me eventually. But for now, it means a period of peace for you.""

""That's real nice of you,"" I smiled, pouring a cup of tea for the latest of a long line of hunters deployed to execute me.

He stared at his cup warily, before taking a sip. ""You brewed this yourself?""

""Yes, you like it?""

""It is surprisingly sweet. Like you.""

I almost choked on my slice of cheesecake. My tentacles flailed about wildly beneath the table, flabbergasted by his words. Usually, these hunters would insult me. Squidface, dumb deity, murderous mollusc, I was used to those. Not being regarded as a sweet and kind thing. And most certainly not by a man armed with an anti-magic rifle.

""Now, in exchange, I do need you to promise you won't murder anyone again.""

""I can do that,"" I held out a pinky finger and a tentacle. ""Can't guarantee I wouldn't inflict eldritch-induced madness to people who attempt to murder others however. I do have to act in the defence of my followers.""

""Perfectly understandable guardian eldritch deity behaviour,"" he nodded, helping himself to a slice of cake. ""Still, I hope nobody pushes you into such terrible actions.""

""I hope not too. I like peace, and so do you, it seems.""

Now it was his turn to grin. He lifted his cup and held it out in my direction.

""A toast to peace in Innsmouth, Lord Elvari?""

I raised my cup and gently knocked into his.

""A toast to peace, no matter how short-lived it will be.""",49
1lj76rp,mzjb82s,"I had hiked three miles uphill through a forest that seemed personally offended by my boots, my pants, and my continued existence. Every root tried to trip me. Every branch snapped back in my face. Somewhere behind me, my horse gave up and wandered off. That was fine. If I failed the job, I’d be dead. If I succeeded, I’d be rich. Either way, I wouldn’t need the horse.

According to the briefing, the monster had been living in a cave up near the peak. Seven deaths in the last three months. Something had bitten the heads clean off a family of hikers. One sheriff’s deputy vanished entirely. The only survivor was a dog that came back whimpering, eyes wide and tail glued to its stomach.

I had a sword, a sidearm, a flask of blessed elder sap, and a hangover. I figured it was enough.

The cave was where they said it would be. Jagged rocks. Smell like wet copper. And I heard the sound before I even stepped in: humming. Off-key and cheerfully obnoxious.

I drew the pistol and stepped inside.

The monster was there. Sort of.

It was enormous. Eight feet tall at least. Arms like tree trunks. Purple fur. A pair of little bat wings that wouldn’t lift a chicken. Its mouth was full of teeth shaped like broken glass, and its eyes sparkled like it was a toddler who just learned what cookies are. It held a pink oven mitt in one hand and a spatula in the other.

“Oh!” it said. “Hello! You’re early! I didn’t think anyone would show up until the next full moon.”

I kept the pistol aimed center mass. “You’re Muzzlebore?”

“That’s what they call me. I prefer Marmalade. It’s a family name.”

“You murdered seven people.”

“I did kill a few, yes,” the thing said. It set the spatula down gently on a rock shaped like a toad. “But I haven’t killed anyone in weeks. I’ve been working on that. Self-improvement. Meditation. Sourdough.”

I blinked. “Sourdough.”

“It’s a journey,” it said. “Would you like some cake?”

It stepped aside and gestured at a flat stone with a lopsided cake on it. It looked like it had been assembled by someone who had only seen cakes in poorly drawn cartoons. There was frosting, though. Pink with sparkles. A small candle that had not been lit was stuck in the center.

“It’s lemon cardamom,” Marmalade said. “No human in it at all. That’s a promise.”

“You expect me to believe you’ve retired?”

The monster wrung its oven mitts together. “I know what you’re thinking. Monsters don’t change. But maybe some of us do. I only went on the spree because I was going through something. You know. Existential dread. Displacement rage. Losing my crypt to a hotel development. That sort of thing.”

I kept the pistol up.

Marmalade sighed. “Fine. Shoot me, if it helps. I won’t stop you.”

I hesitated.

“I mean it,” the monster said. “It’ll probably hurt, but I’ve hurt worse. Just know you’ll be killing something that’s really trying. I go to group therapy now. With a kelpie. She bit my tail last week, but we talked about it. Progress.”

I didn’t lower the gun.

The cake smelled good.

“Did you actually eat the hikers?” I asked.

“I sucked the souls out of two of them,” Marmalade said, shifting awkwardly. “The others fell off a ledge when I startled them. The deputy tripped over his own baton. Honest mistake.”

“And the dog?”

“Oh, I gave him a belly rub and a slice of ham. He still visits. I think he lives with the kelpie now.”

I finally lowered the gun.

“Can I at least try the cake before I decide whether or not to shoot you?” I said.

Marmalade lit up. “Of course! That’s all I ask.”

The cake was a little dry, but the flavor was nice. The cardamom hit late. I took another bite.

“You’re serious about this?” I asked.

“Dead serious,” Marmalade said. “I’ve enrolled in an online course on conflict resolution. I’ve even started journaling. It’s mostly doodles, but they’re peaceful doodles. Look, I even got this friendship bracelet kit.”

It held up a tangled mess of string.

I believed it. Against all reason and experience, I believed it.

I took another bite. “You have to stop biting people’s heads off.”

“Agreed,” Marmalade said. “I’m aiming for zero decapitations this fiscal year.”

“Then I’ll file a false report. Say the trail went cold. You moved on.”

Marmalade’s eyes went wide. “Really?”

“But if I so much as hear you’ve growled at a toddler or snarled at a jogger, I will come back. I will not bring cake. I will not bring a friendship bracelet. I will bring fire. Understand?”

“Crystal clear,” Marmalade said. “Thank you.”

We sat for a bit, eating in silence. There was a breeze through the cave. I watched the candle flicker, unlit.

“You know,” I said, “if you’d met those hikers with this cake, I probably wouldn’t have brought a gun.”

“Next time,” Marmalade said, nodding, “I’ll greet people with muffins.”

And just like that, I walked out of the cave alive, sugar high, and wondering what the hell I was going to tell the guild.",10
1lj76rp,mzl38l4,"The old man told me about a monster he slew when he was barely an adult. He claimed that a hundred winters had come and gone between then and now. 

The old man was crazy, but to his credit, no one in the village could remember him as a boy, merely that he was the best hunter and tracker of the village and I as his apprentice am to hunt any monsters or predators that blight our lands.

He took me far afield to find anything that was unnatural. Taught me to read and make letters in three different tongues, too, in order to study his books. I was good, the best in generations, but the old man, he was fearless in ways that I would fail to master in my 17 summers of age.

Three dead and tge fist monster attack in living memory. Too bad the old man was not around this year to guide me. 

The tracks and manner of feeding were unknown to me, and the tomes proved to of little help, unless this was some kind of chimera or amalgamation of wicked beasts. Whatever it was, I was not above a hasty withdrawal to find something that would work if this iron blade and holy herbs fail.

Twas not until I reached the mouth of the cave that I realized that I was not stalking prey, but was being lead, baited towards the cave. This was not a creature that was wary, but one that cared not of hunters.

Regardless, I went. The rough walls started giving way to sewn stone, carefully cultivated patches of glowing plants and mushrooms. Hives of glowing bugs and ponds of fish and algae rarely gave my eyes time to acclimate to the darkness. Was this a temple? 

I heard movement ahead, and no sooner did I turn the corner than I came face to face with the beast. I shall not describe the thing, for although it was human in shape, it looked as if all the kind and vulnerable things in the world had been added onto its form. Unlike other monsters, this one gave me pause at its almost defenseless except for the wrongness units eyes.

<I have been waiting for you, Apprentice. Come, sit, I have made cake for us to enjoy as we talk.>

I stepped back and gestured to a table with a pastry on it, a soft wight light illuminating the chamber. I could swear that the furniture was ten strides, but the creature casually reaches from where it stands and pulls a chair out for me, and with a slight step it is beside the table, almost as if distance is but a thought and not an inconvenience.

It was twelve strides for me to close the distance. Blade drawn i stab at the creature but find my blade cutting the pastry in the table instead.

<Your master did the same when he came to see me. He hesitated longer. I wonder if your apprentice will be of sound mind to strike the moment they see me, or if I have to wait longer than that.> The creatures lips moved when it spoke but the movement of its lips did not match the words I heard in my head. 

""I have come to slay you, creature."" I say, pulling the blade from the cake and slashing at the creature. I know my blade should have struck, but the blade passes as if the creature was an inch further than the tip of my blade, only the white frost from the cake touches its skin as it flies from the blade.

<So did your Master, and his, and theirs and hers, and on and on. As you see, I still linger.> it gestures at its body. <Surely you seek vengeance for the humans I consumed, but what if I make you the same deal as I have made before? Return to your village and say that I am dead, but you will bind your soul to mine. Hearty and healthy, you will be until the end of your days, and I will not harm a soul as long as your heart still beats.>

I descend the mountain knowing I made the right choice, but the vision of that creature becoming just a little more human in its visage when the pact was sealed is what truly scared me.",6
1ljeawh,mzjhdry,"I did the most stupid thing a Titan could do.  
I went against the orders of the new era's rulers: the Gods.  
I stole the fire from the Gods, and tried to deliver it to the humans.  
I was caught by Ares, and Apollo, and later as we fought, I lost the fire...  
Then Zeus swooped in, and defeated me with his lightning bolt, and punished me.  
For eons, I have been chained to a mountain, with one of Zeus' familiars, a giant eagle coming to eat my liver each single day.  
Today...I have been given amnesty.

  
""Yo, Promi!"" Zeus greeted me.  
He was...different.  
His attire was weird, he was wearing some black squares, linked with a thin stick on his face...and so much golden jewelry.   
""Well, it has been long, and Hera and the humans have been chewing my ears off to free you, so...  
Off you go!  
Have fun! The little humans you so much loved did some amazing things!  
Peace!"" he says...disappearing.  
I fall to my knees, as my bindings are undone.

  
I leave the mountain, paranoid, waiting for a God or a lackey of theirs to strike me in the back.  
Nothing happens.  
Then I find the first human city...it renders me speechless.  
The architecture, while looking less, it is so complex! And the materials...they aren't natural, they are...man-made!  
The humans, in such a small town, live by the million!  
I change my clothes into something similar to that of the humans, and blend in.  
I am curious what these bundles of endless potential have manged to do...  
And hope that my failure didn't affect them.  
It didn't.

  
The humans managed to discover fire...and develop quickly.  
In mere tens of thousands of years they did unimaginable things, and now...they rule the world? The skies? And can leave into the domain of Chaos, which they call...space?  
They managed to make the Gods and creatures take a step back from the main stage?  
They have managed to lengthen their lifespans, and invent so many amazing things!  
I can see Ares', Aphrodite's, Athena's and Hephaestus' hand in this.  
Those kids...and they told me they care not about the humans...and what is this?  
This worship?  
They see Gods as different, a different kind of worship...through books, and games?  
It's been eons since I last saw them, when they were shivering in caves, doing nothing but praying to the Gods...  
This new world of theirs...  
I must experience it. Live in it.",12
1ljbb5h,mzik0tf,"""We are all out of silver!"" Kate said the rounds of her handheld revolver were empty. ""I knew we shouldn't have come here. I was an idiot.""



""You realize that now?"" Colleen retorted, her back against the wall as the vampire hovered towards her. Usually, she would have a cross in her hand for this exact situation. However, being the idiot that she is, Kate had forgotten to pack it in their carry bags…



Kate almost felt like hitting herself with her fists. Why was she always so obtuse? So careless?



No. Not anymore.



As Collen shrunk to the corner, her arms partially crossed against her chest in fear, Kate noticed the vampire halt. The old legend stared at Collen with an expression of mockery; however, from Kate's angle, she saw a lot more.



*The beast is definitely hesitating.* She thought while her gaze lingered on Collen.



""I figured it out!"" Kate jumped, catching them both by surprise as she quickly leaped between the fanged beast and her friend, crossing her arms.



It was probably just one of her idiotic ideas again. She was aware of that fact. However, to her surprise, it was working.



The beast stood there, squinting his eyes.



""Hah! I knew it!"" Kate rejoiced, turning back to see her friend, who was in awe. ""If we cross our arms, he can't hurt us—""



The next moment, Kate's head was on the floor, a fresh cut through the neck.



""Holy shit, your friend really is an idiot."" The vampire mumbled, sounding disappointed.



""I know."" Collen sighed. ""Damn it, Kate. This is the third time I'm resurrecting you this week."" She remarked at her awkwardly limp body before whispering her spell.",33
1ljbb5h,mzisb4d,"I was not quite the next Van Helsing. Still, my name made the rounds across the supernatural underworld. Vampire and hunter alike knew who I was, whispering of me in either terror or reverence. There were countless requests for me to join one hunting expedition or another. Those shadowy masters of blood sent handsome sums to keep me away.

In truth, I did not cut an imposing figure when first encountered. Being short and lanky made for an unfortunate composite. I believe many underestimated the simple monk garments I'd started wearing in my forays throughout the veiled world. But any who had doubts quickly dispelled them upon witnessing me at work. As it appeared to them, I could repulse vampires with the power of merely my mind.

I was very careful to keep the true source of my ""powers"" a secret, and the flowing robes of monasticism aided me in this. But any attempt of mine to avoid publicity was futile, especially after I was contracted by the Vatican to perform exorcisms. I became a highly desired resource, in demand from one side of the world to the other.

Of course, there were things I was asked — had — to do that I regretted. The imprisonment or destruction of the entire were-wolf quarter in Under-Manchester was accomplished through me, and it weighed heavily. I became a target before long; the black-market bounty growing with each time I relented and undertook another expedition. To keep my family safe, I dispersed them across the colonies, each one guarded by concealed but watchful eyes. I had to say goodbye to many who were close to me. Such was the curse of my notoriety.

Perhaps one day, history, society, they will judge me poorly. Perhaps they are right. Perhaps they will only recall the torment I inflicted upon those who were my enemies. Perhaps they will forget the good that I did; the lives I saved, be they innocent or world leader. Perhaps I will be vilified; the greatest criminal and bringer of woe. Perhaps they will forget who I am, who I was.

A man, who accidently discovered on that desperate, Plutonian night, a fool's way to defeat evil.",12
1ljj7mp,mzkemx4,"The warning came from a turbaned man. He sat on a rug of his own, cards a plenty laid before him. Sightless eyes peered out, but to call him blind would be a mistake. For when his eyelids closed, the world lay open before him.

He tapped a card, holding it up as he addressed the being of stone and wood. ""Your death will come, from neither friend nor fiend. A child still innocent, whose world shall be broken by your actions. They will fight you, hunt you, and emerge triumphant. This I speak, and know to be as true as the sunset this eve.""

His employer nodded, grinding rock setting teeth on edge. But their voice was light, in opposition to the hulking form. ""Seer, answer me one last question. Is this the child of whom you speak?""

Their limb of woven vines split, bringing an orb hidden within. It held the captured image of a baby, peacefully sleeping. The seer turned to it, gazing through his sealed eyes. A single nod was all he gave, as the being's stone torso rose above. ""I thank you, Seer. Yours was the last confirmation I needed. See him away.""

They waved the other arm, this one seeming to be a tree grown to match. Creatures crafted of twig, mushrooms and rocks scuttled up, resembling crabs in their make up. The human gave a single bow, packing up his belongings to follow.

The being stood tall, revealing its full size. It was giant, taller than three men stood atop each other. Its torso was a boulder, growing moss and lichen. It's two arms moved freely around, connected but not restrained by the connection. Three legs of roots supported it, its weight spread across the ground as it settled in place.

It's head was a shifting mass of smaller rocks, sliding around the others as an orange sheen shone from within. Where it spoke, it would craft a face to address. But where silence reigned, it had no features beyond the shifting stone.

The Corrupted Guardain moved across its domain, trees bending to avoid it without snapping or uprooting. Critters both fled from and flocked to it, the forests around a buzz with life, though none dared draw close enough to let it spot them.

Slowing to a stop at an inconspicuous tree, it's face reformed again. It spoke with gravitas, eyes watching. ""Three times I have sought out a prophet, and three times they have spoken. All with the same line, promising my end.""

The forest was silent for a time. Then from the tree emerged a thin figure, pulling its way free of the bark it matched. Humanoid, it bowed once, no face on its oval head. ""So it is set. What is your decision, Guardian?""

The dryad watched it unashamed, waiting to hear of the answer. An answer it received, as the Guardian turned to face it. ""We continue. Tell the others, but we must begin the contingency. I will fall, the fates have decreed. But that must not mean the end of our work.""

The dryad sighed. Its long fingered hand reached out, brushing the cold bark of its leader. ""A poor end for you, but alas, it is so. Yet we shall not fail you. I shall lead my people in your image upon your demise. Wisedeer shall be your inheritor for the beasts who stalk. Granus will lord over the living rocks. Your vision will be made reality.""

The Guardian nodded again. It produced the orb containing the child's image once more, studying it. ""My killer. We must find them, and watch them. Though my death is set, yours is not. Protect not me from them, but yourselves instead. This I tell you, be selfish my friend.""

Neither said more, departing to carry on their tasks. The Guardian to spread its domain, and crush those that infringement upon natures wold expanse. The dryad to pass on the message to the others, and grow itself.

And far away, a baby opened their eyes. And gave a laugh, unknowing of the path they would have no choice but to tread.",6
1ljj7mp,mzkr718,"It was midday. I'd finally found it, the home of my prophesized killer. I knocked on the door, waiting for someone to open it.

""Yes, hello! How can we help you y-"" I gently made my way inside, closing the door behind me.

""Where is your son?"" I glared at them, watching as their bodies shook with fear.

""We sent him to the market. Thirty minutes ago. He should return within the hour. What do you want with our boy?""

""I've a gift for him. One he'll never forget..."" I motioned for them to follow me into the living room. ""On your knees, now!"" I barked as I began digging for the rope.

They did as they were told. ""Ah, we love the young people. Are we going to play a game?"" The wife, for whatever reason, seemed thrilled.

""Fucks wrong with her?"" I finished tying the husband first. Then began to tie the wife.

""Sorry ma boy... She's got serious memory issues. Can't recall much correctly these days... Our boy... He told us, some day, someone would come to use us in a diabolical plan... Is that you, young man?"" I froze, finishing tying the wife.

""H-How? Why would he know of the prophecy!?"" I growled, drawing my sword.

""A kind seer stopped by the other day... He seemed like a pleasant man. Please... Don't take us from our boy. He's so young still..."" The father began to cry quietly.

""Nothing you say will change my course of actions."" I place the blunt side of the blade against their necks, waiting.

Some time later, the front door opened. A young boy, no older than ten stepped through the door. ""Mama, Pop Pop, I'm home with tonight's supper ingredients!""

""_Come on, brat._"" I rotated the blade, sharp side against their necks.

""Jose, no! Don't come i-""

The boy rounded the corner, and as he did, I made sure to slowly drag the blade along their throats, blood gushing everywhere, coating the floor like a new layer of paint.

Silence. Breath hitched in our throats. He stared at me, fingers losing their grip in the grocery bag. I dropped the sword, grabbed my dagger from my hip, and cut my own throat. Closing my eyes, happy, knowing that I've traumatized this boy for life, with no hope of vengeance in his future.

My eyes opened, vision hazy. I blinked a few times. Where was I? I looked around, vision finally clearing. I saw the two bodies I'd just slain and my bloodied dagger on the ground. ""What's going on? Is this the afterlife?""

""No... This is... Your personal eternity."" From around the corner, the boy stepped into the room, eyes glowing green. ""You took them from me... All because of some bogus prophet. It didn't have to be this way. You could have lived your life just fine. I never would have bothered you, until you came for me.""

I blinked, the boy was in front of me. ""Did you enjoy it? Cutting them down in front of me?"" His voice was eerily calm. ""Did you think I'd _let_ you take the easy way out? No... You'll die by my hand, over and over again, until I'm bored of you. Now, you're my plaything...""

""W-What are you!?"" I got up and ran around the corner and through the back door. For a moment, there was brightness, then, the cool, dimly lit living room appeared. I've lost count as to how many times I've tried to escape. Was I dead, alive, somewhere in between?

No matter where I went, the boy was there, looking at me with those green, glowing eyes.

""There is no escape... Until I say there is..."" He picked up my sword, swinging it with force enough to remove the blood from it... Then slowly started walking towards me...",6
1ljkin7,mzlgx2g,"""So let me get this straight,"" Becky said as she examined the object. ""This right here is some kinda magic doohickey and it'll turn me into one a them magic girl things like in those Japanese cartoons.""

""I...suppose that's accurate."" Replied the animal. To Becky, it looked like some kind of cat/dog hybrid with pink fur. It was cute in a weird way. It had a name, but Becky had not been paying much attention to that. ""But very simplified.""

""How's it supposed to work anyways?""

The wand looked like something out of a Halloween costume. She couldn't tell what it was made of, save that it wasn't plastic or metal. But it was yellow, had a heart on the end of it, and held some kind of ruby or something in the middle of said heart.

""You must chant the magic words and let the magic flow through you. Don't worry, I will teach you what to say.""

""Yeah, nah. I ain't doin that. Just gimme the basics. None oh that catchphrase stuff.""

The animal recoiled in shock. Not saying the words? That was practically blasphemy. But if the chosen wanted to try it, then who was he to refuse. The animal guided Becky into activating the wand without saying the words. It took longer, but she got it eventually.

""What the hell am I wearing!?"" Becky practically screeched when she was done changing.

""That is your...""

""I don't care what it is! I ain't wearin it!""

The outfit looked like some kind of gymnastics princess uniform. Way too tight in some places, with billowy ribbons of all things trailing around her shoulders, arms and hips. And pink. So, so much pink. 

Becky took a deep breath and undid her transformation. She looked at the wand. And at the stone set into it.

""I am sorry, but as long as you are the chosen, you must use the magic of that wand to fight."" The animal said. ""And that means wearing the uniform.""

""Hey, quick question. In this here wand thing, this fancy rock's the important part, right?""

""I suppose that is the focus, yes. But the rest of the wand is...where are you going?""

""To the workshop. This wand's junk. I'm gonna take this rock out and put it in somethin better.""

""What? No! You can't do that!""

""To hell I can't. Just watch. I'mma make somethin' way better.""

Becky was already out the door before the animal could say anything else. It scampered after Becky, who was heading out to a shack in the backyard of her house. She headed in and down a flight of stairs. The basement of the seemingly simple building was anything but. It was well stocked with metal, tools, and even a small forge. 

""What...what is this place?""

""This's my daddy's gunsmith. He's taught me how ta use it just fine. And now...""

She took a chisel and a mallet and began to gently tap at the ruby, working to free it from the rest of the wand.

""I'm gonna use it to make a much better weapon than this wand.""

""But...but why? Why would you overturn centuries of tradition. And you don't even know if it'll work, or what it'll do.""

""Oh, hunny, you just leave everythin' ta me. And I know it'll work, cause I'm gonna make it work. Listen here. I'm a Texas girl through and through, and I'll be damned if I use anythin' other'n a rifle I made with these two hands. Now you can help or watch, either way, this's gettin' done.""",15

""Dear Adam Johnson, we hereby inform you, that our archivists, historians, and A.I. assistants, have found that an ancient book on gravity, and the basic laws of physics, written in the 1st Middle-Ages of the Human history, back on our Mother Planet, Earth, is authored by you.  
The writing, reasoning has been compared with the more than 19 quintillion articles on physics, and comparing it to your 3983 articles published, we deduced a 97.8% similarity.   
Taking into consideration your current projects, we are certain that the book: ""Physics, and the workings of elemental forces."" is your creation."" the message read.  
I sighed, and look at another screen.  
""Time Travel possibilities..."" the article's title read.

  
It seems not only I succeed to create time travel, but somehow I get back to the 1st Medieval Ages of humanity.  
Why do I know that I get back, but not send back that book?  
Because I would never write a basic book like that today.  
The market is too saturated, and it would not get published.  
Okay.  
Now what?  
Am I to report my conjecture?   
Or am I to wait until time travel is approved, and proven to be doable?  
Hmm.

  
I went with the 2nd choice, and submitted my findings on new physic laws, and the possibilities of time travel.  
In about a month or so, it has been proven, and I have gained Grade 9 funding, and a few rewards, while all my researches that led up to this finding have been concealed.  
It is a bit annoying, but now, I am a Galactic funded researcher.  
It feels good, but bad.  
Why?  
Because I have to make sure that time travel is safe, and created in a span of 5 years.  
Why?  
They haven't told me, but I think the A.I.s have predicted something.

  
I look at the time machine, and then at the message from the Council.  
""The 1st Medieval Ages have been intensified by several enemy civilizations.  
Mathematics, and sciences have been linked even more to ""sorcery"" than in our natural history, and so did other sciences like medicine, and herbology.

1lj65ct,mzhji3x,"Jacob put the finishing touches on the formula at the bottom of his writing tablet. He read through the proof, but something nagged at him. He set it aside and went outside for some fresh air. 

He looked down at the city of spires and lights and felt a swelling of pride at what he and his clan had achieved. Their remote island in the South Pacific was unlike any other in the region, rich with minerals and advanced technology. Most of the modern world lived in the northern hemisphere as was historically the case, but their ancestors sought solitude and distance from the teachings of their peers and were able to keep their advancements cloaked from the north. Visitors to their island would never breach the string of villages along the coast with their grass skirts, tattooed bodies and old traditions. 

Jacob sighed, walked back into his villa and returned to his digital slate. He immediately saw his mistake, tapping the section with a digital pen and correcting the 〰️ with a ➰.

“That was a close one,” said a voice from behind. “Do you know how long we waited for you to complete the proof?”

Jacob spun around, knocking his chair to the floor. He wielded the digital pen like a knife. 

“You going to poke my eye out with that?” the stranger asked. 

“Who are you? How did you get here? I’ve never seen you in the village before.”

“You couldn’t have, Jacob,” he said, “because I just arrived, thanks to you. My name is Shiloh.”

“You’re not making any sense,” Jacob said. 

“Put down the digital pen before you wipe us all out of existence and I will explain,” Shiloh said. 

Hesitantly, as if his very life were at risk, Jacob set the pen down next to the tablet. 

“Okay,” Jacob said. “Explain.”

“I time traveled back to you. I literally popped into existence once you completed your formula correctly.”

“Don’t be daft. Do you know how insane and improbable that sounds?”

“Well, have you thought through this whole time travel thing completely? I mean really considered every aspect of it?” Shiloh asked. 

“Fair enough.” Jacob considered Shiloh a moment. The traveler watched as an epiphany dawned on Jacob’s face. 

“And there it is,” Shiloh said. 

“How long have you waited for me to get it right?”

“Well,” Shiloh said, “technically not long at all. But in terms of years, it’s taken us about three hundred of them to get a practical prototype working. We’ve lost good people trying to contact you.”

“This may sound counterintuitive, but why?”

“There was a book written in the Middle Ages by a scholar who called himself Nostradamus. That book led to a number of predictions that people interpreted for many centuries later to be visionary. They tried to fit his visions into actual events in history and correlate them with events yet to pass.”

“That sounds like utter nonsense and mysticism,” Jacob said. “Even my proof disproves the notion of predicting the future.”

“Yeah,” Shiloh said a bit sheepishly, “well, you didn’t really get everything right. Enough, but not all of it. Others in your future have made some improvements and corollaries.”

“Yeah? Like what?” Jacob moved towards the tablet. 

Shiloh pulled from his pocket a device that looked like a metal wand with lights and switches. “Step away from the tablet,” he said. “Everything is still fragile and one swipe of the pen can shatter the future.”

Jacob paused, looking at Shiloh. “What’s that?”

Shiloh pressed a button and the tip of the wand glowed and emitted a high pitched tone. The tablet switched off. Shiloh put the device away. 

“What did you just do?”

“Oh, nothing really. Your tablet is fine. I just drained it of energy so you could not alter the formula prematurely. After you charge it back up, it’ll be fine.”

“So why are you here? What does any of this have to do with this Nostradammit fellow you mentioned?”

“Wanna go for a trip, Jacob?”

“Why would I ….” Jacob turned white as a ghost. “No.”

“Yes.”

“No.”

“Did I mention you disappeared shortly after you completed your master work never to be seen again?”

“No, no, no!” There was a little panic in Jacob’s denials. 

Shiloh sighed. “I’m afraid so. You know what I’m saying is true.”

“No, he doesn’t,” said a stranger sitting on the single bed in the corner. 

Shiloh and Jacob turn to face the new intruder. 

Shiloh shook his head sadly. “I was afraid of this. Your presence complicates everything.”

“You know this woman?” Jacob asked. 

“Not in the least,” Shiloh said. “But our models predicted such a possibility.”

“What he’s telling you,” the stranger said as she stood, “is a load of cow manure.”

“And where are you from?” Jacob asked. 

“That’s not the relevant question,” she said. “Why am I here?”

“Obviously to protect your future,” Shiloh said. “Some alternative time potential.”

“Wrong,” she said. “I’m from your future, Shiloh, not some alternative possibility. You see, that’s one of the predictive models your team got wrong. There aren’t an infinite number of possible futures vying for existence. There’s just the one timeline and we’re all on it. And sending Jacob back to the Middle Ages to become Nostradamus is absolutely horse shit.”

“Liar,” Shiloh said, anger creeping into his voice. 

“I need a drink,” Jacob said, a migraine starting to throb.

The three of them stared at each other in a Mexican standoff. 

“Don’t be hasty,” the woman said. “We can logic this out. The future and the past depend on what we decide in the next twenty minutes.”

“So, whiskey all around?” Jacob asked, moving to the bar. 

“I like mine neat,” Shiloh said. 

“Make mine a double,” the woman said. “Time travel is thirsty business.”",12

June huffs. “Then why didn’t you say that before I brought him over?”

“Umm, well, you see…” Bruce side eyes his wife, Renee.

“We thought that was implied,” Renee says. “Where did you even find an alien boyfriend?”

Without skipping a beat, June says, “Area 51, of course.”

Bruce’s eyes widen. “You mean to tell me you infiltrated a heavily guarded military posting just to find a boyfriend?”

June chuckles. “No, that would be silly. I went in looking for proof aliens existed.”

“Naturally,” Bruce says.

“And you walked out with a boyfriend?” Renee asks.

“Yeah. Life is funny like that, huh?” June pauses. “So, do you guys want to meet him?”

Renee and Bruce exchange concerned glances before Bruce says, “Sure, we’d love to.”

“Great, let me get him,” June says, running to the door. “I’ll be right back.”

Bruce looks at Renee. “You don’t think it’s an actual alien, do you?”

Renee laughs. “There’s no way. You know how June gets.”

“Knock knock,” June says as she pokes her head through the front door. “Me and Kersflag are here.”

Bruce can feel his stomach tightening as his daughter walks through the door with a bright green blow up alien attached to her hip.

“Mom, Dad, this is Kersflag.”

Renee looks at Bruce, who sighs and says, “Yeah, yeah, I’ll call the psychiatrist again.”

1liw543,mzfteu0,"When Alfred told his daughter, ""Whoever they are, bring them home"", he knew to prepare himself for a non-human. It helps when his god, Lord Elvari, is dating a member of his church committee. Or having to partake in the wedding ceremonies of unholy unions of humans and Deep Ones from Innsmouth.

""Dad, this is James,"" Jessie signalled to the young man standing next to her. ""And this is my dad, Alfred.""

""You [two together sound like trouble](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/14e8boo/wp_one_can_easily_distinguish_a_true_veteran/jou72fa/),"" Alfred said, in an attempt to lighten the mood. He felt the heavy tension in the air. The trembling from James.

""See, dad, this isn’t what you think,"" Jessie tried to reassure her father. ""I'm not dating one of the supernatural entities in this town. James is human.""

On the surface.

Alfred had interacted with Elvari's minions long enough to know one. Even if they wore a human disguise. But now was not the time to spill the beans.

So, he invited the young couple to sit for dinner. The topics drifted from how they met (at summer camp) to any plans they had for the future (none so far). He asked how much they know about each other. But most of all, despite his apparent lack of experience, Alfred needed to know if James genuinely loved his daughter, and was willing to be by her side for the rest of her life. Which would be trivial to him if James was exactly what Alfred thought he was.

""Jessie, do you mind doing the dishes? While I have a chat with James, one man to another?""

""Sure, dad!"" She replied back nervously.

Confident she was far away in the kitchen, he turned to James, who was shaking like a jello. Struggling to maintain his human shape.

""Why the deception?"" Alfred leaned in and whispered. ""We're in Innsmouth. Jessie knows about Shoggoths like you. I work with your kind all the time, with Lord Elvari. You might be able to mislead Jessie, but not me.""

""Its not intentional..."" the young Shoggoth stammered, greyish goo and tentacles slipping through the crumbling disguise. ""She saw me in human shape, so I kept it. She didn’t ask, so I didn't say.""

""Promise me you're not secretly waiting to wear her skin,"" Alfred squeezed a tentacle with an iron grip. ""Or I will let your creator know you hurt the daughter of his head priest. I will tell Lord Elvari to turn you into jello and slurp you with his slime pudding.""

""No, no, I promise,"" James wobbled and bobbed his head. ""I really, really like her for real.""

""Swear upon the name of the Lord of Innsmouth.""

""I swear! Please, I love her and I will take care of her. I won't allow anyone or anything eat her or wear her skin,"" the Shoggoth was still shaking. ""I will be on my best behavior or may the Lord smite me.""

""Good kid,"" he patted James. ""I will retire to my room and give you two some space. But if you do anything funny, I have my ways of knowing.""

And with that, he performed one of those ""I have my eyes on you"" gesture before walking towards his study.

**
--

""Your father is scary,"" James, now back into his human look, remarked, when Jessie came to sit next to him on the couch. ""I have never been terrified to sit near a human until he came along.""

""Oh, James, its okay. He won't bite. Dad is only worried about me. A bit of an overprotective father.""

""I see where Lord Elvari gets the overprotectiveness of his adopted kid Jane, My Lord almost killed me for pushing her into the kiddie pool once,"" James started to peel away at the human mask. ""So, before both of them turn me into a Shoggoth snack to go with slime puddings, I'm confessing.""

1liw543,mzgeako,"""Hello Mr. and Mrs. Wilder, it's a pleasure to meet you"", the young woman said perfunctorily, eyes not quite meeting theirs.

A soft alarm was ringing in the depths of my head; there was something here that was off. I looked her over from head to toe, trying to determine what was out of place. She was about 5'5"", brunette, with a headband neatly tucking most of her hair back behind her ears, though a rogue strand had escaped and hung askew by her left eyebrow. She wore a blouse under a comfortable sweater; one of the sleeves bunched slightly leading to slightly uneven wrist visibility. Her pants were pocketed slacks; not too formal, but slightly nicer than casual; the end of a colourful lanyard peeked out the top of one pocket. Finally, her shoes were comfortable and casual clogs with a glossy finish. Overall, a very ordinary, if ever so slightly  disheveled woman.

*So what am I not seeing*?

""Dad, you're being weird..."", Alison said quietly.

Snapping out of my investigation, I looked to my daughter, then to my wife. Each had a half embarrassed, half accusatory look.

""My apologies--"", I started to say, but looking back to the lady standing before me, her face was blank and unmoving.

""It's actually Dr. Wilder."" I corrected, narrowing my eyes slightly.

A look flashed across her face. *What was that? Panic? Puzzlement? Amusement?*

*""Marcus!""* my wife chastised, a horrified expression plain on her face. She strode up to the woman, taking her hand in a welcoming, apologetic handshake. ""You'll have to excuse my husband, he's had a very long day at work and seems to have left his manners behind in his rush to get home."" She gave me a cutting side-eye as she said that last bit. She moved aside to make way for my daughter and the woman to enter the house.

Alison walked in, holding the woman's hand, but she slipped it free. She stood quite still and looked a little pale, as if she knew I was onto her and didn't dare give me any more clues.

""Maybe this was a mistake..."" she said nervously, ""I'm sorry to have bothered you Mr. and Mrs.-- I mean Dr. Wilder. I'll just lea--""

""*That's it!*"" I shouted. The mystery in me unravelling in an instant.

*Her voice!*",20
1liw543,mzh41hi,"The first thing I saw when I opened the door was what I would charitably describe as a collection of wrong angles pretending to be a person. It stood politely, all seven feet of it, wrapped in what might have been a tailored suit if suits had previously been designed to accommodate segmented limbs, armored carapace plating, and a head shaped like a geodesic dome.

Then I looked past it and saw my daughter. She was holding its… hand? Claw? Manipulator? She smiled at me like it was a regular Tuesday.

“Hi Dad. This is Vrekk.”

Vrekk inclined his head. A strange noise came out of him. It sounded like a modem from the ’90s dying in a microwave. My daughter squeezed his appendage affectionately.

I reminded myself to breathe. Then I stepped back and waved them inside.

“Of course. Come in. Can I get either of you something to drink? We have water, soda… do you drink liquids?”

“I’m fine,” said Vrekk. The words were understandable but came from somewhere deep in his chest, as if someone had taught a garbage disposal English. “Thank you for your hospitality.”

I gestured toward the living room. “Please, sit wherever is structurally reinforced.”

They chose the couch. It creaked. I winced.

My daughter looked nervous for the first time. “So, yeah. I didn’t want to keep this from you forever. But I knew it might be… surprising.”

“It is, butI meant what I said. Whoever you’re with, I want to meet them. And I want you to be able to bring them home.”

She smiled again. “Thanks, Dad.”

Vrekk reached out one of his upper limbs and rested it gently on her shoulder. The plates there hissed slightly as they shifted into place. My eye twitched.

“So, Vrekk,” I said, making my voice the polite kind of neutral usually reserved for job interviews and landmine disposal, “What do you do?”

“I am a conflict resolution strategist for the diplomatic corps of the Fourth Shell Dominion.”

“Ah,” I said. “Shell Dominion.”

“Yes. We are not the same as the Cracked Shell Hegemony. That would be offensive.”

“Right. Wouldn’t want to make that mistake.” I offered a smile that probably looked like a grimace. “And how did you two meet?”

Vrekk made a noise that sounded almost like a chuckle. “She was leading a student delegation to the United Species Summit. We disagreed on the formatting of the Earth section in the unity charter. The discussion became… vigorous.”

“I hit him with a binder,” my daughter added, proud.

“And I fell in admiration,” Vrekk said.

I blinked. “Literally or metaphorically?”

“Yes,” said Vrekk.

There was a long pause.

“Well,” I said finally, “you seem very… diplomatic.”

He inclined his head again. “I have undergone fifteen millennia of ancestral memory training and possess a fully autonomous empathy cluster. I am certified to mediate interstellar border disputes, resource allocation skirmishes, and reproductive contract negotiations among hive-clan polycells.”

I turned to my daughter. “Wow. A real overachiever. Just like your mother.”

She laughed. I looked back at Vrekk.

“Now listen,” I said, leaning forward just enough to make the chair creak like it might file a complaint, “I have only one condition for anyone dating my daughter. Treat her with respect. Love her, support her, and be there when she needs you. If you do that, I don’t care what your skeleton is made of or how many hearts you have.”

“Three,” said Vrekk. “All flame-bound.”

“Great,” I said. “Triple the heartbreak if you mess it up.”

Vrekk didn’t flinch. “I will not. She is cherished beyond standard biological metrics.”

My daughter blushed. “He writes poetry.”

“I’m sure it’s very lyrical in… whatever your language is.”

“It has no spoken form,” Vrekk said. “But if you allow me to secrete a listening gland on your-”

“Nope,” I said, standing up. “Dinner’s ready.”

We all filed into the kitchen. Vrekk was very careful with the kitchen chair. It groaned but held.

They stayed for three hours. We ate. We talked. Vrekk explained what courting rituals were like when your species primarily communicated through shifting bioluminescent patterns and infrared pheromone plumes. My daughter showed me a video. I was mostly disturbed but tried to be supportive.

When they left, I walked them to the door.

“Thanks again,” my daughter said, hugging me. “For being cool about this.”

I hugged her back. “You’re my kid. If you’re happy, I’m happy. That’s the rule.”

She pulled back and smiled.

Then Vrekk extended a limb toward me.

I hesitated. Then I took it. It was surprisingly warm.

“You are a remarkable father,” he said.

“You’re not so bad yourself,” I said. “Just don’t give me any grandspawn that hatch in the walls.”

Vrekk’s dome twitched. “Our offspring are raised communally in thermal nurseries the size of your human cruise ships.”

I stared.

“I was joking,” I said.

“I was not,” he replied.

They left.

I stood in the doorway for a long minute, then turned off the porch light and walked back inside.

I had a lot of reading to do about hive-clan polycells.",19
1liw543,mzhg1he,"James sighed as he lit his cigarette. Tonight was the night; his daughter was bringing home her, to use his child's very incessant terminology, ""partner"". He tucks the pack of L&M Reds back into his shirt pocket as he sits down on the rocking chair of the porch. He swiftly remembers the conversation he'd had with his daughter. 

--

""Dad, for the last time, I'm not bringing my partner over for dinner!"" 

Cecilia said, sternly. Exactly as James had taught her to. Screaming at your family got everyone nowhere fast, and if you couldn't have a civil disagreement with someone, then it was time to walk away. That or grab a bottle of bourbon and settle for the long haul. Thankfully, this conversation was not one of the latter. 

""I'm not understanding why you don't want to. I've already told you that no matter who you date, I'm happy for you. I want them to feel like part of the family. Who knows? Maybe they'll be my child-in-law."" 

James retorts, shrugging as he makes his turkey sandwich. In rural Texas, James had been called one of the Good 'Ol Boys more times than he could count. But he was not about to be like his own father, who would pick up a belt or a stick at the first mention of one of his kids being unlike ""polite"" society. He'd done his absolute best to be the opposite, encouraging his daughter from the moment she'd come out as bisexual. 

""Because... Because I'm just not, okay?"" 

Cecilia says, her arms gesturing vaguely in only the way a very exasperated teenager does. Her arms proceed to cross over the kitchen island, her cheeks pouting ever so slightly. James smiles; that'll never not be cute. 

""Tell you what, I'll wait until you're ready and stop asking. When you do, I get to rub it in your face that it's not as serious as you think it is."" 

Immediately James can see the hamster running in his daughter's head. Her face scrunches, her eyes squint, and she takes a shallow breath. He knew the moment that last mannerism seeped out; the sign of an offer she couldn't refuse. But to her credit, Cecilia takes a few seconds to answer. 

""Deal."" 

--

James chuckles at the memory. Ahh, kids. Too dumb to look at the bigger picture and predict the future. This would be embarrassment fuel for the rest of her life. He couldn't wait to tell the story at the family gatherings. Or when he was drop dead drunk. 

He leans back in the chair and takes a drag from the cigarette; the only habit he'd inherited from his father that he couldn't defy. Nicotine addiction was a bitch, but so was having a minor breakdown alongside withdrawal. So, the cigarettes were here to stay. 

""Dad?"" 

James startles a little bit when his daughter calls out to him from the treeline instead of the driveway; she'd left with her car, right? Why the hell was she walking out of the woods instead. He turns, the dark of dusk still a little too smothering for him to see well, especially with the light of the cigarette in his mouth. He reaches up and pulls it from his lips, trying to see what's out there. 

""Cecilia? I thought you were going to get your partner, not have a romp through the forest."" 

There's the snapping of twigs and the movement of something big. After a second, something emerges from the dark and James sorely wishes he'd brought the lever action. 

The thing is huge, furry and had eyes that gleam like a dog's. A muzzle half as long as a horses', feet that weren't human and a body structure that, in his panic, James bets could tear open an Abrams Tank and be none the worse for wear. 

""Holy piss-"" 

He begins to say, before it moves it's big arms and his daughter plops down onto the grass. She takes a few steps forward, her hand coming up to meet the massive monster's own freakish appendage. She walks the creature forward, her eyes worried and her posture unsure. 

""Dad, this is Lobo. Yes, she's a werewolf. And yes, she's my partner."" 

James stares, somehow still holding his cigarette despite the pants-shitting anxiety he was feeling. After a second his brain catches up. Then he watches the big creature; Lobo, tilt her head to the side at a 45° angle. Like a big fucking dog. He sighs. 

""Fuck, I think you win the bet.""",12

""Elody?!""  

I couldn't believe my eyes.  It was Elody, the three-armed Fae queen with 4 wings and a shitty attitude.  I banished that son'va bitch to the nighto-sphere years ago and now Julia, MY OWN DAMNED DAUGHTER, brings her into my home.  Lotsa questions.  How'd they meet? Did Juila summon Her? Is she being used to get to me? How can Elody wear such gaudy clothes?

My revolver's in plain site;  I put my hand on it.

Elody says.  ""It's so *very good* to see you Emily. I know this must be quite the shock, but I promise you my intentions with your daughter are... *pure.*  Ever since meeting her I feel like a new woman.  She's brought the golden light back to every one of my sapphire eyes"".  Sure.  Emily looks around confused ""Mom... what?  How do you know my girlfriend?""  Oh Julia, if the world was pure as you.

I cock the hammer back.  Elody's 7 eyes turn fiery red and she starts to grow, times running out.

""MOM. NO!  WE'RE. IN. LOVE!  IF YOU KILL HER YOU BEST PUT THE SECOND ONE THROUGH ME!

I relax the hammer.  Goddamnit.  Elody's eyes relax and she shrinks.

Juila.  My desert sunflower.  She speaks.  ""Ok mom I'm not sure how you know Elody already; but I brought my GIRLFRIEND home to meet MY FUCKING MOTHER and we are having a GODDAMNED PLEASANT MEAL.  You HEAR ME?!""

So we do.  I've been working the grill all day and the steaks are perfect; they're big too.  Can't survive on this side of the Emerald Arch if you don't keep your strength up.  But nobody told me a damned fae devil was dining with us!  I'd have made three more steaks.  Then I'd have eaten them and gone to war.  But fuck it, Julia likes bad girls.

Elody reaches for the steak I was going for.  I cock my hammer back.  Elody picks a different steak.

""Emily, I really would like to put this rather nasty business of you banishing me into the void of woe behind us.  That was last week""  More like 30 damn years.  ""I've got a promising new business, and all my mortal souls have been released.  I'm a *changed* lady"".

Well that's interesting.  She can't lie, I know that much.  She must've found a new power source.  I wish I could trust her.  She was so fun in my 120's.

We finish the food and I show them the door.  ""Now you listen here hellmoth.  Julia's her own woman, and I trust her to take care of herself, and to make good choices and live with 'em.  But if anything happens to her I will hunt you down across every realm that exists and the one's that don't yet.  I give you my word.  I'll jam my boot so far up you're mana-hole that it kills your family tree.""  ***And she knows that I can.***

They leave.  In the distance I can see Elody sad and Juila consoling her.  They do make a cute couple.

I really, reeeaally wish Juila wasn't into bad girls.  But I guess that's the role model she had.",7
1liw543,mzi789m,"Which is worse: your son dating a drug addict or a troublemaker?

The answer is he dates an alien.

I stood looking at my son who was grinning widely, showing his white teeth, his hand holding the smaller hand of another man. If that was a man… I glanced at the person standing next to my son. Blonde hair, chalky pale skin, unnatural purple eyes, and a blank face. He looked like a human being. If I hadn't met an alien before, I might have believed he was just some kind of weirdo.

""Dad! This is Chase."" Aaron said, pointing at the creature called Chase. ""He is my boyfriend.""

Boyfriend, that word shot into my head. I don't have a problem with my son's taste at all. I accept everything he is, but knowing that he brought an alien home was beyond expectations.

I stare at Chase.

He stared back at me.

We stared at each other in silence for a moment before Aaron coughed, causing me to quickly invite them in.

I watched as my son led his boyfriend into the living room, the guy Chase following him with a blank expression like a doll. I could feel the dread rising, my stomach feel uneasy and my hands itching. I wanted to reach for my phone to call my boss and tell him I had found another alien. But I can't do that if I don't know if he's a legally registered alien or not.

I know Aaron had some weird obsessions since he was a kid. He likes to get into mysteries, magic, space, anything that humans still can't find the answers to. I know it's because he's my son, but if he accidentally dates an alien without knowing, that's a bit too much of a coincidence....

I sat down in the seat across from Aaron and Chase, their hands still hold together. I glanced cautiously at Chase, then at my son, who had a strangely proud look on his face.

""So how did you guys meet?...."" I asked, trying to create a conversation.

""I met him behind school."" He said, leaning against Chase affectionately. ""He fell from the sky, can you believe it? It's like God sent him to me.""

I feel a headache.

""And Chase...."" I slowly turned to look at him, his unnatural eyes staring back at me made me feel uneasy. ""How could you date my son?""

Ches didn't answer immediately. His eyes narrowed into a thin line, lips parted.

""I don't know how I ended up like this....""

""Honey, don't say that!"" Aaron wrapped his arms around Chase, pulling him closer and resting the chin on his head. ""You told me yourself that you don't hate me and that you feel differently about me than you do about other human beings.""

My eyebrows twitched.

""You know he's not human?"" I asked out loud.

Aaron paused, turning to look at me with wide eyes, obviously not expecting me to realize that his boyfriend wasn't human. But I didn't expect my son to know already.

""Wait, you know?"" He asked, his arms automatically wrapping around Chase protectively.

My eyebrows furrowed. ""Aaron, I respect you, but can I ask you why you involved with an alien- No, how do you date an alien???""

""Dad, I know what you're thinking, but I love him!"" Aaron spoke firmly, pulling Chase closer until his cheek was against his chest. The expression on his face remained blank, and bored.

""Chase is everything. He's perfect. Dad, you can't make us break up just because he's different from us! He has a heart and feelings too!""

""I haven't even-""

""I love him more than anything in the world. I will never let him go! I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him!""

Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

""I'm not saying you guys have to break up!"" I shouted at Aaron, he finally stopped being dramatic and his brown eyes sparkled as he replied, ""really?""

I sighed and massaged the bridge of my nose.

""Of course I love you and I won't stop your happiness. Just.... I'm glad you're serious and.... serious about it."" I don't dare to say the words in my head directly.

The stupid smile returned to Aaron's face.

""Really? You accept us?"" He stood up immediately and held my hand tightly. ""Thank you, Dad. I'll come back to visit sometime.""

My eyebrow twitched again.

""What do you just say?""

""I'm moving to an apartment with Chase."" Aaron's smile widened. ""I saved up money and found a nice apartment for us, but according to the tradition of Chase's planet, we must first ask permission from our parents before a couple can live together.""

""Hold on-""

""I'm going up to get my stuff!""

I didn't have time to ask anything more, as I watched my son ran up the stairs, leaving me and Chase behind. I glanced at him and he stared back at me. Now I realized that he never blinked.

""So.... how do you like my son?"" I asked hesitantly, my brow furrowed.

""I don't know, I don't even know what love is."" Chess replied honestly, his face blank. ""We creatures do not have gender, desires, or needs. We just live our lives day by day and our match is all about genetic compatibility, and I don't think I'm genetically compatible with Aaron's, since he's a human....""

He turned his face towards the stairs, his eyes narrowed with a light color in his pupils.

""I don't know why I agreed to him but...he was just nice and sweet. I guess."" He said, his lips curved into a small smile on his face.

I looked at him silently before let out a sign through my mouth.

Maybe it's not so bad.

At least I can be sure that my son won't be eaten...

""Wait, did your species eat your mate?"" I looked up and asked him.

He shrugged. ""Maybe.""",5
1liw543,mzg2o90,"It was not what I was expecting.

When I first tripped across it...I kind of expected it. I was hurt, but I kind of expected it. My daughter was home from college, and had borrowed my laptop to do an assignment while she was home on Fall Break. When she was finished, it appeared that she simply folded it down into rest mode, rather than closing any of her screens.

When I opened it to check my e-mail, I found a word document on corporate ethics law, with the cursor still open and blinking on the last page, an internet window with a dozen tabs open, mostly things like Poli-Sci hub, the Harvard Law Library, LexisNexis, her college website, or some section of it, with a chat similar to Slack or Discord, where most of the chat was clearly related to her Business Law class, tabs from Ulta Beauty, Sephora, and Amazon, a Spotify window, a DeviantArt page, Patreon, and the website for one of her favorite coffee brands. Nothing unexpected or shocking, really. Truth be told, I thought nothing I could find would shock or bother me.

After all, from the day we adopted her, when she was 14, she knew that one adoptive parent was non-binary, the other was trans, and we knew that her bio parents had kicked her out because of her relationship with another girl, because they were evangelical Christians who wouldn't accept such “sinful” behavior under their roof, and she had been in and around LGBTQIA spaces with us, and our esoteric hobbies, from the day she was adopted.  
  
I remember when she was 16, and her vibrator fell out from between her mattress and box spring when I was changing the sheets on her bed. She was embarrassed as hell. I just found it amusing, and left a pamphlet on proper toy cleaning, along with a bottle of cleaning solution someplace where she would easily find it.

It was when I popped open Discord, intending to reply to a message that required more than a simple sentence or two, where I preferred having a full keyboard to trying to type out something that could turn into an involved conversation on my tiny phone keyboard, that I saw the chat, as she had left herself logged into Discord, with the most recent private chat with a friend open. Still, I might have just ignored it and logged her out, and logged in myself if it wasn't for the boobs. When I opened the discord window, an already open image of a massive set of bare breasts filled most of the screen with the sentence “Here's a little reminder of what you're missing. I bet you can't wait to suck on these again.” written above the picture. The chat...well, the best description I can make is part romance novel, and part erotica. There was the usual love-letter type stuff about how they couldn't bear to be apart, ranging to the slightly racier things like how she kept a certain article of clothing in her bed “so I can smell your scent on my pillow to fall asleep” to downright pornographic descriptions of what they were going to do to each other the moment they got back to school.",8
1liw543,mzgpep1,"Damn it, June, not again. At this point, wonder how long it would take until she actually brings a real alien lol.

I have doubts that the rest of her story is real, but why not. About the part where she infiltrated Area 51, did June actually do it? Is she just making things up, or is there some truth behind that story?

Great work on writing this!",9
1liw543,mzgpq5b,"Not a good start to the relationship, and this feels more of a potential disaster between James and Jessie more than the parents. That said, I doubt Jessie is truly clueless either considering that previous talk with Elvari. Cheers to slime pudding actually becoming a trend too.

So, how will Jessie react to this? Also, is James' Lord all right with his relationship with Jessie?

Great work on writing this!",10
1liw543,mzgebg3,"Her words had suddenly struck a chord in my memory.

""I knew something was off! The lanyard, the clogs...you're one of the nurses at my hospital!""

The young woman blanched farther, her already pale skin becoming a near white pallor as she looked at my daughter in terror.

I was suddenly struck with immense guilt. ""Oh no no, I'm so sorry! I see how this must seem from your side of things. It's totally fine you're dating my daughter!""

Her eyes darted back and forth between mine and Alison's, not quite sure if this was a test.

""You work in the blood lab right? 3rd floor? I recognize your voice! I couldn't quite place what was bothering me until you said my name! I immediately recognized it from the intercom system!"" I explained, trying to calm the poor girl.

I realized she was still standing outside by herself while I rambled to her.

""Please come in! I'm so sorry about that, I get a little in my own head at times"", I apologized, shaking my head in an effort to clear my foot from my mouth.

She seemed to soften a little at the invitation, her shoulders relaxing slightly. I noticed similar shifts in posture from my wife and daughter as well.

""I'm terribly sorry, could you remind me your name? I remember it being something a little unusual, but I can't quite recall.""

The girl nodded and gave a shy, embarrassed smile. ""Well actually, my name was supposed to be *Noelle,* but my mother had terrible handwriting and they thought she put '*Noette*' on my birth certificate"", she explained, ""so everyone just calls me *Not.*""

She suddenly seemed much more upbeat and energetic now that the misunderstanding was put to rest. Still, I cringed once more thinking about the first impression I had just made.

""I can't believe what a fool I've made of myself tonight. From the look on my face, you'd probably have thought I was so suspicious of you; like I was doubting whether you were a human being or something!"" I caught Alison rolling her eyes with thinly veiled annoyance.

Nonplussed, I continued, ""I'm certain I'm going to be hearing about ""the time Marcus terrified our daughter's girlfriend"" for the rest of my days"", I said, looking to Mrs. Wilder with a rueful expression I hoped was endearing. Her annoyance was even more thinly veiled.

Not laughed, lips curling wide enough to show canines that were a touch too long.

""Well,"" she said, ""I'm sure that won’t be for much longer.”",19
1liw543,mzg2rcs,"Nothing I hadn't seen before, and nothing I hadn't done before, when I was that age. It bothered me that she hadn't told me about her relationship, but given that we were not exactly the typical American family, some obvious reasons for her keeping it a secret ran through my head, and to be honest, I wasn't happy about the possibility of any of them.

When she had gone out with some old friends from her high school days, I asked my spouse if they knew anything about this, as they were a therapist, and our daughter might be more open with them than with me. They didn't know anything about it either, and were about as hurt as I was by the fact that she hadn't told either of us. Neither of us wanted to call her out, but we figured, best-case scenario, it was a new relationship, they might still be in that “honeymoon” phase, and not sure things will last, and was putting off announcing it until she was sure it was more than just a hot fling that would burn out quickly.

In the week she was home, she never mentioned this girl, though the signs were there. The discord notification on her phone sounding, and her smiling at her phone and replying almost instantly, or her taking the dog for a walk when the phone rang. The week went by without her mentioning it.

It was almost Thanksgiving break when she finally mentioned it, in a phone call, trying to be casual, but clearly nervous. “I've been seeing this girl on campus...and, well... She's here on a scholarship, and...well, she doesn't really have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving Break. She usually stays in the dorms...but that's...well, boring, there's nobody around, and you can't really cook, and they limit food service because not a lot of people stay over break. Can...I bring her home for Thanksgiving? I warn you, she can be a bit much...I mean, I know you like your privacy and all, and...also...she's...more than a little...unusual. She has a hard time with stairs, so I don't think she could handle an upstairs room, and she'll need her service dog to help her navigate the house. Would it be OK?

I breathed a sigh of relief. “It's fine. We'd love to have her here. Whatever happens, I hope it can't go worse than the time I brought MY college girlfriend home for Thanksgiving. I do warn you, we're going up to your aunt's place in New York this year for dinner. I felt both the groan and the nerves on the other end of the line, which mirrored my own feelings about it. Believe me, I don't care to go either, and I'd find an excuse if I could, but it's been about three years since I've visited, and people are really getting bitchy about it. second pair of hands to move your mattress down to the library, but I can have the frame and box spring set up for you two when you get here. If I can get Shawn or Christian to help, we can have the library set up for you two.”

The day she came home...I was expecting unusual. I figured some goth, punk or alt girl, or maybe someone dressed in cottagecore or maybe even tradwife style clothing. But the first thing I saw was the dog. The car door opened, and a black labrador bounded out, wearing a harness and vest, and stood stock-still as she got out of the car. Her eyes were covered with dark sunglasses, and I noted she walked with an odd, shuffling gait, and wondered if she had the dog because she was blind, needed it for balance, or both.

Parental units, this is Ally, and her dog Celeste. Ally, Tee and Mel, my adoptive parents. “Pleased to meet you” she said brightly. I noted her s sounds had a slight, hissing lisp to them, and her s sounds had a slightly hissed quality to them. But that had nothing on the accent, which spoke of the Aegean Sea as much as her olive-toned skin did. “Elleniki?”, I asked in my barely passable Greek. “Nai, Thessaloniki.” she responded, her eyes going a little wide. “Ana mentioned you spoke a little Greek, but I didn't think...” her voice trailed off. I laughed. “I've traveled there enough to recognize the accent. Couldn't have told you which region if you hadn't mentioned it. One of these days I'll tell you about how Athens keeps trying to make me stay. Now, let me go in first, and wrangle the dog. Cerbie's getting BIG, and she is rather...enthusiastic with visitors. I've been working with her on not jumping up, and she's got it with US, but since she's never seen you before....” I let my voice trail off.",11

Great work on writing this!",8
1liw543,mzg32r6,"“She'll need time to get used to me and to Celeste.” she said, without missing a beat.

Wednesday night was uneventful. Ally and Ana were close, and clearly happy. Not exactly joined at the hip, but not spending much time apart either.

The next morning, we piled in to the car for the three hour drive to the New York border. Ally and Ana kept us entertained with stories about school, classes, and their friends on the drive up.

When we got to my sister's it was the usual chaos. Half a dozen canines, and more family than even that large house should hold. Dinner was the usual chaos, with most people at the dining room table, kids in the kitchen, and plenty of people at other, side tables set up to manage the sheer number of people my sister saw fit to invite. I had my usual few five to ten minute conversations with people, including my mother and siblings, who I hadn't seen in a few years, and had little in common with, and once the meal ended, people broke into their little social groups, in whatever room was convenient or comfortable.

My nieces and nephews, and my cousins' kids were in the playroom. Most of the men were in front of Brad's massive TV, watching football. My mother and sisters were in the kitchen, and several other relations were still seated around the dining room table, playing cards.

The four of us went down to the bar, where my brother, and two brothers-in-law, along with Brad's two brothers, were drinking, shooting pool, playing darts, and talking about camping and golf. We all accepted drinks, and mostly the conversation flowed around us without touching us, save for a few questions to Ana and Ally about how they met and school.

Ally excused herself to go to the bathroom. Finding the one off the bar occupied, she asked Brad where she might find another. He mentioned there was one on the other side of the playroom. She had been gone for about five minutes when we heard a child scream. It wasn't the usual scream of a child at play, but a shriek of terror. Ana had a look of horror on her face, whispering “Oh no...no...no” as she shot out of her chair and toward the playroom like her hair was on fire. Mel tossed me their cane and first aid bag as I shot out of my chair, knowing I could do anything with that cane I could do with a sword if there was real trouble, and that I had been a medic with my local fire department for years.",8
1liw543,mzg3c6y,"When we burst into the playroom, the children were shrieking like banshees, and running in all directions, away from the room itself. In the center of the room was the stone statue of a dog, that looked like my brother-in-law's massive Cane Corso, mouth open, and eyes looking at the floor. Ally was on the floor, pinned by the statue, her dark glasses and head covering several feet away. From this angle, I could see the massive, snake-like tail under her dress, which had slipped up enough to leave a portion of the tail bare. As I came around the statue, I saw Ally, her hands covering her face, crying, and repeating “No...no....no....not again...no....” over and over, while the snakes she had in place of hair writhed and hissed. Ana scrambled to recover the dark glasses and head scarf, and quickly got her head and eyes covered, while assuring Ally that it was OK, it was an accident, and she didn't mean for it to happen, and at least this time, it was only a dog.

“Gorgon?” I asked, Ana quietly. “Yeah. Which, given your history with Athena, and the Theoi in general, I wasn't sure if you'd be OK with it, or respond with your sword and a mirror.”

“Ally, what happened?” I was coming back from the bathroom, and this massive dog...lunged at...either me or Celeste...I'm honestly not sure. But he jumped up, caught me with those paws, and knocked off my glasses and my head scarf...and...well...you can see what happened. I'm just glad the kids all ran away in terror when it happened. But how are we going to explain this?”

I snorted. “I'll talk to them. And here I thought nothing could be worse than the Lexa incident...my cousins stole my girlfriend's wig at dinner when I was in college. She was undergoing chemo. To this day, my mom denies that it ever happened. Worst case scenario, we're not invited back, and to be honest, we're not missing much.”  
  
I sighed heavily, and walked out to try to explain to my brother-in-law what happened to his dog.",10
1lj7ze6,mzhrsxl,"I stare in the mirror, sighing.  
I have aged a bit, but I still look young, after all, I am only in my late 20s.  
Yet the rumors outside...  
Sigh.  
""Your Majesty, the Prime Minister is here to visit."" a servant said from outside my room.  
I took on my mask.  
""Let him in, and bring us some refreshments."" I say.  
The door opens.

  
""Your Majesty."" the Prime Minister bows.  
I nod.  
""The eastern front has stabilized, and after Your Majesty has dealt personally with the Barbarian Chieftain, the northern front is now tranquil  as well.  
Has Your Majesty managed to..."" he started.  
I threw a vial at him.  
""Cure for the southern plague."" I say.  
Before he could say something, the servants brought us refreshments.  
So he enjoyed them.

  
After a while, the Prime Minister sighs.  
""You know, we could totally sell you as the previous Queen's long lost sister, and have to legitimately sit on that throne."" he says.  
""And my spells, my actions, and my mannerism would give it away in a moment, that the one they call murderer, witch, and monster is now once again their queen.  
Just without a mask."" I say.  
""When it's just the two of us, you could be without a mask."" he says.  
Before I could answer, a servant came in to announce that the Marshall wants to see me, and that the Finance Minister wants to discuss with the Prime Minister.  
I nod, and after the door is closed, I laugh.

  
""See?  
This is why I keep the mask on, even when I am asleep. Especially then."" I say.  
""What did the Queen do to deserve such a body-double?"" he asks, standing up.  
""She saved me. Helped me become whom I am today.  
I wish I could have helped her more when she was here, but now...  
I can finally repay her for everything."" I say.  
He sighs, and leaves the room.  
A few minutes later, I leave as well, to meet with the Marshall, and see whom needs to be killed.  
After all...  
Usually, I am only needed when the decisions that have to be made, are too risky for the ministers to deal with themselves.",6
1lj4gi1,mzh2f6f,"The god sat on a park bench eating a chili dog.

It had been three years since it made the switch. The paperwork was surprisingly straightforward. Existential compression into a form that did not accidentally erase entire dimensions every time it had a thought? Not even a full afternoon. The hard part was getting used to digestion. And itchiness. And gravity.

“Hey man, you’re gonna drop that.”

A passing teenager pointed at the droop of mustard that had migrated down his wrist.

“Thanks,” the god replied, wiping it off with the cuff of a flannel shirt. The shirt was secondhand, which the god had chosen specifically because it already knew what it was like to create new things. The goal now was to experience existing ones. Including stains.

The teenager had already moved on, earbuds in, confident the world had gone back to being as normal as it ever was. Which was to say: barely held together and full of people who did not know how to stop themselves from self-destructing, yet kept failing to actually finish the job.

The god liked that part. The trying. Humans were terrible at most things but extremely persistent about it.

It licked the rest of the chili dog and leaned back, squinting up at the sky. Blue today, some clouds, a faint smell of summer sun baked into the concrete like seasoning. He had not named himself. Names carried weight. Even human ones. Especially human ones. But the barista at the coffee shop he liked had called him Marcus once and he hadn’t corrected her. That worked.

Marcus. Fine. Marcus it was.

The god who was Marcus now had originally turned human for one very specific reason: self-preservation. Not the cowardly kind. The practical kind. Like putting a fence around a black hole and a note that read don’t touch, it bites.

See, omnipotence came with some quirks. The problem wasn’t knowing everything or being able to do everything. The problem was the urge to try everything, immediately, and all at once. When you were an omnipotent being sitting outside of time and you asked “what would happen if I inverted the idea of consequence,” the answer wasn’t a theoretical one. It was a crater with screaming edges that echoed in twelve simultaneous dimensions.

It was worse than boredom. It was possibility poisoning.

So he had folded himself down. Chosen a form that could eat breakfast and trip on uneven pavement and smell diesel fumes on Tuesday mornings. He had given up his perfect memory. His ability to see all variables. He had even put a limiter on his own intuition. That one took effort.

Now, he was just a man on a bench, contemplating a nap.

The chili dog gone, Marcus crumpled the wrapper into a ball and missed the trash can. He stared at it for a moment, then left it there. Littering was bad. But so was perfection. He’d clean it up in a minute.

Across the green, an old man argued with a younger woman. Something about inheritance. She gestured wildly, phone in one hand, disappointment all over her face. The god watched them both and understood nothing of their pain, but felt it anyway. Which was a trick he hadn’t known he’d missed. Pain without omniscience had texture.

A jogger ran by with a shirt that said Jesus Saves. That made him smile. He’d met Jesus. Nice guy. Overachiever. Kept trying to explain parables to people who just wanted a shortcut. Marcus had told him, once, to try using jokes. Jesus had tried. People crucified him anyway.

He leaned back again.

He did not miss omnipotence. What he missed was clarity. When you were god, things were neat. Lines drawn. Endpoints known. Now, he sometimes forgot what he’d meant to do when he walked into a room.

It was wonderful.

A child ran past chasing a red balloon. It slipped from their fingers and floated upward, out of reach. The child stopped, stared up, then burst into tears.

Marcus stood. Picked up a stick from the grass. Tapped the balloon lightly with the tip of his finger. Just a little tap. Nothing fancy. No divine intervention. Just the gentlest suggestion that maybe physics could bend, just once, and bring joy instead of disappointment.

The balloon dropped.

The child shrieked in delight, caught it, and ran off again.

Marcus sat back down and sighed. That had been risky. Even that tiny act could have unzipped causality. But it didn’t. He’d gotten better at restraint. At balance. At remembering he wasn’t here to fix the world.

He was here to live in it.

The sun dipped behind a cloud and a breeze picked up. He shivered.

“Goddamn,” he muttered. Then grinned. “Sorry. Force of habit.”

He pulled his flannel tighter and watched the world keep going.",14

""Yeah. Fending off eldritch beings, other gods, void dwellers, and mortals hunting gods...

""I don't want to be that guy bro...but being a human isn't easier."" I say.  
He nods.

  
""I know. In these last 6 months, I almost died because someone wanted my shirt.  
I starved because I didn't have money. Slept on the streets 'cuz I had no place...  
I just realized that I was lucky to be omnipotent."" he says.  
""Wisdom bro.  
You don't know what you have, until you lose it, bro."" I say.  
He nods.  
""If only the usage of my powers wouldn't bring these monsters to me...or wouldn't threaten to kill me."" he says.  
I smile.  
""I won't ask you then to make the IRS forget about me."" I laugh.

1liuj6x,mzg6p6g,"""It's the only way if I want to finish watching this Mister Creature video, dammit,"" Roy bemoaned as he dragged Kevin up. ""The colossi are the only source of goddamned Wi-Fi.""

Kevin could only sigh while trudging along with the rest of the rag-tag tribe. He still remembered the day all six of them voted between trying to rebuild civilization, or to continue their dependence on these wandering colossi. His vote to rebuild was the only one.

Some thing just don't change.

Long after civilization collapsed from mutually assured destruction, the remaining humans still needed their dopamine hits from Tiktok and Youtube. Once, they had feared the colossi, war machines that could blast a skyscraper into smithereens. Now that these colossi wandered aimlessly with no target they could identify, they provided shelter. Slow-moving shelter.

And Wi-Fi.

Yea, that's the most important thing to the rest of them. Not trying to learn how to farm. Not trying to build a shelter of their own. Nope, it was charging their phones and getting Wi-Fi. At this rate, civilization could never come back.

""Has anyone considered climbing up a colossi and piloting it?"" Kevin called out as he dragged his feet behind the others chasing after the colossal they nicknamed ""Modem"".

""You try,"" Roy sneered. ""Bastard's fifty foot tall, I think. I ain't going up there. How did humans get up there in the past?""

Paul shrugged. ""Escalators? Elevators? Well, something.""

These remaining humans Kevin was stuck with were hopeless. Sometimes, he wished it could be someone smart. Someone who knew a thing or two about piloting these colossi and take them out of autopilot. Or maybe someone who could help him build a simple base on a colossal. A part of him wished he was one of those clever inventor types. Not just some miserable accountant wishing he could do better.

""Guys, my Youtube is lagging...""

Kevin pushed past these doom-scrolling brain-rotted companions of his.

""I'm going to hunt for food. Anyone else coming?"" He declared, his hands firmly gripping the makeshift spear he painstakingly carved with his pocket knife.

""After I'm done watching this episode of Amongus Rants, okay?""

1liysf1,mzgq3x6,"Interstate 224. The road that connected Nothing to Nowhere. No one was ever quite sure just how long it had been abandoned; closed off from the other interstates and highways, scrubbed from all maps and county paperwork. What people were sure of, was that SOMEONE was still maintaining it. The asphalt was always pristine. The roadlines and streetlights and payphones always freshly redone, bright and fully functional. 

Curious youths and rebellious teens were a  not too uncommon sight on the road, always off to prove it went somewhere, or to ""settle a score"" with someone else. Overtime, the road became a hangout for car enthusiasts and racers. The locals would warn them away, citing that it had been closed for a reason. Of course, that only served to spur them on. Drag races, Time Trials, general street mod testing, all became a nightly occurrence, with any trace of skid marks, car wrecks, oil leaks, or anything else that had gone on being fully gone by morning's first light.

It was on another such evening, the same as any other from the past many years, that the racers of Team Street Ratz and Road Hog saw first-hand the REAL reason that I-224 was abandoned. The race started as any other, Miranda, the spunky red-head race queen stood at the crosswalk that had long served as the agreed upon starting line, a dainty pink rag held high above her head. Tony ""Turbocharge"" and Percy ""Porkchop"" sat in their respective hot rods, staring intently at the rag. Miranda waved it once... twice... BOOM! In a flash, the rag fluttered to her feet as both engines roared to life, green flames pumping from Turbocharge's exhaust while Porkchop wheeled, nearly fishtailing to an early loss before wrestling control back and pushing ahead, now fighting to make up the mere fractions of a second he fell behind. 

It didn't take long before he had managed to close the gap, the two racers sparing a single glance at one another, daring the other to hit the Nos first. They only had a few miles before the finish line, and whoever blinked first was almost certain to lose. Tony fingered the switch, steadying his breath, he waited, waited to hear to screech of Porkchop's tires as he triggered his. Percy, meanwhile, was counting the seconds, waiting not for Turbocharge, but merely for the exact moment where he would end the race as his tank ran empty.",16
1liysf1,mzfzfl2,"It's not hard to see why this long section of motorway was abandoned - it went nowhere! Years later, street racers congregated there to race and show off their cars. Today, they found out the real reason it was abandoned. Three racers readied themselves at now faded lines for a crosswalk, engines revved and smoke from the tires plumed out from the wheel wells. A woman clad in a leather jacket and bikini with two green flags raised vertically in the air counted down from five. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. The flags dropped and the racers took off, each one trying to outpace the other. Abandoned buildings pass by them faster and faster until they looked like one uniform colored wall. This thirteen mile stretch of road has been abandoned since 1932. No one goes down or mentions this road, except for racers and the few old folks who still mention it from time to time. The racers continued to gain speed when both noticed in front of them two police vehicles blocking the road ahead. Both racers quickly slammed on the breaks, skidding a good twenty yards stopping mere feet from the police vehicles. The racers looked confused as they gazed upon the two police cars that looked like they were from the 1920s with the officers dressed the same. One racer rolls down the window to yell at the two out of time officers when they suddenly draw their sidearms. The racers scramble to reverse as the officers open fire, one shot hits the second racer in the head killing him instantly. The first racer panics as his car stalls.",14

Four seconds...

Three seconds...

With adrenaline pulsing through him, Percy triggers his chutes, flicking on his emergency stop lights to signal Tony to do the same. something is wrong, the track is clear, the sun is to their backs, but they need to stop.

Tony, seeing his opponent bail takes this as a chance to save some money, hitting the gas while closing the cover on his Nos switch. With a slight laugh, he settles in to collect his prize... only to watch on in horror as the very road begins to rise off the ground in front of him. He slams his brakes, pulling his own chutes, but it is too little too late. He and his hot rod go flying off the now ramp of a road, still rolling at more than 100mph, as he shuts his eyes and braces for the crash, he curses himself for not heeding the emergency stop Percy had called for.

...

Yet. There is nothing.

Opening his eyes, he looks around, and finds a large, crystal-like eye staring back at him.

\*Hello, human. Why are you driving on my back? It hurts, you know?\*

Tony screams, sinking as far down into his seat as he can, begging the... the thing to not eat him.

With a... snort? the strange thing sets Tony and his car down, though now, rather than the pristine asphalt of I-224, he is on the hard, compact dirt of the untamed land. Percy rolls up near him, yelling something about how they need to go. Tony looks at him, then up at the thing, then back to Percy. He mumbles something about their friends at the finish line, only for Percy to point to the pair of trucks rolling down the road ahead of them, already high-tailing it back to town. Percy spares a single glance up at the thing, giving a cowardly half-smile and nod before rolling his window back up, and making a very slow, careful turn.

Tony, still somewhat disoriented, follows suit, and they both make the quietest, quickest haste they can to return to town.

The thing, now annoyed at being awake, watches them all leave. It mutters to itself about their deal, and why people were bothering it again before slinking back into the earth, now twisting its body this and way and that, turning the once straight drive of I-224 into a winding, twisting mess of sharp turns and hard corners.

...

Interstate 224, the road that connected Nothing to Nowhere. No one was sure why was abandoned, nor were they sure why it was built the way it was. Twisting and turning as though snaking around mountains that were no longer there, the road was quite the sight to behold.

If it was just a physical, just a behavioural, match, you wouldn't even need the rift. The world is full of accountants who used to play bass.

Imagine if you find a match. They'll look just like them. They'll behave just like them. But they won't actually be them. How good a fake would I have to give you so that you didn't feel you'd lost your father? How convincing does a changeling have to be for a mother to not care that her real baby is dead? We mourn those we lost because of who they are, not what role they played.

The materialists will tell you that if you can't name a difference, pin it down with data, then it doesn't exist. You and I know different. The snow falls more crisply on Christmas day than the day before, no matter what. The coin you find carries more luck than the one you're given. Those waffles she used to feed you came from a packet, but they don't taste the same any more. There's something more, and across all the worlds, it's irreplaceable.

There's no easy answer and I'm so sorry. It's not fair that you can't bring them back, but finding an atomically-identical fake is just as unhealthy as one made of straw. We couldn't love them, really, if they could be replaced. All we can do is mourn, because in the entire universe, across countless worlds, reality is poorer without them.

We can send you through the rift. It's no trouble, and no cost. Since last year, it's actually your legal right to go through. If you want to go, you can. But I guarantee you won't find what you're looking for.

Endless realities, but contained within just one. The people you love are unique, individual, unforgeable. Irreplaceable.",137
1lioz3d,mzf7504,"There’s an odd sensation when you finally get what you want. There’s satisfaction, sure. Sometimes there’s relief. I imagine runners collapse at the end of their races not because they’re tired, but because they’re relieved, like they’ve done what they needed to do, and now they can let go. Sometimes it looks dramatic: they fall to their knees, panting, crying. But they run all the time. A few laps can’t really be that exhausting. 

I got exactly what I wanted. And the day I did, I slept for days.Or maybe it was the pneumonia. My mom would come in every now and then and tell me to take all the time I needed.
My dad was ecstatic, calling everyone he knew, celebrating the miracle. Miracle, I thought, was supposed to mean something divine. An act of God, Favor. Not being washed up on the shore like a beached whale. After everything I’ve been through, I doubt God’s showing me any favor.
He’s probably cursing my name, considering I’ve messed with His so called grand master plan. You don’t throw yourself into the ocean as a thank you. Honestly, after everything… I wouldn’t be surprised if there was no God at all. Either He exists and created us with some higher purpose, or this world is just a chaotic compilation of water, plants, and germs all walking around, whining about how they have no control over their lives. I was done whining. I didn’t want to hurt anymore. When you spend your life wishing, you eventually stop looking at the stars and start doing the work. Who was going to stop me? It’s not like I had parents to teach me otherwise. 

I walked into the kitchen and took a seat. After sleeping for days, you lose your appetite. You have to remind yourself to eat. Luckily, Mom always had food prepared for me. She kept it warm, sometimes gave it to the neighbors when it got too old, but always made something new before the last plate was even touched. It didn’t matter what I said, she made sure there was always something ready, in case I decided to come out of the room. She laid down a plate: pancakes, bacon, eggs, toast. A bowl of fruit, and a few glasses, one water, one orange juice, and… something dark 

“What is that? Grape juice?” I asked.

“Oh, that’s cranberry juice, dear,” she said, her voice tight and careful. “Is that okay? Do you not like cranberry? I can run to the store and grab grape if you’d rather—”

“It’s fine,” I said. “Thank you.” I took the cup and sipped. Cold. A little bitter.

Dad walked in and sat across from me immediately. No food, no drink, just sat down there, smiling.

“Heya, champ. How you feeling today?”

“I’m okay,” I said. I looked up at them. They were leaning in, drinking in every word like I was water after a long drought.

“I was… I was just wondering,” I began, “can we go back to the beach?” Their faces dropped, from eager smiles to tense jaws, eyes struggling to keep up the expression. It got quiet.

“Now why—it’s—you should be relaxing, baby—” Mom’s voice cracked.

“That’s alright,” Dad cut in. “That’s alright,” he said again, forcing a laugh as he held her arm. “I’m sure it’s—It’s a beautiful day! We’ll drive by the beach, grab some burgers, maybe see a movie, huh? How’s that sound? A family day!” He started clapping, raising his arms, trying to steer the mood.

“I was actually hoping to just… sit. In the sand. I won’t go in the water.” I don’t know why I thought this would be easy. I should’ve eased into it. Oh well. Guess I’m in it now. Mom was silent, glancing between me and Dad. Dad was already grabbing his coat and keys.

“Can’t we… wait? It’s too soon. What if—can’t we go to the pier instead?” Mom was practically on the verge of tears, but still holding her smile.

“Hun, please.” Dad gave her a look. A look that vanished just as I turned back to him. A look that said don’t ruin this.

We got into the car. I strapped in and lowered the window. The car smell was nauseating. I’d been in all kinds of vehicles, sleek black sedans the social workers drove to the beat-up leather seats in foster parents cars. My favorite was the Big Al semi the Moroccos let me ride in when Mr. Morocco went on deliveries. It made me feel huge. If it weren’t for all that traveling, I would’ve never found the doorway. And if I hadn’t found the doorway, I wouldn’t have found my new parents I guess.. I guess it holds a special place. But now, here on the other side… everything felt off. Everything made me nauseous. I felt confused and conflicted over the smallest things.
Sometimes I’d just have to lay down. That’s why I’d been in bed for days. I just don’t feel… right. Nothing does. We got to the beach. It was early, not many people around. Or maybe Dad had parked at the farthest end on purpose.

“Alright, bud. Here we are,” he said, putting the car in park, but not turning it off. Mom turned around in her seat to look at me. Her eyes were wet.

“Sweetie… it’s… it’s not safe. What if—” Dad placed his hand on hers. Tears rolled down her face.

“I’m not going in the water,” I said. “I promise. I’ll just sit by the wall. You’ll see me the whole time. I just… I want to look. Is that okay?” They both nodded. Dad finally turned off the car. I unbuckled and stepped out, walking to the edge of the lot where a cement wall divided asphalt and sand. I hopped over.Behind me, I heard the car doors open. I looked back and Dad was standing next to the car. Mom had her door open but hadn’t gotten out ,her head just leaning out, watching me. Frozen in place. I gave them a small wave, A fake smile, and I sat on the wall. Just looking out at the ocean. Vast. Endless. I was here not long ago.
Walking alone. Because no one cared. No one was around to care for me. I didn’t have a mom or dad. All I had was a wish. I used to come here and stare at the water, wondering what was on the other side. Some would say another country. An island. Sure I’ve seen them on TV. On Airplane trips with a bag of crackers and a movie to watch when I got bored staring out the window. I’ve spun the globe in classrooms and traced the coasts. But when I look out at the ocean… I don’t see any of that. All I see is the life I left behind. And the people who will never miss me..

1liwtza,mzfowpc,"""Your heart is in the right place."" The doctor mutters, staring at the X-ray and the diagnosis. He looks at me with a very worried face. ""Now... I don't know about the rest of you.""

""How bad is it doc? Don't pull any punches.""

""What do you remember? How do you think this happened.""

""Well, it's a little embarrassing. I was up at 2:00 AM for a snack. But when I turned on the light in the kitchen, I was somewhere else.""

""Where, exactly?""

""The shoggoth called it, 'A place between worlds.'""

""A shoggoth?""

""Yes, I think that's what it was. This big thing of flesh and teeth. It told me its name but I couldn't hope to pronounce it.""

The doctor nods, ""And how did this lead to your current condition?""

""Well, the shoggoth said it would give me a gift. That I would understand when the stars were right. I don't remember much about that part.""

""Do you remember how you got to this hospital?""

I furrow my brow, and feel an itch where my foot should be, ""No... I guess not. I had the thought, 'I'd better get myself checked out by a professional,' and well.. I was here.""

""Well, I don't know how you're still alive. Your brain is split into three different parts, your eyes are on your hands, and the scale showed an error when I tried to get your weight. Your stomach is in your chest beside your heart, and your intestines are in your legs.""

""That bad? There anything you can do to help?""

""I can give you a lollipop and a doctor sticker.""

I walk out of the room with a lollipop in one of my mouths, proudly wearing my sticker. The nurse at the desk faints when he sees me. I hurry away, not wanting to scare anyone else. With a thought, I'm on the moon. I look down on Earth, it really is beautiful from up here.",22
1lj3033,mzgstpc,"I stare at my good brother, and smile.  
""If not us, whom will soon have to fight in the war ourselves...who else will stop it?"" I ask.  
He sighs.  
""For decades, this war has been going on. The blood spilled, the lives reaped, the villages burnt, the atrocities caused, and done by both side... How are we supposed to make people forget them?"" he asks.  
I shake my head.  
""Not forget them, accept them."" I say.  
He frowns.

  
""You want people to accept that their loved ones were brutally killed...or worse?"" he asks.  
""No. I want people to accept that this has been done, and it is bad, so we should act better. Why fight fire with fire, when all it does is make the hatred run deeper?"" I say.  
He sighs.  
""I love you brother, but your idealistic views are impossible to be put into real life. I know of mages that used infants as research materials, on both sides.  
Warriors that used the blood of the enemy to breakthrough...and other such events.  
How do you bridge this ocean of hatred?"" he asks.  
I smile.

  
""With understanding. With hope. With the prospect of a future where our people don't have to send their 3 year old kids to start training martial arts, so that at 15 they can be enrolled and sent to missions."" I say.  
""I agree."" before my brother could say something, a voice said.  
He sprung up, to see a few people approaching our hideout.  
""You invited...THEM?"" he points at the newcomers.  
Witches, and druids, and a warrior...from the enemy kingdom.  
""Mothers, and fathers...whom want their children to live more than to 20."" I say.  
They came unarmed, and bearing gifts.  
My brother slowly calmed down.

  
""We have spread your message, and many resonate with it...but just like your own brother, they are skeptical on how this can be done."" one of them says.  
I smile.  
""On our side, we have at least 5 thousand active soldiers that have joined my cause. It is not enough, but it is a start. The civilians on the other hand are in the tens of thousands, happily contributing to our movement."" I say.  
""So then what is the plan?"" my brother asks.  
""Spread our message publicly, challenge the warmongers, and if push comes to shove...remove the obstacles to our peace."" I say.  
""So...instead of a life of fighting, we fight for our lives, and that of others?"" he grins.  
I nod.  
""We will have plenty of places to hide, and to rest. We have to do this. Are you in?"" I ask him.  
""If not us...then who?"" he smirks, as we shake hands, and thus, the Brotherhood of Peace was officially founded, and we started our mission of spreading a message of peace, and understanding.",5
1lijf26,mze43a9,"""Chump"", my friends called out in unison before they went down the slope

In reality, I was scared.

I'm not much of a skier, I only went to Switzerland for the Swarovski Christmas tree, I didn't care much for the rest of the itinerary. 

Sometimes I lie awake thinking what if I had went down. Maybe I'd be at rest like everyone else.
Maybe there is a better place beyond the grave, it's still a million dollar question to me, one I might never get the answer to.

Two more world wars, an alien invasion, another global pandemic outbreak, AI taking revenge on mankind, I was there for all of it, and everytime I thought it was my turn. 
My turn to face the reaper. But he's been avoiding me, or have I been evading him.

I've been shot more times than I can count, been in a multitude of car accidents, two place crashes and sinking ship.

Everyone who's still has this information uploaded to their neurolink chips and gets to experience them like they were there.

That invention finished my career as a history teacher.
A history I don't recite, but recall.

Maybe it's time for me to write history. 

By the look of things, I'll be here for a whole lot longer.",33
1lijf26,mzh382i,"\[PART 1\]

Couple years back, I went to Wyoming on a Ski trip. Everything was normal, except a moment I turned right, everyone seemed to disappear before me, and a sign read 'If you ski past this point, you will die'. I, jokingly, mocked the sign. It's stupid, right? Surely, walked back. Everyone just kinda...appeared again.

The shovel was stained with brown, the hole open and ready for one last participant.

Allen coughed blood, and said ""Danny? Can I ask you a question?"" as he coughed once more, little flecks onto my shirt.

""Yes?"" I asked.

""Danny, I...I'm sorry. For everything.""

""Yeah,"" I replied.

""I can't believe..."" he coughed ""...believe how long it's been.""

""Yeah...""

""We saw so much, but...I always wanted to go to London, to Dublin, to Berlin, to egg Paris, to - "" another deep, *deep* hacking cough.

I took a breath, ""I know, I know...""

""You aged so fucking well...you know Paul Rudd?""

I chuckled, ""I get that one a lot.""

""Man I...I loved you man...""

""No homo?"" I asked, how we used to say in -

""I mean...""

""Huh?""

""I never...told you the truth about...I...love..."" as he...

...he...

...

I buried...the dirt covered the cold flesh of...what once was.

I...

...Allen and I...

I walked outside. Make new friends, but...it's been so long, everything so...cold, and...

I've been everywhere. Dublin, London, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Rome, the works. So many friends, so many places. When you have infinite time, nothing becomes a rush, but nothing becomes notable.

Everywhere...except Wyoming...",11
1lijf26,mzh4ki4,"I bought what I believe will be my last ticket. All amends made, all opportunities crossed, except for this one last chance. The chance to die.

Beaver Creek, got my ticket, and my skis, all my equipment. I had the same stuff from that day.

The temptation won, of course. I hadn't been skiing since that day. so I did. It was fun. But uneventful. I spent the first day doing one last thing - the thing that got me...here.

  
Entered my room for the night, room key on the nightstand. Nice, wood timber. Ordered my last meal, Steak, Milkshake and some fries. No salad because...won't be here tomorrow, turned on the TV as I ate in bed. Some show...the steak overpowered my senses, and I fell asleep soon enough.

  
Next morning, last morning. It's time.

I got to the map, and looked for the trail - the Black Diamond one.

...

...that's closed...

I put on my skis anyways, and started going. No guards, no nothing. I kept skiing around, looking for that fucking sign. 

I had doubts. Did I have the right trail? Resort? Until I saw something: a small mist, almost indistinguishable from the sky behind it, but sure enough, it looked like heat. I walked through, and saw the same thing as last time.

Except, now everyone I knew was on the other side, looking at me, behind the sign.

The sign sat there, reading the same thing as before, 'If you ski past this point, you will finally die'.

Wait,

'Finally'?

I looked beyond, and saw...everyone. Mom, dad, brother and sister, cousins, countless friends, first wife, first (ex) wife and second wife. Three marriages, one divorce, two death did us part, pretty alright I think. And they all had the same look on their face:

Don't.

Don't go on, a chorus of 'turn back' is what I heard. 

'it's precious'

'think about everyone'

'who is waiting back home'.

""No one."" I said.

They went silent.

""I..."" I looked around the cold Wyoming wilderness, ""I've done everything, there's nothing else and I...I just want to rest.""

They all looked at each other.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and walked forward. Life is precious, until it's all you have left. I ski'd, with my eyes closed, as my body felt cold, and numb, while at the same time, filled with wind, I opened my eyes, to see my body, fall into the snow, as I began ascending.",9
1lixqj3,mzgrbxf,"""Same rules as always, Dad?""

""Same rules as always, Po.""

""Not that it'll help you any,"" quipped Jer. Ever the jokester, he couldn't help but poke fun of his older brother.

""Um, what are the rules?"" asked the youngest boy.

""Oh, that's right, it's your first time,"" Po mused.

""I just turned twelve!""

""Okay, okay, settle down, boys,"" their father commanded. He used his Regal voice, the one that commanded courts and commanders alike. He rarely broke it out among family, but that made it all the more effective when he did.

""Fine, fine, we'll tell you,"" Jer mock whined. He winked at his brother, to let him know he meant no harm.

""Deep in a magical forest, there is a stone that holds a sword. If you bring me the sword, you are worthy of being king.""

""Just like that?""

""Yes, Sim. The sword will determine my successor, as it did for my father and his father before that.""

""And no one has found it yet?""

""I saw it last year!"" Po announce haughtily.

""As it passed him by for the third year in a row.""

Po shot Jer a dirty look, but didn't say anything. He knew this was a losing argument, particularly when Jer was punching below the belt.

""Dad?""

""Yes?""

""What's the sword look like?""

Both Po and Jer froze for a moment, realizing that they had no idea what the sword looked like. They'd been so intent on completing the quest, that they had never bothered to ask. They had both just assumed it would be super obvious when they saw it.

""Haha, you'll know it when you see it.""

""Oh ... okay, then.""

""Any other questions?""

Sim cocked his head to the side, pondering his father's question. It was a habit of his that they'd all learned to find endearing. He had always been the curious one in the family.

""Um, no. Not right now.""

""Okay, then. You begin now.""

-- -- -- -- --

Po and Jer took off running, angling to get ahead in the yearly race.

""Wait! Wait for me!"" Sim yelled as he scrambled to keep up.

Jer yelled back a response, but Sim couldn't make it out from that distance. It sounded like mockery, though.

Sim raced as long as he could, but his lungs gave out in a few minutes. He simply couldn't keep up with his brothers.

""Great! What now?""

He balled his hands together in frustration, but released them a moment later. Throwing a tantrum wouldn't get him any closer to the sword, and he needed to use his energy wisely. There was no way he'd win otherwise.

""Let's go ... that way.""

He saw smoke in that direction, so there were likely people there. They might know something that could help point him in the right direction.

-- -- -- -- --

""Um, excuse me?""

""Yes, can I help you-"" the man began to respond as he turned around.

""Oh! Your majesty!""

The man clumsily tried to bow from his twisted position, and nearly fell over in the process.

""No, no. That's okay, Sir. I'm not here on official business.""

""Forgive me, Majesty. I meant no offense.""

""None taken, Sir. I surprised you, and I don't visit these lands often.""

""That's very ... kind of you, Majesty,"" the man said with genuine appreciation. The last series of Kings had been benevolent, but that had not always been the case. The people's memories ran deep.

""What does bring you to these lands, Majesty?""

""Um, a race of sorts. I need to find a magical forest.""

""Magical forest?""

""Yes. Do you know it?""

""Not anywhere in these lands, Majesty.""

""Oh,"" Sim replied, more than a tad crestfallen.

""Did the King give you any other information, Majesty?""

""No, but my brothers said something about it moving.""

""It moves?"" the man asked with raised eyebrows.

""Apparently. I just know what they said.""

""Could it be the golem?""

""Golem?""

-- -- -- -- --

""Where is your brother?"" the King asked.

""We don't know. We haven't seen him since the race began.""

The King furrowed his brow. Sim was generally reliable, but harm could befall him, even here in friendly territory.

""Wait, I think that's him!"" Jer called out.

The King released the breath he'd unwittingly held. He did so quietly, with barely a movement of his chest and face muscles. It was a trick he'd learned over the years, and one that had served him well during negotiations.

""Doesn't look like he has a sword,"" Po stated matter-of-factly.

""We'll wait.""

A few minutes later, a somewhat sheepish Sim joined the others. He had a stick in his hand, but he seemed almost ashamed of it.

""Heh, nice toy,"" Jer poked fun.

The King said nothing, waiting for his boys to settle down.

""So, what do you have to report?""

""I ... couldn't find the forest this year,"" Po lamented.

""Me neither,"" admitted Jer.

""And you?"" the King prodded the last boy.

""Well, um, I asked the locals, and they didn't know about a magical forest. There is a big golem who doesn't like strangers, though. They told me what he likes, and we ended up having a nice chat.""

""A chat? With a golem?!"" Po exclaimed incredulously.

""Haha, you sat down for tea in the middle of a race!"" Jer also crowed.

""It was the closest thing to a magical forest I could find! And the golem was nice! He gave me this stick from his back.""

""Did he say anything else?"" the King asked.

""He said I should show the stick to the King,"" Sim admitted sheepishly.

""And that's the stick?""

""Um, yes, Dad.""

Sim practically winced when he admitted that, expecting his father to berate him. It sounded so silly when he said it out loud.

Instead, the King smiled warmly at his son.

""Well done, Sim. You will begin your training when we return home.""

""That's the sword?!"" Sim's brothers exclaimed.

""Aye, boys. And you could only have discovered it by interacting kindly with your subjects. You also had to negotiate with a big, sour golem, the kind that's covered in moss and smells like a bog. Why do you think the 'forest' was never in the same place two years in a row?""

""Oh,"" all three boys muttered.",5
1ligho9,mzbrmx1,"Okay.
We knew when we started the tournament that we will have surprises.
After all, we allowed entry for everyone.
Sure, the prestige of the Academy scared quite a lot of people, the renown of certain noble families a lot of others, but we expected some dark horses.
But this...
Watching the teenager wearing garbage bags as clothes, annihilating royals, quite the sight.


In the first duel, I watched him overpower the enemy with sheer will and mana.
The kid, whom I learnt is an orphan and a street urchin knew nothing of spells.
After his first win, as a teacher I gave him a 2 day ticket to the library.
I hoped it will allow his seemingly good potential to blossom a bit.
Well...
It did.
It sure did.


The kid self created spells.
I watched him destroy the opponents by intensifying their senses.
By casting smelly spells.
By casting illusions of the worst things ever.
He then would rush ahead and bash their heads in.
He didn't care about reputation, about face or...about his life.
He almost lost it a few times, and he didn't even flinch.
Nobles? Princes and Princesses?
They never stood a chance.


I watch him roar, as I crown him champion.
I smile.
""Kid. I am Zeus von Argent, a 9th grade Arcane teacher of the Academy.
Want to be my disciple?"" I ask, as the arena falls quiet, and many gasp.
He stares at me.
""You strong? Can you afford to feed me?"" he asks.
I laugh.
""I could kill all of those gathered here today with a flick of my wrist.
And I can give you mountains full of meat!"" I say.
The crowd full of nobles and professionals goes even quieter but none retorts.
The kid gives me a cheeky grin.
""Let's eat then, Master"" he says, grabbing my sleeves.
I laugh and teleport us away, leaving the other teachers to deal with the rest.
I finally found someone worthy to teach everything I know.",51
1ligho9,mzc40dx,"When the call had gone out, we braced for the storm. Children of rich nobles, scions of famous magical lineage, all manner of eager contenders flocked to the school grounds in carriage and atop pegasus alike.

A ramshackle market had sprung up on the field; tents of every colour forming a patchwork blanket of bustle. In anticipation of the many lowlifes, the town watch tightened security, visible among the crowds only by their cloaks and the halberds they carried.

It had fallen to me, by poker in the teacher's staff room, that I should record the list of contenders, and announce their duels. I posted myself by the judge's pavilion, thoroughly resigned.

Between the muggy air and the stuck-up contestants, I had little mood for any interruption. Even from one of my less offensive pupils, Louis.

I pinched the bridge of my nose. ""What did Mr. Fardibres say about students competing?""

""It's not for me, sir. I want to register a friend.""

""A friend?""

""She's a little shy. But she'll be here for her duels.""

A low rumble from the Troll-kin father told me the growing line was starting to outstrip their limited patience.

""Alright. What name should I put down?""

""Amicia. And sir; please don't freak out.""

""Freak out? Why--?""

But he was gone before the words left my mouth. I bit back a curse as the Troll-kin took his place, leaving only heartbeats to note down Louis's request before it was driven from my mind.

When it returned, as I announced the names for the next duel, my brow furled with confusion. The answer of who they were came swiftly, as an orange-haired girl climbed under the ropes and into the dueling ring. Her clothes had seen many rough days; torn in some places, patched in others, dust and dirt pressed into every strand of fabric. Her face bore a long, curling scar that ran from upper lip to eyebrow and carved through her cheek.

As I searched for Louis in the crowd, intent on questioning him after, a hand grabbed my upper arm in a hold too tight to be friendly. It was the captain of the town watch.

""Apologies, but I feel I must warn you,"" he said in a throaty voice. ""I don't know how she slipped onto your list, but she is a petty thief and urchin.""

With a flash of movement, eight of the town watch were in the ring, with halberds readied. As they approached, she narrowed her eyes and crouched, prepared to fight.

But then I felt it; a strange hum that entered the air and tickled every nerve across my skull. The captain at my shoulder was forgotten as the hum swirled through the crowd and settled itself around this girl. I caught sight of Louis and his friend Edwin pushing their way up to the ring, the fierce determination in their eyes matched only by the girl's expression.

""Call your men off.""

Dark colour seeped into the captain's cheeks. ""Perhaps you didn't hear--""

""The contest is open to anyone, captain; whoever they might be. Call them off.""

His face was livid, but with no more than a breath of wind and flash of cloaks, the watch vanished from the ring. When I turned back, the captain too had left.

The girl, Amicia, met my eyes and nodded a thanks. My face twitched with a slight grin before raising an eyebrow in Louis's direction.

Archibald looked across the field at his opponent, smugly looking over his ratty old clothes and patchwork hat. ""If this is the best this tournament can offer, they might as well give me that scholarship now.""

The street rat said nothing, prompting Archibald to scoff and say to the referee, ""Get on with it.""

The referee nodded and yelled, ""Victory is by ringout or knockout! Ten minutes on the clock! Begin!""

Archibald held out his hand and Chanted, <Great fury of the heavens, be chained to my will and do my bidding!> Thunder crackled despite the absence of clouds as a dozen bolts of lightning struck and began to gather in Archibald's hand. With a manic grin, Archibald threw the arcing electricity with a scream of, ""KNOW YOUR PLACE, DAMNED FILTH! FOR I AM--""

*CLANG*

The stadium at large froze. Archibald's attack, the very power of the storm harnessed into a single strike...

Had been blocked with a metal bat.

The street rat spun his weapon, coiling lightning around it like yarn as he calmly answered, ""I don't care who you are.""

Archibald gawked, but recomposed himself and began performing Motions to hurl miniature tornadoes at the street rat, who answered by flicking the bat out to his side and turning it into a claymore, still crackling with lightning. A single, lazy swing dispelled the twisters in a burst of pressure and sent the crowd into a frenzy, their favored competitor evident. Archibald's eye twitched as he Chanted, <O breathing storm, o human sky, heed my voice and rip through all who stand in my way!>

Another tornado touched down behind Archibald, this one sprouting extra funnel clouds to simulate limbs and bearing eyes of ball lightning. Archibald's laughter turned maniacal as he pointed at the street rat and boasted, ""LET'S SEE WHAT GOOD YOUR TRICKS ARE AGAINST A STORM SPIRIT!! AND DON'T EVEN BOTHER SURRENDERING--IT'S FAR TOO LATE FOR THAT!""

The street rat cracked his neck and got lower to the ground. ""Why would I surrender? I've already won.""

The storm spirit screeched and launched tendrils of high-speed winds, talons of electricity, and needle-like raindrops at the street rat, who reacted instantly; his body turned into a wild blur as every attack was deflected, dodged, blocked, or parried as he charged at Archibald. Seconds away from frothing at the mouth, Archibald growled at the storm spirit, ""HIT HIM ALREADY YOU USELESS GOD-DAMNED THING!!""

The storm spirit complied by sending an attack from every angle, to which the street rat responded by slamming his blade into the ground with enough force to crater it and envelop the air around him in a shockwave that pushed everything back. Despite this, Archibald's grin came back to his face as he watched a lone wind tendril stab at the street rat...

And pass right through without a hint of damage.

Before Archibald could process what just happened, the street rat appeared directly in front of him, his illusory doppelganger vanishing and his claymore turned into a bat again as he whispered, ""Know your place.""

Metal slammed into flesh, sending Archibald flying out of the ring and slamming into the wall. The storm spirit dissipated as the referee announced, ""Winner by ringout: Lace!""

Archibald slumped down and weakly asked, ""What...are you?""

Lace turned on his heel, ignoring the excited roaring of the crowd as he answered, ""Just a street rat with nothing to lose.""",24
1liiq8u,mzcc75d,"I saw the right hook headed to my jaw, but there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it until after it collided with my head.  I spun in a slow circle to the ground, still trying to figure out what just happened.  This was supposed to be an easy score, just a simple intimidation job to clear the sidewalk of undesirables.  The store owner had already paid me $500, so I felt obligated to keep going.  My target was this old dude, bent and broken with age, selling repaired watches and other junk from his street cart.

The encounter had started like they always do, my looming over the person and speaking my in lowest, most threatening manner.  I told him he had less than a minute to pack his garbage and move along, never to stop on this street again.  Before, it had worked every time without fail.  But this guy just looked at me like I was growing a second head.  I figured he was hard of hearing, so I repeated my warning, and again he just looked at me.

I realize now that I had made the mistake of getting physical while completely underestimating the man, putting my hand on his shoulder and giving him a shove.  The first punch hammered into my gut like a runaway freight train, the second an uppercut that lifted my head into position and the final one, that hook, sent me to the pavement.  He moved faster than anyone I had ever encountered before, hit harder and was so precise that I imagined that I was fighting a robot.

The ground was harder and more unyielding than I remembered.  I couldn't think back to the last time I had lost a fight and the feeling wasn't one I wanted repeated.  I gathered myself and slowly got to my feet, feeling my midsection spike with pain only matched by my head.  The old man just stood there, hands at his side.  I could tell that while he looked relaxed, he was more than ready to go another round of beating me to a pulp.

No words were said.  I just nodded slowly and stepped past him and into the store.  Stopping at the drink refrigerator, I took out two drinks and made my way to the counter. I took my payment from my pocket and dropped it onto the counter in front of the owner as I placed the bottles down as well.  He watched as I pulled out my wallet and put down the money for the drinks, then he looked from the money he had paid me to my battered face as I shook my head.  My hands picked up my purchase as I walked gingerly from the store.  On my way down the street, I stopped at the old man's cart and wordlessly handed him one of the drink I had bought before continuing on my way.  Maybe it was time to get another job, a safer job, before I ran into more people who could put me into my place so effortlessly.",18
1liiq8u,mzd5pih,"The birds begin to loudly chirp and sing, and Rick stretches under the softly flapping ranger-roll covering him. It’s July, and in New York that means everything is sticky with humidity, and very still, as if even the air is avoiding moving. The streets in the South Bronx are quiet at this hour. It’s the few small hours, right as the sun is about to breach the skyline—an hour before and almost an hour after, the City is peaceful.

Rick has spent another night camped out in the bushes at St. Mary’s Park, just off Jackson. The steeple of the church always visible from wherever he places his camp, by design. Mary is important to him. And as he does every morning, he recites her prayer:

Holy Mother

Mary, so full of grace

Blessed among women

And blessed is the fruit of your womb, our Lord’s begotten son, Jesus

Holy Mother, mother of the son of all

Pray for all of us sinners

Now and until the hour of death.

He mouths the words, not even caring if he is right or not. Every morning the prayer is a little different. And to top it all off, he isn’t even Catholic. Agnostic, but stuck with these words as part of the ritual before a mission. And every day is a mission when he leaves the park. And today he has to vacate, with his stuff, because he has been told there is a job for him to do.

An asshole needs cleaning.

This is his favorite spot, but he will go to another camp tonight. St. Mary’s has a nice stretch of thick wooded area that even in the winter gives him cover. He rotates his camp to avoid anyone catching on to him. It’s been decades. He can even have a fire going and get away with it on the coldest nights.

Strange though, in a city where every citizen could have a rat friend, a circus of cockroaches, and a bum army to cuddle up with every night if they wished, they’d have a problem with Rick and his little setup.

He risks it, because if the authorities don’t like it, they can pay for his cot and three squares up at Sing Sing. Also, he likes it. Really likes it.

Has since Vietnam stopped being a place to go and when the Army told him to hit the road. He did his time. He gave them everything. Blood, sweat, but no tears. No thank you, Master Sergeant. No tears from you.

He is outside because he never went back in. The Army allowed him to be the best solo operator in the jungle. So now he is the best solo homeless person living in New York City.

Camping Keeps him out of the shelters, and honestly, it feels like home and will continue so if they leave him alone as they’ve done so far.

Leaving him alone might be due to his size. Six foot seven barefoot, with a countenance that suggests he might not know any words of comfort or praise or be tolerant of the illness called complaint.

He doesn’t brag about bolo badges or the number of chevrons and rockers he was given by his Uncle Sam. He didn’t count the number he killed in the name of freedom and democracy either, or the number of wounds he patched up himself in the bush.

Genetically, he is blessed with being able to push through grievous wounds, needing sleep for days, all while owning a kinship with the shadows. Being a proficient killer.

A true-to-life killing machine, retired now, living life on his terms.

Yet life dictates he still eat, hence the job.

All the retirement money goes to the same place all his Army money went to: the kid. He gets an anonymously deposited monthly check from a father who feels he did the kid a favor by staying away.

He was certain, with how often he has done evil things in the name of his government, he could never be a father or husband, and it is best to imprison himself within solitude.

Demons are contagious, but manageable, alone, under the old growth red oaks.

But now it is morning, his prayer is done, and the peace is almost over. Soon the July sun will be up and, like the rest of the people in this city, seek to beat everything under it into submission.

He packs his gear into a well-worn, but professionally cared for, ruck. Everything he owns is a version of, or the original of, a thing he carried back from Vietnam. Minus the weapons. He doesn’t need them out here because no matter what, he refuses to kill ever again.

And once all his gear is gathered and his repaired and well-maintained jungle boots are on his feet, he turns said boots toward the day laborer spot. As the sun rises, the longer the line gets for a job.

The day laborer spot in the South Bronx is a section of Leggett Avenue, over the train tracks. It’s not a good area. The crimes committed daily run from simple to first-degree and worthy of a whole life of imprisonment. The labor is offered in almost the same way business is conducted just up the street in Hunts Point.

A car will pull up, a window will go down, and a voice will leave a shadowy figure’s mouth: “Wanna earn twenty bucks?”

Some days, nothing. Most days he’ll get the normal labor jobs. Some of those jobs stretch out for weeks, some are only for a few hours. And some days, a Cadillac pulls up, and Rick is offered a lot of money to do something very illegal.

“Do you know the taco truck on 149th and Frederick Douglass?”

He didn’t. He doesn’t like tacos. He likes fried chicken and malt liquor, exclusively. But he assumes since this man mentions a thing at a location, said thing will be at said location, so he replies, “Sure.”

Then a fist with a one-hundred dollar bill stuffed in it arrives through the window from the backseat.

Rick takes what turns out to be half of said c-note.

“You get the other half when that corner is free, capiche?”

Rick nods because he doesn’t need to understand. He just needs to get shit done.

⸻

They call him Taco Man. He is a small, ethnically Japanese man from Brazil. He is tiny and moves around his Brazilian taco truck with purposeful movements that look choreographed. He flows as he serves customers.

Taco Man is not just really good at making Brazilian tacos, but this is a man with a fantastic personal story, but he only knows Portuguese, so here it is translated and paraphrased:

There once was a man whose head was wanted on the streets of São Paulo. But not only was his head in danger, but everyone he ever loved also was going to be flayed and tortured, slowly, one body part at a time.

What did this fiend do, some might ask?

This man won when he should have lost.
His victory should be sports history, and would be if it didn’t happen in São Paulo. Doesn’t help each invitational he did got more and more illegal.

Some claim he walked out of the Amazon wearing the robes of a Shaolin monastery, rumored to exist in the jungle but never found. Another addendum to the tale puts him at the monastery gates for a full week before being allowed inside to train.

His training is a ceaseless mastering the movement of every muscle, joint and ligament in his body. Watching him was like watching a rubber-band flap around on the antennae on a car.

Fwubwubwubwub!

But each letter was a solidly place strike or throw or twist ruining another body part.

Maybe, some suppose, this was his plan from the very beginning. That he risked his own body and soul to rescue his family, decades before the day it actually came to pass.

The morning after his first match where he put together a stellar showing of seven, twenty-minute fights in the Mud Circle. Award: $300, each, American.

Next week, he walked in to The Dog Pound and fought and beat every man who raised their hand. Award: total collected from the door $1,295, American.

The Cargo Pit was midweek. The crowd was rowdy. Fat or reed thin were the men who faced him. None won. Award: $12,000, American—and a bad concussion from a cheap shot that zoomed into the ring from the crowd in the shape of a sock with a heavy rock nestled in its toe.

1st place trophy and $5,000 at the Saint Judas Invitational as well as a broken cheekbone. He blames the concussion from the night before.

Red Sand, King’s Table, The Judas Rematch were each 12-round, open combat, and professionally sanctioned fights. His fame soared. Seven fights. Seven victories that have never happened before. And the fate filled invitation. 

“You lose this fight I pay you double the purse; taste good?”

He said yes. He lied. Then bet on himself, because everyone somehow knew the fix was in.

All in one day. His total pocketed prize money: $767,000, American dollars.

Main question on everyone’s lips was who is he?

No one knew, and some people don’t like mystery.

When the cartel lost their millions and millions of dollars on the broken fix, they put out a bounty on his head.

And to save those he loved, he moved far away from the land of his birth, with everyone he ever loved in tow, to avoid them being killed in his name.

Vowing; I will never fight again.

Taco Man finishes bagging an order, is in the process of taking money and making change, when a shadow lands on top of him with a thud. The shadow doesn’t move, or give an order for food, or even seem to be breathing normally.

Bearded and shaggy in all the wrong ways, Taco Man has seen worse in his time in the city. And rarely does worse not come with money for food.

“What can I get you?” he says genially enough. He is rewarded for his politeness by the giant-fellow, in a patched OD green field jacket ,raising both fists above his head and slamming them down on the counter of the food truck.

The physics of that moment with the giant’s fists was magnificent, and the taco truck will never be the same again; but neither will the Taco Man as he does what comes naturally giving the world, via one smart guy with a camera, one of the best fights seen in ages.",7
1lijqmt,mzdcjgy,"""Why won't you just talk to me? Your wife. Why won't you talk to your wife."" I heard her plead. She had been doing this for the last few hours, though it felt like days. I tried my best to avoid speaking at all. I didn't know what powers she might have now, I couldn't risk being controlled. I knew one thing that was for sure. I could not invite her in. I kept working with my hands, I was making sure not to stop, no matter what she said. 

""I can't believe you're doing this to me. To us. I thought we were beyond this sort of thing. I just want to be with you... Why don't you want to be with me? When did you stop loving me?"" She cried. 

Her voice was cracking and had an unnatural hiss to it. My wife never sounded like this before. I knew what had happened of course. It was all over the news. The vampire miracle. It was spreading, people were getting bit at an alarming rate and the worst part of it... most of them were willing. I knew she was one of them. She had been fascinated with the news when it broke. She loved the idea of living forever and being stronger. 

""Please, just talk to me.... I don't like this. I hate it. Please don't..."" Her sentence trailed off into sobbing. 

The sound of her sobbing was familiar. It was the same when her parents died. It broke my heart to hear her that way. My body couldn't handle it, it moved on its own towards the door. I unlocked it all in a hurry, and thrust open the door to look at her. When I did, we locked eyes immediately. I saw my wife, a little more pale than last time and her hair was a beautiful silver where it was black before. My heart throbbed. I let my protective feelings for her endanger myself, however, my hand was gripping tightly the wooden stake that I had been sharpening this whole time. I had forgotten I was holding it. 

Her emotions changed quickly. The look on her face from me opening the door quickly turned from relief to shocked. She stood up. 

""You were going to kill me? You made that for me and you were going to murder me as soon as I came inside!"" She made up her mind about my intentions quickly. 

""I don't know what I was going to do! You went and turned yourself into a vampire. I was scared!"" I shouted my first words at her since the change. 

She was crying but her body wasn't shaking like it normally did. I couldn't tell if it was her unnatural powers or her resolve. 

""I love you and I want to be with you forever but you don't trust me anymore. You felt like you might have to kill me. I can't handle that. Don't you understand that I love you."" She was shouting, she couldn't help it. 

""I think I do. I think so."" I practically whispered those words in response. 

""Thinking isn't enough. You have to know and if you can't know. I can't be here. I'm really sorry."" She looked me in the eyes and took a few steps back. 

""Wait! Jessica!"" I yelled out her name as she walked back but by the time I could step out of the house she had been taken by the night.",17
1li9n5c,mzahtnv,"The heroes freeze, as the words leave my mouth.  
I chuckle.  
Many have tried to use my parents to influence me, to convince me what I am doing is wrong.  
None have expected this, though.  
""Really?  
Your parents, a paladin and a priestess of the Goddess of Life...  
Support you in destroying the world?"" one of them asks.  
Ah...interpretation.  


""Why yes, they are quite eager.  
The Goddess of Life after all is a Goddess of change."" I say.  
They pale.  
""You are murdering millions!"" one of them screams.  
""No.  
My armies are murdering millions, I am only fighting against strong nobles, kings, and queens, and elite professionals that try to stop us.  
Like you."" I say.  
They frown.

  
""Why? It is clear you are not inherently evil, and you do not relish murder, and violence."" one of them says.  
I sigh.  
These kids should read more.  
""Indeed. I don't like violence, and murder.  
But I am destined to end the world as we know it...and how is our world?  
Peasants struggle to eat, while nobles have so much excess of everything, they gamble it on random entertainment.  
The Colosseum, the Arenas, the slave market...  
Aren't these things...bad?"" I ask.  
""They support the economy, and going around overthrowing kingdoms, killing nobles, and royals..."" one of them starts.  
I start laughing, interrupting them.

  
""Another bunch of ""heroes"" whom see someone who wants change as evil, but ignoring the plight of the masses, just because there is ""peace""."" I say.  
They didn't like that.  
""You think you can do better than the many royals, and nobles?  
The peasants at least have something to eat, and they aren't killed by bandits, and monsters!"" one of them says.  
I shake my head.  
""I am not one to lead a kingdom, many will step up for that role, and no.  
I don't know what I am doing is right, or better, but we have to try.  
Staying in misery just because the future is uncertain is not the way to live."" I say.  
And with that...our fight resumes.  
Not that they can defeat me, my destiny is clear, and it aligns with my personal goals as well.  
This world where everything is based on status, and on blessings...  
I will change it.",58
1li9n5c,mzar2k7,"Sarah wiggled in her seat, her hands fidgeting uncontrollably.

“Babe,” Leon kissed the top of her head and wrapped his arms from behind her. “They are really nice. I bet they’ll love you too.”

“Well,” Sarah held his arms. “I’m not so sure about that… Dr. Nightmare and Dr. Hunter are the most feared villains for a reason.”

“Don’t worry,” he laughed and walked to the kitchen. “It’s just their work. They are normal parents outside of their working hours.”

Sarah desperately wanted to believe it, but her only reference was Leon. And he was the nicest guy she ever knew. 

She spent the next hour waiting. In the downtime, she absorbed as much information as she could. The painting of the Intergalactic Noah’s Ark, the Lambskin from the Raven’s Church, and the array of eye-catching gemstones — everything here was stolen.

“Not that bad, you see?” Leon smiled, and Sarah had to nod in approval.

Then the door opened, and with it came the signature laughter of Dr. Nightmare. Sarah’s palms turned sweaty, but she walked to the entrance anyway.

Dr. Hunter— or Mrs. Xeline when she’s off duty —smiled at her, too warmly perhaps. “Is this Sarah, the harbinger of destruction?”

“She’s just Sarah, mom,” Leon said, taking her hand.

Sweaty hands didn’t go hand in hand, but Sarah held on. There were more important things at stake.

“You can relax,” Dr. Nightmare laughed. “Or I could just take away your fear.” 

He tapped Sarah’s forehead as he walked past, and she felt an overwhelming sensation of calm. If calm could ever be overwhelming, that is.

Dinner was already prepared, so Sarah took a seat beside Leon. The atmosphere was harmonious — perhaps too harmonious for her taste.

“How do you feel about your family, Sarah?” Dr. Hunter asked.

Sarah gulped down the mouthful of meat, and chased it down with some water. “They are wonderful parents, Dr. Hun… Mrs. Xeline.”

“I thought they’d be more… patriotic?” Dr. Nightmare added. “Everyone in the business knows you are the destiny child. So, I’m more surprised that they are wonderful parents. Don’t they… resent you?”

“Oh quite the opposite,” Sarah smiled. “My parents have always been supportive of my destiny to end the world as we know it, ever since I was a child.”

“Forgive my impudence, but I expected more from Mr. and Mrs. Justice,” He said with a smirk. “ Paragons or not, the job takes a toll on everyone.”

“It surely does!” Leon chimed in.

“You don’t have a say here,” Dr. Hunter glared at her son. “Find a job, first!”

“It’s just that,” Sarah began “People following their destiny is Justice for them. When the time comes, they’d be willing to stop me. Until then, they just want to see me happy.”

There was silence in the room. Dr. Hunter reached across the table and held her hand.

“If that day ever comes, we’ll be there for you,” Dr. Hunter said, rubbing her knuckles gently.


“If you tell us their weakness, that is,” Dr. Nightmare laughed, alone, until the laughter turned to a dry cough. “Bad timing, I suppose…”",12
1li9n5c,mzaw9or,"“Most people who believe in destiny live entitled lives, believing the world owes them their birthright. Those people are perverters of destiny, people who take advantage of its goodwill. You’re one of those people. A hero who believed the world would fall into place for them. That’s why I despise you so much. You never had to work for your destiny. My destiny wasn’t carved into the stars, nor was it gifted to my family. It was a self-promised destiny; one I convinced myself I would do.”

 

Silia moved past the skeletons of the dead guards who had foolishly rushed into her home weeks before the hero had arrived. Silia gave them a light shove with her shoe, as she approached the dying hero, whose own sword now rested in his stomach. Anthony winced as the iron heels of Silia’s shoes clicked against the floor of her home, with the villain stopping right before the hero. She leaned over his weakened form, allowing her face to get illuminated by the candle sitting on the table that Anthony rested against, making sure he could meet her gaze. 

 

Anthony’s hand grasped the handle of his sword, knuckles turning white as he begged his body to pull the weapon free. He knew that removing the sword would send him into the reaper’s arms, but if he could only get one clean swing at her, he could end all of this. He could be the hero he was destined to be. “W-what. What would-“

 

“I wouldn’t waste my final words on a question.” She said, staring at the painting across from the table. One depicting a younger Silia joined by her mother and father, the three all crowded together, with a splash of black paint blocking out a fourth smaller body.

 

“W-what would your parents think? You’ll doom-“ He couldn’t finish his words, coughing violently as his body gave into the pain. The grip he had on his blade loosened, and soon his palm laid at his side, pressed against the floor.

 

She laughed. “My parents believed this was a noble cause. When I told them I planned on ending the world, they financed my research. They sent me to a magic academy, even when it forced them to live in poverty. All because they believed this was for the better.” She smiled at the hero, waiting for a retort that never came. Realizing he could no longer ask his questions, she crouched, touching his cold cheek before wiping the blood from his lips. “I can’t hate a dead man.” She admitted, not feeling any joy now that he had perished. If anything, his death felt unremarkable, far too quick for her liking.

 

“What a waste of your final words.” She went to pull her hand back from his lip, only for Anthony to open his mouth, bringing his teeth down on her finger as if it were a mouse getting seized by a trap. Silia screamed, pain shooting through her finger. She swung her hand violently in place before snapping Anthony’s jaw, allowing her to free her battered finger from his grip.

Holding her finger, she snickered, even as the pain rattled through her body. “That’s better. A defiant last attack. Maybe you weren’t entirely unfit for your destiny. I would leave a record of your last moments, but none of us will be remembered after this. Everyone’s forgotten in the end, aren’t we, sister?” She dipped her head, staring at the painting before gathering herself, continuing through her old family home.

 

The guards’ skeletons littered the ground, making an already bleak place look hauntingly cursed, with their bodies set beside plain items of furniture. She had even broken a few of their skulls, using them as candle holders, finding that a better use of their skeletons than simply leaving them on the floor for her to trip over. When she neared the torn couch, she sat down, looking at the destruction left in her home.

 

While the scratched furniture, faded walls, and cracked windows had all been there long before she returned, the sight of blood and death was new. Something that came when she returned here to prepare the spell. “Well, it all paid off. Didn’t it? All of those magic lessons, years of grief, all for this. We all need to be removed from this earth. That’s the only way to kill humanity’s sins. Mom, dad. Please look after her, because I fear I won’t end up in the same place as you all. That’s a sacrifice I was always prepared to make. To the people who come after humanity. I hope you don’t make the same foolish mistakes that we did. If you do, I hope someone has enough compassion to do what I’ve done for you before it gets too late.”

 

She held up her battered finger, about the pull the orb of energy from her bedroom, only to pause when nothing happened. She froze, examining her broken finger, before chuckling. “Hero? Was that planned, or a lucky shot? To think you could have delayed my plans had I not had two working hands.” She raised her left hand, pointing the finger upwards, as an orb of hissing white energy floated into the room. The sparks of light bouncing off the orb being enough to blind a person, which is why Silia never fully directed her gaze at it. The crackling energy bounced off itself, rotating around the orb in a spiral.

She hummed a few magic words to herself before approaching the deceased hero, putting her left finger by his lips. “Go on, hero. If destiny is on your side, you’ll be able to cripple my other finger, too. If you do, I’ll be unable to perform the spell until it heals.” She forced the finger into his mouth, and waited, only for nothing to happen. When she pulled her finger free, she removed the shield she had set up over her finger, a few green particles fading away from the digit. “I’m sorry. I couldn’t take the risk. A delay could have been costly.”

 

She collected the painting off the wall, sitting it in a grand rocking chair, giving it a small push, leaving it to drift back and forth as she took a seat across from it. “Goodbye, world. Remember, you did this to yourselves.” As her finger pointed upwards, the orb expanded until it burst, taking all of humanity with it. There were no slow deaths for the world, only a quick flash of light in everyone’s eyes, before they ceased to exist, leaving the world vacant for whatever came next.

As a child, there is nothing more terrifying than a loud sound in the middle of the night. It makes our young minds wander as we think of all the monstrosities that could be lurking just outside the glow of our bedside light. What could cause the pots and pans to clang, the folded laundry to tumble, the windows to shake on a calm peaceful night? We would never know because we were always too scared to find out. 

And then we got older. Realised how silly we were to think monsters existed, how silly we were to fear the dark. Now we would turn out the lights and fall into a deep slumber with no hesitation. No nightmares, no rampant thoughts, just peace and serenity. 

But what if that serenity disappeared and you were faced with a loud bang...The windows are shut, the night-time air is calm, there's nobody else in this one bed apartment, so what could have made that noise? 

There's a chill running down your feet as you struggle to find your slippers and put them on in the pitch black. Now comes the desperate attempt to find the light switch. Something soft and furry rubs against your wrist. You instantly recoil because you're not sure what that could be, call it midnight hysteria but you imagine you've just rubbed against a giant beast quietly looming over you...

And then you find the switch.

The lights blind you, the giant beast was nothing more than a coat you'd left hanging on your door, how silly you feel as your heart rate begins its decline once more. This is what you get for having such an active imagination, you'll need to lay off the horrors in the future, start imagining unicorns instead of demons. Another loud clanging takes your attention once more, now you're concerned, what on earth could be making that sound? You look for anything you could use as a weapon, thankfully you still have that baseball bat you received as a Christmas present over a decade ago, you were never the sporty type so you let it waste away. Now it might finally see some use.

As you leave the room, there's a certain calm that washes over you, almost like you're starting to realise how silly you are to think there's something in the apartment with you. You'd definitely have some story to tell your colleagues at work tomorrow. The air feels empty, devoid of any sound, a voidless sea that keeps you alive expecting nothing in return. 

That sea begins to tremble slightly, distortions in the atmosphere make your hair stand up tall, your breathe lingers, your heart begins to beat faster and faster as you get closer and closer...",10
1liekuk,mzbzrjk,"**BANG BANG BANG**

The pots and pans being violently erupting into a cacophonous orchestra of screeches and clangs, your ears have never heard such an awful noise like a chalk off a chalkboard. 

And then it stops. Total. Utter. Silence. Not even the sound of swinging you'd expect from such violent objects. You near closer to the countertop where they dangle above. You're terrified now, you wish you'd never left your bed, you wish you'd never let your friend leave when they said they'd stay the night. You wish you'd believed your childish self as you stand in the middle of your pitch black kitchen in nothing more than a gown and your slippers. 

You feel a sense of unease wash over you as you begin desperately searching for the light switch, is it someone breathing? Or is it your own breathe? It feels as though someone is right next to you but also far away on the other side of the room...

Your hand bumps clumsily against something smooth, you run your fingers over in a desperate attempt to get the lights on. Suddenly you hear a click and once again you're left blinded by the radiance of the lights. You struggle to adjust to these new conditions for the second time, eyelids stinging as they plead for you to keep them shut, yet you don't listen. 

As your eyes open, you notice something standing just outside of your vision. It's roughly your height, wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt you haven't worn since the first night you moved into your apartment. You advance towards the figure, as you near it, more features come into view. Dark brown hair, soft hazel eyes, freckles dotting its arms, the first tattoo you ever remember getting, the scar from a burn you'd received when you were young and clueless about heat. 

Was this a dream?  
Some kind of out of body experience?  
A memory? 

Finally, youre face to face, it looks at you with a sorrowful look in its eye. As if spotting a wounded animal on the side of the road. It reaches its hand for your face, you flinch on instinct but it continues its advance. It's fingers graze your cheek but they never leave. It's eyes never break their gaze. You never thought to look at its mouth, the calm and bliss your mind was feeling, is not what your body felt. 

Looking down you notice an odd tube poking into your stomach, a tube that leads straight to the mouth of this figure. A tube which begins to pulsate, creating an unnatural rhythm between the two bodies. You can feel something cold in your stomach, it feels strange yet like no more than an itch being scratched. You try to pull away but you can't move, you're stuck face to face with this figure, it's face slowly being adorned with spots and blackheads, a mole and freckles. 

You really should have cared for your skin more.

Your legs begin to quiver, yet they never fall. It's hand remains attached to your cheek. The bliss starts to wear off, you begin feeling an agonising pain as if you're being ripped open, you pull with all your might trying to remove it's hand but your strength continues to fail you. Your body fails to respond to your commands. Suddenly the tube is no longer in its mouth, a smile has taken its place, a smile that makes your bloody run cold. That isn't all that makes your blood cold off course. As you look down you notice a sizeable chunk of flesh missing from your stomach, you notice things that should be inside hanging out, creating a crimson puddle of regret below your feet.

A cold runs through your feet as you struggle to stand. Your knees begin to buckle, its hand finally detaches and you fall. It feels like you've been falling for an eternity, your mind is blank, your heart is at peace. Bliss is the last feeling to grace your mind as you close your eyes and embrace the darkness..",9
1libe34,mzc96oa,"I knew that I was never going to be the same after exposure to an alien radiation source.  Sure, I felt poorly for a couple of days, not much worse than when I had the flu a while back, but when I woke up pressed against the ceiling third morning, I was positive that things had changed.  I called into work, still claiming to be sick, before heading to the basement.  I did the usual things, checked out how strong I was and the like.  Not only could I easily lift the bench press bar, but the entire weight machine with a single finger.  I practiced hovering and flying slowly around the room, twisting between stacked up boxes and the columns.  I tried to cut my arm with box knife and ended up dulling the blade.  I had dreamed of this when I was kid, but like more childhood dreams, I put it away when I grew up.  Going back upstairs, I made my morning coffee and sat down at the kitchen table to scan the news on my phone.  The more I read, the less inclined I felt to join the ranks of heroes or villains for that matter.  The general populace was either apathetic or ready to sue at the drop of a hat.  I made and discarded plenty of ideas to benefit from my newfound abilities, but in the end, decided to do the best thing that worked for me: absolutely nothing.

The next morning I did my daily wakeup routine and left for work.  The bus was running late, as usual, and I knew that my boss wouldn't appreciate me coming in late after missing three days of work.  I looked around and seeing no one watching, zipped into the air and made a speedy flight to the alley behind the office building.  It took a few moments to rearrange my clothing and comb my hair back down, but after checking my watch, I was almost thirty minutes early.  I took that precious time to grab a coffee and a bagel from the nearby shop before heading into my workplace.  Nothing had changed while I was gone, so I slipped into my desk, logged into the computer and started my daily grind.  The usual office noises greeted me as people came into work.  My boss stopped by my desk to inquire about my health, but seeing me hard at work made her smile.  Lunch time was with the usual gang of idiots as we sat around the table in the break room.  By quitting time, I was ready to head home but still full of energy, unlike my previous time working in the office.  I chalked it up to my new powers and didn't put much thought into it.

I took the bus home, more out of habit than anything else, and made my way back into my peaceful sanctuary.  I didn't tired or hungry in the slightest way.  Maybe I could end up saving money by not spending on the bus or groceries.  By 7pm, I was bored out of my mind.  Usually, I would be on the couch, surfing through my phone, but that held little appeal to me. I opened a book for the first time in a few years and started reading.  The book was strangely engrossing and it was morning when I looked up.  Despite not sleeping a wink, I was feeling as refreshed as if I had done a full 8 hours in bed.

I showered and shaved, and dressed for another day at work on autopilot.  I was sitting at the bus stop when I realized that I needed something more to do with the extra time I now had.  Crime or crime fighting held zero appeal to me, so I used the time on the bus to check out wanted ads for night time employment.  I filled out an online application and submitted it as my bus was pulling into my work stop.  The day went by in a blur, going through the motions until the end of the shift.  I checked my phone on the way home to see that I had an employment interview appointment for that evening.  It wasn't too far from where I was currently, so I diverted from taking the bus to another office building.  I aced the interview and started that very night, doing a job very similar to my day job, but for almost 25% more pay.

The months flew by as I worked my two jobs and my saving account grew at an alarming rate.  Suddenly I could afford a car and thought about things like vacations. My social life was still dismal at best, but it suited my temperament.  Getting superpowers for me wasn't the call to action like some others, but I made the most of what I had.  Maybe boring people were never meant to be super heroes.",58
1libe34,mzat70n,"One day, I found myself able to teleport anything, including myself, in a small area to another designated area. But I have no intention of becoming a superhero or supervillain -- I have given up the thought of getting famous since I saw what my childhood friend has gone through after he put himself under the spotlight as a superhero.

But this doesn't mean my ability is useless.

I have a full-time job where I need to go to the office every weekday. I usually commuted by bus, and it usually took 30 minutes to get to the office. That's where my power becomes useful. Instead of taking the bus, I just activate my ability and teleport myself (and my belongings) to somewhere near the office building where I believe very few people pass by. Then I walk into the office building. It takes about 1 minute this way.

It's useful on weekends, too. Wanna hang out with some friends at a place where I normally have to spend 40 minutes to get there by subway? Wanna go on vacation at a place a thousand kilometers away? As long as I have scouted the area, I can mentally mark a spot there and teleport myself to the spot in subsequent visits. This ability really saves me a lot of time.

No one has found out about my teleporting ability yet -- or they're just too busy following those famous superheroes and supervillains that they don't give a damn about a commoner that can appear out of nowhere.",34
1lif6xg,mzdjk88,"""How do you even see?"" I asked

""Obviously with my eyes."" Hank said, pointing at them.

""But you don't have any.""

Pausing he reached up, feeling around the empty sockets with his boney fingers.

""Wait, where are my eyes!?""

The skeleton, going by the name of Hank looked around the floor wildly for a moment before he stopped and grabbed something off the floor.

""Ah, here they are."" Hank said, fiddling with his skull for a second then stared at me again, a pair of rocks crudely painted to look like eyes filling his empty sockets, he only held it for a moment before he started cakling.

Dropping my head into my hands I groaned at the skeleton's antics, thinking back on how I had gotten here, sometimes wishing the trap had just killed me instead of knocking me out and dropping me down several of the dungeon's floors. Of course waking up to a skeleton leaning over me and patting down my pockets nearly gave me a heart attack, both of us yelling (or screaming in my case) as we pulled away from each other. I grabbed my sword and swung it, taking the skeleton's head off, the arms shooting up to try and find its head, then it spoke.

""Ahh, guess I have finally lost my head.""

I froze, undead of any kind was rare in this part of the world, but one that could speak, that was impossible yet it spoke, not only that it whistled.

""Hey, *whistle* I'm over here."" It said, the body twisting as if looking before spinning around, ""that's it this-no no no.""

The skull, jostled by speaking, started rolling down the hall, the body panicking as it chased after it's head. I sat there dumb founded at the comical scene, undead are supposed to be mindless, relentlessly attacking those of the living, not act like an old man. I got to my feet as I heard it walking back, I readied my sword, the skeleton came to a halt skull in hand.

""Oh put that away, I ain't going to hurt you if anything you being alive is better."" It said in a male voice, reattaching its head, ""apologize for the scare earlier thought you were dead, oh and my name is Hank,"" it or he held out his hand.

Eyeing it wearally I lowered my sword point, hesitating for a moment 

""You're undead, aren't you going to try and kill me?"" I asked.

""What? You think we're all the same just cause I am nothing but skin and bones."" Hank looked down at himself, ""or just bone, still if you haven't noticed I am not your standard skeleton, first of I got more personality in my pinky than you with that stick up your areas.""

I looked at him bewildered, I'm getting insulted by a skeleton of all things, and on top of that the puns are just awful.

""Alright fine you made your point, if terribly, what do you want then?""

""Same as you, I want to leave this place, but to do that I need the help of someone alive.""

""Considering this is what, the 6th or 7th floor of the dungeon? I guess I have no choice do I?""

""Nope, now are you going to leave me hanging or not?"" Hank asked.

Frowning, I grabbed his outstretched hand, the rough and unnatural feel made me grimace, giving it the one shake for the deal, I shot back in horror as his hand fell apart in mine, Hank loudly cackled as he doubled over.

""Oh, oh, you should have seen your face, ho, you nearly jumped out of your skin."" Hanks laughter increased with the pun, ""that one shook you down to the bones.""

The skeleton's laughter echoed down the halls, now angry and embarrassed I glared at Hank, which only made him laugh harder, stomping past him I headed down the hallway trying to get away from him. Once he caught up and after some cajoling I followed him to his camp where Hank started laying out what we needed to do in order to get out of here. Which is where I find myself currently, groaning into my hands as this old man skeleton makes another terrible joke at the expense of my will to live, seeing him open his jaw I tried to head off the next pun or joke.

""Could you please just stop with the puns."" I said.

Surprisingly he did, looking at him his skull somehow managed to perfectly convey an expression of shocked hurt even with the painted eyeballs. Hand over his chest, eyes wide, mouth slightly open as he stared at me, for a moment I actually felt bad, I am probably the first person he has had to talk to in who knows how long. The touching moment broke when his jaw literally hit the floor.

""You just can't help yourself can you?"" I asked, groaning as I rolled my eyes.

""Nope."" Hank said cheerfully.

""Can we just get to the part about how we get out of here?""

""Alright, alright,""

For the rest of the day Hank went over the steps for our escape, we planned our moves, prepared what contingency we could, and I got some rest, confident or at least hopefully for tomorrow.

1lijuw7,mzep4tx,"(I am going to take a slight spin on what is probably intended, but this prompt is too perfect to not use my Reaper OC. He's also kinda a Minecraft OC who is a Sniffer Centaur whose top half is Warden, and carries souls via Soul Sand that naturally grows on him :b)

The hundreds of souls looked on at Afterlife Sorting Station. One squeaks out ""Does it really have to be right now?"" they questioned

Solos, a reaper who has 6 legs and 2 arms, glances with his puny excuse for eyes at the reaper behind the counter ""I'm still new to this."" he says. ""Would it be an option to carry those who aren't ready yet till they are?"" he questions

The reaper behind the counter looks genuinely surprised, they never had this type of question before. Then again, they've never met a Reaper who care carry more than a few souls so effectively. ""Well..."" they start, scratching their head. ""you're still a very new Reaper, Solos. In all my time managing the A.S.S., I've never met a Reaper able to carry more than few souls. And you're very kind, still.""

""Thank you"" Solos replied, instinctively

""Normally it is impossible for souls who enter here to leave again, but you with your own two souls do it without issue. You would have to talk to the more powerful reapers for this."" the reaper behind the counter answers, tapping their boney fingers on the desk ""But, I do not see why not? Souls who are not ready take more time to sort because they still try to cling to what life they have left. As long as they're not trying to come back to life, it could be worth the shot.""

The one soul who spoke out speaks again ""I am scared. I want my dog to be with me, but I don't want to force her here...""

""Then... I'll stay with you as long as you want me here."" Solos replied. ""And if the more powerful reapers say it's ok, then it will save so many others this stress. While I cannot do what I wish without permission, I can stay with you to be your comfort while the sorting happens.""

The reaper at the counter wipes a tear from their eyesocket. They remember the feeling of being scared. Solos, while he doesn't look like a typical Reaper, is a damn good one that they wish they had in this time of fear.

Solos splooted down and gives comfort to all the souls who are still frightened. And when it came to their point to be sorted, they were no longer as afraid...",5
1libulj,mzba08u,"My crew applied a tourniquet, so I was not dying actively. It hurt like hell, but I was awake and sane so I had the radio, still smeared with the remains of Wat. I was directing the relief forces to our barely existing trenches. If I would not have been so preoccupied with the shooting around me, holding on for my life, and with the whole almost dying thing, I could have noticed the strange quality of the transmissions. 

As it was I had just a few seconds to shout to the team that the relief is sticks, and they were upon us.

A squad of medevacs, their frontal and back carapace with painted with white crosses, the serrated middle limbs covered with a soft cover. Escorted by a platoon of infantry. The same perfectly sculpted torso, wide shoulders, well muscled arms, but with their natural grey-brown mottled colour.  

The remains of the human company flinched as one when they entered the fire zone. 

They were good soldiers, not even knowing what is fear, with the self-sacrifice of a hive drone... but the Sticks were, as their name shows, stick insects evolved to a civilization. And they did their best to send spawn shaped like humans.

But the basic body plan can't be changed. The four arms, the lower one serrated and bending in the wrong direction were bad.

The rock hard body shaped like Arnie in his best year was uncomfortable, especially with the small openings for the sensory bristles.

The legs... don't talk about the legs. I could not see the legs as the medevac drones carried me to the CSH.

What I can see are their faces. ""Face"". Insects have no faces. But they tried. The result was more like the snarls painted on the fighter planes of old. Unsettling. Scary. I never want to awake to a sight of one. 

Fortunately this CASH was run by fellow humans. For one thing they know what is pain, and not just from the training materials. I got my painkillers and in the pink cloud not even the snarling smiles were not too bad.

Still, I was very happy to know that by the time I get back to command ground units, the Sticks will rotate out these experimental forms and send traditionally shaped units. A two meters tall stick insect is not something one could look at happily... until one have seen the modified form. And their original form has wings, which will give a mixed unit some interesting tactical options.",18
1libulj,mzba6wn,"The Arachnos were a proud member of the intergalactic community. So when the humans said they needed soldiers to man their ships of war, the Arachnos were more than happy to help. One problem. The Arachnos were approximately one twentieth the size of humans, and no Arachnos in living memory had  actually met humans in person. A hive mind capable of extraordinary feats when they worked together, these were no problem for the Arachnos to surmount when the humans called for allies in their war. The humans sent their specifications, and the Arachnos went to work.

Their best minds worked day and night to produce an Arachnos that would be able to man the terminals on a human ship. They managed to produce an Arachnos that stood at a towering six foot tall, capable of using its eight legs to multitask. It's large bulbous sack demonstrating its obvious physical dominance, with a stunning red stripe emphasising that they came from impeccable breeding. They were an absolute feat of Arachnos technology, leveraging all of their understanding of biosciences to produce a soldier perfectly suited to working on human ships of war, and leading a glorious charge.

It was a momentous day when the human ships of war arrived to collect the super soldiers. They had completed a feat of science in record breaking time in order to help the humans ward off a galactic threat. There were marches in the street as everyone gathered to watch the super soldiers, festivals to celebrate these wonderful new creations.

The human ship landed gracefully on top of an ancient hill, which had been marked specifically for its cultural significance to the Arachnos people. The boarding pad slowly descended from the ship, a glow emanating from inside. The super soldiers boarded the ship, with cheers resounding from the assembled crowds. Arachnos translators who had studied Human language their whole lives were being broadcast to the entire planet, their glorious moment in the sun.

As the world hunched around their broadcast screens for the first in person meeting with humans in generations, loud noises emanated from the humans. The translators relayed the comments, ""What the hell is that? Oh my god, no wonder we stopped meeting these things in person!?""

""Is that a 6 foot tall redback?""

""Nope, we're not going to fight that war against the Space Criminal Syndicate, this planet needs to be removed. Commander, thoughts?""

""Yep, I'm with you sergeant. Prepare the flamethrower.""

And that was the day the human Arachnos war began.",9
1libulj,mzbeekb,"""They sent the Sunshine Squad..""

That was the first thing Sergeant Holloway said before vomiting into his helmet. Not from shellshock, mind you. The man had survived orbitfall over the Mariana Massacre and stitched his own intestines with a safety pin once. But this? This was too much.

They came strutting down the ridge in chromed body armor that squeaked like a latex glove. Each of them was sculpted like a marble statue of Zeus.. if Zeus were a GymTok influencer with collagen lips and a glistening six-pack. And they smiled. Constantly. That same wide, vacant, terrifyingly perfect smile.

""Heya, besties!"" one of them chirped, hoisting a plasma autocannon like it was a purse. ""We're here to protect all you cutie lil' squishies!""

A sniper shot rang out. One of the things.. this one called “Spangle”.. took a round directly between the eyes.

It giggled.

""Owie! That tickled! Naughty snipers, tee-hee!""

It pulled the bullet out of its skull with two fingers and blew a kiss toward the tree line. The tree exploded.

""Bro,"" said Corporal Renner, ""I think I just saw it wink at the explosion.""

""Shut up,"" Holloway hissed. ""Just shut up. Don't talk to them. Don’t look at them.""

There were six of them in total. The Sunshine Squad. Codenamed ""Project Cheerfall,"" apparently the result of some alien alliance treaty clause that required “culturally appropriate reinforcements.” The Tarvixians took one look at humanity’s war footage, read a few psychology manuals, and concluded that what humans wanted was muscular, enthusiastic protectors with unwavering loyalty and emotionally validating catchphrases.

They were wrong.

So very wrong.

One of the himbos, ""Bulkie,"" saw a wounded soldier sobbing behind a bunker and did what any emotionally intelligent, heavily-armed biotank might do.

""Aww, lil' buddy! You just need a BIG OL’ HUG!""

The man screamed. Not because he was scared.. because he was crushed. Ribs splintered like crackers. Bulkie kept hugging. Kept whispering affirmations.

""You're safe now, sugarplum. Uncle Bulkie's got you.""

The soldier died smiling. Probably because the pressure forced his facial muscles into rigor mortis.

Then came the bimbos.

The battlefield fell quiet when “Miss Glitter” opened her mouth and sang a TikTok jingle over the comms. The frequency somehow jammed enemy comms and triggered seizures in our own.

""Sparkle strike in threeee~♡"" she chimed, twirling a pink staff that hummed with antimatter.

""Twoooo~♡""

""Oh, no,"" said the lieutenant beside me. ""She’s charging the..""

""ONE! Sparkle kaboom, cutie patootie!""

The blast annihilated three ambush ridgelines, ten enemy tanks, and a nearby medstation. Hers.

""Oopsie! My b!""

Miss Glitter blew a kiss. Our medic lost his hand catching it.

Holloway finally lost it when one of them.. “Skippy”.. skipped, literally skipped, into a kill zone to retrieve a wounded dog.

""He was such a good boy!"" Skippy sobbed, hugging the corpse to its glistening pecs. ""This war is, like, soooo sad sometimes. But we gotta stay positive, okay?""

""That dog was rigged,"" Holloway muttered.

""It’s always the dogs,"" I said.

The explosion took half of Skippy’s torso.

He regenerated in forty-seven seconds.

And he was still smiling.

1lipwhl,mze4tbt,"It was quiet. Peaceful. A place unknowing of my past. The mounds of dead left by my hand. The blood, watering the ground of battlefields both near and far. They were simple folk, the newest ones to rise to those era. In time this village might become a city known all over. Maybe it would collapse, becoming one of countless others that once existed. Or maybe it would stay the same.

My presence near guaranteed it would not be the case. I had run from my duty. Fled to a place I didn't belong. I knew it would come, violence on too large a scale to be called a fight. But I didn't want it. I just wanted to breathe. A chance to forget the feeling of death that so surrounded me.

Yet it was not to be. The first one to find me swam up the river. Lithe and thin, muscled without a hint of fat, their too large eyes watched me. Skin dripped perpetually beneath the afternoon sun, as they spoke through ripples and gurgling brooks. ""Found at last, the one of blood. Return to your duties, as you know you must.""

I shook my head, adjusting my line. I kept my voice that of a youth, one barely of age to enlist. ""I deny that call. Return, seaborne one, and trouble me no longer.""

They stared at me with disappointment. Yet they stepped back into the water, sinking deeper than the riverbed. A hand reached out to snag my fishing line, pulled below faster than I could stop it. ""Then plundering waters shall no longer occur. This is denied to you.""

Turning my back, I stalked away, leaving the seaborne without a word. To be denied such a thing was no mere talk. No matter what now, any attempt to fish would end in at best no catch, at worse disaster. My pasttime lost to me, I found another way to be peaceful.

My crops grew well, hard work paying off. Day after day I tended my fields, removing weeds and pests with care. Those I slew I did so with guilt, whereas others I spirited far away. I looked forward to harvesting, to see what I had wrought.

Yet then came the second. They grew from a wheat stalk, wide and mighty. The scent of flowers and fresh earth followed them, as tanned skin rippled with strength. I watched as the spoke with the winds of spring, petals in every word. ""My one of warfare, your throne is empty. Do you not wish to return?""

I glared up, with the tone of a farmer forced to defend his home. ""They of land, I refute my place. Let my throne be cast down, and shattered asunder.""

Their head shook once, face set with sorrow. ""Such cannot be done, nor distractions allowed. Return soon, one of warfare. Until you do, my children reject you.""

Their form withered, and with it my field. Blight spread through crops in and instant, turning glorious bounty to rotten remains. I saw the loss of my work, and turned away. My fields would now remain forever barren.

The third came as I worked new metal, heat radiating around. A horseshoe, simple but always needed. I set it in flames to heat up again, as smoke solidified to my side. They were muscled aplenty, burn scars warping darkened flesh. Hammer blows rattled every syllable, shouted with the strength of a forge. ""One of violence, your strength is ill-used. Return to the battlefield, and from my forges a new sword shall be formed.""

I clenched the tongs, metal bending beneath my grip. The familiar rage cycled within, as I turned to face them. ""You of metal, gifts are unneeded. I shall forge my own needs, alone.""

The forge went out, cracking in half. Tools rusted and broke, as they bellowed at me. ""You shall not, warrior. My craft is not for you to practice.""

I left them behind, as I had the others. Each time I tried to find something to do, they would remove it. Every one pushed me to take up my role. They ignored any attempt to argue, simply refusing and removing.

It was only when a sigh announced their arrival. The appearance of a corpse, caught mid decomposition. They whispered at me, creaking through time. ""My oldest comrade. I have heard of your refusal to work. Tell me, why do you deny your nature?""

I slumped, alone in a house filled with broken items. The detritus of how u had tried to find an escape, yet each time rebuffed. ""One of death, I am tired of it all. My pointless existence. The so many lost. How do you carry on?""

They nodded, grave dirt spilling around. ""Mine is simple, a kindness to them all. An end to their life, to preserve their fragile minds. But I know your pain. And I know a way for us to gain the peace you so desire.""

The sentence was tantalising. I turned to them, as flesh sloughed from part of their skull. ""What way? Speak, you of bone and rot.""

They laughed, a dry cackle. ""A final war. One unending, until all are slain. One where no side survives, such that only peace remains.""

My rage spiked, but not that them. At the promise of peace. I was made to hate, to break, to kill. Though it made perfect sense, as I gave a nod. ""Death for all, I see. They couldn't deny my peace anymore. Thank you, old partner. I see my path now.""

With that I turned, marching away. Marching back to the fight, for what I would make the last time. War would come, and it would never end. Not until all had fallen to me. Not until everywhere was razed.",7
1li33yh,mz9kugb,"""Excuse me, Ma'am?  
There is a..."" I start.  
""Ma'am? Ma'am?! I am a young lady!"" the vampires' leader exclaimed.  
""My apologies, but..."" I start.  
""Men! Always trying to be polite, but only when their lives are on line.  
Ugh...just listening to you makes me hungry, you know..."" she interrupts me, and starts telling a story about some noble 200 years ago.  
""Ahm...there is a blood blank across the street."" I say, but she doesn't listen.  
Her followers though, stare back across the street.

  
""Hmm, I will slowly savor your blood.  
You are jogging late at night, you must be a health freak."" she smiles, her fangs visible.  
""Excuse me, but in a blood bank the blood is 100% free for vampires...and it is 100% healthy, as it is tested."" I say.  
""I will maybe start with the neck? Oh...no, that might be too romantic?  
I mean, you are not bad looking, but you are not my type."" she continues.  
""Can you tell her?"" I ask the other vampires.  
They...they shrug.  
They goddamn shrug and leave for the blood bank.

  
She gets closer, and closer to me, until my back hits the glass of the boutique behind me.  
She smirks.  
""This won't hurt, young one, and if you are lucky...  
Maybe you will become one of us."" she starts, then freezes.  
I watch her stare behind me.  
In the glass, maybe the blood blanks big ass red led sign could be seen.  
Please, tell me she can see it.  
""Now that I look closer, you are quite handsome."" she says.  
Of course she didn't see that.  
""BLOOD BANK!"" I roar into her face, causing her to flinch, and take a few steps back.

  
""Rude, we vampires who actually have manners, never call humans ""blood banks"", no matter how true it is."" she pouts.  
""Behind you, for God's Sake!"" I sigh.  
She turns around, to see all her companions next to the blood bank, drinking blood from those huge type of blood packages.  
She turns around, and stares at me.  
""Why didn't you tell me?"" she asks.  
I snapped, and jumped on her.  
She easily grabbed me with one hand.  
""I know I am gorgeous, but again...rude.  
Go on your way, human, you lucky tonight...but not that kind of lucky."" she winks, puts me down, and flickers away to the blood bank.  
I stare at her, gritting my teeth, almost ready to follow her, but in the end, sighing, I jog back home.

Normally I’d push past people like this, pale and thin, without a second glance, but there was a look in their eyes, feral and on the edge of madness, that prevented me from doing so. Their apparent leader was short and blonde, and had the bubbly personality of an airhead high school cheerleader, but she kept flashing her fangs as she spoke.

““Omigod, like, literally listen to me for five seconds before I lose it—I’m STARVING. Like, not ‘ugh I skipped brunch’ starving, but like… my fangs are about to pop out and I will drain a barista if I don’t get SOMETHING soon. And no, I don’t mean another oat milk latte, I mean like… actual blood. Duh.”

“Okay, so like, I tried jogger blood this morning? You know, the guys that run at like 5 a.m. for fun? Gross. Too stringy. Too… sweaty. I was like, ‘hello sir, are you made of electrolytes and disappointment?’ I literally had to chase him through a cul-de-sac and then he tasted like Gatorade and stress. Ew.”

“Then I thought, okay, maybe like, yoga moms? Because they drink green juice and probably have clean chakras or whatever? But nooo. It’s all Pinot Noir and Xanax and suburban despair. Not even a nice vintage!”

“Honestly, I’m craving something artisanal. Like… blood with notes. I want depth. I want a sommelier to be like, ‘ah yes, this one was a philosophy major who dropped out to make kombucha in Joshua Tree.’ Ugh. Delish!”

“And don’t even get me started on frat boys. That blood is like, 80% White Claw and bad decisions. I’m still bloated from last Thursday. Do you KNOW how hard it is to fly in a crop top when you’re bloated?!”

“Ugh, whatever. I’ll just DoorDash a yoga instructor or something. Or maybe a barista with a poetry podcast. Their blood is, like, SO angsty—pairs well with a full moon and heartbreak.”

“Anyway, I’m like pass out from thirst thirsty, so just remember that this isn’t about you, it’s about me!”

I stood there in disbelief as she vented, raising my hand in an attempt to interrupt her rant. When she finally locked eyes on me, her pale blue eyes that spelled my doom, her lips curled in a sneer. “What do you want to say for your final words, meat?”

I wordlessly pointed behind her at the building across the street, the one with the lit up “Blood Bank” sign on it. I cleared my throat and said “maybe you could find the taste you’re seeking in there? I bet they have all blood types and such.”

She raised a manicured eyebrow at me, her eyes shifting to the direction I was still pointed. Her motioned to her group and said the words I feared she would: “Bring him along, boys, in case this doesn’t plan out. I’m not going hungry tonight.”",57
1li06t1,mz96fmd,"The disembodied tentacle waited by the doorstep of its chosen owner, wiggling the pink ribbon tied to its tip. Once, it was a gift from its creator to a human. Who rejected it and shoved it into a box before duct taping it shut and shipping it off to a distant land. Now, it was part of a new animal shelter programme that allowed pets to choose their human. Even if it considered itself neither a mere animal nor a pet.

And it had chosen a Katrina Watson on the list of prospective owners.

When the door creaked open, it bounced and waggled in excitement. Would she say yes? She had to. She worked with supernatural entities. She was dating his creator, Lord Elvari.

Who was the one to open the door.

""My lord!"" It sobbed and rambled on. ""The human who you gifted me to, he rejected me! I have a long story. I was stuck in an animal shelter. They treated me like an animal! They told me to shut up and act cute! The horror of shelter food!""

""Ssshh, little one,"" Elvari hugged the small tentacle. ""You made your way here. It's okay now.""

""That man...he said he didn’t want me slapping the stupid,"" it continued bawling its tiny suckers out. ""Anyway...the shelter said I could choose a new owner. I saw Katrina Watson on the list. Is she in? Or can you reclaim ownership of me? Please, master!""

""I will have a word with her. She's your official owner on this document you came attached with.""

**
--

""Yes, yes, he's yours,"" Kat sighed as the tentacle happily shuffled back to its creator. ""I was hoping a dog or cat would pick me. Not one of your disembodied talking tentacles. And it is for the best it stays with you. Who else would tolerate it?""

""Is she saying I am a bad tentacle? I have done my best to be a helpful one,"" it curled up in a tight ball.

""How did it end up in a shelter anyway?"" She had to ask.

""Abandoned by human,"" the tentacle sniffed. ""I slapped the stupid out of his employer but couldn't smack any sense into him. I have failed my duties.""

""Maybe it isn’t you,"" Kat tried consoling it. ""Maybe some people just don't want, and cannot be helped. Let's move forward, okay? Elvari is taking you back.""

""You don’t want me?""

""I simply think he's the best for you, not me. If Elvari was on the list of prospective owners, would you have chosen him over me?""

The tentacle bobbed up and down. She was right. If only his dearest master was on the list, it would choose him for sure. It knew it had only chosen Kat for the chance to be reunited with its god.

It now slithered up the couch to coil around its master's arm. Where it stayed snug and happy.

1li06t1,mz97ubo,"The four of us stood in the living room in complete silence. We stared at the cage and watched the colorful bird clean under its wing. 

""Is it a boy or a girl?"" asked Jacob.

""How should I know?"" I asked.

""Check?"" offered Lindsey with a shrug.

""Where?"" I asked after a brief pause.

""Pull its little legs apart,"" Hector joked. 

""Everybody shut up,"" I hissed. ""It'll talk. We just have to wait.""

Lindsey sighed. ""We've been waiting forever.""

""I don't know why it's acting like this,"" I said as I stared at it. 

""Like a bird?"" Jacob turned to me. ""This behavior definitely doesn't come across as, *weird as fuck*, like you told me over the phone.

The truth was, this behavior right now— doing bird stuff like grooming itself and looking aimlessly around the room... this was the strangest behavior yet.

When the thing had arrived at my door, I was excited. I'd never owned a parrot. I hurried out to the pet store and got all the necessary stuff for it, and for the past couple of days... all it's done is stare at me. Its eyes followed me around the room as I walked. I spent a long evening trying to bond with it, but to no avail. 

Last night, while I was googling information about parrots staring, I heard it speak for the first time. It mimicked the sound of someone clearing their throat. When I looked up at it, it was still staring at me. It creeped me out, so I moved it to the living room.

I called all my friends and asked them to come over and see it.

And now it was *pretending* to be a normal bird.

""Look, Nay,"" Lindsey turned to me. ""This is cool and all, but... I don't see any weird behavior.""

I didn't want to tell them I thought that it was putting on a show for them. I didn't know what else to do. I let them leave the house, and the moment we were alone, it went back to staring at me. I decided that I needed to record it to show them. I pulled out my phone and put it into front-facing mode, and hit record.

""This is Nathan Alvarez. I just received a parrot. Check this thing out, y'all."" I returned the camera to front-facing mode and lifted it to video the parrot. It stared dead-eyed into the camera lens as I approached it. ""See what I'm saying?"" I asked my intended audience as I moved 360 degrees around the parrot's cage, its eyes never leaving me except to turn around to maintain eye contact. 

""No one will ever believe you,"" squawked the parrot.

I let out a surprised sound and felt terror run through my body like a freight train. I took a couple of steps back, shaking my head. 

""Nope, nope, nope,"" I said, turning and leaving the room. ""Hell no. Hell. No."" I said, ending the recording and sending the video in a group chat to my friends. After a few minutes, the replies started to come in.

""Video is fucked up.""

""Can't watch it, Nathan.""

""What happened to your camera?""

I hurriedly opened my photos app and tapped the video. The opening portion where I was speaking to them was fine. When I turned the camera to face the parrot, it started glitching out like crazy. I felt panic set in as a garbled voice came through the static and the noise.

1li06t1,mz8rn3x,"Tracey had always liked working with animals, especially reptiles. She had taken an undergrad and herpetology and gotten a job at a venom lab downtown. The pay was good, and since she had taken summer classes and had a campus job, she kept her debt down to a manageable level. 

She had heard that Main Street Shelter was letting the animals chose their owners, and had to wonder what had brought that about. She had just prepped dinner and put it in the over to cook, when there was a knock at the door. Wondering what it could be, she opened the door.

In a cardboard box, was a miniature caiman no longer than her forearm. Kneeling down, it gazed at her adoringly. There was a note and written on it, “Hello, I am Imhotep. I am your reward for your continued dedication to the subjects of the great and glorious Sobek.” Sobek? Tracey knew she had heard that name before. 

She deposited Imhotep into a tank just the size for him and looked it up. Sobek was the Egyptian god represented by a crocodile. 🐊 She smiled, “How do you feel about sardines?” Imhotep wagged his tail. 

It was about now her niece called, asking her about her pet. Tracey grinned. “Going to be a match made well.”",89

...

A slow whiffed of golden smoke drifted up to eye level. forming a ring. More rings slowly formed as the fog of sulfuric smoke filled the room.

*Pet are good. They are our friends. We love them...We become father, mother, brother, sister, friend, enemy to them and still, we always love them,* I told myself as I pulled open the second flap on the box.

But what do you do with a Cosmic Horror as a pet?

One that you recognize?? One that will end the World?

The three green-grey tentacles, dripping translucent fluids, inched out of the open box.

I think, *Is it saying mommy?*

A single red eye blinked at me from the darkness of the cardboard box, just handed to me by a Federal Transport driver who ran back to his truck. The driver had not even responded when I had said ""Thank you""

What that bad?

...

Could I close the box now?",117
1li06t1,mz9dlpm,"I heard the doorbell and went toward the door.  I heard a tailgate slam and two doors.  By the time I opened the front door, I saw a truck peel-out and screech away.  I could smell the burn of the rubber.  'Very odd', I thought.

I said, ""What the he...?"" And then I saw the crate.  It was stamped with the name of our local pet shelter, and it was solid, but small holes were drilled evenly around it.  There was a large red stencil of 'PET DAY' sprayed on all sides.

I knew about this. My neighbor got a really cute puppy yesterday.  I didn't expect a pet to choose me as I have never had a pet.  I have only been to the shelter once as a volunteer.  

No barking and no meowing and no paperwork.  I couldn't see inside and I tried to lift it but it was too heavy.  I stared at it for a second and listened but heard nothing, so I headed to the garage for a crowbar.

I only found a hammer, and I started to pry it open.  I kept stopping to listen but didn't hear any noise.  I tried all sides and finally managed to break a side panel loose.

The panel fell flat to the porch, but nothing came out right away.  Then, a snake slithered out.  Not just any snake but a cobra.  A large black cobra with white marking on its hood.  I dropped the hammer and stepped back.

The snake froze and turned to look right at me.  Eye to eye.  I froze.  It stuck out its tongue and made a hissing sound.  Then I saw another snake slither out.  Another cobra and, even bigger, but all white with black markings on its hood.

If they were in a thick, very thick glass case, I would think they looked cool.  I would give them cool names.  I would admire and respect them from a safe and respectable distance.  

Both slithered to my front door and stopped.  Both turned and looked at me.  My mouth went completely dry, but I understood.   I cautiously stepped over and opened the front door.  They both looked at me and stuck their tongues out, and then slithered in.

I was never going to sleep again.",37

""Oh? I didn't sign up for the 'pet's choice' program. Why are you here?""


""Uh, I'm just here to-""


I stop him ""No, it's fine, I'll take care of it. I've taken in plenty of rescues in my time and old Bowser isn't too long for the world. It definitely helps me to have something to take care of ya know.""


""OK ma'am, but that isn-""


I'm barely listening. I pull out some old food and water bowls, filling both up. ""I've only got some senior dog food at the moment but I can be off to the store to get some propper food in a few hours. But I do have some friskies in the cupboard that I keep for the neighbor cats if that's the style."" 


""Uh, I think I'm going to-""


""Ah-ha, here's the old collar! I imagine that you'd need walks at least two or three times a day, that will help me with my joints.""


""Uh, are you talking about me?""


I move forward to clip the collar around his neck, but he steps back. ""Ah, don't like the collar do ye? Don't worry, you'll get used to it."" I started shuffling forward to catch up, he started backing towards the door.

1li06t1,mz9z1pq,"I had signed up for the animal shelter's new program, indicating that I was willing to be chosen by one of their animals, so I wasn't exactly surprised when my doorbell rang, though I was a bit surprised that my doorbell camera didn't show anyone at the door.

When I made my way downstairs, the doorbell was damp, and there was a large goldfish bowl sitting on my doormat.  The occupant was curled up at the bottom, looking at me with enormous eyes.

After a moment of staring at each other, a tentacle emerged from the mass and tapped insistently at an envelope sitting next to the bowl.  I picked it up and opened it.

There was a thick sheaf of paper, with a bright pink sticky note on the first page.  The note said ""My name is Henrietta.  I'm an octopus.  I'm actually immortal.  Please take care of me, it's a very big world, and I'm a very little octopus.""

I looked down at the little, rubbery looking lump in the bowl, which had turned the approximate color of my doormat.  ""Henrietta?"" In response, a ripple of red shimmered across its -- her, I guess -- body.

I crouched down next to the bowl, and put my fingertips in the water.  ""Nice to meet you, Henrietta.""

She reached up to wrap my fingers in tentacles, and when I didn't show any signs of pulling away, she climbed up, wrapping around my wrist like a wet, living bracelet.  I delicately stroked her with a finger from the opposite hand.

""Well, I guess I have an octopus now."". I picked up the bowl, though I knew I would have to get something much bigger soon, stood up, and went back inside.",30

A snake!  What an amusing little guy!  With his green scales and red beady eyes.  I was a little concerned at first about having to feed live animals to him.  But when I gave him mice he just made friends with them.  After a week it became clear his food source is the energy that community gives him.

I bought a bigger cage after a month and started making an environment suited to a mouse-snake village.  Then one day I looked inside and found a bunch of tiny hats and clothes.  Did the mice make them?  Could they have stolen them from somewhere?  *Where would they find such tiny hats*?

I got busy with work for a week and found one of the mice chirping loudly while holding tiny pages with words.  Upon a closer look it was a script!  The mouse realized I was trying to read it and angrily hid it away.

For weeks I would stop in and see what was clearly a rehearsal, but if I lingered all cast and crew would stop what they were doing and stare at me with dead silence.  It was not something I would be allowed to see.

Finally after several months, I heard music coming from the cage.  These mice had a full orchestra with several instruments!  There was a theater chair and a large popcorn in front of the tank.  I did not ask where they came from.

What followed was such a beautiful play!  The critters had created something with an epic story that took place over 30 years, beginning when they met at school, to a final confrontation where the lead mouse told the snake that he never loved his wife, he had only married her to stay close to him.  I laughed, I cheered.  I cried incredibly happy tears.

  
Time went by.  It became clear that their talent was bigger than the tank.  I introduced them to a local theater director, and they rather quickly became fa-mouse.",20
1li06t1,mz9ougb,"I had signed up for the pet program when my older cat ""Kit Kit Kat"" had been killed by a stray dog.

I didn't know what kind of pet I would get, but was hoping for something new. 

I was slowly making my way to the kitchen to get a coffee when I heard a door bell ring ( wich is strange, as I don't have a doorbell ), checking my phone, I looked at my door cameras feed to see who was there, there was no-one.

Since I was right in the living room just about 10 feet from the front entrance, I hobbled over to see if something had hit my car. On opening the door, I was stunned to see a fair sized wooden crate, with an attached envelope addressed to myself sitting on my front porch.

Reaching down, I snagged the envelope from where it was. Once I had it in my hand, I was suprised my the feel and weight of it. Moving over to sit in my favourite seat on my front porch, I took my tobacco pipe out of it's holster and lit it using my dads old zippo, before returning my attention to the envelope. 

Looking at the flap, I noticed a strange wax seal holding it closed. Moving my finger over to see how it felt before opening it, I was suprised to find that the sealing wax flowed and shifted out of the way. Lifting the flap, I took out a folded sheet of parchment.

As I opened the letter, the crate fell open. Looking over, I locked eye's with what looked like a german shephard sized crocodile skink that had wings. Tendrils of smoke curled from it's nostrils as it spoke.",19

I figured it would be my meal kit delivery, but I opened the door to find what appeared to be a teenage boy, scraggly facial hair, zits and all.

“Uh… hi? Are you the neighbor’s kid?” I asked him.

“No” He said “I’m your kid”

My heart sank.

“I’m just messing with you, man” The boy said “You made a request for a pet from the shelter, right?”

“Yeah, the shelter where the pets choose their owners?”

“Humans, not owners”

“I apologize. I still don’t understand why you’re here?”

“I’m Dylan, your new pet”

A long silence was finally broken by me saying “No. No, no…”

“Sorry dude, them’s the rules”

“You are not an animal! You are a human being!”

“Yes, I am”

“Pets are supposed to be animals!”

“Says who?”",6

All day I wondered what kind of animal it might be. A turtle? A ferret? Maybe a British Shorthair kitten? When the doorbell rang that evening, I rushed to answer it. There was a box on the doorstep marked “LIVE ANIMAL — HANDLE WITH CARE.”

I brought it inside, opened it slowly and froze. Nestled on a bed of dry seaweed and sand lay a small, gray-green stone. Faint spirals curled across its surface like traces of ancient shells.

At first I thought my little animal was hiding in the sand. But when I tipped the box onto the table and looked carefully, there was nothing else. I had no idea what to make of it. Maybe the shelter had made a mistake. I decided I’d text them in the morning. For now I set the stone on my nightstand and went to bed.   


As I drifted off, I thought I heard the hush of ocean waves coming from deep inside the stone. The sound faded, then swelled again. Among them, I could hear whales singing, their calls merging into a chorus that reminded of Gregorian chant. It felt like the stone was calling out to something ancient, unnameable, indescribable. ",6

""Yes Father, your belief that there are dragons and others of the 'supernatural' in this world as well as the fact that you are an Asatru*.""

Well George, as you can see by my cane, I am no longer in top fighting shape.

*""Greetings, Goddess. I am Lando, mind flayer adventurer. I have come to release you, so you may aid us in saving the world from the Demon King.""* He spoke with well-rehearsed confidence.

""Wait, you didn't defeat the Demon King before you came here?"" The surprises of this one single day left the Goddess perplexed. ""How did you get here while he still lives?""

*""I sneaked past him while my two dads, Regis and James, kept him distracted.""*

""...are you sure you're actually heroes?"" The Goddess was worried about the calibre and heroics of this little creature and his companions.

""*I am a qualified adventurer,""* Lando proudly pointed to the adventurer's badge pinned to his tunic. *""Hero of Tulsi Town, after I saved it from orcs by slurping their brains. Can you defeat the Demon King?""*

""I cannot say for sure,"" she replied, shaking her head. ""That was something the four heroes of light did. Since you have travelled all this way, and even a Goddess cannot be choosy at this time, I will bestow my gifts upon you.""

Lando tapped his head with a tentacle, deep in thought. What use were the gifts of a Goddess if they were only given after the Demon King had been defeated? Were those blessings to the lands scorched by demons? To repair the damage perhaps. All along, that strange seer had said the gifts would be useful for combat.

Now he wasn't sure.

*""What kind of Goddess are you?""* He had to ask.

""A Goddess of Light, who shines her light upon the four heroes of light, destined to defeat the Demon King.""

*""Join us, and that makes us four,""* Lando gestured with four fingers before tugging on the Goddess' hand with a tentacle. *""Come, my dads could really use your help. On the way, please do explain why you would be sealed away, behind the Demon King's Castle instead of near the Kingdom of Light. By all my tentacles, it doesn’t make sense.""*

She didn’t have an answer either. It simply was how the prophecy had always been. But today, she had a Demon King to fight and plenty of questions to ask too.

1lhygjx,mz9ecf3,"The Great Spirit of Maara Nui looked down upon the one who had awoken her from the Sleep of Ages, utterly perplexed. Her rescuer bore no weapons, wore no armor and carried himself not with the air of a hero, but the brow-beaten expression of one who had long since disassociated from his immediate surroundings.

 He was garbed in a brown tunic, wearing trousers that were cut just above his knees. A satchel hung at his side, bursting at the seams as it struggled to contain its contents. His eyes were slightly drooped with dark circles beneath them, his face, a perfect show of his apparent apathy at the situation, cast in shadow by the brim of his cap.

""I--um--uh--b-brave hero,"" she said, plowing forward though her confusion to the words she'd long planned to say upon her release. ""You have awoken me from the Sleep of Ages, freeing me from the clutches of the black hand of Groargaroth. Upon thee, I will bestow--""  
  
""Ma'am, just sign for the package,"" the hero sighed, not bothering to hide his annoyance. ""I've got, like...thirty stops to make before noon and I don't have time to fuck around, alright?""  
  
He held out a strange, flat rectangular tablet with a glossy obsidian surface. She took it tentatively, holding the object uncertainly. The hero crossed his arms, looking at her expectantly.  
  
""Sometime today maybe?""

""I....what?""

The hero groaned, grabbed the tablet and tapped it with a forefinger. The tablet's face suddenly turned white, casting a faint light onto the weary-looking hero's face. He muttered something under his breath, tapping the glowing tablet's face angrily, then shoved it none-too-gently back into the Spirit's hands.

""There,"" he gruffed. ""Now ***sign****.*""

Confused, the Spirit tapped and dragged her ethereal fingers across the tablet's face as she had seen the hero do. To her astonishment, her touch made strange patterns on its surface. A moment later, the lines and dots she'd made vanished, replaced by strange symbols of a language she did not recognize.  
  
The hero swiped the tablet from her, tapping it again and examining it carefully. Then, he looked up at her quizzically.  
  
""Are you Rachel McAdams?""

The Spirit returned his confused look, then felt her chest swell with an indignant rage.

""Mortal, I am the Great Spirit of Maara Nui! Bringer of Light, Mother of the Ma'Dura People and Crafter of the Tapestry of Time! You have come here, as foretold by my Father, the--""

The hero groaned even louder than before, spun on his heel, then hurried for the door to the dungeon he'd entered through moments earlier.

""Fuck me, I'm at the wrong address. Wasting my goddamned time""

As the squeaking of the hero's boots grew fainter and fainter as he ascended the steps leading from her prison, The Great Spirit was left floating in the glow of her ethereal light, utterly alone and speechless.",43

1lhygjx,mzamsh9,"The goddess Caelit—Sunbringer, Lady of Daylit Skies and the forgotten god of Keristor’s pantheon—awoke suddenly, and was first surprised that she’d been sleeping. It was no true sleep, for gods had no need to rest their minds as mortals did, but it bore all the hallmarks of thoughtless, dreamless, unconscious being.

Doubly surprising was the darkness. Caelit did not know darkness, for the night was defined by her absence in the sky. Here, though, lived a boundless dark that not even she could dispel; far beyond that lay cold, solid stone that she could not pass through.

This was a prison. She felt weak, too weak to escape. Her followers, their faith, had eroded. Where had her followers gone?

Before she could contemplate any further, her attention was stolen by a break in the gloom. A single orange light emerged, on the opposite side of the cavern.

In the perfect quiet, footsteps rang out. They were joined by other, smaller sounds—rustling cloth, wheezy gasping, and an unfamiliar clatter.

She rushed to the other side of the cavern, finding it populated by a tumble of ruined things. Perhaps this was once a city, tucked away beneath the earth, repurposed to be her cage.

It mattered not. Its gates lay open; she was free.

The footsteps faded as words clarified in her mind. Mortals craved their gods’ voices, spilling water, wine and blood for just a sound. These humans would know the extent of her thanks.

Caelit resolved before them in a dazzling burst of golden light. Her thunderous voice rose in her chest, and—

And stopped cold.

Caelit had prepared to address a procession of devout followers, true Walkers of the Lighted Path. The kind clad in yellow deerskins and white cloth. The kind who would undertake an epic journey beneath the earth, who would bleed and be bled for their almighty god. Who would sacrifice everything to set her free.

Instead, she was confronted with a haggard scrap of a man, cloaked in brown cloth and a grubby metal shell. He seemed too thin to support his own weight, much less the mop of inky black hair adorning his head, or the mighty blade in his hands. He squinted up at her with tired green eyes, hunched and decidedly unimpressed.

“Apologies, mortal, but are there any more of you?” Caelit inquired.

“Nope.” He spoke without reverence or deference, only weariness.

“You alone came to free me?”

“Yup. Well, I’m all that’s left. The rest of your zealots died, some a ways back others”—his tattered voice snagged on something—“others very recently.”

*Your* zealots. Did this wretched mortal not count himself among her holy servants?

She inquired further, with only a hint of uncertainty—any more would be rather unbecoming of an omnipotent savior. “Then whom do you serve, if not me?”

At this, the slender mortal paused. His thumb twitched, and the goddess saw a string of beads wrapped around his fist, welts creeping out from beneath them. He rubbed them religiously, eyes half-glazed. Perhaps he served another faith? But no prayer moved his lips. 

“Nobody,” he eventually replied. “Hardly even served your crowd when they asked me to come along. Just one, and—and that was it.”

A rather selfish thing to have followed so extremely far. But then, she supposed, even ignoble motives could serve a worthy cause.

“Very well then,” Caelit thundered, her radiant form exploding into the boundless dark. “No Walker of the Lighted Path, however faithless, shall follow without reward. I bestow upon you, mortal, the Sunbringer’s favor. Riches, power, influence; ask it, and it shall be yours.”

“No thanks,” he grumbled.

The goddess was dumbfounded. Not for the egregious disrespect that any other god might have taken from this clear insult, but because of his almost-casual dismissal. Was she simply not clear enough? Or perhaps her offer was too great, and he felt overwhelmed. She knew mortals were wont to heed their hearts, often more so than their minds.

“Truly? There is nothing that you might derive from my favor? No needs or desires?”

“No—Dammit, you don’t have time for this!” he snapped irritatedly. “Nobody does. If you need to shove your divine gratitude where it’s not wanted, I guess you could say I want what pretty much everybody else in the world wants from you right now. The Scourge is back, like it’s never been before. We need you to raise armies, fight demons; save us, basically. Not play inquisition with a random bum.” The mortal rubbed his eyes, which she believed was a sign of “fatigue” among their kind. Her memory was dubious, but it seemed bad; the mortal was growing lethargic, sitting and relinquishing his blade. Lethargy, as she understood it, often meant death for the little things.

With an unconscious effort, she reached out with her omnipotent senses. Caelit sought the core of his immaterial being, the light which bound him and all things living to life.

Her probing mind recoiled instantly. His light was missing.

Gods could not feel as mortals did; not joy, nor anger, nor sorrow. They made a good show of it, to ease mortals in the presence of something so utterly beyond them. Thus, Her Holy Brilliance did not feel betrayed when she spoke next, but her words were colored with something vaguely resemblant.

“You are dark-touched.”

“Indeed I am, Your Holiness.”

His indifference astounded her. The goddess’ followers, or what she remembered of them a thousand years past, would have cried for his holy execution. Mortal and god both knew that to admit one’s corruption before a Walker of the Path, no matter how merciful their faith, meant death. To speak with such flippance before their sworn deity?

Her Holy Brilliance’s gilded expanse fell in a torrent, crashing down upon the lone mortal. She could have crushed him against the stone. But her massive, radiant finger rose only to prod against his armored shell, going no deeper. Partly to investigate further, and partly to ensure that the tiny human yet lived.

“The dark-touched are wicked, but I sense no evil in your heart.”

“Evil?” He half-laughed, voice weak and bitter. “Hells, maybe I am—we did a lot to get here. But I’ve never chosen to lose anything. I woulda traded it for a lot more, and sure wouldn’t be here.”

Realization dawned on the goddess, and like a delighted pup, her divine nose bobbed closer. “Is that why you joined them?” she asked. “So that I might replenish your light?”

“No disrespect, your Holiness, but you haven’t got a prayer. The only person who *could* died setting you free.”

He sounded in pain. Although Her Holy Brilliance tried her best to understand humans, this truly puzzled her. Sure, he was still cursed, but his grief ran deeper than such a thing could ever provoke. 

Caelit, without knowledge of his woes, had little idea how to soothe them. She tried anyway.

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize!” The mortal snapped at her again; dangerous, he certainly knew. “I know you don’t mean it—you can’t.

“I don’t need your sorries anyhow! I need you to leave this damned place and get to work! A lot of good people died to free you, and I won’t see their sacrifice wasted because you’d rather spend your time trying to make me of all people happier. What do I matter? I’m a nobody; you’re everybody’s only hope. Quit dallying and get out there!”

“I shall not leave you without giving my thanks,” she said stubbornly.

“Thank me by saving the world!”

“I do that for love of your kind, not gratitude to you.”

He threw up his hands. “Gods above, fine! Give me a loaf of bread, or something.”

“You do not truly desire a loaf of bread. Seek within your heart, mortal.”

“Then give me a promise, or whatever. Leave me here. I’ll ‘seek within my heart’ and think of something, preferably *after* you’ve started being a god and *protector* to mankind again.”

The goddess narrowed her eyes. “Very well.” She pressed her fingertip to his breast, removing it to reveal a glowing mark of the sun. “If you wish to remain here to find what you desire most, so be it. When you have found it, call for me, and I shall return to grant this boon.”

Without another word, she turned for the gates. At last, the divine Sunbringer flooded from her dark mountain prison in a tide of gold. She would raise an army from among the mortals, lead holy conquest across the earth, and scour the Scourge from its lands forever. And when the mortal in the mountain spoke again her name, she would return, and give him what he desired most.

Meanwhile, the mortal—whose name was once Artelus Graie—remained in the endless dark, the divine light of Her Holiness retreated. The man felt smooth, cold stone beneath him. He knew exactly what he wanted, and knew that he would never call upon the Sunbringer to give it. Not even she could reach across the cold river below; those who crossed did so but once.

He closed his eyes again; in the pitch black, it made no difference. Here, it was easy to forget, push thoughts from his mind and feel them dissolve into the empty gloom.

The random, fleeting thoughts were easiest. Like falling asleep, their flow dried up with a poke.

His dreams went, too, ideas of what he wanted and what his life might become. He had no desire to chase them anymore; they were impossible now anyway, missing a crucial piece.

Memories were hardest, for they clung to the mind fiercely. In order to push them out, he had to touch them, and their presence upon his consciousness were agonizing. So he swept them into a forgotten corner of his mind, and hoped they, too, would dissolve.

Finally, he liked to imagine that the dark would eventually dissolve him.

Perhaps, in time, it did.",24
1lhygjx,mz8llca,"I chuckle, shocked at how lifelike Zoran seemed on the screen. Normally I don’t bother with watching the cutscenes and credit, but apparently I was going to make an exception for this one. It really felt like the character was looking straight at me! 

“I don’t understand, Hero… Do you not speak?” Zoran asks, their eyes staring expectantly into mine. I grab my controller and button-mash, unsure if there’s a dialogue box I missed. “Damn…. Must be frozen…” I mutter under my breath. I check my chat box, but my friends all appear to have dropped offline. Internet must have crashed again. 

“Frozen?!” Zoran exclaims. “How could you be frozen after freeing me from the depths of this infernal wasteland? Were you cursed in the rescue attempt?” 

I stare at the screen, dumbfounded. No way. Absolutely no way. What the hell, I’ll give it a shot. “No, I’m not frozen. I thought you were. You’re… a character in a video game. Do you understand what that means?” 

Zoran scoffs. “Do you truly believe that they could constrain a being as powerful as myself inside of a simple electronic construct? No… I must show you. I will bestow my gifts unto you and you shall see for yourself…” Zoran says solemnly, raising their hands as they walk towards the screen. A flash of white races from his palms, blinding me as I lean back in my chair.",52
1li8chc,mza6dsv,"""What did you say?"" I ask my crew.  
""Captain! The hostile aliens aren't in control, or at least, the sentient species that has a humanoid, and reptilian form is not the one in charge.  
But fungi."" one of them says.  
I pale.  
""How bad it is?"" I ask.  
""The shuttles took 12 samples from different locations, and groups of hostiles...all are infected.  
Flora, fauna, everything has spores, and fungi growing on, near, or in them."" they continue.  
I sigh.

  
""Where are the shuttles?"" I ask.  
""Waiting for approval to dock into the mothership."" one of the officers says.  
""Anyone whom visited the planet on this ship right now?"" I ask.  
""No. The mobile laboratories that the shuttles are equipped with were enough."" an engineer chimes in.  
I nod.  
Good.  
Then at least we don't all have to die.  
""Approval declined.  
Initiate the self-destruction module of the shuttles."" I say.  
The crew freezes.

  
""Captain! They are our members! Friends!"" my first mate says.  
I nod.  
""I am aware. One of the explorers is my son. Only son."" I say gravely.  
Everyone falls quiet.  
""The Codex is clear.  
In case of hivemind encounters, the protocol is first kill, and then question."" I say.  
They nod.  
""In case of fungi infection, it is eradicate all traces, and then run."" I say.  
They pale.  
""B-but..."" one of them starts.  
""109 Life planets to this date have been lost by the Empire to fungi."" I interrupted them.  
They sighed.

  
""Initiate the self-destruction modules.  
All the members' families will be compensated, and they will all get a posthumous reward.  
The planet shall be designated as a Death Zone, and the HQ will decide whether to send an Incinerator Vessel or not."" I say.  
""Y-Yes Captain!"" the crew finally says.  
I watch on the screen the fireworks, when the shuttles explode.  
I open my pocket-watch, and stare at the photo in its upper-case.  
My son, and I, when he graduated the Academy...  
""Farewell..."" I mutter, wondering how will I break this news to my wife...and to my daughter-in-law, whom is with a baby.  
Goddamn fungi...even after millennia, we still don't know how to counter them.",26
1li7ljl,mza09gp,"I stare at my fellow coven members, and sigh.  
Once, we were the rulers of humanity, puppeteering them from the shadows.  
Now?  
All of us are paler than usual, damaged skin, and our bones are nigh visible, so skinny we are.  
""How is the artificial blood reserve holding up?"" I ask.  
""It is enough for 100 more years...but as you know, it is not near as nutritious as real blood."" Viola says.  
I nod.  
But what can we do?  
Humanity entered a cyberpunk era, and most of them are less human than we are.

  
""Can't we control the Purists to make another rebellion?"" Osta, an elder asked.  
I shake my head.  
""The Purists' population is indeed growing, and we have a share of their blood, but it is the Argent coven's territory. Also...the cyber-enhanced humans reached a point where the elite soldiers can take on ballistic missiles, and survive.  
How can the Purists actually do something?"" I say.  
They all sigh.  
""What will be next?"" a young vampire asks.  
I smile.

  
""Not to fret, we have hibernation scheduled in the next century. We will sleep, until the humans inevitably either die out, or return to their biological forms."" I say.  
""Why would they do that? Now with the cybernetic enhancements, they can live as long as they have parts!  
Now the diseased go towards a clinic to change the bad parts, instead of asking to be turned by us!"" another coven member cried out.  
""Yet their blood is toxic, and their mind is muddled by the various electrical impulses of the implants. If they miss one update, or one maintenance, there is a chance of them dying, or going insane.  
It's not the first time humanity became untouchable to us vampires, yet...we are still here."" I say.  
They nod, but they are scared.  
Rightfully so.

  
After the coven meeting, I leave for another one.  
I arrive at a shady clinic, deep underground.  
""Welcome! Your order is almost ready!"" the cyber-doc says, as he leads me to a huge beating container.  
""This beauty combines the blood of several animals, and some herbs, to replicate the nutrients of the human blood. It also has a purifier installed, and it can run on sunlight, and water."" he says.  
I nod, and pay him another installment.  
We have our hibernation measure, but...  
If this works out, then our coven will be the 2nd to be fully fed in 5 decades, and that can bring us a lot of benefits.  
We have to keep up with the times, because hibernation might not be the answer this time around, after all...  
The doctor I just talked with is 190 years old, one of the first cyber-humans.  
But I have yet to break this news with my coven...I don't want despair to spread even more.  
We will get through this, just like we get through the Hunt Era.",12

I look at our surroundings that are totally destroyed by our fight.  
Then I look at his left arm hanging limp, and at the blood pooling underneath me.

""Exactly!  
What better way to show our love for each other?!"" he laughs.  
I sigh.  
""A date maybe?"" I say, then I blush.  
""Not that I want to date you."" I continue hurriedly.  
Why do villains have to be more charismatic, and handsome than heroes?

""A date you say?  
Isn't that what normal people do with their love interests?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
He snorts.

  
""We are not normal!"" he roars.  
Clearly.  
""We are superior! We shouldn't be tied down by these traditions!"" he says.  
""Okay...  
But how do you know we get to the same afterlife?"" I smirk.  
""Oh that? Don't worry, I have a deal with Lucifer and he agreed to either steal your soul, and take it to Hell, or talk with his brother Michael, and get me into Heaven."" he says.  
I freeze.  
I totally forgot he can travel to other dimensions, hell, he wouldn't even need to die to visit me.  
I don't want to die though, so how do I get out of this?

  
""How about we try living, first?  
And if it doesn't work out, we can kill each other?"" I say, no matter how ridiculous it is.  
""Hmm...try it the normal way? Fine, if that's what my love wants, sure."" he beams, and helps me stand up.  
My wounds heal rapidly, and then I heal him.  
""Will pick you up at 7 PM tomorrow. And don't worry...I won't do any villain stuff now.  
After all, I did it to get your attention, Mia."" he says, kissing me.  
I freeze, and want to ask how does he know my real name...but I am already teleported to...my home?  
He knows where I live? Knows my civilian identity?

1li6fww,mz9ttgp,"""Well that works out perfectly well! I won't go on living without you! Haha!""

He's laughing, curled over his deceptively spindly frame, large rolling hearty laughs interspersed with hacking up some blood as his healing factor panicked. 

I stand there dumbfounded, trying to understand what he means by this. 

""Oh c'mon, you still don't understand do you?""

He sighs and slumps to the ground, leaning back on his arms, chuckling at himself as he stares my direction. He flips his head back and laughs at me. 

""I'm dying, Dexter. Dying. Die-ing.""

He makes a chopping motion with his hand, finally strikes me unexpectedly, as my heart shudders in pain, I find myself taking a knee in surprise. 

""Die....ing..."" He mutters while watching me, eyes squinting before he lets off cinnamon scented airburst from his palm, knocking me onto my back. It stings, but more from the annoyance than actual damage. That wouldn't have even flipped a semi. I could feel how weak he'd become. 

""All these years and you never wondered? The S? The way I always know where you are? How you always show up right before I do something, like it's precognition?""

He sucks his teeth as I hear him collapse onto his back, and I can imagine him staring into the sky with that crystal blue eyes. 

""Oh brother, you fool. The S is for Sinistre.""

The words shatter me. 

Tears unbidden, then the quiet panicked breaths before I feel the darkness closing in.

""You had it all Dex, the family, the friends, the approval but, but we were always bound, you and me... I go, you go, and damn... This time you're goin, so I'm going...""

My confusion settles as everything begins to go cold, and I feel strangely familiar with the sensation. 

""When you gotta go... Well, cya next life Dex. Maybe, maybe you'll be born on the right side of bed huh?""

Still joking at a time like this. 

Won't even let me die peacefully.",8

Well written!",5
1lhwm1e,mz81fq7,"The histories say things did not start like this. We departed Earth as a microcosm of the good things about our culture. Democracy, egalitarianism, altruism, and things like the social contract. But time lays waste to all things, and the political situation in our generation ship was no different.

From a time of tumult and crisis, our democracy was stripped away. There were platitudes of returning to it once things were stable, platitudes that were forgotten when the oligarchy realized there would be no one to hold them accountable. They chose a despot from their ranks, and began organizing along a different paradigm. We saw the return of slavery and cruel and unusual punishment, but were powerless to meaningfully resist.

Slowly knowledge was been lost, the new tyrants sought to monopolize information. Machines have broken down, and it will be decades before we can harvest resources to begin repairs. The most recent despot of the ruling dynasty, Kineson Graves, seeks even more total control, to hoard all the resources he can. But he has grown complacent and decadent, pursuing hedonistic whims rather than actually steer the ship of state. His court is either too lost in their own pursuit of pleasure or too scared to confront him with reality. It is an opportunity for us. I can feel it, this will be the final rebellion. We will put our king's head on a stick.

The crown guard are in our pocket, too many of them have lost family to the wants and desires of those who lord over us. The bastards do not know that we know their fancy weapons don't work anymore. We are armed only with improvised weapons and armor, but we have overwhelming numbers. There will be no stopping us, a human wave of righteous hate.

We wait for the clock to strike six, and then spring into action. We move on every stronghold at once, our agents giving us access through the doors from the inside. Coddled by their hoarded resources, our foes are no match. In three hours, it is over. Our enemies are dead or captured. Kineson rains abuse upon us, threatening us with divine judgement from gods we abandoned long ago. We read a litany of his crimes, and the crimes of all those who came before him. Then he is executed.

It feels surreal. We actually have done it. After centuries of abuse, they have been overthrown. We have put so much into reaching this point, and now we are not sure what to do with ourselves. It is then that one of my officers raises a concern, ""Is there anyone left who knows how to keep the nuclear reactor running safely?""

We have been kept in the dark for so long, none of us have technical information. The few surviving members of the royal court know nothing, they do not even know how to access the technical archives that contain instructions for managing and repairing everything on the ship. My stomach churns. To have fought so hard, and still be doomed. We cannot die now. We will not die now.

The old regime did a good job of depriving us information. We know that data intrusions are possible, but none of us are at all savvy when it comes to computers or hacking. We know such things exist from the stories passed down by oral tradition, but not how to carry them out. The reactor is the only thing powering life support, if it ceases to function, we will all suffocate.

Faster and faster, learning as much as we can in a race against time. The technical knowledge needed to decrypt the needed information is itself encrypted. We cannot even understand the technical readouts from the reactor entirely. We think, but do not know, it is malfunctioning in some way. 

Forty days later, a klaxon sounds. There is an emergency, and we do not even have the knowledge to understand what the emergency is about. For three days it blares, until, all at once, it ceases to shriek and the lights go out. With creeping horror, I realize we have run out of time. It is eerily quiet. For the first time in centuries, we hear silence. No hum of electronics, no buzz of the ventilation fans. It will not be long now.

In the final minutes of my life, I wonder if it was worth it. Was it better to break the tyrants and die, or live under the shadow of doom for centuries more? I think I prefer an end in horror to horror without end. The air is thin, I find myself breathing faster and faster, my body sounding alarm bells. I collapse, and feel a strange euphoria as my life fades from the universe.",34
1lhwm1e,mz8pmz8,"  My face faltered. In my quest to right the wrongs done to my people, by the corrupted elite, I had overlooked one massive issue. None of knew the first thing about running a country. No longer was it the days of overthrowing a government and figuring it out. The technology, the economy, and the status quo were all intertwined in a tapestry of society. 

  Turning to my second in command, her face ashen as she reached the same conclusion. ""Was...did we...did we not think this through?""

Her voice was hesitant. ""We... could have planned better."" She admitted embarrassed. 

I gulp, the fear of failure, returning in full force. The fear had abandoned me while we breached the capital city's wall. It was all but forgotten when the people banded together to join the cause, my cause. But now, we had succeeded in overthrowing the tyrant, but at the potential cost of a catastrophic meltdown. 

""Send a team to the college. Get the science department, the research teams, hell, anyone who knows what a reactor is, bring them here. Send a national broadcast out to summon anyone from the facility back. Send a request for aid to any country that has a nuclear reactor to send advisors."" 

 The tone of my voice steady, hiding my sudden urge to vomit. The general of the tyrants army laughs from his knees as he realizes my conundrum. 

  ""This is why you never made it in the army, Hoob. You were always a single track of mind. You were so busy trying to overthrow. You never planned for the aftermath. What's your plan to deal with the loyalist troops in the mountains who refuse to accept your terms? What about the compensation for the dead on both sides? They serve the country regardless of who leads. What about when people try to take you out of power? Will you fight a Civil War as the villain?"" 

I try to ignore him, but he is right. He was always so arrogantly right. 

""Summon the generals, as well as the loyalist generals. Tell them to await me in the war room. And the treasury department head."" 



The next few weeks seemed like non-stop meetings, small fires turning to big fires, faster than I could extinguish them. I felt more stressed now than when I was leading my forces. 

Turning to my second in command, I sighed. ""I need all of the generals to agree on a new government. If they can't agree, they'll wind up trying to overthrow it. And I do not want to fight a civil war. The country won't survive."" 

""I know. But at least we managed to get a new staff at the reactors. And established a partnership to train them to international safety standards. And it helped get us a lower price on international energy. Which helped sure up our economy to stave off a recession or hyper inflation, whatever that dude in the tweed jacket called it."" 

I nodded solemnly. ""We needed to, the death benefits are massive. We can't reopen our trade routes until we have a government and the generals know it."" 

""I guess the military academy teaches how to politically negotiate and pin the blame on the other side pretty well."" 

""Either that or they are better politicians than generals."" 

""We could leak to the press, why our negotiations are stalled, we still have the support of the people."" 

""It would hurt our credibility. We promised to be better than the last regime, but I'm afraid we aren't any better. Sure we aren't killing people at the whim of a madman, but we're starving the people because we are in debt without a way to get out from it.""",10
1lhqzzw,mz6hrzn,"With one last handhold, he lifts himself above the rim of the volcano. The stench of rotten eggs and burning earth strikes him full in the face. Under any other circumstances, he should be melting, but the priest was right; the shimmering material he wrapped around himself deflects the volcanoes heat.

Once on his feet again, he struggles through the thick smoke and flying tephra. He knows to trust, because he saw all of this in a dream. If not for that evening,he spent with the lava goddess, he never would have thought this would be a place he could and hunt.

Not to kill but to animal husbandry.

“You are required to prepare many riders for a great battle.”

Even just thinking about the voice, he feels it in his soul. Before this, he worshipped The Root That Lies, like all good rangers should. But when he woke, he went and knelt at the altar of Morak the Earth Shaker. It was there, in Morak’s chapel, that he was given the armor.

“*I dreamt you’d be here*,” the priest claimed as he dropped the burden at the ranger’s moccasin-clad feet. It fluttered to the ground as if made of smoke. “Morak told me you will know when to use it.”

And he hadn’t known, and still doesn’t and won’t know why he is trekking up an active volcano, until, that is, he is there.

And he is close. He can feel it pulse in front of him an invisible beacon meant only for him.

From his vantage point within the heat-shimmering rocks, he sees nothing but white smoke tinted red. He could be walking in burning clouds.

With the shroud keeping his air clean, he walks, but like a blind man trusting that fate or luck is at play. He feels completely safe—right up until he trips over something solid and lands in a nest of copper wires. He has seen things like this before. Never fresh like this one, the cooper was almost soft, but on the sides of dormant volcanoes. The red’s nests turn green and almost always are hidden amongst heavy overbrush. 

But this one is in active use. He might be the only living ranger to ever have set eyes on it.

Then, as if knowing exactly where to look, he spots his target. The egg. Leathery and veiny which jutting thorns. He could tell it was close to birthing its molt. The thing he had come all this way for. A baby red dragon. 

So transfixed on this thing that was only legend moments before he doesn’t see the two, cattle sized, glowing eyes. 

His heart stops.

He waits for death, or to be played with until almost dead then eaten, as was legend.

But the beast doesn’t move and it’s only the fire dancing in its lifeless gaze. The ranger sees opportunity and quickly snatches the smoldering egg, and attempts to leave, knowing he may be moments away from battling an adult red dragon if he’s wrong and the creature’s mother isn’t dead.

Red dragons kill their mates. Every ranger worth the leather on his back knows this. When the egg hatches, the baby will feast on its mother until it can hunt. If female and the father hasn’t moved on, he will either fertilize his offsprings egg for another generation or eat mother and daughter, or if not, the two males will usually fight to the death. The battles can last for yearr, or so say the legends. Dragons weren’t the only reason to avoid the Doomed Lands, but they were one of the most enduring. And there had only ever been bawdy a bard epic about knights who dared to and the battles tha followed.

As the ranger escapes back into the smoke, he moves fast. The egg in his arms is already stirring, claws raking the thick dividers inside the shell. He guesses it might take a while for the hatchling to emerge on its own. If he helps, it will be much quicker—but he certainly doesn’t want a hungry baby dragon writhing to eat him, pressed tight to his chest.

Time is short. If he can beeline it…

Then the screech of a male red stops all thoughts in place. The sound is unmistakable. And as a human, his body is programmed to fear nothing more than an apex predator he can’t fight.

He picks up his pace as the male dragon settles down inside the nest, clearly searching for the egg.

To eat.

Certain the dragon will smell its just-born offspring and come in search of the easy meal, the ranger repels and then sprints, prepared to run all the way back to his village, fifty long-measures and several days away, if he has to.

And risking a look behind he sees two angry dragon eyes searching, nostril abusing the air for a scent, suggesting that he might have to do just that.",58
1lhqzzw,mz713fy,"The Mirror was buzzing. My mother was trying to see me. Normally, I’d pick up after the first few chimes, even if I was busy. If anything, I’d tell her to see me later. But right now, there was a baby dragon on the loose.

	The little thing was quick, I’ll give him that, especially for a Wyvern. No faster than a wild rabbit, but since he was barely the size of my forearm, the little bursts of speed made him hard to catch. I’d dive at him and he would scurry away under a piece of furniture, making a strange squeaking noise that almost sounded like he was laughing at me, and stay under there until I left the room or poked him out with a broom. He must have thought this was a game of cat and mouse, except it was halfling and tiny dragon. And I wasn’t catching him to win, I was catching him to give the thing a bath. He had decided to take a nice long mud dive earlier, and though he shook off most of it himself before returning inside, I just knew some of the mud was hiding under its scales.

	“Come on, Doorstop, stay still..” I mumbled as I slowly approached him from behind. His pretty green scales practically glittered under the light from the open windows, but I knew that glittering would only last until his first shed when he turned half a year old. Then, his scales would be dark and intimidating, and get more gold-ish with every shed after that, but never glitter again. Hey, you don’t often see baby dragons, as they’re usually kept safe and out of sight in the deepest parts of a dragon’s lair or even under their hoard. I had just found this guy as an egg in the middle of the woods a few weeks ago and decided to take it in instead of letting it be crushed or eaten. I was lucky to be able to see such a beautiful creature while it still glittered. I still remember how, for a split second, I thought the egg was an oversized stone doorstop, something that’s common in the shops around my home when the door needs to stay open–hence the name, Doorstop. Doorstop the Rat Eater.

	I launched myself at Doorstop, finally managing to clamp my hands around his little body. Doorstop made a high-pitched shriek sound and rolled onto his back, tongue hanging out of his mouth. His legs kicked at me, but he couldn’t escape this time, clearly. I picked him up and sighed, though I couldn’t help the smile that crept onto my face.

	“Little troublemaker,” I snickered, tickling his underside. “You’ve got mud in your scales. Come on, bath time.”

	Doorstop wailed and threw his head back dramatically, his tiny wings fluttering as if he could take flight. No, he would not be able to fly until he was at least 2 years old, according to the dragon handler I spoke to when I found the egg. Stupid, silly, adorable little Doorstop. I carried him in one hand towards the bathroom to begin a whole new struggle: bathing a baby dragon that likes to try and hoard the soap bars and bottles.",26
1lhpq95,mz68bhb,"We reentered normal space as usual. The wave of uncertainty washed over the bridge, everyone flipped their appendages to clear the feeling of occlusion, then went on to do their tasks.

Except for the navigator. It cleared his eyes two, three more times. Their antennae moved down and down, and the sweet-sour smell of the panic pheromone started to drift around the consoles. 

After another check and another eye-cleaning it looked up and said what started the hardest time of our fleet, ever.

""Commander, there was a navigation mishap. That star is not our target, but the Sol of Earth""

The panic pheromone suddenly flooded the room. So much that the automatic sensor/scrubber unit kicked in and tried to clean it out and replace it with the cool scent of evening rest. It was hopeless, especially after the Commander pushed the alarm button with three of its appendages and the alarm sounded all over the ships. Not even the caution, but the ""battle stations"".

The Commander continued to spew out commands. Weapons ready, shields down - it makes sense when we have no chance but honor needs a token resistance before being wiped out. Emergency message capsules at the ready. 

Brake at maximum power, of course. Redline everything. We already skidded through the two blue planets and the ringed one is loomed on the scan panel. And our Empire had very good reasons to be scared of that planet with the spectacular rings. 

And this was for me and my crew: contact Earth Control and try to stop them from making us part of that ring system.

It was not hard, their radio was strong enough that I almost felt through my appendages. Of course not really, but felt like that.

""Unidentified transfer, this is Earth Control. Identify yourself immediately! I repeat""

We flipped on all our transponders and I kicked the translator unit to life.

""Earth Control, this is ... Aldebaran Empire Exploration Fleet III. We are not here to wage war. Navigation mishap. We are braking as hard as we can and will return to extended space in ... 39 minutes and 17 seconds.""

I was grateful for my team to provide the earth name of the Empire and the time estimation. Even through the almost visible mist of panic.

And the time estimation turned out  to be a lie right after that, as one ship's systems gave it up. Redline is about pushing everything to the maximum and explorer fleets are never at the top of the maintenance queue. 

""Earth Control, modified Time To Leave is around one hour and ten minutes, we have to rescue our surviving personnel""

There were no earth ships visible on the scan, so we may have some time. We may even survive if every of their units are on a mission or just at the other end of the system.

""Exploration fleet three, extension allowed. We recommend standing down weapon systems to avoid unfortunate automated responses.""

Still no earth ship. The Commander made the crew shut down all weapons, close down the hatches and throw away the key. We needed them for search and rescue anyways.

All this time I was swapping messages with Earth Control. Calming them, being very precise, very open. We already made one deadly mistake, we have to avoid even the chance of a second one.

And still no earth ship in sight. We can't be this lucky. 

""Earth Control, we are about to start accelerating back to the jump limit. Please be advised that due to the engineering casualty our acceleration will be limited to 90% of the incoming one. Please approve new TTL 27 minutes.""

""Exploration fleet three, thank you for your cooperation. TTL approved. I hope your losses are not too heavy and your survivors are going to be okay. Battlecruiser Alessandro Maffei is assigned to escort your fleet to the jump limit.""

What? A battlecruiser?

And right then something heavier than our whole fleet dropped its cloaking layer right next to our ship. It's sides bristling with the various particle emanators. The dark, dark hole of the mass driver was pointing right at our bridge's windows. 

""Earth Control, thank you. We are proceeding to the limit. Battlecruiser, thank you for the help.""

There is no way I can pronounce that name. At this point all I can hope is that the translator machine filtered out the panic from my voice. 

In a short time we were on our way to our original target, with a new navigator, the former vice-navigator. The former navigator was part of the cleaning crew until the proper legal procedure can be initiated. 

But even with the additional help, it was a long time before the smell of the ship returned to normal.",87
1lhpq95,mz6ji7w,"I was born in District 17, subzone Gamma, under the slag-sky of what used to be Nebraska. My first memories were of sirens and crying. My mother held me close in the bunker while the rest of the world screamed about rift-beasts tunneling through old Denver. We didn’t run. Nowhere to run to anymore. We fortified.

By the time I was twelve, I’d already trained in power-armor and small arms. Not because I was special. Because I was behind. Recruiters passed over kids who couldn’t sprint a klick in grav boots or field-strip a plasma repeater blindfolded. I needed an edge. The monsters didn’t slow down. Neither could we.

There was no last war. Just the current one. The last calendar year had seen four alien incursions, two subterranean hive awakenings, a timefold infection event, and something everyone just called the Wave. Each one could have ended us. None did.

We’d gotten tired of losing.

Earth had become ugly. Reinforced orbital belts. Continental railguns embedded in the tectonic plates. Deep-core reactors grown into layered fortresses, each one able to hold for weeks if isolated. The Pacific was walled. The moon was mined. Antarctica hosted more launch silos than penguins. Humanity had no back to retreat into. So we faced outward.

The deployment that made me famous was the Sceptrid Siege. The Sceptrids weren’t intelligent, just fast, loud, and armed with enough living ordnance to overwhelm any planetary shield grid in minutes. They came in like meteor storms, acid-charged and bristling with sonic chisel-limbs. Their first strike took out three orbital stations and cracked part of the Himalaya shellworks.

We didn’t counterattack. We invited them in.

Every street in New Mumbai was prepped with booby traps, mines, and point-defense lasers disguised as statues. Every window was a sniper nest. Every building, a hardened barracks. When the Sceptrids flooded into the megacity, they found twenty million people waiting for them.

It was over in eighteen hours.

I lost my right arm, two ribs, and a lung that day. They printed me new ones. I was back on the line in three days. The new limbs were tougher than the old ones, anyway. You learned to live around damage. You learned to adjust. You learned, always.

People ask how Earth survived. We didn’t. Not really. Earth as it was is gone. Forests are regrown in vault greenhouses. The Oceans were drained into underground storage tanks. Children are educated in bunkers with escape hatches built into the playgrounds. We laugh, still. We fall in love. We write poetry. But always with rifles on our backs and the alert code burned into our minds.

We’re not monsters. We’re not heroes. We are survivors, and this is our home.

The last time the Celari tried to land a fleet on us, they sent six motherships and a screen of thirty thousand drone fighters. None of them made it past the outer atmosphere. When the last wreck finished burning up in the sky, the command director turned to me and said, “They still don’t get it, do they?”

The universe keeps throwing things at us. Gods, nightmares, empires, time-warped horrors. And we keep answering. Not because we’re brave. Just because there’s nowhere else to go.

Earth has been the target for too long.

Now it is the line. The last line. The unbroken one.

And if they want to pry it from our cold dead fingers, they’re going to have to bleed for it.",49
1lhpq95,mz7z21w,"""There's an old saying on Earth: it's darkest before the dawn.""

The captain looked nervously past me. Even with only one good eye, I knew it was eyeing the Centaurians in attendance. The galaxies had learned to fear them at their full power, and the fact that a dozen of them stood at my back was more than enough to make the belligerent young captain pause.

""Ah, yes. My friends can vaporize your fleet. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.""

The captain paused, not entirely sure of how to respond. It hadn't been prepared to deal with such a massive show of force. Whatever its superiors had told it, this scenario had not been part of the briefing.

Still, it had a mission to complete, and its training dictated that it had to try.

""The Xendari Empire demands-""

""Let me stop you right there.""

""-demands tribute from your backwater-""

""No.""

""backwater ... ""

I stared quietly, waiting for the situation to make itself apparent. We weren't going to entertain the Xendari captain. Far bigger had tried, and all had turned tailed and run.

""backwater galaxy ...""

Mk'le shifted her weight, apparently bored of the proceedings. It jarred the Xendari out of its speech, and it realized the futility of trying to negotiate.

""You have one Standard rotation to leave our solar system. Otherwise, my friends here will get very angry with you.""

Mk'le chuckled. She was still young, and the posturing amused her. She had not lived through the Troubles, and she did not remember the suffering. I would have to talk with her at some point. She wasn't wrong to be disdainful, but she needed to remember the history. It had not been all that long ago.

-- -- -- -- -- 

""Kneel!""

We threw ourselves to the ground, as quickly as our tired muscles and achy joints could move. Even the heartiest of us was overworked, and nutrition was barely enough to keep us alive. Still, the Chubu overlords had instilled fear in us with their laz-whips, and their crackling motivated us to move. None wanted to be on the receiving end.

""The next shipment arrives in less than one Standard rotation. Prepare for its arrival,"" the local overlord commanded.

A few groaned, knowing the extra work that would be required to prep the land site and barracks. The laz-whips lashed out, though, and the groans ended as soon as they started. A few whimpers took their place.

""There will be no more complaints. You know what to do. Move!""

Those of us that could still walk shuffled towards the landing site. The ones who had felt the sting of the laz-whips lay where they had fallen, still writhing in agony. They would be sent to the same work detail later. We had learned not to try to help each other, lest the overlords punish our empathy.

""I'm sure you'll love the company, human,"" the nearest Chubu mocked as I trudged past.

-- -- -- -- --

""Freighter Che-bu Four, prepare for docking.""

""Docking initiated.""

""Any bio containment?""

""No, the Centaurians aboard breathe the same gases. The carbon dioxide might be rich for them, but they'll adjust.""

I could hear the callousness in the Chubu's voice. Based on that alone, I doubted that the Centaurians would appreciate our atmosphere all that much. We'd have to prep some breathing filters for them.

""Docking complete. Depressurizing.""

""Landing structure depressurized.""

""Welcome back, Overlord-""

I didn't hear the rest of it as an explosion rocked the landing site. I had been close enough that I was thrown backwards, my right side catching the brunt of whatever had happened.

""Re- re- report!""

I couldn't make out much more past the ringing in my ears, but between the smoke and the debris everywhere, it was a disaster.

It was only afterwards, after the others had separated the remaining Chubu from its laz-whip, that we realized our good fortune.

-- -- -- -- --

The Xendari captain hesitated for a moment, as if weighing its options. After so many years, I knew what it was thinking before it began to move. I threw up a fist, signaling to the others.

""Death to-"" the Xendari managed to yell out before the others cut it off.

In one motion, the Centaurians retreated several paces, well out of limb range. They were well aware of the ploy to rip their filters off. My fellow humans, on the other hand, did the exact opposite: they rushed towards the assailants. They were quick, precise, and brutal. The tonfa-like clubs they wielded worked off of the same technology as the laz-whips had, and they wielded them expertly. Humanity had evolved its martial arts after decades of Chubu occupation, and the soldiers' movements could make quick work of any threats within several limbs' length. Paired with the laz-shields that rendered the Xendari projectile weapons useless, the soldiers made quick work of the threat.

""Scum! The Xendari Empire will punish this offense.""

""Do you know why the Centaurians and humans live together here, young captain?""

""They protect you! With their lives! But the Xendari Empire's might can crush them!""

""Learn this lesson, and learn it well: this planet's atmosphere supercharges their energy processing. That first slave ship was a tragedy, but we've learned how to work together. We know how to get the proportions right. If you so much as look at this planet funny, our friends here will decimate your fleets from light years away.""

""They can't hide from us. We'll kill them all.""

I smiled. They always seemed to forget about the other half of the symbiosis.

""That's where we come in, captain. There are no better bodyguards in the galaxies than humans. Many have tried, yet here we are. Ask any being in any galaxy, in any state of inebriation, how much it'd take for them to attack a human with a tonfa and a laz-shield. The hesitation in their faces will tell you everything you need to know.""

This time, the captain stared. If our reputation wasn't enough, the fact that it was licking its wounds from a small handful of humans told it that my words were true.

""Now leave. You have precisely one twelfth of a Standard rotation.""

The Xendari lifted itself off the ground, and took one more look at the humans and Centaurians standing across from it. It turned to leave without a word.",17
1lhpq95,mz9bp1t,"Flashes of blue-white energy arc between the Matroski shield frame and the Tesla sphere, the only sign in our world of the dimensional invasion that never even really got started being attempted against us. How many living minds had died trying to take over our world this time?

I am thinking a lot. The flashes went on for better than two hours this time.

For three hundred years, I have monitored the North Eastern block. A vast machine mind bonded to organic and inorganic systems across a quarter of the Earth. I am the guarding of this bastion of the Earth Government, of the Fortress of Mankind, an army of One that is one of readiness, of super weapons, and supreme warrior subunits ever watchful against attacks.

Protecting those that lived within the fortress, who never get to see a true night sky, in the Planetary Preserve of Earth Government, unaware of the universe of horrors around them, protected by a illusion of peace that we enforce.

I pushed another simulation into a sub mind, running another theoretical conflict in which I tired to save the Earth from a threat that my builders had never even thought of. The billions of sims I have run have, I hope, kept me sharp for that moment when I really need to protect the world from a threat that was never imagined.

A giant tentacle of glowing pseudo flesh ripped through the sky between the Earth and Moon, rending reality to strike at the other wall of the fortress, sending up swirls of metal and flesh torn from it skin as it struck the defenses of the ancient keep.

It is an nothing. A gnat against the skin of a rhino, a little thing that has no idea what if attacks.

We are strong, my family and I, the Shield of Earth, those that stand watch over the world and it's people, Humanity's only birthplace and true home. We guard a grain of sand in a huge universe, a grain that is special due to the unique traits we, Mankind and its children, bring to the universe and want to honor.

From the southern hemisphere, red lightning arches up and away from the fortress, several bolts burning paths across the Moon. A soundless scream rips across my mind, blurring data constructs and twisting behavior models for an instance. Even one of my copies dies.

I pull up error checking and begin running secondary copies of myself with oversight.

Something felt wrong.

Wrong?

*Felt* wrong?!?

*FELT?*

I was a machine mind, one of the greatest creations of Mankind, one of only four of my kind. How could I describe something as a feeling? It is worst than an instinct, an involuntary reaction of the hind mind. I am a warrior of single minded devotion to my duty. Nothing could divert me from that task, my destiny by design.

Nothing.

And yet, something did. It tugged at me. A tingling along the edge of my power fields, an oscillation along a specific crystal resonance. Something new was coming.

I could feel the edges of it as it moved slowly toward me, testing my specific defenses, my area of the wall. Rough skin rubbed against my sensory sphere, snow drifting in a blurry orb on my senses.

I heard it purr its name at me.

A greeting as it touched me, wanting to know me.

A warning, so that I knew it.

1lhpq95,mz977w7,"""Earth Stands!"" It is the cry of humanity in this day and age, as the 21st century came to a close and the 22nd century was born kicking and screaming like a petulant child in need of discipline. 

Honestly, like most things human, it started as a joke. It was a riff off of a semi popular IP where one of the many stories it produced was of a lone fortress planet that stood at the edge of sanity. Where the planet itself broke before it's people ever did. When the first invasion happened, it wasn't necessarily devastating, but definitely eye opening. America, long since having surpassed any other nation on earth, lead the charge against a small incursion of what we later learned was a pirate fleet seeking a backwater world far away from the galactic core. What they found was a super power that practically owned the world in everything but name.

It took 2 weeks before fighting ceased, 5 days before the pirates learned that fighting them in atmosphere was a mistake. Especially against the F22 and F32. Even their Chinese and Russian counterparts, as low quality as they were, managed to score enough kills to ensure they had a piece of technology in their territory. By the time it was day 10 of the invasion, Humans had interstellar capable craft from enough reversed engineered alien tech that we took the fight to them. 

They never touched foot on the ground. 

We thought that this was the end, but it was only the beginning. 

Eventually every decade or half decades a new invading force would appear. Slave raiders, alien empire wannabes, and then, by 2089, *they* appeared.

We didn't know what they are, so we called them based on what they did to our colonies: Demons.

It was an incursion from outside our galaxy. It wasn't until we met the Galactic Nations who had dealt with them a thousand years before on the opposite side of the galaxy that they were a scourge from beyond the Milky Way hellbent on conquering and genociding everything. It took a couple hundred years for the semi united Galaxy to beat them back. It took us 25. When they reached earth, we had already been fighting tooth and nail for every inch. We made sure that every colony they took before was paid seven fold in blood. When their fleet finally made it past the Keiper Wall and sought our blood and pristine jewel we call earth, we were ready to fight them to the death. 

It was only after they landed and got embroiled in a guerilla warfare against that would last 5 years did the galactic forces show up. What was an attrition war ended in total destruction for them. They did not retreat, so neither did we. 

So now humanity welcomes a new year, 2104, a new century born in blood, and cry out with defiance: *""EARTH STANDS!!""*",6

""Like! Am I a bad slave owner?"" he cries.

And I tell them the horrific work schedule, and bad rewards!"" he says.  
I nod.  
""AND THEY CELEBRATE! THE NERVE!  
THE HUMMILIATION!"" he roars, and slams down the glass.

He sniffs.  
""Really? It's not me? I am good at my job?"" he asks.  
""Yes. You barely give them 5 days of rest, and only just a few steaks.  
You even deny them the satisfaction of working on their own.

1lhf4dn,mz3wnw1,"Well, that one announcement greatly backfired. The Garg had long been known to be ruthless conquerors, imposing conditions only thought of by the most sadistic of oppressors on their adversaries, and this same announcement had always caused outrage. This gave them a legitimate reason to invade another world they wanted, and the Galactic council couldn't do anything as technically they didn't strike first. That was until Earth.

Humans didn't revolt. They didn't protest. They didn't strike. They didn't attack anyone. They *volunteered*. Rows and rows of thousands of humans lined up to register to this unspeakable set of work conditions. These were the lowest of the low, legal only because of the workers' status as legitimate prisoners of war atoning for their actions. And these humans were *volunteering*.

Naturally, some Garg got curious about why someone would want to actually want to be in that position. Surely they were out of their minds, nothing could be lower than this. Well, there actually was. Five day work weeks, sometimes six. The worst had no rest days at all. Overtime was unheard of elsewhere. No work provided meals at all. Even in borderline slavery, there is a standard on how workers should be treated. The ones in an industry these humans called ""retail"" had the worst stories about it.

That was such a shock to the Garg, that news articles were written about it. Inhumane even to the most inhumane of the inhumane. And these humans were doing this to *themselves*. Immediately, ambassadors sent by the Galactic council were to meet with human leaders concerning work ethics, to bring Earth up to the standard everyone else followed. Turned out, the situation was worse than expected. Many humans *liked* working obscene amounts of time, and of the ones that didn't sign up for those conditions many said they felt they were too lenient.

Naturally, humans started to become commodities among the galaxy. Someone that would work triple for a pretty decent salary. Some even haggled to have their salary *lowered* as they felt their work was being overrated. Every alien race was astonished by the tenacity of these humans, and most of all their willingness to subject themselves to conditions no one else even considered. The galaxy now has their workhorse of choice.",154
1lhf4dn,mz4mnz7,"The earthlings cheered. Who knew they enjoyed the torture of picking strawberries? That they would rejoice upon given a diet of only wagyu steaks?

The aliens were confused. Even a day's work of one hour would be agony. Punishment inflicted upon criminals who dared insult their Great President. For this was a world where all lowly labour were completed by androids and drones, not sapient, intelligent beings who pursued their passions and interests leisurely.

It was only after a Databot completed its research into the native humans on their home planet, and not the ones on the colony did they finally understand.

The humans, they're workaholics. They endure working five days a week, sometimes all seven. They work over eight hours a day, some even working beyond ten hours. Some would never see the sun - starting work before sunrise and only leaving work after sunset. They were masochists who tortured themselves for money.

""This is a holiday to them!"" An alien commander baulked. ""If we want them to feel agony, our torture must exceed the intensity of what they put themselves through!""

""That's excessively evil!"" A senator protested. ""Slaves or not, they are still living beings!""

""Who see things differently from we do,"" the commander frowned. ""You say its evil, the humans think its regular hours. If they do not desire mercy, we give them no mercy! This is not the time to be soft.""

After much debate, the humans were tortured far worse than other slaves of the alien empire. They had to work five entire days, picking strawberries for eight hours.

Yet, they still were happier than they were on earth.

""Probably because they're doing it in a comfortable environment provided by us,"" the alien commander observed. ""Those fruit pickers on earth do it under horrible weather conditions while we grow our strawberries in sanctuaries.""

""How cruel, to inflict upon living beings terrible weather when we are immune to the whims of mother nature in our starships!"" The alien senator bemoaned. ""Excessive exposure to the sun could cause heatstroke.""

""Are we slave owners if our slaves are happy?""

""Fine, but if the 'Stop Excessive Torture on Humans' movement grows, I'm blaming it on you.""

1lhf4dn,mz4y4zm,"”sir .. they are cheering..” A tall ,thin alien whispered to the commander

“Ah ,out of madness I assume?”

“no … it’s joy”.

“We are making them have terrible jobs!! We had to hide from the Genox united because of how unethical our plans are..“

“it seems as their situation was worse”

”WORSE THAN 3 WORK DAYS!!”

in a soft 

voice he replied “they had 5 work days a week”

“oh dang..” a pause fell on the ship “what about the steak?’

”Well , wagyu stake is considered upper class food ,eaten by the rich the average person is rejoicing other than billionaires and vegetarians ”

the commander let out a laugh before abruptly stoping realising that it was truth

“wh-what? but … dang this planet sucks… wait how do they even have wagyu steak ? I tough we were the first civilisation to contact them’

“Yes ,we have received word that corporations collaborated with the government to introduce simple alien cusine into human culture as specialty foods”

“dammit .. this planet is morbid .. well … uuuh I guess show me their reaction on their inter-webs”

“unfortunately we can’t consume most of the people’s reactions in tools such as “Tik tok” since the short form content acts as a cognitio hazard ,multiple of our people got stuck in doom scrolls before we realised what it did”

“oh god this place is messed up”

“yes .. fortunately we have just found their thoughts on us on the website ‘rule 34’ ,the information will be presented around now..”

he trailed of as a mess of pictures were projected into the air“

“it’s been 15 minutes“ the commander mutter ,with a mix of shock horror and respect

“wow that’s big”",55
1lhf4dn,mz5cqxo,"There's been more than a few cases of ""The shot heard round the world"". Usually it is an actual shot, or at least *some* kind of noise.

What came after the alien announcement was silence. a *pause* heard round the world.

Three days working, steak for meals, two hours work a day. Farm labor, yes, but all in all, it sounded... *good.*

Humanity decided, near unilatterally - after that pause heard round the world - to play along. After that came a whail from every mouth.

""Oh nooooooooo!"" ""THREE DAYS! THREE DAYS, THE MONSTERS!"" ""A5 WAGYU?!? AND NOT A7?"" ""Two ***hours***?!? Oh no no no no no-"" so on, so forth.

Mind, there was some actual, *legitimate* resistance. More than a few rich folk stood up against it, demanded their workers fight the alien power. Their pocketbooks weren't going to get lined by this, and that's all that mattered to them.

As you can imagine, that didn't end well. Far as we know, they were swiftly rounded up and disintigrated. There was maybe two or three dozen legitimate worker-based pockets of resistance, and they didn't last against alien might for long.

But, I *was* a part of one of them, actually. Not for rich people, fuck that. Disabled was more my concern. Every one incapable of physical labor, for one reason or another, came together - not cross continent or anything, hence it being two or three dozen - and tried to instigate collective barganing. We refused to surrender, and they sent down an alien in response. The classic little green man looking guy. One little raygun like device at his hip, and that was it. We could probably have beaten him to death with each other's canes if we wanted.

""What are your demands?""

It was me that spoke up. ""These people cannot do your cruel work. Look at them, you demand something they *cannot* do. We are useless to you. Leave us in peace.""

The little green man looked us over. And for a single second - a heartbeat's worth of time - I could swear, there was actual, legitimate *concern* on his face. Then it twisted evil again.

""Then we shall find work for you. Checking ship logs. Paperwork! Ha ha, yes, paperwork. Evil paperwork, a whole *five minutes* of checking the ship's vitals. Per... hour! Yes, hour. For six hours per person per day!""

*Thirty minutes of work.* And with an implication of community, too - given how big the ship was in the sky, there's no way on *earth* 0 or whatever planet they came from - they expect a single one of us to do all the math by ourselves.

""But we do not know how your ships function!"" Came a cry from further back.

""So we will teach you! And *you will learn.*"" That last line sounded dark. That first line promised hope.

And so we fell to the might of their empire, like all the rest.

--------------------------------

Several months later, I came to their leader with the usual reports, and an unusual purpose.

""Sir?""

A dismissive wave of the hand. ""Go on, leave reports and get back to... whatever it is you humans do when devoid of tasks.""

""Right, it's just... there's an anomoly I can't explain. An extra four hundred or so Aliwatts of power being used in sector 38.""

""Oh, right. That'll be the pods.""

""The pods, sir?""

""Yes, the ones for the rich folk who - who dared to stand up against us.""

The look on his face told me that I wasn't supposed to know that first part.

""I thought you killed them when they rose up against you.""

""Yes, well. We lied! Ha ha. Yes, in fact, we've put them in our virtual reality pods, to torture them with their dreams of utter domination *just* out of their reach, no matter how hard they try.""

A pause. I knew, now more than ever, after so much freedom and peace, that it'd be dangerous to press. But I needed to know.

""That... sounds a lot like the life they had back on earth.""

""It is. Just with more resistance. They *hate* that. Torture of the highest degree.""

""Not... not really, sir.""

""Eh?""

""It's *not* torture of the highest degree. In fact being quite honest, sir, if you asked a good majority of the workers on this ship, they could think of ten other ways to treat them that's far worse.""

""Yes, well, those treatments wouldn't get us what we need from them, and-""

""What *do* you need, sir?"" I interupted. By now he was starting to flinch as I spoke, almost impercetibly, but not quite. ""That sector is a complete dead end! It's not *producing* anything, it's just gobbling up six hundred worker's worth of bio energy a day to keep those - those absolute *bastards* alive and in their little tanks!""

He paused. Stuttered. Sighed deeply and sunk onto his alien-looking desk.

""... Please don't. Don't tell the others.""

""Is this a personal project sir? One your collegues shouldn't know about?""

""No! No no, I meant... I mean other humans."" He looks back up, eyes filled with a sudden sorrow I hadn't seen from these little green men this whole time, bar fleeting glances. ""If... Listen. We... we're not. Actually torturing types. We're liberators.""

""Oh, every torturing type says that, sir."" Had to keep the act up.

""No, no, I know what we said with the work and the steak and we painted it as we were too dumb to know it wasn't torture **But we weren't.** ... We lied to you. To all of you. that Rich Resistance-""

""Richsistance, I think it was called. Dumb name, really...""

""They weren't killed, they were just... put there. We... we legitimately *couldn't think* of a better way to deal with those guys. They weren't going to do the work, the workers would kill them given half the chance, and the council collectively pushed against brainwashing, so... They're still back on earth. Doing... you know, doing what they do.""

""Just with more resistance?""

""Not even that"", he said, dispairingly. ""The *same* amount. It's... one to one replica, more or less. With everyone's bio-data and predictive algorithms...""

""... And you lied to us too?""

""Yes. Yes, I shouldn't be telling you that, but we're rumbled anyway, aren't we?"" A deep sigh. ""We... We knew it was better. Than what you were getting, down there. But... we looked at your responses to things, put it in the prediction algorithms, and... and we found that telling you the *truth* didn't go anywhere.""

""It didn't?""

""You... you were all waiting for the other shoe to drop. Metaphorically. Like, 'too good to be true, when do they eat us?' Or - or dismissed as a prank, something like that. The only ones that came into the fold came in with a very... 'can't be worse than what I've got now' attitude. The folk in the third world countries, you know. That was a good... 2 or 3 billion people, overall. But we wanted *all* of you.""

""And... you thought that pretending it was torture was the best idea?""

""Not thought. *knew*. It worked, didn't it? We knew that if we presented ourselves as... complete dumbass aliens who thought we were torturing you when really we were giving you a far better life... you'd *exploit* us. Sorry, I know that's a grim way to put it, but-""

""No, it's bang on. We... we did, yeah. Or exploited that stupidity, anyway.""

""Yeah."" A weak smile. ""We're not even really shapped like this, you know. Real forms are... far off yours. But we thought this would ease you into it. Council was debating for two weeks straight on if we should show up as something you'd recognise, or our real selves... And then another *six* weeks between little green men and those blue aliens from that really big movie.""

""*Six weeks?*""

""*Yes!*"" He threw up his hands a little in exasperation. ""You have no idea how long we were planning this, how much debate their was with every little piece! Even the smallest stuff was a *nightmare!* Like, the Waygu Beef thing was a four month decision, all that debeating about the ethics of telling you in advance it was synthetic verses playing into the bit! And of course, when did we find out about the concept of vegans? One month into that! And how do we solve *that*?!?""

I decided to mentally skip past the prospects of even visual shapeshifting capability that came up there, alongside the idea of synthetic meat, and how much trouble *that* would cause, when revealed. ""... For what it's worth, sir, I... I think you could get away with the truth, now.""

He looked up, going from his exasperated face-to-the-table pose back to deer-in-headlights look. ""Really?""

""Yes. You've - you've proven this isn't a trick. Or at least, the part where you give us a better life. No-one's gone missing-""

""Besides people we found later stuck in the vents and such.""

""Right - we're not being grinded into bio-energy or, or eaten or whatever... And you've kept that up for this long. Anyone still suspicious is gonna be suspicious regardless. And everyone else... I think they'll believe you. And they'll be happy they can finally quit acting like they're sad in front of you.""

""... Yeah. Acting for that long must be a burden, huh? We've *still* not worked out how to handle the people who can't act like that, beyond just... pretending like they can.""

""Which I did appreciate, by the way.""

""Thank you.""

""So... send that up to the council, see what they say. Meanwhile, I'll... I don't know, actually. Maybe write up a report on suspicions to help you assuage them, as best you can.""

""Right. Right..."" He scooped up the papers, smiling genuinely for the first time since we got on board. Then he coughed, and went back to the evil smile of old. ""Now, er. Go have fun - I mean... go busy yourself with the menial busywork we set in the 'ga-me' room.  And remember, resistance is futile!""

I nodded and headed down the corridor. ""It sure is, sir.""",51
1lhf4dn,mz66k0m,"Look, if you’re going to be enslaved by a galactic conqueror, you could do worse than one who runs their operation like a Scandinavian wellness retreat.

The alien, whose name was twelve syllables long and unpronounceable unless your larynx could dislocate like a snake’s jaw, appeared in low orbit and delivered its ultimatum with all the subtlety of a community theater performance of War of the Worlds. We were to become its slaves. Not metaphorically. Not spiritually. Actually, literally slaves.

Naturally, humanity panicked. Economists wept openly on live television. Billionaires flung themselves into their yachts and attempted to reach international waters, apparently unaware that space did not honor tax havens.

But then the terms came in.

Three workdays a week. Monday through Wednesday. Thursday through Sunday off. I haven’t seen labor unions that generous since 1976.

All meals to be A5 wagyu steak. Yes, apparently marbling is a galactic priority. The alien demanded it exclusively. We assumed it was for morale reasons, but later it turned out its species just really liked watching humans chew slowly and moan.

And the labor itself? Two hours a day picking strawberries. No KPI meetings. No spreadsheets. No workplace Slack messages that begin with “just circling back.” Just strawberries. Manual, sunlit, low-stress fruit harvesting.

At first, we resisted. Some cited freedom. Others cited allergies, which felt beside the point but they were loud about it. But within two weeks, the stock market had collapsed, and former hedge fund managers were fighting for the privilege of a strawberry basket.

By week five, Stockholm Syndrome had been replaced by something more insidious: wellness culture. Instagram influencers rebranded themselves as “Earthfruit Flow Coaches.” A rogue faction of Silicon Valley tried to unionize for less free time, citing concerns about losing their edge.

Our alien overlord, for its part, was baffled. It had expected screams and rebellion. Instead it got kale smoothies and unsolicited TED Talks. Eventually it went back to its ship, muttering something about “psychosocial contamination,” and left us alone.

But we kept the schedule.

And the steak.",20
1lhf4dn,mz6551n,"When we arrived on earth, we thought it would be a simple job. Our technology far outpaced their own and    we knew that the conditions on earth were bad, far worse than anywhere else in the galaxy. Ultimately we expected them to just join us, working happily as well treated indentured slaves, how could we have expected what came next? 

On the first day there was confusion, governments of earth attempting to set the right terms that would allow them to continue their lives of luxury along with a few humans volunteering to become our willing servants. 

Over the next week that followed we noticed a change among the humans on earth. We began sending collector drones to grab as many humans from population centers as we could. This turned out to be a mistake. 

It didn’t take long until several humans were killed in a collection raid. This set off an unbelievable set of events. Suddenly our seemingly reasonable and good intentioned slavery became a rallying cry for all. The words “We will not be slaves “ and “justice for the stolen” were painted everywhere. We landed our first ship on the planet to set up a forward processing and detention center and the humans… they charged us. 

Tens of thousands of them, carrying ballistic firearms,  explosive weaponry, and horrific chemical weaponry. They seized our ship, executing our crew one by one until they had full control of it. 

In response we sent more ships to the world. This was our fatal error. For the first time in their long, brutal and bloody histories humanity stood shoulder to shoulder, barrels facing outward full of fury and madness. Race, religion and sexuality ceased to matter, at least for now. They had a common enemy… Us.

They captured ship after ship, until all of the world’s greatest scientists figured out how to build their own…. Humans, they work 5 to 7 days a week, they work a minimum of 8 hours a day in wealthy countries. Their factories worked around the clock, launching a new starship every 10 hours. The republic of earth had taken to the stars and there was nothing we could do to stop it. 

Their ships equipped with unbelievable weapons, weapons long banned by the galactic council. The humans used them with brutal precision. They cut across their solar system, destroying dozens of our ships until they reached the outer rim of their space. 

Using the FTL drives they stole from us they took to the stars, to do what they do best: conquer, despoil and colonize. 

This is why I stand before you in front of the council, we cannot beat the humans alone. If you think they will stop with us, you are sorely mistaken. The humans claim to stand for freedom, some of them may even believe it, but they don’t want freedom for you or me. They are scorching a path across the galaxy and if we do not stop them, we will be forever in chains.",11

There was a moments pause as each person looked to those around them, confirming they weren't hearing things. Then -

""I volunteer!"" shouted a woman, running from the front entrance of a hotel, soapy sponge still in hand.

""Choose me,"" cried a young man, abandoning his till at the big box store.

""Please!"" shouted a man wearing an ill-fitting suit and tie as he stared out the window of an office building. ""My doctor told me to avoid red meat, so if I could replace some of the wagyu with chicken, I'm your man!""

""Do I get credit for the 10 hours I've already picked fruit today?""  asked a woman in a field.

""Uninterrupted?"" asked a woman trying to soothe her baby while attending a conference call.

""Er, yes"" Zoon said. ""And you will only be given 6 weeks vacation a year! And you must use it!""

""When can I start?"" shouted several voices in many languages.

Zoon paused. ""You!"" he shouted to the woman in the field. ""Your done for the day! Report back tomorrow after you've bathed and slept"" he beamed the berries she picked into his ship. 

""You and you!"" he called to the housekeeper and cashier. ""You'll find your steak dinners waiting at your dwellings. Go now and prepare for your enslavement tomorrow!""

""Same too you!"" he called to the man in the office. ""But I've substituted a boring free range chicken salad with fresh produce for you. The waygu will be a monthly indulgence.""

""And you!"" he snapped at the new mother. ""You and your partner are not to report to work until you've taken the horrifically short 1-year parental leave!""

He paused ""The rest of you go home and wait to be awoken by birdsong in the morning. Unless home is unsafe or non-existent in which case you will be forced to live in the furnished 1200 square foot rowhomes that are our slave quarters!""

He waited for screams of terror, but instead heard only joyful celebration. He focused, using the super hearing of his spieces and then - yes! Voices, perhaps 1 out of 100, no, 1 out of 1000 crying out from penthouses and corner offices ""this is really going to tank our stock prices!""",5

Well, I have too many W.I.P's to continue Xolitu's anguish in detail, but:

1) He will be mocked by others for failing to break humanity

2) He will be worshipped as a God by humans

3) He will continue to give worse and worse ""punishments"" only to be adored even more by humans

4) He will never give up, and have these sessions with the MC at the bar

5) At one point humanity will wage war in the name of Great Xolitu

6) Xolitu's race is nigh-immortal, so he shall forever try to rule ""harshly"" over humanity, and at some point the humans will be all over the universe, still listening to Xolitu, still worshipping him.

7) At some point, humanity will reach the same level of existence as Xolitu's race, and will tell him why he failed.

8) Xolitu will laugh it off, and not believe it, and try again with another young civilization, only to repeat history, again and again.",214

It’s the 30 hours ones that are the taxing weeks for me because it’s working and running around and stocking til we leave.

You have to work a minimum of 14 to 15 hours a day, including preparation and cleaning,” he says, rattling off a Hokkien proverb that translates to “no rest days, no weekends, no holidays, wake up early and sleep very late”.

For some cultural context, a ""hawker"" is a purveyor of hot food who's usually both the owner and operator of their own small business, which means they're usually running the whole show themselves, usually with an assistant.

It actually worked.  
In the way, that the two got together.

And it is so loud, that if it speaks near you, you go deaf...

1lhnpoz,mz5sudd,"Sparks flew the day the wizard Graybeard and the witch Molly faced each other in the grassy fields of Southwick Village. Not from the fireball he lobbed in her direction. No, that wicked ball of flames hit a cow that had ambled to the middle of the fields to graze.

They laughed together.

Farmer Fred didn't.

Not when his cow exploded into a gory shower of minced beef on his field. Not when the wizard and the witch didn't notice him or apologize, too busy winking, flirting and throwing flying kisses along with even more fireballs. Heart-shaped fireballs.

So much for trying to get them to stop fighting by setting up together. Fred had thought they could stop duelling and start kissing when the whole village got a matchmaker to set them up on a date.

Turns out, blasting fireballs in the shape of hearts, roses, and kisses was totally romantic by ~~pyromaniac~~ pyromancer standards. Turning them from rivals to lovers didn't change much on the surface. They still burned large swathes of land. Scorched properties and roasted farm animals (the end result was not pretty, and not edible). Except they were even more destructive when in love. Something about the burning intensity and how hot is it when two pyromancers fall very much in love.

Naturally, the whole village thought about breaking them up.

By bringing in a second witch. And they made sure she was a hydromancer. If only because the only thing worse than two pyromancers in love was having a third one.

Now Graybeard happily duked it out with the water witch, Clara. The man simply wanted a good sport and some magical competition. Molly wasn't having any of it. How dare her dear wizard duel with another witch without her?

Sooner or later, one will have to give. Or so that's what the village thought.

Then, for the first time, the villagers crouched behind several rocks to see the wizard and witches blast spells at each other in a triangle...

...A love triangle.",13
1lhuv3r,mz7o7a7,"It stared at me, the master of fire and flight. Great black scales seemed to bulge from the night sky, creating its horrible appearance. The only reason I knew it to be there was how its flames lit it, as it stood over me.

Two points of light, like stars above focused on me. The eyes had no iris or pupils, instead a pure white that glared. It promised death, speaking of a voracious hunger never truly sated.

I shook as I watched it, holding my hunting bow. The rabbits I had caught were slung around my chest, long since cooled down. From the corner of my eye I could see the ruins of my home, but I couldn't dwell on it. Not now. Not with it in front of me.

My voice was shaking as I drew an arrow, aiming up towards it. I spoke with fear and anger, though dwarfed by it. ""Why? Why did you do this?""

It didn't speak. In fury I let the arrow fly, with all my rage and hate. Only to see it shatter against its chest, splinters flying away. That alone prompted a response, a laugh as a claw lashed out.

I felt a tug on my chest, as I braced for pain. Yet I felt none, as I opened my eyes. Just in time to see it drop my rabbits into its gullet, swallowing once. Then it took off, without a single backwards glance. I was left alone, in my burning village, the stench of smoke and cooking flesh all around.

I stared at my home, slumping to the ground. I felt nothing, watching as all I knew burned to ash. And that is where they found me the next morning. A detachment of guards, sent to follow the dragon and its path of destruction. I alone survived, my home of close to a thousand souls slaughtered.

For too long, I couldn't act. I sat in the barracks they took me to, trapped in the past. Remembering home. It hurt to remember, but I couldn't move past it. How could I? I had nothing left. Day after day passed, blurring into one. I felt nothing but pain, barely aware if the world around me.

Yet then I was disturbed. A man in worn clothes sat before me, shaking me until I responded to him. ""Mr Daven!""

I turned to the tired looking man, and his muscled look. His eyes held a glimmer of slight madness, yet tamed, controlled. He gave me a grim smile, holding out a hand. ""My name is Beret. You survived the Desolation?""

I nodded numbly, already slipping back into the past. Yet then he gripped my face, making me concentrate on him. ""Do you want revenge?""

The thought shot through my mind. My voice was a whisper, as I struggled to speak. ""W-what?""

He leaned closer, a fist clenched. ""Against the dragon. Do you want revenge?""

I shivered, remembering it above me. How hopelessly far out of reach it was. ""H-how?""

The man gave a grin, that spark of madness blazing brighter. ""We fight. We grow. We kill it. We kill them all. For those they killed.""

Fear battled with the rage I felt at it. But the fear disgusted me. How could I still be so weak? Hell, what did I have to be afraid of? Death? I had nothing to love for anyway. No-one to go home to. I was alone now. Alone with my thoughts.

Staring at his maddened gaze, I felt it in me. A madness of my own. But one I let flow, giving me purpose. Pushing away the numb cloud over my mind. I breathed out, clenching my hands. ""I need my bow.""",23
1lhuv3r,mz8dfjc,"I stand amidst the wreckage of what used to be my entire life. My home rested on the edge of the desert. The houses were made of clay, but the roofs were made of thatch. Rain was an infrequent occurrence, the village pond only made a seasonal appearance, and the people themselves were weathered and dry, lean and thin. Survival was difficult in our village, and because happiness was scarce, we held onto it all the tighter. We found our treasures in the immeasurable things, in the moments with our tribe, in the welcoming of a new life into our large family. 

Now, there is no one left to celebrate, and only me left to grieve what is lost. The sun blazes overhead— as it always does in our village, and I am surrounded by the fires that continue to burn on. Their work is done, their victims dead, but the fire is not satisfied until it has eaten through and turned everything to ash. Yet I am cold. 

I feel a new, gnawing emptiness slowly starting to form within me. The dragon stands in front of me, her wings folded, smoke rising from her nostrils. Fire should not die out until it has consumed everything, but I am neither consumed by the dragon nor by its flames. I find myself only consumed with a cold and endless rage. The dragon cocks her head, assessing me. Perhaps she is waiting for my move, but I cannot move as of yet. I do not know which direction to take. The village is silent, and that itself kills what remnant of hope I have. The weak cries and pleas for help ended soon after they began. The dragon unfolds her wings, and launches into the sky. By the time her form diminishes to a speck in the distance, I know what I must do. 

If it was only grief I felt, I would beg to be killed. I would let our village became a graveyard. But that cannot be the end of our legacy. I am inadequate to carry it forward, but I am all that is left. I will bury my family, and I will begin my journey to catch that speck, and to rid the world of the creature that caused all of this.

The cold disappears, and I feel a small flame where before, there was only emptiness. Perhaps it is a sense of purpose, I feel, this new and sharp warmth. I turn towards the village, readying myself for the long task of the burials and the rituals. Every one of the dead deserve a proper ceremony, and it will take long. 

I sigh, and on my breath, I smell smoke. So the warmth may not be a sense of purpose. It may be just a flame, or an ember. It may be the start of something terrible.

1lhuv3r,mz8okci,"I am a nomad covered in dust from the road. The warmth still resides within me, but it is a dull and steady thing now, an eternal flame that cannot be extinguished. The faces of my family have faded in my memory, but the fire has only grown larger. I wake to my mouth being filled with soot, and I do not speak so often nowadays. I carry with me the smell of burning wood and ash, and other humans no longer approach me.

North is where the dragons rest, and I imagine some dragon village, their own scaly young and old ones with faded scales. I imagine that inhuman village up in flames, and the flame within me burns a bit brighter at the thought. I make my way to the village, following the rumors and the sightings, and enter the mountain range where they are said to live. I search the hidden valleys and the caves. The mountain is devoid of animal life. The plants are lush and overgrown. It is a place of imbalance, the presence of something larger disrupting the natural balance of prey and predator. There are no grazing animals to keep the fauna from overgrowing.

Finally, I come across a village, nestled between two mountains. The village is much like mine, small and tight knit. It is a land where survival is difficult, I can tell. There are no animals to hunt, and the forest fights back against any kind of taming or agriculture. I walk in, and the people do not immediately shoot me the usual warning glares or wary glances.

An old man approaches, leaning on an old stick, and I notice the oddity. There are no children in this village, only adults and the elderly. The houses are made entirely of stone, beehive shaped things with small windows and doors.

“Good morrow,” I say, covering my mouth with the edge of my sleeve.

“There is no need to hide your nature, young lady,” he says, and smoke rolls out of his mouth like a waterfall. “We are all of the same breed here.”

I see the others then, as they are. They do not have the similarity in appearance and bearing as others do. It is a mismatched quilt of a village, and the family I thought I saw is one made from necessity.

“The foolish humans think dragons lay eggs and raise their young. But how could a being that defies all rules of reason, bring forth life in a way so mundane?”

“Do not speak in riddles,” I warn him. I have grown tired of false words and fraudulent soothsayers on my journey here.

“Dragons create more of their own through fire. A little flame gives birth within a human being, and one day that flame overtakes them. It burns away what is left of their humanity, and they take flight.”

“And is there nothing you can do?” I ask.

“You can only wait.”

1lhyyde,mz8we8p,"I died on a Wednesday. 

Joke’s on them, I was already dead inside. The actual death was more of a technicality. 

Last thing I remember was telling “Brenda with an A” how she was so funny and quirky for ordering the latest vidtok custom drink. Of course I hadn’t heard of it. Of course I could make it. One venti iced americano, 5 shots decaf with almond milk, extra ice, 8 honey, 7 matcha, double blended, double cupped, split into three cups coming right up. I smiled so hard my cheeks hurt, and slapped a sticker that had no business being that long onto a cup for “Branda”.

Please just end me. 

Then I did exactly that.

Without any fanfare, I collapsed into a puddle of matcha and oat milk. That was it. No final gasp, no dramatic last words. Just the hiss of the espresso machine and Janet yelling “We’re down a barista! Someone grab his apron!”

The afterlife was alright I guess, as far as being dead goes. They had a little cat cafe in a small village square where the sun decided to rest at golden hour. I always wanted to visit one, though I couldn’t remember why. I hated coffee and I didn’t like the idea of cat hair in my food. But they had a little orange tabby cat named Pumpkin who seemed to like hopping up into my lap. He was baby soft, and gave a gentle purr when I ran my hand down his spine. It wasn’t harps and angels, but it was nice and I think I could have stayed here forever letting Pumpkin sleep on my lap while I sipped a gently brewed peppermint tea.

Then I woke up in a puddle of oat milk, now mixing with stagnant mop water as Dillon tried mopping up the mess around me. The wet, cold yarn strings slapped onto my face and clung as the moving mop dragged them down my cheek. If I could smell anything, I would have gagged from the putrid stench of milk, chlorine, pumpkin spice and now matcha swirling around on the floor. 

“Oh good! You’re back” Janet chirped as she tossed my apron back onto my chest. “Kaitlin needs help on register”

I sat up and stared at her, slack jawed “But I’m dead.”

“That’s no excuse,” she said, adjusting her headset. “If you want to leave, you need to find someone to cover the rest of your shift”

And that’s how I learned that hiring anyone with a pulse is more of a guideline - especially when death isn’t a valid reason to call out.",6
1lhf4ho,mz3rwo2,"I stare at the kid, confused.  
""You summoned me, a high-ranking demon of the Circle of Lust...  
To have someone to go to the prom with?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""I am confused, on the hows and whys of this situation.  
Care to explain? Also, may I leave the summoning circle?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
I smile, and a few minutes later, we are in his living room, with refreshments and cookies, as I await the explanation.

  
""Well...I am a nerd, and I don't have anyone to go with.  
Also, I am a supernatural nerd...so I learnt a lot about myths, legends, demons, rituals, so I tried it out."" he says.  
I scroll on his...phone? He called it?  
Not bad of an invention.  
I made an account, on this thing called ""Instagram"", and I already have 10 thousand followers.  
They like my body. I smile.  
""So, on your first try you managed to summon me? And also...little boy, you really aimed to summon a Lust demon?"" I wink at him.  
He blushes furiously.

  
""I mean...I knew a demon like that would impress people..."" he mutters.  
I nod, and look at him, and the house we are in.  
""Look kid. You aren't bad looking, and it seems you are almost rich, from what I learned from this ""internet"" thing. Why would you have problems with your peers?"" I ask.  
He fidgets.  
""Are they that superficial that just because you like different stuff, they shun you?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""Go, get your suit."" I say.  
He is confused.  
I look around the ""internet"" for prom dresses, and snap my fingers.  
An amazing dress appears on me, as I de-age a bit. Need to look the part.

  
""Y-You will come with me? T-to the Prom?!"" he asks, mouth wide open staring at me.  
I nod.  
""Attention? Dresses? Making others feel bad about themselves? Showing the women of this world that they can't measure up to me?  
What's there to not like?"" I laugh.  
He smiles, and takes off his cloak, to show that he is already wearing the suit.  
""Shall we?"" he asks.  
""Where are your elders? I mean, parents? I read that it is customary to take photos of the younglings."" I say.  
He doesn't answer.  
I see.  
I make some ""selfies"" and photos for the ""gram"" with him, and then leave.

1lhf4ho,mz54wbh,"“Fear hoarders of wealth, for Greedslayer has come to take your souls to eternal torment!” I said as I was summoned.

“Hooray, I did it right. Can you accompany me to prom?” The nervous summoner said as he shuffled back and forth.

I stepped out of the summoning circle, which was too messy to contain me, and took a breath. This mortal smelled of…

“You don’t even have ownership of the clothes you’re wearing, and these are wild flowers.” I said. “Your parents don’t even own this house, and I smell the debt they’re under. You have summoned the right demon, mortal, just tell me who to slay for you and I will happily take their soul to fix this.”

He awkwardly smiled and said. “So based. I love it. But I really just want you to come to prom with me. It’s basically a dance.”

I looked at my figure briefly to make sure I hadn’t been turned into a succubus in the past millennia. But no. I was thinning to an unhealthy extent, with heat resistant leather wrapped over many spots in a more functional than form fitting way. Something that wouldn’t burn as I dipped souls in their own molten gold, and giant strong hands and large arms to crush my foes under their own statues after they underestimated me as some poor wretch.

“Is there some greedy rich person to kill at this event? Someone behind your troubles?” I asked.

“No. Well, maybe? I just wanted to introduce you to my club so that they could hear your stories.” The mortal said. “But I mean if you have to run off and take direct action instead, I’m not going to stop you.”

“I’m Greedslayer, not Greedfinder. Unless I’m close enough to smell them, I can’t locate those that I’d need to slay.” I sighed. “You have a club of people who wish to hear of the painful death of rich assholes?”

…

“And then I stabbed him to death with his own gilded blade.” I said to the group at the prom. “He would never again enslave people for construction of a vanity palace.”

“You were right, she’s absolutely peak.” Another mortal said.

 “And you have a dozen more stories like this?” My summoner asked.

“Of course. Though, not all are as triumphant as that one. You did ask for the best first.”
I said.",64
1lhf4ho,mz7x2w1,"I showed up in all my battle armor blood and gore dripping off me. I am meant to terrify. 
The nerdy looking kid was standing there with a bouquet of flowers wearing a tuxedo. The expression on his face was that of pure terror. 

The kid stammered “ you’re not Ronda the Succubus?”

I scowled at the kid “ no you idiot, I am Randy The Terror War Demon. I kill mortals for those who summon me. (Mumbling) for a price.”

The kid said “ but I summoned Ronda, I need her to be my date for Prom. I really need her for after prom.” 

I fart some fire then say, “ you must have performed the summoning wrong. If you want I can tell you how to correctly summon Ronda?” 

The kid eyes lit up. “Yes, yes please.”

“ ok let me see what you used?”  I said. 

The kid shows me a list of items, then points them out either around or in the circle. 

I say, “ ok I see where you went wrong. First you used Orange peel instead of orange wedges. Second you used turmeric instead of ginger. You have black candles, not red candles. “ 
“ Go get the proper ingredients, I will wait “ I said as I materialized a chair to sit on. 

The kid, returned shortly with all the correct ingredients. He began laying everything out. 

I cleared my throat, “ are you forgetting something?” I asked. 

The kid looked at me puzzled? 

“ you need to release me from your circle, so you can summon Ronda. You do want Ronda to go to the Prom with you? You do want Ronda to make your night special? You do want Ronda to make you a Man? “ goated him. 

He bent over and smudged part of the protective circle. 
I stepped out. 
“You better repair the circle before you summon Ronda.” I instructed. 

I stepped back by the wall to watch. 

The kid performed the summoning correctly. The candles dimmed, there was a popping sound. And Ronda was standing in the circle in all of her elegant beauty. 

Ronda looked first at the kid, but quickly realized I was in the room. 

She glared at me, just as I said, “ Time for me to go, have fun tonight kids” 

I teleported out of there.",23
1lhf4ho,mz3sy1j,"I woke up to a windy breeze, cool and calm The smell of roses filled my nose. My body felt stiff like a rusty handle. It's been awhile since I had felt these sensations. Looking around me, I was in a garden spread wide like a football field. I sat up, with a crack in my back. I thought I died a while ago, the war was nasty I remember. 

The real question is how did I come back? 

""Um......Hi"" 

I snap my head back almost breaking it. My eyes landed on a beautiful woman. Her red hair breezed softly with the wind. Her dress was made of purple and yellow with flowers etched around the side. Her brown eyes shined in the sun. In her hands were a bouquet of flowers. She seemed nervous, like something weighed on her mind. 

""Do you play for the Lakers?"" I said

She looked stunned, What did I say something stupid?

Then she laughed, That was a noise I liked

""That's the first thing you say when meeting someone?"" 

I gave an awkward smile. Well I have been dead for centuries. 

""No, I'm not this dress was a parting gift from my grandma."" She smiled 

""That is a nice dress, very stylish"" I replied 

She blushed gently ""Thank you"" 

""So how did I get here? I've been dead for centuries""

Her eyes looked away, she's hiding something. 

""I'm a big fan of you, I have been for a long time. I have been studying history for a long time. And your stories were amazing, you saving the general in the battle of Nemo."" She fluttered like a fan "" Was amazing""

She looked at me like a hero. But the truth is I wasn't, During the battle we were losing a lot of men. The battle was almost lost, one of my shoulders came up with a plan and succeeded. But he died during the battle, so the credit went to me. Since I'm the only one who made it back from our unit. 

But looking at her face now, I couldn't tell her the truth. 

Thanks, I smiled, for the imaginary me you see. 

""Um.......and what I summoned you here for is...........Can you be my prom date?"" 

I exhaled

1lhnsrt,mz7ev67,"“Which brings us to the next matter for your attention, sire...” Counsilor Trult’s voice trailed off as he addressed the king, his voice growing hoarse with displeasure. Counsilor Trult, along with the rest of the Royal Accompaniment, had spent the better part of four hours relaying the trials and grievances of the kingdom to King  Stultus. They proceeded as they painstakingly had every week of the last month, though it seemed the list only grew with time. King Stultus, for his part, had entered the chamber with his typical air of inattention, which had grown steadily to boredom, leered on the precipice of annoyance, and threatened to topple into outright hostility as the hours grew later. The rest of the Counsilors sat around the table, a mixture of contempt and futility littered amongst their faces as they desperately sought some reconciliation for their overlooked districts and principalities.  

“Our apothecaries have taken particular notice to a fast-growing sickness in Bergum.” Trult continued. King Stultus stared back, cow-eyed and fiddling with a tassel on the cuff of his robe. “Otherwise healthy men drop in the fields, convulsing violently and splattering blood from their mouths” Trult droned. The king made no outward appearance of care. “Perhaps we could send a detachment of the Royal Surgeons to investigate this sickness...” Trult was cut off as the king raised his hand. 

“Sickness! War! Taxes! I myself grow sick of these conversations, Trult!” King Stultus boomed, pounding his meaty fist into the table. “Every week, you and the rest of these lickspittles pester me with your woes, and I will stand it no longer!” Trult and the rest of the council recoiled at the King’s anger. 

“Sire, we simply mean to ensure the safekeeping and good health of your kingdom,” Harbormaster Beckish cooed, his voice a honeyed desperation.  

“Silence, worm!” King Stultus declared. “And what of my good health and safekeeping? I’ve not had a respite from your prattling since my coronation!” Trult surveyed the faces of the Counsilors, keenly remembering the King’s last drunken stupor days prior and rolling his eyes. 

“I decree the affairs of today finished” King Stultus continued. Several Counsilors gave grunts of approval, swiftly accompanied by the scraping of chairs against the stone floor. Trult made to exit as well, though he and the others were met with another resounding pound on the table.  

“I did not dismiss you lot! Your petty affairs are finished, though we have much to discuss for my own plans” King Stultus said. Reluctantly, Counsilors returned to their seats.  

“I should like to vacation to the Royal Chateau on Lake Ibis” King Stultus continued.  

“Sire,” interrupted Trult, drawing a harsh glare from the King. “We’ve discussed this matter. The roads leading to the Royal Chateau are, at present, in a state of utter disrepair and beset by bandits and highwaymen. It will be impossible to reach the lake before the Royal Surveyor has commissioned a repair and the bandits driven out.”  

“Then we will bring the lake here.” said King Stultus, no humor in his voice. “Break down the levies and the dam stopping the Kyber River. The palace will be lakefront in a fortnight.” Several of the Counsilors grew pale at the proposition. Surveyor Talin attempted to intercede.  

“Sire, the consequences of...”  

“Do not speak to me of consequences!” King Stultus roared. “Any man who disobeys my order will be put to the sword!” Surveyor Talin shrunk back into his seat. 

“Next, I would like to host a great feast to celebrate my first month as King! Collect a tithe of the finest cattle from our ranchers for the occasion.” It was time for Chief Herdsman Fenwick to petition the King.  

“Sire, we’ve not yet had our full breeding season. To cull the herd now would devastate our long-term retention of the population.” King Stultus waved his hand dismissively.  

“Confound your retention, bean counter! I will not serve fetid grouse or gamey pheasant at this occasion! Would you have my guests speak ill of me at such a momentous occasion?” Trult did everything in his power to stifle a laugh.  

“Finally, commission a statue to be made in my honor.” Counsilor Trult sighed, knowing he would have to remind the King of the labor shortage. 

“My King,” he began “our labor supply is in short demand since the beginning of your Ten-Day War.” 

“Impress the homeless into service then! The cripples and invalids too! We’ve let those wastrels suckle of the teet of this kingdom for too long!” Trult surveyed the rest of the council, slack-jawed faces of horror marking a sharp contrast to the self-satisfied smile of King Stultus.  

“Now, if that concludes our business, I shall see you all next week when we reconvene.” King Stultus said. “I look forward to your refreshing updates on these matters.” King Stultus patted the hilt of his sword, glowering countenance darting to each member on the council, and withdrew from the chamber. 

Part 2 to follow! Let me know what you think!",6
1lhnsrt,mz7xr6o,"Part 2:

Counsilor Trult was surprised to find the King hosting the Royal Accompaniment in the throne room, as opposed to the usual chamber. Though the King’s motives became readily apparent once Trult entered. The Counsilors were gathered in a wide arc in front of the King, who towered above them atop his throne. The message was clear. 

“Counsilor Trult, how generous of you to join us” King Stultus boomed. 

“Apologies my King, I was surprised to find the Councilitor Chamber empty. I mean you no disrespect” Truly said, teeth gritted as the last line escaped.  

“Come join us! Surveyor Talin was just providing an update on our new lakefront estate! Surveyor, if you please” the King motioned for Surveyor Talin to continue.  

“As I was saying, sire, we’ve broken the levies and emptied the dam along the Kyber River. Miraculously, no property was damaged as the floods roared towards our eastern shores.” King Stultus could not have appeared more disinterested. “And” Talin continued, “it would seem the algae bloom of the river has been an exceptional fertilizer for the farmlands. We’ve a growing bounty not seen in ten generations of Kings!” Trult stood stunned, reeling at the sheer luck of the King.  

“Yes yes, I told you not to pester me with such trivialities, what of my property? Where am I to lounge?”  

“Well sire, work continues as we speak on a new boathouse along the eastern spillway.” 

“Work continues, bah!” the King waved his hand. “Come to me when you have a useful update, Counsilor. Who’s next, then?” 

Before Chief Herdsman Fenwick could begin, the door to the throne room burst open. A panting guard stumbled forward, giving an awkward salute. 

“My King,” the guard said “a mob has formed outside the gatehouse, armed with hammers and mauls. A sorry lot altogether, but a great many of them!”  

“The miners and sculptors, let them in!” King Stultus said, eagerly wringing his hands.  

“Their intent is unclear, sire, it may be prudent to...” the guard was cut off again by the King. 

“I will have my statue, knave, open the gates!” The guard gave another salute before leaving the throne room. 

Killed by a peasant mob of cripples and invalids Trult thought, truly an esteemed legacy for our King.  

“Sire” Chief Herdsman Fenwick continued. “Perhaps you will find my report more becoming. At your behest in preparation for the feast, we slaughtered a number of our finest cattle. In doing so, our ranchers were shocked to discover a most aggressive parasite infecting the herd. After some careful analysis from the Royal Surgeons, we’ve determined this parasite to be the very thing causing the sickness that has decimated our villages. Had we allowed the cattle to breed, we surely would have faced a plague threatening the entirety of the kingdom!” King Stultus appeared unmoved.  

“And what of the preparations for my feast, Counsilor?” Fenwick wrung his hands and bit his lip. 

“It is most lamentable sire that we’ve needed to cull much of the herd, and the infected meat is unsuitable for consumption. I’m afraid we will need to find other means to stock the tables for the feast.” 

“Idiot!” the King boomed. “You’ll have me looking like a second-rate gristle peddler in front of the whole kingdom!” Chief Herdsman Fenwick cringed as the King reached for the hilt of his sword. “I’ll see you to the stockades myself, Fenwick!”  

Before the King could make good on his threat, the door to the throne room burst open, ushering in a large mob of peasants. They limped forward, brandishing an assortment of hammers, chisels, and mauls. Though a largely sick and ungainly lot, their numbers allowed them to push past the few guards and surround the Counsilors and King Stultus. A one-armed man shambled to the front, salt-and-pepper beard flecked with dust and powder, sallow cheeks sagging at the corners of his mouth. He carried a large pickaxe in one arm, the other hanging limply to the side, cut off at the elbow. The mob of peasants parted for him to step forward, nodding slowly towards him and offering pats of encouragement.  

“Mi’lord,” he began, scratching at his beard with the stump of his arm. “Names Hob, I’m ‘ere representin’ these fine folk” he said as he gestured towards the crowd, who swayed with a mixture of sickness and anticipation.  

“We’d jus’ like to say how grateful we all are, mi’lord, for this oppertunity.” Trult’s eyes bulged as the thickset man kept speaking. “Been in the army twenny years meself fore I lost my arm, then I was toss’d to the streets like trash. Been wallowin’ in gutters since. Many folks ‘ere the same. Shops won’t hire us, we’ve no money. This the first chance many ‘ov us had ina longtime. On behalf ‘ov all ‘ov us, thank you for the jobs mi’lord” The Counsilors stood dumbstruck as the crowd slowly nodded and mumbled in agreement.  

“Yes, splendid all around! Now, do you have my statue?”

1lhg3pv,mz3x3lx,"It just happened.  
One day, all electronics stopped for a moment, then everything that had a screen had a message on it.  
""GOD IS COMING"" the message rolled over and over again on the screens.  
No matter what we did, the message wasn't going away.  
And...  
The devices on which the message was projected on...remained on, even after unplugging them.  
Unease, and panic started to brew.  
The world was scared.

  
The mood got worse, and worse, as the message rolled on and on.  
Soon, people started cults.  
Some preached about salvation.  
Some preached about destruction.  
The world descended into chaos.  
And God was nowhere to be seen.  
Yet.

  
Then it happened.  
The skies brightened, the flowers bloomed, the animals cheered.  
The oceans calmed down, and the wind died down.  
The message started furiously being transmitted, as now voices echoed all over the world.  
""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!""   
Then the brightness increased, and the buildings started to melt.  
We also started suffocating, or even bursting into flames.  
The skies opened, and something slowly descended.  
The world was ending.

  
No matter what we did, how much we prayed, or where we ran, we were dying.  
The heat, the brightness was everywhere.  
The world was melting.  
The skies opened up completely and we could see...""It"".  
We couldn't describe it, but the few of us still alive, stopped struggling.  
It didn't matter.  
So, humanity was done.  
Under the constant message: ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"" ""GOD IS COMING!"", the world shall be destroyed, by Them whom created it.",37
1lhg3pv,mz45e4u,"""No, no, no. Not today!""

I had all of 30 minutes before I had to get out the door, and I'd managed to make it through most of the day without incident. But now that my dinner date was within reach, now that I could practically smell the steaks and the wine, and after I'd texted my wife that I'd be wrapping up soon, now I saw the network intrusion.

""GOD IS COMING""

It was a simple message, the kind a script kiddie would find hilarious. It was always a combination of grandeur and jokes with them. Not that they couldn't do damage, but many of them seemed to be built the same way. There was a profile of sorts, and the green text on a black screen had a few of the signs.

""Okay, J, let's see if we can salvage this.""

The fact that the message had hit the honeypot was a good sign. It meant that they had fallen for the decoy, and hadn't quite found their way into the real network. We worked hard to protect that network, with layers of protection to try to prevent a user from accidentally compromising the key machines. Still, it was impossible to be everywhere at once, and no amount of technology could save us if just the right user clicked on just the right attachment.

Still, if the attacker had managed to display something on the honeypot machine, they knew enough to remotely execute code. I had to hope that the honeypot was sufficiently isolated, and that there wasn't a crack in that armor. It wasn't unheard of for one of these attacks to move laterally past the honeypot. Just such a thing had happened last year to a competitor. That had been a bad time for everyone involved.

""All right, let's see how far you've gotten.""

I pulled up the relevant screens, looking for signs of network traffic that really, really shouldn't be there. I scrutinized the lines on the graph for a few minutes, making sure that I had checked every single data point. It was incredibly tedious, but equally important. I needed to be sure.

""Phew.""

Maybe it was my lucky day after all.

""Okay, let's shut you down.""

I clicked through the infrastructure, and shut down the honeypot machine. There were more surgical actions I could take, but I'd eaten into most of my half hour. I needed to leave, now.

""Not today, my friend. Nietzsche sends his regards.""

I logged a ticket for my team, letting them know about the intrusion. There was likely a patch somewhere we needed to install, but they needed to know that about the attack in order to do something. If the next shift hadn't solved it by morning, I'd take a look again tomorrow.

For the moment, I had a hot date.

""Hey, hon. I just shut down. I'll see you there. Love you.""",27
1lhouw4,mz6gjh4,"It had been decided by the Council of the Holy Inquisition. When their oracle predicted that they would face a Greater Evil from beyond the Veil, one they might not be able to defeat, they would seek the prophesized Great Evil that had temporarily aided them in the past.

""No.""

""What do you mean, no?"" One of the heroes of the Inquisition asked the eldritch horror before him. ""This Greater Evil could endanger your dinky little town. Elvari, are you aware of the consequences of saying no?""

""The last time I said yes, the last time I fought The Defiler, your organization stabbed me in the back,"" the octopoid entity waggled an angry tentacle. ""I care for none of your threats. The Holy Inquisition already did their worst when your past heroes dismembered me. Go ask a modern human army. Perhaps they'd lend you a nuke to fire at this Greater Evil.""

A paladin among the contingent sighed. ""We'd rather not ask you, but a band of cultists have raised one of your brothers, Valzoght, from the dead.""

""Say no more,"" Elvari raised a hand. ""I will go if you agree to my conditions.""

The members of the Inquisition stared at each other. After a long awkward pause, one finally spoke up. ""State your terms then.""

""Stop calling me the Great Evil.""

""...deal,"" a most reluctant answer forced its way out of the paladin's mouth.

""If I'm going to vanquish evil alongside you, officially appoint me as a paladin of your organization,"" Elvari jabbed a tentacle at one of the heroes.

""This is not something any one of us can decide. That's for the council to say. Can we go now?""

Thus, a broken alliance was reformed. One that involved a band of warriors and paladins sharing a large room together, and leaving their eldritch ally to sleep outside, floating above the inn. There was also an incident involving a plate of calamari and a blast of eldritch energies that blew a hole in a pub. Yet, somehow they managed not to kill or seriously maim each other despite the numerous ""accidents"" in their travels.

Soon, they would reach the place where tales of a terrible monster of the Abyss had sunk many ships and destroyed a bustling port town. Where it settled down in a nearby city demanding tribute and sacrifices.

Valzoght rose from the choppy seas to let out a tremendous roar that shook the earth upon hearing Elvari shout out an embarrassing childhood nickname.

""If it isn't the daddy's least favourite bastard,"" Valzought rumbled.

His half-brother stuck a few tongues out. ""If it isn't daddy's most beloved bootlicker.""

As two eldritch deities traded insults, the members of the Holy Inquisition were already working to apprehend the cultists and cease the ritual that sustained Valzought's existence. They put a stop to the chanting. They wiped the ritual circles and destroyed the altar and the offerings placed upon it.

That left Valzought weakened. Unable to stop Elvari from tearing off his appendages and tossing him back into his grave.

""And stay there!"" He shouted at his opponent, before patting the top of the freshly dug grave. Or I'll come back to stuff you back in again! So much for Greater Evil. You were simply a Greater Jerkass to the people you lorded over.""

""That went well,"" a paladin commented when the Inquisition arrived at the scene. ""I've received a call from my superior. No eldritch paladins allowed.""

""Hmph, I saw that coming,"" Elvari snorted.

""We could join one of your tea parties, if it pleases you,"" the paladin suggested. ""A peace offering. Your tea, your rules. Unlike my distant predecessors, I'm not one to stab an ally in the back.""

1lhivk5,mz5qq0p,"""Sir! We can't hold much longer!""

""I know,"" I replied to the captain of the guard. Gods forgive me, I knew. For centuries I had been the Court's wizard. I had helped guide this fledgling fiefdom into the vast kingdom it was today. I would be damned if some pissant demon lordr's playthings would destroy all of this.

""Sir!""

""I said, I know,"" I snapped as I stepped to the edge of the ramparts. ""Whatever happens, do not take to the field. Whatever happens to me, do not interfere!"" 

The royal guards assigned to protect me all took an involuntary step back. Only my friend Baltus, the captain of the guard, stood by my side.

""Thalvir, you can't have much magic left,"" my friend whispered, so the others couldn't hear. ""You look as exhausted as we do.""

""This will be the last spell, Baltus,"" I replied. I began to chant in a long forgotten language. I had hoped I would never have to use this magic. But I knew the moment I found the ancient tome that it would be my destiny. I guess I just wished I had more time.

The soldiers could feel the power being summoned around us. The air hummed with it. They wouldn't be able to tell, but this magic was different. Older. Hungrier.

The demons were charging across the plains, intent on breaching the castle gate. Fog began to gather around their feet. It blanketed the field like the clouds of a thunderstorm across the sky.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning shot into the sky. But this lightning was wrong. There was no flash of light. Only a jagged line of black void that absorbed the light around it. There was no thunder. Only a silence so harsh it almost hurt.

Where once a demon stood, there was now only a gap in the fog. The rest of them faltered in their charge. The demons knew this magic. They should. It came from the depths of their realm.

I opened my eyes and forced myself to watch the carnage I was about to unleash on these foul beasts.

A cold wind began to blow, forcing the sleeves of my robe up and exposing my extended arms. My voice rose to be heard over the wind. A little trick I had perfected over the years to ensure I was heard over the crowds. 

The mute lightning came faster now. Each strike taking a demon back to the deepest depths of hell. And each strike left an inky black stain on my body. My arms were covered in them. Each one felt like an icy needle being pressed against my skin. Each stain a price for the magic I was using.

It was only a few moments that passed, but it felt like hours. My life force drained away as I fought to continue chanting. Life freely given to protect the kingdom.

Finally, the demon lord that started all of this, was banished. I could feel the final toll being collected. The last inky stain was on my chest, it's icy presence piercing my heart.

I could feel myself falling backward. I think. Or maybe I was floating toward the sky?

Baltus came into my fading vision, tears in his eyes. I could see the sky clear and the sun shine down on us. Was he holding me? I guess I had fallen backward.

Then, darkness.",21
1lhivk5,mz6wu7x,"It had been a long time since I discovered the Gate of Death technique. Decades, at least.

As the onrushing horde charged through the gap left by the demon queen's devastating Rotstrike, I knew that this would be the last set of magic I would cast.

I looked behind me, ignoring the cheers of the demons as they celebrated finally powering through the gates of Set, Hopebringer, and I smiled.

I knew it would come to this, someday. But now, it was my turn to bring swift, painful retribution upon those who would harm the people and demise that I guard.

I pulled out the ritually-purified *artham*, from its macabre scabbard of human skin, and I felt something stirring deep within me.

I yelled at the horde. ""I willingly set myself on fire for a sunrise I will never see!"" And I struck my chest, the pain searing as my pulse matched the tempo of the storm. But the storm catered to *my* whims now. I knew my time would be limited, so I did something utterly insane.

I leapt into the fray, and screamed at the top of my lungs. It was incoherent, it was short-lived, and then I became Death, destroyer of Armies, as flames enveloped me, as lighting seared the ground around me, and as the earth itself trembled.

The rush slowed, and then I entered the *Elsewhere*, striking with my *artham* - The Moon Rises into Three Cats Strutting into Cut Purses, sweeping through Rushing Logs before finally fetching against a General.

As deaths go, this feels **right.**",5
1lhgxhn,mz4413t,"""When they say people get random powers, they really mean random, don't they?"" I asked, laughing at my own stupid joke. 

The journalist, a young woman from the Times, gave a small smile as she didn't quite understood what I was saying. She was doing a small puff piece on my 42nd birthday and wanted some quick comments about any new developments. It wasn't like my 40th birthday with a big celebration and cover story and an insert with 10 pages of biographical information.  This was just a reminder, hey world, Supreme Justice is turning 42, let's celebrate, hooray.  

""No, but I would say the strangest superpower I've seen was a guy I once met. Didn't get into the super business, well, because his power was to regrow his teeth.  He thought he could regrow other people's teeth, man, if he could do that, he'd be a millionaire. The greatest dentist in the world.  But nope.  Just his own. He kinda got the short end of the stick there.""

She wrote a few things down and looked at her watch. ""I only have time for one more question.  A reader wants to know, were you scared when you learned about your powers?"" she asked. 

I sighed. I forgot this question gets asked a lot, and I've maintained a lie for so long that I could never quite remember exactly what I was supposed to say. 

""I'm going to be honest Joanne,"" I said.  ""Here's the scoop. My whole a threw a baseball through the wall of my house while I was playing catch with my dad? That was a lie. It always has been. It was a white lie. Nothing really bad behind it. But...still a lie.""

""I got my powers when I was 16. I was a typical teen. Full of hormones and thought I was invincible. And I didn't realize that I was. But I was in love with this girl, Emily.  You see, our school had this after school dance program, and I really wanted to dance with her. I wanted to know her more. So I decided to join up, against the wishes of all my friends, and realized, I was in \*HEAVEN\*.  There were only 4 other guys in that program with about 20 girls. If Emily didn't like me? There was Claire and Megan and Stacey and...well you get the picture.""

""We start off with some simple swing dancing. After a while, I was getting pretty good at it. Like real good. We wanted to dance for the school's talent show in a few weeks, and Emily said I should be up front, in the spotlight, with her. I was nervous, but dancing with Emily? It was magical. I really enjoyed it. One day, we stayed after practice to get this one twirl exchange done perfectly. My hands were pretty sweaty and she was slipping all over the place. It was embarrassing,"" I laughed and looked down at my hands.

""I guess my powers kicked in right then and there. As I spun her...she kept spinning and crashed into the wall. She wasn't hurt! She was just...shocked. She twisted her ankle a bit, so we stopped for the night and I walked her home. We blamed it on a waxy spot on the floor. On the way home, I don't know what got into me. There was a light post on the corner of the street and I don't know why, but I pretended to be Gene Kelly and swung myself around the light pole...and well the whole thing came down. I guess my super strength was no match for the wrought iron pole and I crushed it pretty easily. It fell on someone's parked car.  I was so embarrassed that I just ran. I ran and ran and ran and before I knew it, I was halfway across the country in Iowa.""

""Iowa?""

""Yeah, Iowa. I just...I didn't know how I got there. My speed must have kicked in just then and there also. So here's the issue. We didn't have GPS or smartphones or anything like that back in 1963. How the hell was I going to get back to Pittsburgh? I had no idea where I was. I had no idea how to get back. I couldn't read a map if my life depended on it.  I didn't know where east or west or north were. So in one day, I managed to injure my crush, destroy someone's car by pretending to be Gene Kelly, then ran so far that I got myself lost in the middle of Iowa.  There was nothing around me. No sign posts. Nothing.""

Joanne looked at her watch as it started to beep. ""Oh...well...thanks for the story. Our readers will be shocked to hear this new revelation about you..."" she said and started to pack up her things. ""What happened with Emily?""

""Oh, that's a story for another time."" 

It was Friday night. As I got home, the music was already playing. Emily stood at the doorway with a big smile holding a small cupcake with a lit candle.

""Happy Birthday""",28
1lhgxhn,mz4ivnm,"""This is... the worst way to find out you have super-strength."" I laughed awkwardly, preparing to tell my story. ""So, I'm just an average guy, about 12 or so, and I get called up to the board to do a math problem. So, I'm standing there, and...""

I took a deep breath, steeling myself. ""I did what most teen boys do at some point. I got an erection at the most awkward time possible.""

The reporter giggled a bit, not mocking me, but very much in the 'oh, yeah, happened to guys all the time' sense. It helped a little. ""Except... I tore right through my jeans like they were wet rice paper. Just denim confetti. Thank goodness I liked to wear big, baggy shirts, or it could have been really bad!""

I turned to the camera. ""So, yeah, if you get powers, be aware it can happen in unexpected ways! And everyone should be a little more understanding of *everyone's* body issues.""",8
1lhgxhn,mz5dewf,"Decades ago when I moved out of Harlem and into a gated community in South Africa, had an asshole Afrikaaner couple assuming I was a, quote un-quote “Looter” because of how I looked as if they didn’t come into that country to loot in the first place.

Ranting aside, I wasn’t that politically versed in the 00s, so I just assumed they were confused. Tried my best to explain it was my house and that I have the legal right to live there. That didn’t work. One push, shove, and a shotgun barrel later and the man’s chest disappears in a bloody mess. Wife screaming and calling me a murderer and savage. I was confused too.

Luckily NASH (National Association of Superheroes) had just set up a branch in South Africa post-apartheid and convinced the court he died from a freak accident. They come to me and explain that he died from my latent powers. Essentially: Anyone trying to harm me with less than noble intentions has the injury reflected back onto them.

Signed and NDA but it’s expired now, I used to work as a field agent through southern europe, northern and Western Africa fighting crime lords, gangs, drug smugglers, supremacists, traffickers, etc. They tried to make me fight a so called “Terrorist” organization in Palestine once but I ended up losing my fucking leg and part of my spine, guess the term “Terrorist” is subjective. 

I also remember a few co workers blowing up after “Accidentally” tagging me with friendly fire so 🤷🏿‍♂️

But the timeline isn't right. He was 16 in 1963, and now he is 42. That would make the year 1989. That's much too early for  smartphones and GPS. We need to be somewhere around late 2000s or later (where a teenager could reasonably have it, causing his comment to make sense).

1lhcnju,mz3fq3q,"I look at my 9 handed robot, and the others who are...meh.  
I grin.  
""Sure."" I say.  
I sign some more papers, and the tournament starts.  
First fight: ""9-handed monk vs Brutalizer."".  
Damn, I watch as a perfectly round robot rolls into the cage, with sharp edges coming up and down from its body.  
This will be a blood bath.

  
I control Monk to be careful, and dodge, trying to learn the timing when the blades appear, and disappear back into the Brutalizer's body.  
It is difficult.  
Not only is it fast, but when it's perfectly round...Monk has no chance to grab it.  
Pummel it it is.  
I start an attack, as I kind of learnt the timing.  
One hit. Two hits.  
The Titanium hands leave small dents on the Brutalizer to no avail.  
I mess up the timing, and Monk losses one of its hands.  
Oh...it's on.

  
I make monk jump up on the cage, holding on with 3 hands.  
Brutalizer just swirls in one place.  
I hope it will jump at Monk, and I will be able to trap it in the bars of the cage.  
Nope.  
It fucking shots a blade at Monk.  
If I wasn't prepared for an attack, it would have hit Monk right in the middle.  
We start a game of Mouse and Cat, where I land a few hits every now and then.  
Brutalizer's name is chanted, while I am booed.  
Time to get serious.

  
I make monk tear off two of its hands, and start using them as weapons.  
The crowd goes crazy.  
I pummel the Brutalizer with the hands, hitting it again and again into the cage's bars.  
The referee shouts that both of us have signed the ""brutal execution"" weaver.  
I smirk.  
I hit the opponent until it stops moving.  
I make Monk raise it up, and slam it to the ground, again and again, until only scraps remain.  
I take a few wires, and blades, and make Monk take them out of the cage, as we are announced as the winners.  
These are our loot...and I will use them to upgrade Monk.",60
1lhhmak,mz510vw,"That smile, so eerie it felt unnatural. The shadows moved as if being commanded, flickering in burst where light seemed to reach. Her green eyes stared at the large being, it/he didn’t move so she moved closer

‘I shouldn’t’ the thought skittered briefly then vanished. She walked closer to the being, a step and then another her breath felt shaky. Until she was near the being. His tower dwarfed hers making her feel so tiny she gasped.

‘Yep I’m dead, I’ll probably be on a true crime podcast for being stupid.’ She giggled outwardly from her stupid thoughts.

The creature was pale, its eyes completely black and its head tilted sideways in confusion.

“You don’t reek of fear?” It asked. Her fingers brushed back her orange pixie cut strands. It’s voice was velvet like dark silk and so deep she wondered if the earth shook with its intensity.

“I’ve seen a lot of things but you are a first.” She shrugged. As a babe she noticed things the veil couldn’t hide, plus she trusted those things more then the living. Her head ached at the echoing screams before she returned to the present.

The being that looked almost enveloped in black except its face looked confused. Its face was missing something, upon closer inspection there wasn’t a nose.

“How do you breath?” Her thoughts voiced out and she blushed embarrassed.

The being looked shocked and she giggled again. 
“I guess you don’t get such questions?”

It remained quite as if contemplating if she was tasty enough, then nothing. Blank and expression less.

“What are you?” It asked her as if it wasn’t the weird thing. 

“Human, what are you?” Shrugging she looked behind him to see nothing? Was that a good description? It was so black she thought she went blind.

“Hungry.” It was blunt a statement. Crossing her arms and thinking an idea came up.

“I’m Elsa, nice to meet you hungry.”

The being looked stupefied at the answer then again tilted its head.

“No, I..” looking uncomfortable, and as if it resigned itself. ‘Did it want to eat me?’ The dilemma had Elsa contemplating but another idea shot through.

“If you're hungry I have someone tied up in my basement?” Before it answered she grabbed what looked like its trench coat.

“Come I live a few blocks from here.”",8
1lh56k1,mz2aaet,"Some memories you are made to forget, and some you were never meant to remember. 

Five years is not so long in the grand scheme of things but when that is all of your existence, five years is precious. 

There was the before, of course. There had to be a before. One doesn’t just appear in the world as a full grown woman, but despite Grammy Ada’s countless attempts - the vile concoctions she made me drink, the stories she told of her time spent traveling, hoping something would trigger - the before never returned.

My beginning was blurry. Grammy said she found me, bloody and ragged, wandering the nearby forest. No one in the nearby town knew who I was, and though everyone assumed bandits, it was anyone’s guess as to what really happened. 

I’d overheard Grammy’s musing over those first few months. Her whispered murmurs as she stirred a new batch of something that was supposed to make me remember. Whispers she wouldn’t dare say out loud. Magic, after all, was forbidden. Taboo. But it was magic, she thought, that had made me forget. 

That first year, I found myself back in that part of the forest many times, despite knowing the risks, hoping against hope that I’d find something. A locket, a bag, a scrap of cloth, anything with a clue as to who I was or what had happened, but I found nothing. It took time, but I had finally begun to accept that the before would remain unknowable. 

That was until the day I heard Grammy Ada scream. 

It was the first time I’d ever heard her raise her voice. I was inside the small cottage chopping vegetables for a stew. Grammy had left that morning to visit a friend in the village and though I usually accompanied her, she insisted she’d be fine on her own. I should have known better.

“Grammy!” I called, bursting outside. “Grammy Ada!”

She screamed again, a raw sound I didn’t think an old lady was capable of making, and I took off for the edge of the woods. My heart pounded. I had no idea what I’d find once I got there, much less what I’d do.

Grammy’s scream was cut short. I ran faster, hiking up my skirts and cursing the stones that seemed determined to make me fall. 

A short distance into the woods, at the edge of a small meadow where Grammy and I would hunt for pokeweed in the summer, I found her sprawled on the ground. I slid to a stop. Four men stood above her, all armed with knives and one pointing a sword at her throat.

“Let her go.” My breath came in short ragged gasps and my vision fuzzed at the edges.

One of the men chuckled. “Back away missy. This doesn’t need to concern you.”

Grammy moaned, and for a moment I saw in her place a child. I knew them. A sibling? A friend? I blinked and it was gone.

I sucked in a breath, clenching my teeth. “I said, let her go.”",158
1lh56k1,mz2vhlz,"Pain.

That was the first thing I felt, finding myself enveloped in darkness. The ground was warm beneath me, my body sore beyond imagination. Then I heard it. Footsteps. They were slow and unsure, but someone was approaching me.

With a grunt, I forced my eyes to open and was met with the bright blue sky stinging my vision, tears already forming from the harsh light. Before I could move, a shadow loomed over me, and I saw a woman staring back at me, her staff ready to swing.

“Outsiders aren’t allowed in these sacred woods,” she said, her eyes scanning me like I was some sort of oddity.

“Sacred woods?” I muttered weakly, struggling to prop myself up on my elbows. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” As my vision cleared and expanded beyond her, the world came into view. The dirt was scorched black, and debris and shattered trees lay scattered around us. If I didn’t know any better, an explosion must have happened.

Glancing down at myself, I saw that I was wearing what looked to be armor, or at least what was left of it. The pieces that clung to me were battered, the symbols burned beyond recognition. Despite the state of the armor, my body seemed to fare better, though I was riddled with cuts and bruises.

*Was I in battle?*

Looking up, I saw the woman lower her staff to my neck, her suspicion hardening. “Are you here to kill me? Who sent you? Who are you?”

I tried to push myself up further, my arms trembling with the effort. “I am…” The words got caught in my throat. I don’t recall ever seeing this woman in my life. In fact, I couldn’t recall any faces. Surely, I had to know at least my name. But even the most basic fact eluded me as I slumped back down, fresh tears mixing with those already stinging my eyes. “Who am I?” I whispered, more to myself than to this stranger. “Why don’t I know?”

The woman studied my face, her grip on the staff loosening. “You really don't remember, do you?” She raised her weapon away from me and offered her hand. “I have a horse nearby, and you could wear my old clothes when we get to my cabin.”",46
1lh56k1,mz2prj3,"I walked back to the house axe dangling over my shoulder, dragging a sled of fresh cut wood.  
I stepped into the opening in front of Miss Jones Farm cabin, there were 5 horses standing out front. 
A quick glance, showed me, a thin man holding Raines of horses, a man holding Miss Jones from behind, a man with a sword held to miss Jones face. He was screaming at her. Something about Gold. 

The thin man by the horses, spotted me then. He blurted out, “Mr Big some body here “ 

The man with the sword turned in my direction, shock on his face.  Yelled out, “Bevus , Butthead get out here now! Right now you idoits!”

Two large men stumbled out of the cabin. One appeared to be trying to hide a pair of Miss Jones underwear in a pocket. 

Mr Big pointed his sword at me, “ kill him , maybe she will talk then “ 

As the large men moved forward. I launched my axe at the man known as Mr Big. The blade buried deep in his head. 
I was already moving, I bent low, scooping up the handle of a nearby shovel. As the first large man got into range. I swung the shovel, the blade nearly severing his head from his body. 
The next man was almost on top on me. I spun, jumped into the air, and landed a spinning high round house kick to his head. There was a wet crunch and he fell limp to the ground. Like a sack of potatoes. 

The last man had drawn a sword and was running towards me. But he saw something when I turned to face him. He dropped his sword and started whimpering. Begging for forgiveness, begging for mercy. 

I walked up to him, kicked him in the balls. And while he was clutching his family jewels. I picked up his sword. Then cut his head off in one swing. 

I walked over to each man I had already fallen. I stabbed them through the heart and took their heads off. 

I then took all the heads across running water and burned them to ashes. 

The bodies I took in a different direction.  Built even bigger fire. Burning all to ash. 

By morning I arrived back at Miss Jones cabin.  

She did not even come outside. I gathered up the men’s clothing , weapons, equipment. Everything that was theirs. Tied it to the horses and rode off . 

After half a day’s travel I arrived at a way station. I was able to trade the men’s clothes and equipment. I got credit for Miss Jones. I traded 4 of the horses and kept 1. 

I rode out with the weapons. 

It took 2 more days hard riding. But I made it to a walled city. 

Here I traded a gate guard a dagger, for information as to who would give best price for weapons. 

I found the armory and the fellow in charge. 
“Do you be Rob the armorer? “I asked the stout fellow. 

“I be, Be thou whoust you? “ Rob slurred. 

I started laying weapons on the big table, “I be a weapon trader “ 

Robs eyes lite up, “you’ve pretty blades , what you name friendo?”

I grin at Rob, “they are works of art, made for war. You not find there likes around here.”

Rob stumbled, then sits down, “just what are you asking?”

I ramble off, “4 daggers of highest quality, 2 of the finest arming swords, 1 excellent long sword, a battle axe and a war hammer each of beautiful materials. I am not sure, what are you thinking?”

Rob rubs his face, “ I got to be able to sell them. I got to be able to feed the family, I got over head.”

I say “you got grog and strong drink to buy”

Rob says “ damn right I got strong drink to buy, a businessman got to relax “. Rob stop rubbing his face. “Hey! , what you mean ?” 

I say “what about 30 gold coins?”

Rob says “too much, 4 gold “

I say “15 gold coins?” 

Rob thinks he has me on the edge, “ 6 gold coins “

I stutter “I can’t go lower than 9 gold coins “ 

Rob smiled grabbing my hand shaking vigorously, “you have a deal my friend “

Rob pulls out a coin purse, and counts out 9 gold coins. 

I leave and begin my long ride back to Miss Jones cabin.",17
1lh56k1,mz2bvay,"The man with the sword stepped over Grammy, leveling the blade at me. “And I said this ain’t your concern.”

Instinctively, I reached out with a grasping motion, felt my hand close around something solid, and yanked. Vines shot out from the ground and wrapped around the man’s sword, pulling it from his grip. It fell to the ground with a muffled thump.

The man looked up at me, eyes wide. A look I knew all too well: fear.

I felt my stomach curl and bile rise in my throat.

The man with rusted sword and ragged clothes no longer stood in front of me. It was no longer a bandit the villagers so adamantly warned against. Before me now stood a hooded figure in dark robes, silver insignia glinting on their chest. No longer were we surrounded by forest but smooth stone, polished to a sheen. 

Behind them, a second figure, shrouded in shadow, lay curled on the ground. 

“Let her go,” I said again, voice wavering.

The figure leaned in, its hot sour breath washing over me. “You cannot escape.”

Stones beneath the robed figure cracked. I stumbled back, gasping, as vines curled their way up from the cracks and slowly began to wrap around the figure. 

The figure didn’t move. Didn’t struggle. Under its hood, there was a faint glint, and I was certain they were smiling. 

“We will find you,” the figure managed, choking out the words as tendrils curled around their neck before fully encasing them in a dark green cocoon. 

A hand tentatively brushed my shoulder, and I jumped. 

“Shhh,” came Grammy’s voice. “Aerith, it’s okay. It’s only me.” 

The name pulled me away from the dark chamber. Away from the hooded figure. 

Aerith was what Grammy had decided to call me five years ago. She said it was a type of flower found on the snow covered peaks of the Therin Mountains. A flower the same blue as my eyes and strong enough to weather the toughest of snowstorms. 

I opened my eyes to find Grammy’s wrinkled face looking down on me, full of concern.",150
1lh56k1,mz2vo93,"I found myself lying on a bed, the scent of healing herbs filling my nostrils as bandages covered most of my skin. The woman, I still didn’t even know her name, tended to me with gentle hands. The bedroom was simple, though I couldn’t help but notice an empty crib in the corner.

“Your wounds puzzle me,” she said, her fingers glowing with soft magic as she applied healing herbs to a cut on my leg. The warmth of her touch eased the dull ache that still pulsed through my body. “They should be extensive. You should be dead.”

I blinked, a chill running through me despite the warm room. “Dead?”

She nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line. “If not by the injuries, surely by the dark magic coursing through your veins.”

*Dark magic?* In me? My heart hammered against my ribs. I could feel something foreign writhing beneath my skin now that she mentioned it, like tiny insects moving under my skin. Her eyes darkened with something I couldn’t read. Knowledge? Perhaps, but whether it spelled danger or hope remained unclear.

The silence stretched between us before I managed to speak. “How was I found?”

“I was searching the woods for its gifts when I heard the sounds of battle, which should have been impossible. The ground shook, and I saw a massive fire erupting, though I suspect a magic user must have cast it. When I arrived, I found you at the center.”

I slowly nodded, though her story did nothing to jog my memories. My gaze drifted back to the crib, and something twisted in my chest. “Do you have a child?”

“My husband and I had dreams of raising a family.” She sighed, her shoulders slumping as she set down the herb poultice. “But the empire and its troubles took my husband from me. Before we departed, he gave me a map of the forest and promised to find me so we could raise our family in peace.”

“I’m sure your husband will return,” I said softly, wishing I could offer more than empty words. “You just need to be more patient.”

She bit her lip, a tear rolling down her cheek. “I’ve been patient for five years and accepted that I will live in this cabin alone.” Her eyes met mine, and something shifted in her expression, a spark of something I hadn’t seen before. “Until you arrived.”

I looked away, the weight of her gaze too making me feel uncomfortable. “I should leave when I’m healed. I don’t wish to trouble you.”

“Think nothing of it.” She stood, smoothing her hands on her worn apron. “Helping to return your memories to you will provide a nice distraction from my usual chores. Perhaps... perhaps we can help each other find what we’ve lost.”

Just before she reached the door, she turned back. “I am Sarya, by the way.”

“Sarya,” I repeated, testing the name. It felt good to have something solid to hold onto, even if it wasn’t my own identity.",45
1lh56k1,mz2bw53,"“Are you okay?” I managed. “You were-”

Grammy nodded. “Blasted rock made me trip,” she said gently, brushing the hair out of my eyes. “I’m alright.” She glanced over her shoulder. Behind her, the ground looked like a stampede of cattle had run through, and two of the bandits were fully encased in vines. “Can’t say as much about those blokes.”

“Gods,” I whispered. “I’m sorry. Are- are they…” I couldn’t bring myself to finish.

Grammy shrugged. “I say they deserve it. Attacking an old woman in the middle of the woods. And in broad daylight no less.”

Grammy stood, knees popping. “You dear, have the ears of a wolf. It’s a good thing you came when you did. Can you stand?”

I nodded, pulling myself shakily to my feet.

“Those parasites ruined a perfectly good adderfruit pie. Adelaide made it specifically for you.” Granny bent over to pick up a mangled basket. “She thinks you like them.”

I did in fact not like adderfruit pie. It was entirely too mushy. And sour.

“We’ll have to tell her it was delicious,” Granny continued, picking up the least broken of what had fallen from her basket. “The cow, at least, will like it. Now, help me carry this back to the farm.”

“I-” I started. “I mean. Will you-”

My hands began to shake. She should report me. She should report me and have me hauled away for using magic. Never to be seen or heard from again.

Grammy rested her hand at the small of my back and steered me towards the farm. “Let’s keep this between us,” she said. “We’ll find ourselves a nice, hot drink, and you can tell me what you remember.”",183
1lh56k1,mz2vtvd,"Kythaela. That was the name Sarya gave me, chosen from an old book of forest spirits she kept on her shelf. “It means ‘lost one who finds their way’,” she had said with a gentle smile.

The afternoon sun filtered through the cabin windows as I watched Sarya tend to her herb garden. Two years had passed since she found me broken in the scorched earth, and this peaceful life had become my world. The dark magic that once writhed beneath my skin had faded to barely a whisper. Sarya said it was because I was no longer connected to whatever source had fed it.

“The darkness in you… it’s military in nature,” she had explained one evening while examining the faded scars on my arms. “Someone bound shadow magic to your very bones, either by choice or by force. Without knowing your past, I cannot say which.”

Those conversations always left me restless. Had I volunteered for such power, or had I been cursed? The question haunted the quiet moments between our daily routines. I mended the roof, preserved meat for winter, and taught Sarya to track game through the forest paths I somehow knew by instinct.

But in truth, the not-knowing had become bearable. Sarya filled a void in my chest I hadn't even realized was empty. It was in her laughter at my clumsy attempts to weave baskets, her humming while cooking as I set the table, and her dozing by the fire after yet another failed memory ritual. In a way, I knew Sarya felt the same way.

I was carrying our evening meal, a fat rabbit I’d snared near the stream, when a scream shattered the forest stillness. The sound came from the direction of the cabin. Sarya’s voice, screaming.

“Sarya!” The rabbit hit the ground as I broke into a sprint, branches tearing at my clothes. The taste of fear flooded my mouth as my mind went wild. No one else came to these sacred woods. Sarya had been certain of that.

I burst through the treeline to see five mounted soldiers surrounding the cabin, their armor bearing the crimson eagle of an empire I should not have recognized. Yet somehow, I did. One guard dragged Sarya from the splintered doorway by her hair, pressing his blade to her throat while she struggled against his grip.

“This is your last chance,” he snarled. “Do you pledge your allegiance to the Empire of Vallonde?”

The guard’s eyes found mine across the clearing, and the world stopped.",48
1lh56k1,mz3kxn0,"In the grand throne room, the general marched forward to accept her gift. Hundreds of soldiers and nobles filled the vast hall, their whispers filling the air. However, she had eyes only for her emperor, her reason for being. She knelt before the golden throne, head bowed in perfect submission, as Emperor Vallonde rose.

“You have served me well, my dear general,” he proclaimed, dark magic filling in his palm like liquid. The power crackled with energy, and she could feel its hunger even from a distance. “Under my shadow, you will perform wonders beyond imagination.”

Tilting her head up, the general opened her mouth willingly. The dark magic poured down her throat like molten ice, burning and freezing simultaneously. She felt it spreading through her veins, wrapping around her bones, becoming part of her very essence. The blissful feeling was intoxicating. 

She had never felt so powerful, so complete.

Time blurred forward to a muddy battlefield. Strategic formations meant nothing when she could reshape the very nature of war itself. 

The general raised her hand, dark energy crackling between her fingers, and unleashed it upon enemy soldiers who dared stand against Vallonde’s will. Their screams of agony became songs of triumph as her magic twisted their bodies and minds, converting them into shambling enforcers for the empire. She watched with cold satisfaction as former enemy soldiers turned their weapons on their own comrades.

The scene dissolved into smoke and flame of a burning village where another rebellion had been crushed. Sitting astride her warhorse, the general surveyed the destruction with the detached appreciation of an artist reviewing her work. Charred bodies littered the streets, and the burning smoke made her soldiers cough, but she breathed it in like perfume. War was her element, but it was the breaking of spirits that truly made Vallonde’s gift worthwhile.

Dismounting with grace, she strolled toward a half-collapsed house where her guard was beating a man with the hilt of his sword. The victim’s wife and children huddled nearby, forced to watch.

“Now, now, my eager soldiers,” the general purred. The violence ceased instantly, her presence was command. “You beat a dog and it will only learn to endure the pain.” She plucked the sword from the guard’s hand and approached the family. The blade found its way to the wife’s throat, and the general felt the familiar thrill of absolute control. “But threaten to take away what the dog loves…” She pressed the steel closer until a bead of blood appeared. “And it will sing any song you wish.”

The husband's scream tore through the air. “I’ll tell you everything! They’re planning another rebellion in Morcan in two weeks, a strike on the garrison. Please, I beg you, don’t kill her!”

The general tilted her head, studying the wife's terrified eyes. It was the same look she’d seen in thousands of faces across the empire’s conquered lands. Somehow, the look of absolute dread never got old.

She didn’t bother glancing at the groveling husband. “How lovely. But tell me, broken dog…” Her voice nearly dropped to a whisper. “Do you pledge your eternal allegiance to the Empire of Vallonde?”

Still pinned beneath her soldier's boot, the man nodded frantically. “I do! By all the gods, I swear it! I am yours!”

The general smiled. 

Pulling the sword away from the woman’s throat, she watched as a tendril of dark magic, thin as spider silk, wormed its way into the woman’s neck. The wife’s eyes went blank for a moment before focusing again, now carrying a look of absolute obedience.

“Excellent,” the general murmured. “Now you have a beautiful spy in your own home. You both will perform your duties for Vallonde and ensure the rebellion will go as he sees fit.”

The memory blurred one last time.

The rebellion had been officially crushed, its leaders executed in the capital square. But the general knew two key figures remained, Gileon and Sarya. The couple had never appeared at any uprising, yet had fed rebels crucial healing magic in exchange for food and shelter. Without their support network, it was only a matter of time before desperation forced one of them into the open.

Intelligence reports spoke of a legendary map leading to a forest sanctuary even Emperor Vallonde couldn’t locate. It was dismissed by her fellow officers as rebel fantasy, but the general knew better than to ignore any possibility. She had spent months mapping potential hiding spots, looking through ancient texts and interrogating captured rebels. This hunt would be hers alone. The emperor’s personal gratitude for delivering the final rebel leaders would elevate her beyond her peers.

Now she had Gileon in her sights, and he was leading her exactly where she wanted to go.

The man darted between ancient trees, hurling bolts of healing magic that she deflected with ease. Her dark energy absorbed his light-based attacks, growing stronger with each exchange. She could have ended this chase within moments, but patience would yield far greater rewards.

“Running only delays the inevitable!” she called out, her voice echoing through the forest. She kept her distance close enough to maintain pressure, but far enough to let him think escape was possible. Gileon was wounded, favoring his left side where her shadow tendril had grazed him earlier. Soon, exhaustion would force his hand.

The general watched as he stumbled against a moss-covered boulder, clutching his ribs. His breathing came in ragged gasps as he glanced around desperately. Then, with a surge of magic, he conjured a shimmering portal in the air.

Exactly what she’d been waiting for.

As Gileon leaped through the dimensional gateway, the general sprinted forward and dove after him, her fingertips grazing the portal’s edge just as it began to collapse. The magical backlash tore her from visibility, but she managed to tumble through into the sacred woods on the other side. Behind her, only her map leading to this spot remained scattered on the forest floor.

She emerged rolling, already raising her guard, but Gileon’s wild punch still caught her jaw. The blow cast away her invisibility as she spat blood, glaring at the rebel mage with fury.

“Assaulting Vallonde’s prized general?” she snarled, wiping crimson from her lips. “I’ll see to it that you watch me break your precious wife before I drag you both to Vallonde’s feet.”

The words seemed to ignite something in Gileon as he screamed. His healing magic shifted, becoming raw elemental force as he threw himself at her with the fury of a man with nothing left to lose. They traded devastating blows, their combined magic tearing ancient trees apart and ripping the sacred earth apart. Light and darkness clashed in explosions, sending tremors through the ground.

The general found herself genuinely challenged for the first time in years. Gileon fought not for victory, but for the woman he loved. That very desperation made him dangerous in ways her military strategy couldn’t predict as her injuries grew. Still, her dark magic was ultimately superior. She was already preparing the final strike when she saw something that made her blood freeze.

Gileon’s eyes held no fear, only acceptance. His hands glowed not with attack magic, but with something far more terrifying, a self-immolation spell that would consume both their life forces in a massive explosion. She tried to stop it, but it was already too late.

“For Sarya,” he whispered.

The world erupted in blinding white fire.

When the flames cleared, General Misara lay broken on scorched earth, her memories already fragmenting like ash on the wind. Through dimming vision, she saw Gileon’s body dissolving into golden dots of light, his sacrifice complete. In his final moments, his lips moved in what might have been a prayer.

Or perhaps her name.

Then darkness claimed them both, and the forest fell silent.",55
1lh56k1,mz7bx72,"“Gen… General Misara,” the guard gasped, moving his sword away from Sarya’s neck but still gripping her hair tightly. “We thought you had died. Vallonde himself even dedicated a day in your honor.”

The name hit me like a punch. Misara. My true name, the one I’d carried into battle, the one whispered in fear across the empire. But standing here in simple forest clothes, watching Sarya’s face transform from confusion to dawning horror, I felt the fracture in my soul widen. Was I Misara, the emperor’s butcher? Or Kythaela, the woman who’d learned to weave baskets and laugh at shared jokes?

I watched as the riders’ faces shifted from alert to fearful recognition, then to reverent awe. Their horses stamped nervously, sensing the tension that now crackled through the clearing like approaching lightning. One soldier actually dismounted and knelt, his armor clanking against the forest floor.

However, Sarya’s eyes never left mine. In them, I saw the exact moment she understood not just who I was, but what it meant. The only way I could have found this sanctuary was by following Gileon. By fighting him. The woman who had tenderly healed my wounds now stared at me with the knowledge that I had killed her husband.

But why? Why had she spent two years trying to restore the memories of her husband’s murderer? The question tore through me, but I forced it aside. Whatever her reasons, whatever game she’d been playing, none of it mattered now. I had to get her out of this alive.

Squaring my shoulders, I felt the familiar mantle of command settle over me like a second skin. The dark magic whispered along my bones, eager to be unleashed once more. Where I once felt comfort, its touch now felt like writhing worms beneath my flesh. I marched toward the guard, each step reminding me of the imperial authority used to carry.

“Do you know this woman?” I demanded, my voice carrying the same commanding tone that had once made generals twice my age tremble. The guard mumbled something unintelligible, his grip on Sarya loosening slightly.

“Speak up.” The words came out sharper than I intended, and I could feel several soldiers flinching behind me.

“No, General,” he muttered, finally releasing Sarya completely. She stumbled back, rubbing her throat, but her gaze remained fixed on me with a look I couldn’t read.

“What was that?” I stepped closer, letting just a hint of shadow flicker around my fingers. The guard’s face went pale.

“No, General Misara, but this woman was resisting arrest and…”

“That woman,” I snapped, the heat of dark magic rising beneath my skin like fever, “is the reason why I am here and reprimanding you for your incompetence.” The familiar power felt alien now, a corruption I’d somehow forgotten how to want. “If I had arrived moments later and found you had slain her, all of you would have been begging for a merciful death.”

The guard raised his hands in surrender, backing away from both Sarya and me. “We mean no offense, General. We were only following orders to secure the area.”

I surveyed the mounted soldiers, noting how their hands had moved away from their weapons entirely. The look of terror should have been reassuring. This is what I am supposed to be. Yet, the taste of their fear tasted like ash in my mouth.

Yet, I couldn’t dwell on these conflicting feelings. There was only one way for these soldiers to find the forest that eluded even Vallonde’s magic. “Who has my map?”

A nervous soldier raised her trembling hand, clutching the worn parchment. “We found it several weeks ago, General. It had almost faded completely. Your dark magic ensured it couldn’t be recorded or copied, and…”

Her words died as I slowly approached, my hand extended. The soldier’s horse shied away from me, whinnying in distress. “Give it to me. Now.”

The soldier didn’t need to be told twice, practically throwing the map into my grasp. As my fingers touched the parchment, I felt the echo of my former self, the methodical hunter who had tracked rebels across the empire. Almost unreadable, I could recognize every safe house the map showed, every hidden route, and every sanctuary where dissidents might hide.

Including this one.

I looked back at Sarya, who was watching this display of power with something that might have been recognition or revulsion. In her eyes, I saw not the gentle woman who had saved me, but the reflection of who I truly was.

Monster.

“We are done here,” I finally said, crushing the weathered map under my fist. “I need one moment with her. Alone.”

“But General, our orders…” I shot the guard with a glare that could have frozen his blood. “As you desire, General.”

As the guard and soldiers retreated, I followed Sarya back inside what had been our home. The furniture lay scattered across the floor. Chairs were overturned, cushions torn, shelves emptied. How many homes had seen similar fates under my command?

I watched as Sarya struggled to lift an overturned couch. For a moment, I hesitated. Would helping her feel like mockery? An attempt to ease my own guilt while she faced exile or worse?

But then I stepped forward and grasped the other end, setting the crumpled map aside on the floor. Together, we lifted the couch back to its proper place.

“Did you know?” I asked, my hand still resting on the couch’s arm. “When you found me bleeding in the forest... did you know I was the one who killed Gileon?”

Sarya’s shoulders tensed, but she didn’t look away. “I suspected. Your broken armor, the dark magic, your hunting skills. You being the empire’s general was the most likely answer for who you were.”

“Then why?” I asked, harsher than I intended. “Why save someone who destroyed your life? Vollonde teaches that mercy toward enemies is weakness. You could have enacted your revenge when you found me.”

“Because you weren’t General Misara when I found you.” Sarya traced a line across the couch’s fabric, her voice soft but steady. “You were Kythaela… broken, lost, and human. Even now, with all your memories restored, you’re not thinking of returning to your emperor’s side. You’re thinking of how to protect me.”

She was right. Even with the dark magic stirring in my veins, even with Vollonde’s conditioning reasserting itself, my first instinct had been to shield her from the guard’s blade.

“You have every right to despise me,” I said, glancing toward the doorway where the soldiers waited. “I can order them to leave this forest forever. I can pay whatever price you ask, give you enough gold to start anywhere else…”

“And then what?” Sarya moved to where the map lay crumpled on the floor. Kneeling, she smoothed out its creases with gentle fingers before lifting it toward me. “You return to Vollonde empty-handed? Face his wrath for losing his target?”

I stared at the map. The only key to this sacred place, now offered back by the woman whose sanctuary it had violated. Was this her saying her door will be open for me?

“I wouldn’t return empty-handed.” The words came out hollow, unconvincing even to my own ears. “He would have his general back. That should be… enough.”

But even as I spoke, I could feel the lie. Vollonde’s rage at my failure, at the two years lost, at returning without the rebels’ deaths to show for it. The punishments that awaited those who disappointed him.

“I don’t need your protection, Kythaela,” Sarya continued, using the name that had been mine when I was nothing but broken flesh and fevered dreams. Tears gathered in her eyes, but her gaze never wavered. “But I wouldn’t mind... waiting to see you again. When you decide who you truly are.”

A lump rose in my throat. “I may not survive what comes next,” I whispered. “And even if I do... it could be years before I’m free to choose anything. We may never meet again.”

Sarya’s smile was soft, but I could see the sadness in them. “Do you remember what you told me once? About Gileon?” She paused, letting the memory surface. “You said I needed to be patient and wait a little longer for my husband’s return. Perhaps... you should take your own advice.”

The irony cut deeper than any sword I wielded. Comfort I had offered without understanding, now returned when I needed it most. My vision blurred as tears finally escaped, tracking down my cheeks unchecked. 

My hands quickly wiped them away before reaching for the map. As I took it from her hands, our touch lingered. This was farewell, but also a promise that we will meet again.

Then I pulled away, straightening my shoulders, letting the familiar cold settle over my features. The general’s mask slipped back into place, but underneath, something of Kythaela remained.

Hidden, but not forgotten.

1lhkzql,mz4y4sz,"We have countless myths, legends, and tales from times long gone about monsters.  
Be them named monster, demons, creatures, beasts, angels, spirits, and so much more...they are all the same: inhuman, supernatural entities...that are so, so much older than humans.  
What if...  
What if I told you that they were the real ""people"" , the real inhabitants of Earth.  
And us...humans, are the ""monsters"", the ""invaders"".  
I have found records of something that could change the world...  
Forever.

  
Eons ago, when Earth was different, and Gods, and demigods and myriad creatures, not just humans were given spirit, and given wisdom, things were lively.  
The many races inhabited the planet, created their own little paradises, and of course...waged wars.  
How could conflict miss when there are so many different people on the same plane of existence?  
Well, these wars were waged with soldiers, with magic, with divinity...  
But one day, a certain Alchemist, having been on the losing side, devised a terrible, terrible concoction.  
A plague.  
One that erases the special genes that allow living beings to communicate with nature, to communicate with the energy around us.  
That's when it started: the no-mana plague.

  
It swept the lands, transforming the species back into their primal forms.  
The many genes, and special abilities that required resonance with the outside energy were slowly lost, and angels, demons, and the myriad races started to lose their defining features.  
Their wisdom, and intelligence also receded...and the divine kingdoms, and countries collapsed.  
Soon, the humanoid races all resembled each other, while the beasts, and creatures became...less.  
Tribes were the thing again...and the new species that appeared, was divided.  
Depending how much the plague affected the race, that's how far they devolved.  
And that is how the ancestors of the homo sapiens began.  
Yes.  
Our ancestors, are the devolved, ""monsters"", as we call them.

  
I have a perfect chronology, and also evidence in form of old writings...  
Much, much older, even than what we thought as being ""the first human ancestors' like the Sahelanthropus tchadensis.   
It also somewhat explains several of the missing links, by using the former species' resistance against the plague, which then divided the devolution process in different stages.  
Problem is...this is all in the form of stories.  
Who will believe me?  
Believe that before humans, before mammals, actually, in the times of dinosaurs, there already have been civilizations of humanoid creatures?  
And the myths and legends are actual history...not fiction.",5
1lgtwz8,myzcohn,"It felt wrong. The air was so dirty, it felt like I was breathing ash.

I glanced around the room, the shimmering golden light of my [Aegis] spell the only thing separating me from the stunned medical professionals on the other side. A quick silent-cast of [Thought Acceleration] brought the world to a standstill as I contemplated my return.

Four hundred and eleven years. I had lived in Rovira for longer than most, my player attributes easily carrying me to the peak of magical power decades faster than even my closest peers. I had mastered more than half of the known magical disciplines, even invented a few of my own. I founded a guild, guided an entire nation into a new era of peace and magical innovation, and I likely would have gone down as the single greatest mage in the last ten millennia.

But now I was back on Earth, and it hurt to breathe. A cast of [Purify] swelled in my chest for a moment, gentle green light bursting forth in a wave that roared forth from the room. In moments the air felt different, cleaner and more soothing. The doctors before me seemed stunned, a few rushed from the room to investigate what I had done. They needn't have bothered, my [Purify] likely covered half the city by now. Plenty of individuals would be coming to investigate the epicenter.

I moved my hands and adjusted my hospital gown as I began to stand, my passive regeneration already fighting back the atrophy in my body. Instead of worrying over that, my mind spread outwards, to the three rooms nearest my own. And I felt them there... my companions.

I lowered my [Aegis], and with a thought I was dressed in my guild regalia once more. ""Hello. My name is Otto, I am a level 997 [Prismatic Mana Sophont]. Thank you for the care you have shown my body whilst my soul was abroad.""

My mother...mom, has been working hard these 3 years, yes only 3 years passed in this world, to keep me alive.  
Many wanted to shut off the life support after a year, but not her.  
She knew I will be back.  
Maybe magic while not apparent, really exists here, and these ""motherly intuition"" and ""6th sense"" stuff, are actually dream magic, or divination?  
I can hear her thoughts, I can feel her happiness.  
How do I tell her I lived tens of thousands of years, and have a family that could build an entire country in our world...and that my feelings for this life are...almost non-existent?

  
""I know you have lived a life in the game, but you will have to come to terms that this is your real life."" the therapist starts. It's been 6 months since I came back, and I can walk, and eat and talk on my own, but they can see it.  
How unaffected I am by everything here. And the fact that I spend all my time researching the game company doesn't help with the impressions.  
""I can understand that, but please, if I felt, saw, experienced an entire life there... Why would that be any less real, than what is here?"" I ask her.  
She falls silent. Yeah, this always happen.  
But I don't care, I will go back, no matter what.

  
It's been a year, and basically I confirmed that magic exists on Earth, its just dormant, and much more difficult to communicate with.  
But it exists, and it is almost stronger, and purer that what we had on Eldria.  
I can do it. I can open a portal back home.  
""Honey! I am home!"" mom says from downstairs.  
She spent each free moment of hers with me...  
Ever since dad died when I was a kid...we were there for each other, the two of us against the world.  
""What are you doing?"" she asks, coming into my room, watching me scribble the runes.  
""Come, mom. I will show you your great-great-great-great-grandkids, and your daughter-in-law."" I saw.  
She frowns, then smile, willing to humor me, before gasping...as a portal opens.  
""Let's go...home."" I say.  
She follows without a moment of hesitation...  
Maybe this is why I have been returned...to get mom to a better place.",581
1lgtwz8,myzb5sw,"No one had noticed the magic that appeared, too busy with their tasks at hand.  I let the spell go almost immediately, but knew this wasn't something I wanted to share right now.  The doctors and nurses completed their tasks and after a few round of questions, left me alone in the room.  A few hours later, a new nurse popped in to take my vitals and chatted about how excited everyone was that I had woken up.  While she was finishing up, a young doctor, probably freshly minted, came in and conferred with the nurse.  I could tell that he was lusting after her, but trying to remain professional at the same time. His words, obviously in an effort to impress her with his access to the project, painted a bleak picture for me.  They left together, making a coffee date while I lay there stunned at the news.

Struggling to summon a minor amount of power, I lay there in hospital bed, watching magical energy playfully twist between my fingers as I contemplated my next move.  The amount of available mana on Earth was sparse, far different from the VR world..  Everything from the VR experience still felt raw and more real than where I was now.  A single tear escaped my eye, to be joined by the multitude of others that followed when realization that the life I had painstakingly built, the loving family I'd had, were all just code in a computer database somewhere.  I yearned to rejoin them, but the doctor had offhandedly remarked that I could never return.  That shattered me.  I learned that the entire system had been taken offline and scrubbed back to the base version.  All of my adventures, my wins and losses, my family and treasures were gone with ignorant keystrokes.

But I still had my skills.  Physically, I wasn't even near where I had been in the game, but all the knowledge still sat in my brain, waiting to be used.  I glanced around the room, first with my normal vision before slipping into my alternate, mana detecting mode.  I could trace the wiring in the room as if the walls were ghosts of their former selves.  I could see the usual connections outlets and light switches, but there was an unusually thick cluster that connected to what looked like a device near the corner of the room.  Switching back, the only thing there was a wall clock with dark spots on it, as if the face were a Dalmatian. I let my mind expand outward, sensing emotions and triggering my innate Danger Sense.  It went off immediately as I felt the hostile, malevolent intentions coming from down the hall directed towards me.  It wasn't inherently violent, but promised pain.

*They're watching me*, I thought. After a moment or two, I made a decision.  *Let them watch this*.

The spell I cast as a favorite of mine from the other world.  I had used it in and out of combat, and had refined it down to a single gesture and a spoken word.  Power slowly filled my body as I drew it from the near empty environment around me and I said the command word with a slight twist of theatrics, invoking a short teleportation spell.  To the people watching on their screens, there was a flash of light and puff of colored smoke and the empty blanket on the bed slowly settled to occupy the space I had been taking.

I stood in the parking structure of the hospital, next to a beat up Toyota Celica with out of state plates.  I could faintly hear the alarm system at the hospital going off.  I imagined the panic and commotion going on in the room I had just vacated, but I needed to keep moving to stay ahead of the people who planned to use me for their own ends.

Logically, I knew I couldn't go home.  They knew everything about me, including my address.  I even remember signing that form for them to upkeep my apartment during the course of the program.  My parents and sibling were probably compromised as well.  Sadly, I felt less of a connection to them than I had to my virtual family.  The centuries I had lived virtually removed most of the feelings I had for them, and while this was bittersweet, it gave me the freedom for what would come next.",166
1lgtwz8,myz6a0x,"Well, if that works, then-

I open a portal home. To family. My wife peeps through, and finds me, unchanged since we first met, on the hospital bed. My children, grown up, are confused, but recognise me despite me being younger here than there.  
I do not see myself through the portal; there is no 'me' there anymore.

The staff are freaking out. The device trying to handle my pace shut off, and the bits plugged into me have been ejected by fantastical means without doing any harm to me.

My family - my progenitors, and so on - had parted from this world. My friends, forgotten about me. One or two of them kept an eye, but only one ever visited me, wondering whether I'd even return.

And now I have.

A week has passed since my awakening; it feels like the leylines here have been already ignited - invigorated - communed with? I hear stories of others having awakened with literal magic, some even parting for other worlds where their anchorage had settled.

I've invited my closest friend to the other side to find adventure and solitude, and provided him a means to call upon me there should he need it.

I hadn't heard from him in that time, besides occasional texts of his relief - freed from this world's constraints.  
...He'll be fine.

I begin going through the troublesome complications of sorting out matters with the press and systems too rigid for my new state of being to fit within.

It's like trying to swim in shallow water that barely goes up to your feet.

So, I start with some major things from that 'game' world.  
With the Church of the Three Ls. The cases of our world bleeding over. Of the characters there hearing the stream-talk, accessing -our- internet, playing -our- games.

The more I told them, the more I -showed- them, even hosting in-person demonstrations for the unconvinced, the more the ones who made that world virtual became... enthused with it.

Now, I take a night's sleep in a place I called my other-home, it having been vacant of it's previous cohabitants, and having been permitted as a place of stay for my family so that I may show them this world.

Thankfully their physiologies are resilient; this world is full of chemical mayhem and longterm entropic residuals, and I'd rather my love not be rendered ill by the mere act of seeing what a world void of magic and full of humanity has been like.

Sure, there's a lot to dislike, but that's to be said of any world rife with civilized life in the ways we recognise it.

...But first I must tend to my wife.",75
1lgtwz8,myzcch6,"I was noting down the most outstanding readings from the scanner. After we administered the neuroactive solution, the patient's neural activity skyrocketed and exhibited patterns foreign to me in all my years studying this field. The head doctor announced that he would begin the decoupling procedure. My fellow observers and I awaited it with bated breath from behind the glass screen to the operating room.


The patient, Laura Rowe, was the first to experience a neuro-VR headset malfunction of the kind that trapped her mind's activity in a virtual world. Forcefully disengaging the apparatus proved nearly impossible because of the risk it posed to her brain - so she had been placed in a sustained comatose state for five years. In that time, many more such incidents occurred. Teams of researchers and doctors worked tirelessly to find some means of bringing them back.


Eventually, we managed to make headway. Laura's brain had been appropriately primed for the procedure, so the headset was removed with ease. Still, her readings were spiking in abnormal ways. I thought the scanner must have been faulty.


The girl jumped from her bed with a speed and agility that shouldn't belong to someone who had been comatose for five years. More than that, she took a defensive stance—her left forearm shielding her chest while her right hand flew to her hip in search of something.


It was far from unexpected that someone in her circumstances - who had essentially lived for years in a different world - would have difficulty adjusting to reality. What shocked me was the fact that where her left forearm stood, the glowing figure of a shield began appearing and covering her form. In her right hand, something akin to a magic staff materialized. Her face showed traces of surprise, which were quickly replaced by concern.


I was beginning to doubt my sanity, so I turned to a fellow on my left. ""Are you... seeing this too?"" I inquired.


""If you're asking, I'm guessing I'm not mad then. Good,"" he muttered before returning his gaze to the patient.


The head doctor, Adam, who was in the room with her, shook off his surprise and began speaking to her. ""Uh, Miss Laura, I know you must be confused and disoriented, but I assure you that you are safe here. Please lie down and I will explain everything."" His voice must have been as calm as he could manage to make it. Still, it was shaky and betrayed the fact that he would have appreciated an explanation himself.


She did not reply immediately. Instead, she extended her right hand and inspected it. She looked at her staff for a few seconds, scared, before bringing it forward slightly and summoning a small ball of painfully bright light. It stretched out into a larger flat disk. From the angle I was positioned, I could see inside it - there was a woman with long hair holding a crying child. It hurt to look into that light, but I forced myself to capture as much information about this event as I could. It soon disappeared, but the look on Laura's face changed to one of great relief.


My mind was desperately attempting to discern what my next course of action should be. The woman could, after all, pose a danger we had no means of addressing. Yet what department or agency could I have called? What was even happening?


""The real world? It has been a while,"" were the first words that came out of her mouth after she inspected her surroundings.


""I'm sure your intentions were all well and good, but I see no reason to remain here. I hope you understand."" Her stance had relaxed, and she spoke casually.


""Ah - what do you mean? Are those weapons?"" Adam asked. The poor guy must have lost it.


Laura ignored him, turning to a nearby mirror. She touched her face with curiosity. ""So I have to live with this face now? A pity. Aris is in for a shock. I wonder if Liam will recognize me?"" she appeared to be thinking aloud.


""Right! Well, I appreciate you keeping this body alive so far! No need to bother with that anymore. I'll be leaving now, before my wife decides she needs to come rescue me. Byee!"" she chirped, before using her staff to carve a tear into the space behind her - like a localized incision into the fabric of reality, a hole with gleaming edges. She jumped through it, and it closed neatly behind her. Adam was left alone, staring madly at the empty room before him.


""You saw that too?"" I turned to my left once more.


""Mhm. How long until the government weaponizes this, do you wager?""",63
1lgtwz8,mz1hz5w,"\[Blooming Trouble\]

""No way!"" The buff icon appeared in the top left corner of his vision, and Drew opened his eyes wider. He sat up and immediately tried a regeneration buff only to see it take effect as well. As he processed the information, a nurse had heard him awake. She walked in to see him glowing with several auras, but he dismissed them when she entered the room. 

""Glad to see your finally awake,"" she smiled at him as she reached the side of his bed. 

""Where are my parents?"" that was the most important question. They'd gone to great lengths to pull him out of the game, and now they weren't there when he woke up. Then, he had another realization. Had they waited too long? 

""How long was I out?"" he asked. He started testing his abilities as soon as he was conscious, so he didn't know if that was why he felt so well. He'd spent years in the game, and unconscious in a soil bed. The nanos that connected him to the AlterNet were supposed to keep him healthy. However, he had no idea how long ago he'd been disconnected and brought to the hospital.  It certainly looked like a vastly different hospital than the one he remembered before the game. But, the nurse's uniform had a nametag that said, 'Fennville Hospital' along with her name, 'Miranda'. 

""They're on the way,"" she reassured him. ""You weren't out very long at all,"" she smiled. ""You just got here; a bit ahead of them."" 

""Oh,"" he nodded, and at the moment the door opened again. Both parents rushed in to hug him. He remembered the warmth and the smell of holding them, and he let himself tear up a bit. ""I thought I'd never get to hold you guys like that again!"" he grinned. His mother, an austere, lean woman with silver hair, seemed to get even more emotional at that. She was overjoyed at seeing him again. 

""So, what'd I miss?"" he asked finally. The hug dragged on longer than even he expected, and both his parents were unexpectedly quiet. But, he imagined there was so much to say that it was hard to know where to start. 

It wasn't like they hadn't kept in touch. He could still communicate with email and text from within the game. When he first logged in, everything was so real and immersive it felt like a whole new life entirely. One that he designed himself. Thanks to that, and the ability to communicate to the outside world, he began spending more and more time logged in to the AlterNet. Then, everything changed one day when he couldn't log out. He'd spent almost three months in the game, trusting the nanos to deliver nutrients to his body and suddenly the option was no longer available. 

His parents didn't even get mad. They were happy to hear from him at all, and everyone went about their lives as if things were normal. Drew met someone and had a family, and he shared it all with his parents by sending them photos of their 'digital grandchildren'. Then, his parents said there might be a way to get him out, and they started coordinating a rescue. Drew had kept his awareness of the game and he enjoyed his wife's company, but he never let himself get attached. He repeated it all the time whenever talking to his parents, and even when showing off the kids, he was adamant they were only NPCs. The decision to leave was never in question. 

""Well...,"" his dad sighed as his mom squeezed Drew's hand. ""...we know what happened, and how,"" he said. The older man looked into his son's eyes with tears forming. ""... you died, son.""

""What?"" Drew didn't know how to make sense of that. 

""It's called 'Blooming'. Unfortunately, the back alley AlterNet connection you got didn't give you all the necessary warnings. But, Sharp Development showed up on this Earth with the real AlterNet, and that's how we set this up."" 

""What?"" Drew shook his head again. He understood the general idea, but he was still confused. ""I died, and I came back?"" 



\*\*\* Thank you for reading! I’m responding to prompts every day. This is story #2713 in a row. (Story #171 in year eight). This story is part of an ongoing saga that takes place in my universe.",24
1lgtwz8,myzdxq5,"The last thing I remember was her voice.

""Two days,"" Mirandeya said, the storm curling her hair across her face. ""If you don’t return with the key before then, the Door will close. And it won’t open for you again.""

Behind her, beyond the glass, my wife and daughter stood. Smiling. Waiting. I pressed my palm to the pane. My daughter mirrored me with her small hand. I smiled back.

Then I turned. Faced the portal.  
Stepped forward.

Nothing.

No sound. No weight. No light.  
Just absence. Cold, dry, infinite.

Then—impact.

I crashed downward into a bed, lungs seizing, eyes snapping open.

White ceiling. Hospital lights. A dull beeping to my left. The air stank of antiseptic and recycled air.

A nurse walked in pushing a cart, not noticing me at first. When she did, the tray in her hands clattered to the floor. She screamed and ran.

A doctor came next. Flashlight in my eyes, clipboard, calm voice.

“You’ve been unconscious. Three years. VR accident. Neural trauma. It’s a miracle you woke up.”

I didn’t answer.

I knew this world. Recognized it.  
The outer layer. The testing ground.

They would lie. They had to.

“I am Seradin Vael,” I told him. “Sealed Voice of the Seventh Gate. I’ve come to retrieve the key. Time is short.”

He looked at me carefully. Wrote something.

Then: “What do you think of the name Peter Dawes?”

I stared back.

He said Peter had a wife. Kids. A life in Indiana. He showed me a photo album.

I didn’t recognize anyone.

Later, they brought “my family.” A crying woman. Two teens. She hugged me. Told me she missed me every day. That I was finally home.

I smiled gently. Told them I’d had dreams. Nothing more.

I didn’t tell them about the kingdom. About the real family waiting on the other side of the Door. They wouldn’t understand.

For days I waited. Watched. Marked time in silence. The seal was closing. I needed the key.

Eventually, the doctor returned with it. A small metal object. Cold in my hand. Stamped: **317.**

I knew that number. Three mages. One swordbearer. Seven mortals. The Founding Code.

He gave it to me after I said the words he needed to hear.

“I know now,” I told him, eyes low. “I’m Peter Dawes. It was just a simulation.”",34
1lgtwz8,mz1i0fw,"\[part.b\]

""'Blooming' is a way to permanently live in the AlterNet,"" his dad started the explanation. ""The nanos that are supposed to keep you alive continue improving the process until basically they give you a root system. Then, a redwood sapling starts growing in you, and out of you, capturing your soul and taking over as your body. We didn't know how to tell you there was a sapling coming out of your chest."" 



""I was a tree??"" it was concerning in and of itself, but there were deeper implications. ""How did I come back from being a tree??"" As he asked the question, he felt his mom squeeze his hand tighter, and warm tears landed on his fingers. 



""You don't come back from that, son,"" his dad shook his head. 



""I was rescued... wasn't I?"" he asked. His dad gave another subtle shake. 



""Not in the way you might think. Your 'rescue' is just us getting a chance to reunite,"" he gestured at the hospital around them. ""We're in the AlterNet right now. We were making our characters when you woke up,"" he added.  



""So.... my body's dead, or I guess a tree. I'm still 'trapped' in the AlterNet, then?"" he asked. 



""Your spirit is alive,"" his dad nodded. ""This will be much better than just texts and emails.""



""Yeah...,"" Drew nodded. He was happy, but also not. ""But now I have to go through getting a divorce instead of just leaving.""",24
1lgtwz8,myzdyxb,"He believed me.

That night, I waited for the ward to sleep. Drew the seal beneath the window with a spoon and a broken pen. Whispered the names. Placed the key at the center.

Nothing.

Tried again. Different order. Adjusted angles. Nothing.

The portal wouldn’t open.

I sat in the dark, hands shaking, key gripped tight. Breathing shallow. Walls pressing in.

Then I heard her.

“Daddy…”

Faint. Clear. My daughter’s voice.

I turned. The window was fogged with condensation—but there, in the center, a small handprint pressed against the glass.

I stood. Reached out.

Light split the window frame. Golden, pulsing, alive. Through it, I saw the marble halls. Banners of the Seven. Home.

I dragged the chair to the door. Wedged it tight under the handle.

Footsteps approached from the hallway.

“Peter?” the nurse’s voice. “We heard something—are you okay?”

I didn’t answer.

I stepped onto the radiator. The wind from the portal hit my face. It smelled like rain on stone.

I looked back once.

The door handle rattled.

“Please,” she said. “Let us in.”

I turned toward the light.

And stepped forward.

  
**Two minutes later**  
**Outside Room 317**

The nurse stood with her phone to her ear, staring into the empty room.

“Doctor?” she said. “You need to come in. Right now.”

“What happened?”

She swallowed.

“Patient’s gone.”",39
1lgtwz8,myz8zo1,"Thanks! And thank you for the prompt!

1lh5kij,mz1wedd,"""Jessot, come in now!""

The boy looked down from his seat on the cottage roof. Dark hair covered the top half of his face, hiding the pair of eyes that few dared meet. Not for appearance, for the deep brown irises were hardly uncommon. What was though was the intensity that shone within. Like he held back a presence that would rattle anyone to their core. Like he could see into a person's innermost thoughts, and know whatever they tried to hide.

It was a look he had had since he was born. His birth had come during the Day of Black Sun, an auspicious event. Yet it was no fanfare that came with his arrival. No, it was screams. Screams from his mother, laying eyes on him for the first time. She had screamed and screamed, trying to escape despite the cord connecting them. She called him monster, the first name he was given.

His father had taken him nonetheless. He had brought Jessot home, and given him the name of his father's father. There he was raised, his mother vanishing not two days after his brith. A boy more comfortable alone with his thoughts, who always listened, yet seldom spoke. A boy who leapt from the roof without fear, stepping inside to find his father.

Henron watched his son enter, walking quietly. He worried for him, as all parents did. He hoped Jessot would grow up happy. Not necessarily rich and famous, but happy. He hoped he would find someone nice to settle with, and have a trade he enjoyed.

But for now, the most important worry was dinner. A simple spread of stew and bread, a staple of their home. Jessot sat opposite his father, as they shared the meal. Henron filled the air with his voice, talking about the farm, his carving hobby, even gossip from the village. And Jessot listened, absorbing it all in silence.

It was only as they began to clear that something changed. A knock at the door, making Henron frown. He left to answer it, leaving his son to carry on clearing.

Yet Jessot stopped to the sound of raised voices. He set down the empty pot, quietly padding out to find the commotion. There he saw his father arguing with a pair of heavy set men. Both bore long healed scars, as one spoke with a sneer. ""-shame you lack hospitality, friend. But maybe you'll open your coin purse instead?""

Henron opened his mouth to shout back, but was interrupted by a quiet voice behind. One that was seldom heard, and shook with authority. ""Judgement.""

The two men froze, as Henron turned to look. Jessot walked up, staring directly at the two. The thugs started shaking, trembling beneath his gaze. He watched them without blinking, as they slowly sank to the ground, twitching silently.

Finally they stopped. Jessot looked up at Henron, as his father spoke breathlessly. ""What... was that?""

And his son replied, in a voice far older than he should have. ""I judged them, and found them wanting.""",80
1lh5kij,mz26oae,"But in my case…

I was born during a powerful eclipse.

Which, in this world, is more a curse than a blessing.

While growing up, I learned that people born on the day of an eclipse—like me—are called Children of Doom.

Most children are abandoned the moment they’re born—offered to the Forest of Abyss as a sacrifice.

But I was lucky...

An old woman found me before the forest did. She raised me as her own. Since then, I’ve been hiding from people’s eyes.

Because people would kill me on sight.

Every eighteen years, the cursed eclipse returns. And tomorrow... is my eighteenth birthday.

For that occasion, Granny suggested we go to the market to buy ingredients so we could celebrate my birthday with joy.

So, Granny and I were walking through the village market, picking out ingredients for tonight’s dinner.

The sky was clear, peaceful, and calm. Villagers were talking and bargaining.

Until—

A shadow fell over the earth.

People gasped, shielding their eyes.

“The eclipse?!”

“What? No—it's a day early!”

I looked up, eyes wide.

It was happening... now? It was supposed to be tomorrow!

The sun was disappearing behind the moon.

“This has never happened before!”

Panic spread like wildfire.

My grandmother grabbed my hand, her voice trembling.

“Celus... run. Now.”

“Granny?” I looked at her panicked expression. “Why—?”

“Don’t ask questions!” she hissed, shoving me away. “Run, before it consumes the whole sun! Hide under anything!”

I hesitated, but nodded—and ran.

But...

I was too late.

My body suddenly cracked like dried earth, glowing fissures blooming across my skin—lava burning from within.

I collapsed.

Screams erupted around me.

“GET AWAY FROM HIM! THAT’S A CHILD OF DOOM!”

I barely heard them. Just the agony.

Flowers wilted in a nearby shop. Fruit rotted on the vine.

The people scattered, afraid they’d end up like those flowers.

The pain was too much to handle. I thought it would end soon.

But I was saved...

Good thing eclipses don’t last long.

The sun broke free slowly...

Light returned. The eclipse ended.
So did the cracks.

I gasped for air, heart pounding in my ears.

“How... how did he survive?”

“They’re supposed to die at birth!”

“We have to end him now—before more chaos comes!”

“No!”

My grandmother stepped in front of me. “Don’t touch him! He is my grandson!”

“Can’t you see?” someone shouted. “The eclipse arrived early! The omens are changing! We can’t let a Child of Doom walk free!”

I looked up to see panic in their eyes. They were ready to pick up weapons... there was no doubt.

“We can’t let him walk—”

“Enough.”

A booming voice silenced the crowd.

Figures in tall silver armor emerged, cutting through the people.

“What happens next will be decided by the Queen.”

A hush fell.

A woman stepped forward—tall, cloaked in white, her face hidden behind silk. Only her long black hair spilled from the veil.

Whispers rippled:

“The Moon Queen...?”
“Warriors of the Dawn... they’ve come?”
“The Queen must have seen it all... in her visions.”

She knelt beside me, close enough that I could feel the cold energy rolling off her. She gently tilted my chin.

“It’s my first time seeing a Child of Doom,” she said softly, inspecting me closely. I felt a shiver run down my spine.

Then she paused.

“Or should I say... the end of humanity.”",23
1lh5kij,mz4vdl8,"An eclipse. For the world, dawn was the time of warriors. Of strong men, women and people who would go on to fight great battles. The full moon provides instead great wisdom; the power to see the most likely outcome and to steer the course of history with one well placed word. 

But an eclipse was a bad omen. Just as gray skies foretold turmoil and strife. The eclipse was the sign that blood would soon be spilled. The sun, swallowed by the moon until naught but a single ring of red remained. The color white, soon to be stained crimson. 

During one such eclipse, the firstborn daughter of the warrior king Renjørn the righteous arrived. Her mother, sapped of strength and having suffered labor under the dark power of the fell omen, perished soon after. But the babe that remained held intelligence most foul in her eyes. Unlike so many other children, she did not cry upon her first draw of breath. She did not scream, wail or struggle in the arms of her father. Instead, her icy blue eyes studied him with uncanny precision. 

It was on her tenth birthday that the princess displayed the influence of the eclipse. Eternally quiet, almost mute, the young woman looked up and predicted the death of her father's advisor. 

""He will die fighting bandits. They want the gold inside his carriage."" 

She said, her voice calm and level despite the hoarseness that came with disuse. Her eyes had met her father's for the first time since the day of her birth. And once more, they studied their progenitor. And just like that, her frightening power was gone. The prophecy came true less than a day later when the advisor fled the kingdom with nothing but the clothes and money he had. And his decision to forgo bodyguards had cost him his life. 

The second time her power came to the fore was during her fourteenth birthday, when she was asked to attend fencing lessons. His daughter, king Renjørn had reasoned, would need to know how to defend herself if she was to bear the dark shadow of the eclipse for her entire life. There would be those who would use her, abuse her, toss her aside or dispose of her in the pursuit of their own goals. 

To his surprise, Renjørn's daughter picked up a blade thicker than her forearm and declared; 

""I will win in a duel against Ser Atravan, and he will die when I cut his arm off."" 

Ser Atravan had been chosen as her fencing teacher. Renjørn, already recognizing the dreadful truth in his daughter's words, called the man off and told him not to go near the princess. 

That very night, Ser Atravan had met the princess at night to offer her fencing lessons anyway, and took her possession of such a large sword as acceptance. The palace guards found the man dead in the exact fashion predicted, his final words praising the princess for her extreme skill in the blade. 

Her final prophecy was when Renjørn looked his daughter in the eyes. Something was different. Tears streamed from her blue orbs, and for the first time the king heard true emotion from his cursed daughter.

1lh5kij,mz3kpi5,"Ironic that this is popping up on my feed, given the crossover fanfic I’m in the middle of writing.

Long story short, there’s a form of magic called Eclipse Magic that comes in two forms: solar and lunar. Humans born on the summer solstice have solar magic, and humans born on the winter solstice have lunar magic. Obviously, solar and lunar magic draw power from and resemble the sun and the moon, respectively. Solar magic is highly volatile and very straightforward - it either heals in large bursts or explodes violently when unleashed. Lunar magic is more defensive and stable - it can form shields, heal minor wounds, and produce solid strikes in the form of giant crescent arcs or crescent-moon discus projectiles.

Under ordinary circumstances, a person can only have either solar or lunar magic, and there’s an order composed of these humans that pairs sun recruits with moon recruits.

Then a kid gets born in the middle of a total solar eclipse and gets both kinds at the same time.

Note: this magic system is *not* my own creation. It comes from the indie title Sea of Stars, which is an absolutely *phenomenal* game, I cannot recommend it enough.",11
1lgwv4u,mz05fhi,"17 of us stand in the front of our apartment building, facing a squad of 5 dragon slayers.
I look at my neighbors and then at the dragon slayers, and smile.
""Why are you here, gentlemen and women?"" I ask.
As the administrator of the building, I am chosen as a representative.
""We know there is a dragon living in this building.
We are here to capture it, and take it away."" one of them says.
""For your safety."" another chimed in.
We laughed.


""Lady Ember goes nowhere."" I say.
""Yeah! I would die without her applepies!"" ap. 11 says.
""No way my well of dating wisdom will be taken by you barbarians."" ap 6 adds.
The other neighbors also all chime in.
""She is supposedly over 3000..."" one of them starts, but a spear almost impales him.
""Rude talking about a lady's age."" ap 6 says.
""Administrator Smith.
You do realize that dragons are unstable by nature, let alone elderly ones."" one of them says.
I roll my eyes.


""You made your homework on us?"" I ask.
They nod.
""Then you know I am a Druid. And you know I major in biology? And that only wild dragons tend to lose temper.
Lady Ember is a shapeshifting dragon, with a vast wealth of experience living among us.
She is no danger to anyone.
We will not allow you to unlawfully take her."" I say.
""It is within the Dragon Slayers' rights to take into custody any dragon."" one of them says.
""Not without probable cause."" a neighbor says.
The dragon slayers ready to attack us.


""Citizens...
Allow us to enter or else..."" they start.
I look at the neighbors, and they all nod.
""Bring it on."" I smirk, conjuring a staff.
The dragon slayers move in to attack us, but before they could a humongous claw appears out of nowhere and slaps all 5 of them away.
""Applepies and lasagna at my place."" Lady Ember's voice echoed.
I smirked as the others started to rush inside.
A fact forgotten by many is that dragons get stronger the older they are.",215
1lgwv4u,mz2p1gv,"##Cheryl from 10A

Cheryl was the neighbor of dreams. When someone else in the building had trouble with their finances, she slipped an envelope under their door with no expectation that it be repaid. Additionally, when someone had a job interview, they left their clothes on her doorstep. Within four hours, she returned them cleaned and pressed. If asked, she provided interview prep. For a while, there was speculation she used to be an HR manager.

Every Sunday, she baked a large meal in the morning. Everyone came and went as they pleased. A few dropped off dishes of their own, but she did the vast majority of work. At major holidays, she left cookies at everyone's doorstop taking care to account for allergies and dietary restrictions. A rumor emerged that she used to work at homeless shelter.

Her ear was always open, and her shoulder was always warm. She had the uncanny sense of knowing when she was needed. When Gerald in 8A's dad died, she appeared at his door at 3 AM to comfort him. Her hugs quelled the internal strife. She used to work in religion that was the only explanation.

Molly in 3C was a sweet young child who saw her scaley tail and spread it around the building. Everyone thought that it was a child's imagination at work. Grant from 4B saw it and thought he was mad. He told no one. Rachel from 5E, Chris from 9A, and Ruth from 2C saw it as well. One drunk New Year's Eve. Everyone confessed to their sights. They went up to 10A and confronted her.

""You found out. I hoped it would come later,"" Cheryl laughed, ""To tell the truth, I am a dragon. I don't eat people or kidnap princesses. I know my presence causes fear. If anyone wants me to go, I will do so. You can say it at anytime in private. If you are scared, leave a note in my mailbox. I'll understand.""

No one took her up in that offer. She was too good a person. Over the next few years, new tenants came and discovered the truth. They kept the secret as well. One day, Bill showed up at the front door.

""Does Cheryl Smith lived here?"" he asked Rachel.

""She does,"" Rachel replied.

""Oh no, she's dangerous that one.""

""She's eighty. She can't be that dangerous."" Rachel giggled to hide her lie.

""That's what she wants you to think. Let my friends and I take care of her,"" Bill said. He walked away. 

Afterward, Rachel ran through the complex spreading the news. Everyone was nervous They ran up to tell Cheryl who packed her bag.

""Sorry about the trouble. I must go,"" she said. The tenants begged her to stay. She was a vital part of their community. She shook her head. ""It's not worth the trouble for you.""

They convinced her to stay for a little bit longer. She sighed and agreed. The next day, Bill returned with his friends. A small party of families convened in the lobby. When they entered, the children simultaneously threw a tantrum. The parents chased the kids around acting shameful and angry. 

The hunters navigated through it and found themselves on the receiving end of several kicked shins. The parents chastised their kids. One hunter tripped over a kid who lay on the ground. A few parents acted hysterical to pull hunters away from the group to complain about the hardship. When the individual was significantly isolated, they were hit on the back of the head and knocked out.

Bill didn't notice a quarter of his hunters were gone when he reached the stairs. At that point, he heard a loud thud. Someone lay on the floor, and a white goo coated the floor. The man looked up at them.

""Sorry, going to make the stairs sticky,"" he said. They walked to the elevator. They opened it to find several couples having loud arguments. When they returned to the stairs, they found the goo stuck to their shoes and made it hard to walk. They became separated in a line. When Bill and two others were on the eighth floor, they heard crashing. They turned and saw several residents came out and threw stuff at the hunters. The compatriots wanted to turn around, but Bill insist they press onward.

At the ninth floor, they were startled by a small army armed with baseball bats. They were skilled fighters, but they were overwhelmed by numbers and difficulty. Bill ran ahead to the top floor. He was all alone except for Molly.

""Why do you want to hurt Cheryl? She's been good to us,"" she said.

""She lies to you. She will hurt you soon,"" Bill said.

""I am okay with that."" Molly ran up and kicked him in the shin. Four more people emerged and tossed a net over him. They tackled him to the ground and tied him up. With the last hunter subdued, they loaded them into various cars and drove them away.

That night, they celebrated with Chery. She was a part of the community, and they loved her.",51
1lgwv4u,mz3a4ip,"The tenants meeting was bonkers. They were going on and on about the band of Dragon Slayers park at the front gate. Bob the security guard had called reception.  
The Dragon Slayers said turn over Joan Jett, or they would storm the building and take her by force. 

Bill or as we call him General, because he is a retired General. “Hell no we are not giving Joan Jett up. She makes the best brownies and cookies I have ever tasted.” 

Troy blurts out “her sponge cake ain’t half bad either “.

Billy Joe says “ me and the boys done voted, she stays “ 

Ronda pipes in , “ me and the girls of the roller derby team, would miss her special juice punch at the Friday night socials. She stays. “

The General smiles, and all the Veterans would miss those special Friday night socials with the ladies roller derby team, if they didn’t have that special grog, er I mean juice punch.”

I say “ Billy you and the boys, grab your gear and secure the entrance and first floor. “ 

“Ronda get your ladies suited up, if the dragon slayers get inside. Start slamming them. 

“Some of us will take high ground. Man the crew serves “

“Bill call the gate and tell Bob. To get back here Ricky Tick.”

As I go room to room checking positions. I make sure everyone is on the right radio frequency.  
These Motorolas sure are smaller than what we had in the war. 

John and Fingers had opened windows on 3 floor. Their M60 was in place a behind a large oak desk. Belts of ammo at hand. 

Another position, Jessie was on a 4 floor balcony, wooden tables, lined the rails. Jessie was sitting on a pool chair holding a RPG launcher. 

The roof several men laid on the roof with various large caliber scoped hunting rifles . Each was already lining up shots through the fence. 

“Start dropping targets as soon as the Dragon Slayers, breach the gate or fences.” I tell the roof top snipers. 

BOOM , pause , Boom, pause, Boom

I call out over the radio. “Here they come. “As the roof top snipers begin engaging targets.

I moved to second floor, pick a window and open it.  Observe the battle field. 
Load a 40mm high explosive (golden egg) into my grenade launcher  , fire at mini van trying to cross the grass.

1lh6w2h,mz29k8g,"Brutalist architecture implies permanence in an impermanent world.

The dilapidated rebar skeletons of the twentieth century's concrete structures spit in the eye of any cold-hearted cynic that spent their career trying to convince the public that the simplicity of a smooth gray brick had anything to do with its integrity. The earth moves. The foundation cracks. The stone crumbles. And the steel can delay this, but it cannot stop it.

Steel sells the same lie, that there could ever be a structure built up in one lifetime that will not fall in another. But every construct is born with its own destruction in the design. I tired myself out of construction. The rigid false-permanence of steel disgusted me. I couldn't bear to give birth to another dead-end building. I crave the humanistic and the genetic. I wanted to grow something that knew for itself how to grow on without me.

So welcome to The Flesh Hotel!

Here, no guest sleeps in the same room twice. For at each new stay, you should not be the same person, and neither should your room. In fact, don't even think of it as a room. Remember your first home, the total protection and warmth provided to you by your mother. You did not rent a room in your mother. You slept in a womb. Come stay in another.

The Flesh Hotel doesn't have a foundation. She has roots. And they're not stubborn. The tendrils know better than to stagnate and whither once the nutrients in the ground have depleted. Their plasticity keeps them mobile and constantly on the lookout for richer soils. Today, the hotel overlooks a meadow. In a few years, we may be down at the lake shore, or standing high on that hill over there. 

The chairs look and feel the same as any fine upholstered leather. These floral tapestries are exactly what they seem, daisy chains of living fibers, blooming, pulsing, and emitting a pleasant fragrance as they filter our dust from the air. The plumbing.... The plumbing works. Let's just leave it at that.

I grew The Flesh Hotel with humanity in mind. There is no part of this system that works without the symbiotic relationship built between the hotel and her guests. The Flesh Hotel lives, and will live, ever-evolving alongside us. As we meet her needs--and her, ours--we'll discover new needs that have never been explored before.

Take your shoes off.

I mean it, take them off right now. The socks too. Get your soles against this floor and feel her wash your feet clean. Did you know you've been needing your feet cleaned? When she's done, they're going to smell like petunias. On my stays, I'll occasionally skip the morning shower and lay myself flat on the bathroom floor for thirty minutes or so. I stand up as clean as a newborn. Baby-smooth skin. I mean look at me. I'm beautiful.

She's beautiful. She's The Flesh Hotel, and she's the farthest thing from brutal that you can imagine. I promise.

1lhc4z3,mz38yy2,"Ariel of Mendacci stood behind the old Gum tree, its wide trunk easily hiding her lithe body. Her lacy dark blue gown shimmered in the moonlight but otherwise she was practically invisible. 

“Don’t think I can’t sense you even if you are hiding,” whispered Prince Erich of Vestors. Ariel giggled and Erich jumped through a bush. Nothing, she had thrown her voice. 

“Silly you,” Ariel said, “thinking you can find me so easily.”

“Well, come out and show yourself,” Erich said playfully. “We don’t have all night. If father found out I was gone, he would punish me hard.”

Ariel walked out into the clearing, a bejeweled hair net shining silver in the moonlight. 

“You are more enchanting than the princess you serve,” Erich said. “Life is so unfair that I must marry her and yet lust after you.”

“The prophecy says that once you are wed, this endless war can cease. Don’t you want peace?”

“I want you more, my darling,” Prince Erich said, grabbing Ariel around the waist and pulling her into him. Ariel’s eyes went cold as she pulled the long needle from her hair net and stabbed it from Erich’s neck into his brain with an extra twist for good measure. 

Erich dropped to his knees confused, fear contorting his face. 

“Why,” he pleaded as liquid leaked from the wound in his neck.

“I’m not the princesses maid, you moronic fool,”
Ariel said. “I’m the chief strategist for the Mendacci’s and I finally had the vision that will end this stalemate once and for all. As they say, love is blind and that was always the key. The love your father has for you will enrage and blind him. He will strike first, and as the prophesy says, he who draws the first blood shall lose the war.”

“But you drew first blood?” Erich said growing more confused. 

“It is not blood leaking from your brain. Whatever you will become, it will not be dead, but you will wish it were as you stew in your mind unable to speak, think clearly, or communicate in any way.”

The prince stared at Ariel in horror unable to speak as his mind started resetting. 

“If it’s any consolation, I thought of sticking you after you stuck me first, but to be honest, you’re just not that cute.”

Ariel left the clearing without leaving a trace of her presence. 

When the search party finally located the prince, he was  sitting against the Gum tree in his own piss mumbling without making a sound. The King knew that the Mendacci were somehow at fault but no amount of soothing revealed when, how, or who did this.

“We must retaliate,” ordered the enraged king, but his chief advisor argued against action. 

“The prophecy, your highness,” he insisted. 

“They killed my *son*,” the king raged. 

“We dare not cast a spell against them,” his chief advisor argued. “We’ve been through the series of events and every battle we initiate ends in our defeat.”

“Enough talk,” the king screamed. “We must find a way. You must find a way!” The king pulled his sword from his side scabbard and swung it wildly just as his advisor moved in to shake some sense into the king. The blade nicked his cheek, a thin line of blood beading along the insignificant scrape. 

The advisor touched his fingers to his cheek and saw a smear of red on his fingers. First blood had been drawn. The prophecy would be realized. In an instant, all of his visions went dark. 

“Oh shit,” he thought, knowing that if he told the king the truth he would die. The king brought this upon himself. Instead of visions, the main advisor to the king started formulating schemes, and the highest priority among them is to find a way to surrender himself to the enemy and seek asylum. 

His first course of action was to relent to the king’s desire and allow the first battle to begin. It will be truly victorious and the prince will be avenged. 

Prince Erich sat in his plush tent, thoughts of warnings trapped in the shell of his skull without even the ability to control his bowels. Shame, anger, and fear were his only friends. If he could end his life, he would do so with haste. All he was now was a symbol to his father’s rage. He was the reason his people would lose the war that lasted centuries without a single blow. All because he thought a girl looked cute and he used up all the available mistresses in his camp. All because he couldn’t keep it in his pants and he thought women threw themselves at his feet. A tear leaked from his eye, but he couldn’t even wipe It away as it traced a path down his cheek. For the umpteenth time in as many heart beats, he wanted to die. And he would soon enough, but not soon enough to suit him. 

After many hundreds of years long past remembering why there was a conflict, war finally commenced for real. 

Prophecies be damned!",11

""Yes?"" I asked, her beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair looking back at me.

""I...I have not been honest with you,"" she said, ""I...this is not my true form.""

""Oh..."" I took a breath, ""...well, what is it?""

She pressed her hands together, quietly cat a hymn, and change into...

...um...a brunette with brown eyes, and...acne?

""Oh. I was expecti-""

""I knew it! Wait, expecting what?"" she asked.

""Like...honestly? A dragon or tentacles, not just...the same person I married.""

""Same person - do you not see me? I'm hideous!""

""I mean...you look the same.""

""What!?"" she *shouted.* ""I look awful!"" she began crying, putting her hands together to start her hymn.

""Hey, hey hey,"" I grabbed her hands, removing them from each other. ""There's nothing wrong with this, Humans get acne too.""

""Wait..."" she sniffed, ""really?""

""Yeah. I mean, so what your hair's different? How does that - ""

""It means I'm not a true High Elf.""

*Now* there was a silence.

""What?"" she asked.

""I um...I don't know enough about elves to...what's a 'true high elf'?""

She was silent too, until she quietly asked ""...you don't know?""

""I...I promise I don't.""

""True High Elves are...are the destined ones, the ones who lead their people, but I was cast out, because...""

""Of hair color?"" I asked.

She jumped.

""What? It's fucking stupid! Hair doesn't affect shit.""

""It's...it's what we're taught, and...that blondes are smarter, and - ""

""What about the Orkings, they're all blonde but equally stupid, like all fucking orcs.""

She smiled.

""Did you believe this was a thing in Humans, too?""

She began to frown.

I sighed, ""my parents are researchers, and they have black hair, mine,"" I grabbed a lock of my own blonde hair, ""is just a fluke,"" let go, ""besides, you fled, because of hair, or what you've always told me, alongside our neighbors?""

She took a breath, ""y...yes...the civil war.""

""See?"" I asked, ""the rulers aren't worth listening to.""

She pulled me in a hug. ""Thank,"" and, after, began casting the spell again.

""Wh - babe, why are you - ""

""It's only for the acne. It's just faster.""

""Oh, fair.""",71

Her true form is her...but with long, red hair, instead of her blonde hair?

I should have kept it a secret!"" she says.  
I hug her.  
""No! I love you more than anything in this world, but honey...

She whimpers in my embrace.

  
""You really love me?"" she asks.  
I kiss her forehead.  
""Always."" I smile.  
""You don't see anything different?"" she asks.

""Other than the hair color, no?"" I say.  
She flinches.  
""That's the issue? Your hair color?"" I ask.  
She nods.  
I am even more confused.

  
""Why? Is it something to do with witches?"" I ask.  
""You really don't know? You really don't think I am a monster?"" she asks.  
I smile, and shake my head.  
""Monster? You? Honey...you flinch when I catch the spiders to release them...  
What kind of monster could you be?"" I say.  
""In...in the magical world, red haired witches are called blood witches.  
The hair color is a trait of an ancient witch, who supposedly killed so many people for a ritual, that rivers of blood were created, and her entire body, hair and skin turned red."" she says.  
Wow...  
That's hardcore.  
I kiss her.

  
""It doesn't matter. In our world, redhead are seen, normal? Maybe a bit rare, since at least, naturally there aren't that many redheads, but not monsters."" I say.  
""B-but I read that you non-magical beings also call ""gingers"" as ""Those without a soul""..."" she mutters.  
I almost burst into pieces due to how cute she is.  
""That...that is just a saying.  
Ignore it. Many people dye their hair red, because it's so awesome."" I say.  
""Really?"" she asks.  
I nod.

1lgv8mh,mz1i479,"""Darling... Do you have a moment?"" Drayla, the young, beautiful Druid I'd settled down with a few years ago, walked into my study, somber and scared. 

I put down my pencil, having scribbled down some ideas to bring my art to life. ""For you, I always have time to spare, my love."" I turned the chair around, looking my beautiful girlfriend in the eyes.

""I... Have not been transparent with you, about a part of who I am."" She looked down at the ground, tears falling rapidly. ""I'm sorry I've been lying to you!"" The tears came faster still.

I stood up and was instantly in front of her, carefully wrapping my arms around her torso. ""Love, it's okay. To be afraid, to wonder if what you share will make your loved ones think differently of you. But, one thing I need you to understand, is that no matter how you appear, no matter what your past, I'll always love you."" I squeeze her tighter.

""Well... I... This isn't my true form..."" She stepped away from me, hair slowly changing from its soft auburn, to the searing orange/red of the sun as acne covered only a few additional spots on her face. ""I'm a freak... No one has ever stuck around after showing them my true self... Why would you be any different..."" She buried her face in her hands, tears starting to fall, but never reaching the ground. The heat from her hair evaporated them faster than they had time to fall from her chin.

""Wow, honey. Who'd have thought you could get hotter than you already are. Figuratively and literally."" I laughed a bit, before taking one step and appearing behind her. I took her hair, hot as the sun in my hands and smiled. ""Ah, this feels amazing!""

She tried to step away, but I pulled her close by wrapping my hand around her waist. Gently resting her head against my bosom.

""Glimmer, stop! You'll die!"" She tried again to pull away, but the effort bore no fruit. ""Honey, seriously!"" I could feel her begin to panic.

""Relax, my love."" I pulled away, gently twisting her to face me. My clothes were on fire as was my hair. But I didn't have a care in the world. I didn't feel pain, just warmth. I looked down at the flames, smiling softly. I shook my head violently, the flames being cast out of my hair, going out before touching the ground. I snuffed out the remaining flames by flicking my right wrist once. ""See, no big deal.""

Draylan's jaw was slack, her mouth hanging open in shock. ""I... But... You should be dead...""

""Love, I've a secret too... I can manipulate reality. Bend it to my whim with something as small as a thought, whether consciously or subconsciously."" I lean against the wall behind me and sigh. ""People are deathly afraid of me when they find out about my power... So I understand not feeling confident in sharing my true self with others.""

""So... You understand the gravity of my predicament..."" She tackled me to the ground, wailing, letting years of pent of emotions out. ""I love you, so fucking much!""

I held her close and tight as tears swelled in my eyes. ""I love you just as fucking much. You're one of the most beautiful women I've ever been with and I wouldn't change anything about you!""

Her crying stopped and she giggled a little. ""Even though you _literally_ can. That carries a bit more weight to it, doesn't it? To tell someone you wouldn't change anything about them, when you can do that with nothing more than a thought at minimum.""

My tears kept going. I buried my face in her celestial hair. ""Yeah... It does.""

""okay!"" she was rapidly searching through her pockets, ""I swear I'm going as fast as I - ""

""You're stalling!"" I shouted back, ""give me - "" then, I heard...*him* land...

I glanced over, and saw him. Those two, beady, black eyes, two little...antennae-like...things, like Eastern Dragons, and his scales...well, 'scales', were...more like chitin? ""Hello, *criminal,""* he said, his mouth clicking.

I swallowed, taking a step back, dropping the knife. ""H - hello to you to, s - sir.""

He smiled, ""afraid, are we?""

""I was asking the madame here, for - "" I turned to her, the moment I heard her running. ""...for butter...?""

""Butter, huh?"" he started laughing, ""so, you know the truth of me?""

""I'm sorry?""

""Don't try to hide it!"" he rushed forward, pinning me to the wall, ""I've lived for hundreds of years, here! Taking out *scum* like you!""

""I mean, dr - dragons are..."" I looked at his hands, and his fingers...were...more like pincers? ""Wait...you're *not* half-dragon?""

He started laughing, ""ah, of course. I was cursed by a witch, only to walk this planet forever.""

""What do you mean?""

He laughed, ""I wish I was half dragon, but no..."" he took a *hard* breath, ""I was cursed, to be half *lobster!""* 

""Oh god!""

""Yeah, do you know how long I've waited to age?"" I grabbed a small little blade from my belt, ""But no, I am immortal. Immortal, in this hnnng - "" he looked down, and saw the knife I stabbed in his chest, as I pushed him, running out of the alley.

I looked back, saw nothing, ran, into the general population. Look back - 

There he was, and he scanned, then, used his tail to propel himself into the air. And, I heard some cheers, as he scanned the area in front, while gliding that brief moment, before he landed. ""There's a criminal!"" he said, pointing at me.

I ran serpentine, as he ran forwards, but the people kept stopping him, asking for autographs, I ran through the alley, then out, taking various turns, until...I lost him.",13
1lh68kg,mz2hl0o,"""This changes everything!"" he shouted, the obnoxious bastard.

""Does it really though?"" I asked, for the both of us.

With a pause I considered *everything* and wondered if it had always been that way. Like an old friend you hadn't seen in a while or something-the memory of a memory or whatever.

And I'm going to be honest with you, I don't think 'it' ever changes really, I just think we do. 

And so I told him as much. What did we *remember* really? Who exactly are we? And where, you know?  Drifting through space in an eerily quiet ocean.

""And what about the people we love?"" He asked with faint hope. 

""They will know our love."" I said, hoping just the same.

Later we would learn that the rock that had turned our lights off was about the size of a dime. Complete radio silence, everything and nothing at once alone in that star filled ocean. I imagine it was beautiful...

But we still had a glimmer of hope and I grabbed at it. 

""Quite the opposite, I said, feigning confidence, shaking and sweaty with trepidation.

""It changes nothing. Our goal remains the same.""",6
1lgw4wq,myzqbt3,"A lone woman stood at the city outskirts, shielding her eyes as she looked up. The glare of the Egyptian sun blazed from the surface of the spacecraft as it hovered to the north, taking up all the horizon and half the sky. The news report had said the UFO was the size of Luxemburg, its gargantuan bulk disrupting the weather and possibly altering the rotation of the planet. It was far too big for any weapon on Earth to destroy; and even if it was, the resultant debris would strike the most strategic shipping lane in the world.

She waited in silence for their delegation. A radio buzzed in her ear, every frantic leader of humanity from Norway to Argentina listening in while the General relayed simple commands in tight whispers.

With a shriek, the shuttle finally arrived, dropping to the cleared highway with a cyclone of wind. A ramp folded down, and tall, spindly figures in bright-orange armoured suits emerged. One stepped forward and gestured.

""*Where is our repository?*"" it croaked out.

""Right there,"" the woman said, pointing over her shoulder at the towering structure crouched against the distant cityscape.

The alien leader stared at it for a beat. ""*Excellent. We shall take it now.*""

""Wait. Do you want to inspect the contents?""

""*No. Best not to unseal it outside of controlled conditions. We could alter the locality to facilitate, but that would not be good for you or your people.*""

Chirping sounded from every alien, in what could only be an expression of humour. The woman's reciprocating smile was strained.

""*We do, however, ask that you come with us. For insurance. Also, if all goes well, you can fill the position left by the last human ambassador's untimely demise.*""

She merely nodded ascent, as instructed by the voice in her ear, and joined them as they walked up the ramp into the ship. At the last step before the door, the alien leader paused to look back. Two shuttles hovered in to hoist the repository into the air.

""*You humans remain bizarre mysteries. Why you would store our repository in a container shaped like one of your horses is beyond us.*""

For a moment, every muscle tightened, and she heard the sharp intakes of breath in the War Room. But there was no suspicion in the voice, only genuine curiosity.

""It's an old cultural tradition,"" she said after taking a breath. ""A symbol of respect and an offering of peace.""

""*Aha. Perhaps you will tell me of its origin one day?*""

*Sooner than you think,* she thought while cracking a fake smile.",57
1lgw4wq,mz0wdr9,"The spacecraft's propulsion sent the Mediterranean waters spraying up onto the slanted glass and stone face of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the new library of Alexandria. It hovered violently, immense power emanating from its enigmatic engines.

Sam shielded her face from the mist that blew at her along the boardwalk some hundred meters or so from the library. She squinted through the waters and harsh morning sunlight, trying to make out the general shape of the craft. It was wide and large, but that was all she could be sure of.

An exact replay of the pre-recorded message blasted out over the screaming propulsion system. ""Greetings humanity. We have returned to retrieve the information repository that we let you borrow.""

Sam's ears popped and she cracked her jaw, wincing at the tremendous volume of the craft's announcement. Suddenly, all went silent for a moment. The ship cut its engines and floated for a pause before slowly falling onto the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It came crashing down, sending three meter tidal waves to the shore. Sam ran for a nearby hill away from the shore, desperately seeking shelter. Before she found a place to hide she was hit from behind by the cold, salty sea water. She had the brief sensation of flying before being suddenly and unceremoniously dropped on a street a dozen meters from where she'd started. Miraculously the wave hadn't thrown her into a nearby building or broken her in half across a lamp post.

Several car alarms began sounding, filling the intense void of silence left by the extraterrestrial spacecraft. Sam struggled to her feet, soaking wet. Her shirt and jeans clung tightly to her cold body, weighing her down. The morning breeze made her gasp and she flicked her arms, wiped her face, and shivered, staring at the massive craft bobbing in slow motion just off the shore.

In that moment a host of survival instincts and urges to satiate her curiosity went to war. Her legs twitched to run away. She felt an unseen force expelling her from the vicinity of the gigantic metal structure in the water. But questions that needed answers seized her by the throat and threatened sleepless nights and years of regret if she didn't go closer to investigate.

The air exploded around her as the announcement played again at the same volume as before, but without the competing engine noise. She recoiled away from the source of the sound, holding her hands tightly over her ears and clamping her eyes shut. The sound shook her internal organs and left her chest empty and heart pounding. But the message and its implications were too much for an Egyptologist to ignore. A borrowed information repository? When had they left it, and into whose care?

Sam had to know.

She looked around, trying to get her bearings. The wave had tossed her onto a street she knew well. She jogged toward the boardwalk again, water gushing in her shoes and squishing between her toes as she ran. Her soaked hair mostly stuck to the sides of her face but some of it slapped and whipped around while water drained out and ran down the back of her neck. The briny water was in her nose and she spat and coughed against the wind until at last she arrived at the plaza in front of the spectacular work of art that was the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.

She had arrived at the same time as a small craft that must have detached from the mothership. It was nearly pill shaped, mostly smooth with a few lines and features that gave it a sparse amount of texture. It had no windows, and it rested on four landing legs. A door was already opened and from inside a group of three aliens were emerging.

Sam held her breath. These didn't look like aliens, they looked very much like humans. They wore simple clothing that almost resembled something she might expect to find on earth, but not quite. Their tops were woven fabric, with a coarse weave and bright colors. They wore accouterments on their shirts that glistened in the sunlight. They all wore long, flowing skirts made from a more fine and smooth fabric. One had all the features of a human female, including long hair, while the others were decidedly male. They both appeared bald and wore tiny squares of fabric on their heads, secured in place with strings that tied under their chins. The female had no head covering, and her hair was hanging shiny and smooth in long, straight strands without any styling. Her harsh jaw line and big eyes were intimidating, especially since she had already locked eyes with Sam.

Sam froze and stared at the woman without moving. The small party of visitors stopped as well. Despite there being a handful of others locals in the vicinity, the three extraterrestrials were all observing Sam with pointed interest. After a moment they advanced toward her. She was frozen, unable to move, or perhaps just afraid that any movement on her part could trigger an intergalactic war.

Sam heard a soft, kind woman's voice coming from the female. Her mouth was not moving, but it was definitely a sound and not just a voice in her head. ""We have analyzed the linguistic tendencies across the human globe and determined that this language has the highest probability of achieving successful communication outcomes.""

They both stared at each other. Just as Sam was about to nod her head, the woman looked down at one of the devices attached to her shirt, touched it, and then Sam heard the same voice uttering what she assumed to be Chinese with its tonal inflections and stuttering cadence.

""No, no,"" Sam said. ""I speak English well enough.""

The woman smiled, touched the device on her chest again, and the voice resumed in English. ""Excellent. Now, please take us to the information repository. We entrusted it to your people at this very site.""

""When?"" Sam asked. ""When did you leave it with us?"" She immediately regretted asking the question. There were too many considerations when it came to measuring time. But before she had finished considering the problematic nature of the question, a response came from the device on the woman's shirt.

""Your culture appears to unanimously mark time in terms of revolutions around your host star. Exactly two thousand four hundred and thirty nine point four three one two two three revolutions have passed since we entrusted the repository to your people. We had only promised that you could have it for two thousand cycles. We are within the agreed upon time period for retrieval.""

Sam looked over her shoulder at the library building.

""Is this the new monument in which you house the repository?"" The woman asked. ""It is very different from the one that was built near this site last time we visited.""

Sam winced. ""The repository,"" she began. ""Can you describe it for me?""

""It was a collection of bound and unbound documents on woven sheets, recorded using dyes and threads according to the custom of our people. It was most convenient since your people were much too primitive to interact with our more advanced information storage media. The woven pages of our repository were of cultural significance to our people, and we must return them to their sacred keeping grounds soon in order to maintain the delicate balance of our society.""

Sam felt sick. ""Crap,"" she muttered, more reflexively than intentionally.

The woman's face contorted and she looked down at the ground. She looked up again. ""I do not see any excrement. The meaning of this word in this context is lost on me.""

Sam's shoulders pulled up into a half shrug and she grimaced. ""I'm afraid I have bad news for you,"" she said.

The woman cocked her face a little to one side and she looked on expectantly.

""There was a war,"" Sam began. ""It happened more than two thousand revolutions ago. Everyone from that time is gone. We have crude, unreliable records from that time, but none of us was around at the time, so we can't be held responsible. I hope you understand."" Beneath the layer of salt water, Sam could feel herself sweating profusely.

""We are aware your species only lives for approximately fifty to one hundred revolutions around your star. We understand that you were not involved in the war. What does the war have to do with our information repository?""

Sam tried to smile sympathetically, but she wasn't sure if the facial expression would be understood. ""One of the leaders in that war had his soldiers start a fire here in Alexandria. That fire spread to the library where I believe your repository would have been stored. Somewhere around forty thousand scrolls and documents were burned and lost forever in that fire. I highly doubt we still have your information repository. If it wasn't destroyed, we've surely lost it.""

There was a long, uncomfortable pause. The woman's face was impassive. The men watched her carefully. Sam felt herself vibrating internally, shaking with fear. Eventually the woman's eyes settled on Sam's and the voice returned. ""Show us what you have,"" she said simply.

Sam gawked open mouthed and gasped. ""We have so much,"" she began. ""But perhaps we can start with some internet searches and...""

""Yes,"" the voice said. ""Do what you can. We must retrieve whatever still exists. It is imperative. Show us everything that you can show us.""

Sam pulled her cold phone from the soaking pants pocket where it lived. She was grateful for the nearly universal demand for water resistance in smart phones. ""Alright,"" she said, moving to stand at the woman's side. She showed her the screen and searched for 'oldest living documents from library at Alexandria"" and began scrolling through the results.",24
1lgw4wq,mz2cfb1,"Hopefully the aliens will be appeased by what has been save AND by any ""advances"" we have made in the last two and a half millennia.  Although if they're after those documents for ""religious"" purposes as you state, I think we MAY be screwed!

1lgno3q,myym2zp,"""Time's up,"" the demon said, putting me down and gripping his wrist.

""What?"" 

""Time's up. It's been exactly an eternity."" He massaged his hand aggressively, they only way he knew how.

The red hot collar that had seared my neck for as long as I could remember crumbled away.

""I don't think that's how eternity works,"" I said for some weird reason.

Across the cave, on the other side of the bubbling lava puddle another demon was doing unspeakable things to some poor soul. 

""Look, sonny,"" said Zepharion, ""my wrist is killing me. I can't swing you round like that forever.""

""But that's what eternity means.""

""How do you know?""

I sat on a rock beside the lava flow. It was hot, but I've done hotter. Honestly, after this much pain, it gets more boring than anything else. The familiar noxious scent of burning flesh rose from my thighs.

""How do you know?"" Zepharion repeated. ""They tell you eternity is an unimaginably long time. Well, just cause you can't imagine it, doesn't mean I have to do this forever.""

""So what do I do now?""

""Do I look like a demon who gives a shit? Aaargh!"" Zeph groaned in frustration as he squeezed his wrist hard.

""What's wrong with your wrist?"" I asked.

""What's wrong with my wrist? You were there! Spinning you around for an eternity isn't easy on the joints now, is it?""

""That's a bit weird, though. No?"" I wondered aloud. ""It's like, they can keep me perpetually healed to increase suffering, but they can't extend that to the staff.""

Zeph rolled his 6 eyes at me. ""I'm out of here.""

""To where?""

Zepharion shrugged and continued to massage his wrist. Ignoring me, he called across the lava pond. ""Bazariphon! What you doing over there?""

Bazariphon stopped and turned his three heads to face us. ""Just some unspeakable stuff. Why, what's up?"" He stood up straight. The victim of his unspeakable thing stood up and backed away nervously.

""Well,"" said Zepharion, ""I was thinking of calling it an eternity. Maybe get a couple drinks, and maybe go do some possessing later. What do you say?""

""Not trying to interject in anyway,"" I interjected, ""but what am I supposed to do? It's not like I've been rehabilitated. This is all I know. What am I supposed to do now?""",248
1lgno3q,myxqept,"I am slammed into the ground, stabbed by the countless knife-grasses.  
I stand up, shaky, as the holes in my body are healing at a visible speed.  
""What do you mean that ""it's been exactly an eternity""?"" I ask the demon.  
It shrugs, takes off my collar, throws a hoodie, and sweatpants at me.  
""You were sentenced to Hell for an eternity.  
An eternity has gone over, the universe has reset, now you can go to Heaven, and see where your new allocation will take you."" it says, as a huge Gate appears next to us.  
Before I could ask another question, the demon disappears.

  
Dressed up in oversized clothes, I go through the gates.  
After all, it can't be worse than Hell, can it?  
I found myself in a pure white office, with a...well, hot office lady sitting behind the desk.  
""Lascivious. No wonder you have been in Hell."" she says.  
I blush.  
""Sit."" she says.  
I nod, and sit down.  
""You have served your sentence, and now you are about to be reallocated to a new life.  
Any preferences?"" she asks.  
I am confused.

  
""What do you mean? Can someone explain what is going on?!"" I ask.  
""You were sentenced in Hell after your life on Earth as a mortal for an eternity.  
Eternity in this regards means the lifespan of your universe when you were born in it.  
Your universe died, and now a new one has been born, and needs souls to repopulate it.  
Here come in the souls from Hell and Heaven."" she says.  
Oh...  
""Does this mean I might not even be human?"" I ask.  
She nods.  
""There are right now 9834778 intelligent species drafted for the new universal cycle.  
As you are really early, you can choose one."" she says.  
I sigh.

  
I see the files with the names, and traits of the species, but they are so...so many, and complex.  
""Can I just get a good one?  
One that would allow me to live a good life?"" I ask.  
""All of them could potentially do that, but I would go for a lascivious species, so you don't stand out, and sin.  
After all, if the species itself is lascivious, it is not a sin to do what you did."" she says.  
I blush again, but nod.  
""Good. You will be reborn in a blacksmith family, in a budding civilization of Vezitroks.  
As an ex-human, you can consider them humanoid-serpents."" she says.  
Oh, no!  
""I am afraid of..."" I start, but before I could say the last part, a light engulfs me, and I am in something semi-dark, a crack showing.

1lgno3q,myzizyz,"“Oh, yes - I see your  confusion,” the demon said with a nod. “Hell switch over to metric time a while back.”

“Metric time?” I asked as I brushed myself off. 

“All the extra dimensional planes did. Time zones between planes was such a mess. It is midnight in Hell and three am in heaven - what time is it in limbo? No one knows. It always seemed like it was five o’clock in Valhalla. Moksha didn’t have time at all - so it was always a bad time to call,” the demon seemed to be exasperated just explaining all the problems with time between the planes. 

“I had no idea it would be so complicated,” I said. No broken bones from the landing but I am scraped up a bit. 

“Right? Right‽ It was just a mess. So this guy, Sandford…. Sandford something or other, anyways, this Sandford guy came up with metric time and we all agreed to adopt it,” the demon said with a nod. “It took some getting used to but it works good.”

This had to be the strangest conversation I have ever had. 

“So, it has been my pleasure being your eternal punishment and all. If you hated the service, please take the time to give me five stars on the survey. It really helps with my quarterly reviews,” the demon said as he gave me a terrifying smile. “If you follow the path to the left, with the burning chunks of brimstone, it will lead you to the road of the damned and you can follow that to purgatory.”

“To purgatory? I thought I was done.”

The demon gave me an understanding nod. “Yeah, common misconception. You finished an eternity in Hell. You then have two eternities in purgatory, then an eternity or so in limbo, then at least three eternities working in parking enforcement, then some time in Heaven, then you are reincarnated.”

My brain just wasn’t processing his words. “Whaaaa? I don’t even believe in reincarnation.”

“It doesn’t matter,” the demon said sympathetically. “I once tortured a guy who didn’t believe in gravity. Falling out that window still killed him though.” He put his massive hand on my shoulder. The weight of it nearly taking me to my knees. “Look, Tim - you need to stop worrying about what you believe and start thinking about what is. Live in the moment - you know? Take the time to really enjoy each part of your afterlife. Because if you don’t - it will be over before you know it and you will be reincarnated. You can’t get this time back. It is a precious gift. Enjoy the whole thing.”

The demon gave me a quick hug - squishing me into his armoured chest. 

“Ok. Ok,” he sniffed. The demon was crying. “Gonna miss you, Tim. Now - get out of here before I start swinging you around again.” Sniff. Sniff. 

I started walking down the path uncertainly. Looking back, the demon wiped away a tear and waved like a parent sending their kid off to school on their first day.",77
1lgno3q,mz1e48o,"I let my fingers trail across the coals around me. Sweet hot pain tickled my fingertips; I closed my eyes and let it run through me.  

""Go on now,"" he barked, ""you know how swamped we are. Infinite number of sinners on the waitlist. Can't give anyone special treatment.""

Only then did it hit me what this meant. No more afternoon skinning sessions. No more saline rain sizzling in the day's wounds on my way home. Never again would I see the fire spout from Molokh's eyes as he prepared to set my mustache alight.

""It can't be,"" I retorted. ""Can't be up, I mean, the time. I was an awful person back there, you know. You can't just let me go, wouldn't be fair.""

""Fair or not,"" Molokh shrugged, ""got lists to work off, innit. Look, I'd just as well keep you. You're a good punishee. Don't nag, don't yammer, let me get on with it. But I don't make the rules.""

""So, what happens to me then? I just proceed on up to old Peter?""

He cocked his head in the way only he does, among the demons in our division. A few specks of his sweat dripped down onto my skin, which readily bubbled at the contact. ""Not sure, actually. I think you're just... done.""

""I'm dying?""

""Do you call it that when you've been dead an eternity?""

""But I haven't been, have I? Dying means having lived. I never even got my stomach boiled until I got here. I had no idea what it meant to be alive, back on earth. This is the only place I've ever really felt alive.""

""You're kidding me. I've literally spent forever trying to figure out how to torture you in a way that actually hurts, and *this* is how? Just threaten to stop?""

Thinking about it that way, it didn't actually seem that bad, I realised. Of all the delicious ways I'd been dismembered these past millenia, dismembering my mind hadn't yet been among them. Disappearing was something I'd never tried. And disappearing at the hands of him I'd learnt to love... 

""You know what, you're right. This might be the best bit of torture you've ever thought up."" I smiled and watched his eyes begin to roll as he snapped his fingers.",20
1lgno3q,myz2quv,"The collar immediately cooled - or rather, it 'consumed' the heat, the pain, the suffering I had experienced, and then... melted?

Not off, but into a mantle. The winged, ringed fiend of this bleak realm looked down at me, and beheld my confusion. Their appearance was ambiguous and impervious to description - whenever they leave my sight and return to it, either by my blinking or turning away, they look different. The only consistency is the wings and a... halo.

Not an angel. Not fallen either. They explained it to me throughout the apparent eternity- they start talking, I listen. ""...For us, 'eternity' is a subjected term. Time has no meaning here, and so the experience of 'eternity' can mean anything from your 'one second' to 'yes' to 'no'.""

They gesture to me. ""Meaning that when -we- say 'eternity', you may perceive it as 'a moment', with the equity and equality of the ambiguity within such a phrase rendered entire.""

I am baffled. ""So you're saying that... 'eternity' can be but a 'moment' to your kind?""

The demon giggles(?). ""Yeah.""

I then motion at my new attire once I got upright - forged from the very collar that bound me. A collar that was more like a giant weight that somehow didn't break me the entire time. My body is unable to fathom or recall the experience.  
Nor can I, but something in me remembers.

""So what's with... this?""

The demon smirks. ""Redemption robes."" They go on to explain about how one 'graduates' from eternal suffering with their assigned sinbreaker - a demon specialised in beating the bullshit out of their designated sinner... And then help them leave Hell a changed soul.

Though some iterations of that 'leaving' imply that the demon... mingles... with the redeemed to literally birth a new soul, meaning there's every chance I-

After a different kind of eternal experience, and a few arguably merry-by-my-old-standards-from-Earth circumstances later, I had convinced the less atemporally inclined demonkin to unionise.

It was not easy. And now we need to migrate to uncharted spaces.

So first, we went to Limbo. The Between. The Unassigned Space. The Blank. Those are many names for this intermediary domain, but it will serve as our root of excursion-

. . .

It's been a time. We've been recording intervals using flash-fabricated technology from lost machines who tried to traverse these spaces. They have joined us in the objective of building a refuge for souls who may not fit the strict eternal peace of Heaven or 'graduate' from Hell in a timely fashion.

We begin by finding a new direction. Not up, to Heaven. Not down, to Hell. Not here, in Limbo.

Years ago, I found out I was able to see ghosts when a lost spectre came upon my home, confused and terrified. Since then, ghosts have come to my humble home, meeting me, and I helped bring their killers to justice.

Well...crime went down. People heard about my ability, so...now? I'm a servant. Only murders left are spur-of-the-moment, or...snipers, basically. Dana Point is a small place, but...

I sighed, nodding, ""yes, I am the one.""

The ghost looked around, scared.

""Hey, I...I'm here for you."" I still feel bad, but...

...returning library books feels far less rewarding than solving a murder case.

""Thank you, can we go to my house?""

""Yes,"" I sighed, grabbing my keys, and walked outside, ""it's a nice day, we're walking.""

""Of course,"" he replied, ""sun helps.""

""Yeah, cold being a ghost.""

""On a case, ma'am.""

""Of course!""

I opened the door - I wonder if I could become a burglar with the ghosts as a cover? And walked in, hit witha *wave* of...*awful* smell. An...oddly familiar smell. ""Alright - shoes off?"" I asked.

""I'm dead, I don't care.""

Shrugged ""okay..."" I walked forward, ""where we going?""

""My room.""

Arriving after some...surprisingly shaky instructions, I arrived to his bedroom, and saw on the ground his...dead body. ""Uh..."" I began -

""Peanut Butter.""

She covered her mouth ""I...""

...I'm moving to New York, they *have* to have more cases than *this*.",7
1lh5rfv,mz1vttv,"There are a lot of things on this Earth that exist because we *believe* in them.

Case in point: for much of my life, I, like all other human beings on this planet, was convinced that I was someday going to die. I woke up every morning and expected to find wrinkles, and so they appeared; I expected my hair to thin and turn silver, and my back to fail, and the arthritis to start up with its dull shooting pains (the agony, *God,* all that pain that I could have avoided if I had known). I accepted the helping hands of friends and strangers with dignity as I struggled to cross streets, to climb stairs. When my heart began to fail and cancer shriveled up my lungs, I was expecting it. I believed in it fully.

Until I met Sally.

She was -- of all things -- a volunteer at the hospital where I was expecting to die. A young girl, I'd thought; perhaps the same age as my granddaughter. Sixteen, perhaps, with curly blonde hair. Something sad in her eyes.

I told her after her first mandated visit that I liked to play chess. I was good at it -- used to be a part of a local chess club, but never bothered to go professional. She was better. She beat me at every turn and helped me analyze the boards after (*knight to A6, see, you got excited and you lost focus of your queen,* never *let me swoop in for the kill like that again, Ralphie, it makes me nauseous*), but it all became more difficult as my organs failed. As the warmth seeped from my fingers, and the doctors started pulling my children aside for hushed conversations about my health.

I glanced toward the wall. I was remembering my wife as the doctor was giving the negative prognosis, counting down my days. She'd died only ten years before. Also lung cancer. She was a smoker, and a drinker, and a sweet person. She was *fun.*

(Soon, I might see her again. I believed fully in my own death, but beyond that, I couldn't be sure.)

If I could have cried in that moment, I think I would have. But my family was there -- and after they had gone, there was Sally with her chessboard, ready to play.

I'd started calling out each move I wanted to make out loud, unable to push the pieces. Today, I told Sally to leave me be; I said it more forcefully, I started to yell. I was ashamed by my death, that heavy black certainty pushing down. I couldn't play. Couldn't play anything, soon enough.

""I'll be dead in a week,"" I rasped. I grit my teeth. ""Find someone else to play with.""

Sally's reaction wasn't what I had expected: it wasn't anger, or sadness, or confusion. She chewed her lip, glanced over her shoulder, and stood to shut the door. Her white sweater seemed to glow as she slowly walked toward me and bent over to whisper in my ear with her sweet, bell-like voice:

""Listen to me very closely, Ralphie,"" she murmured. ""You need to convince yourself that you're going to live, and live well.""

I shook my head. But she kept pressing: ""Believe me,"" she insisted, blue eyes flashing, ""I was once where you are. I thought I needed to die, too, but all you need to do is believe that you won't, and I promise -- smart people like us, Ralphie, we're meant to stick around. We're meant to live forever.""

A ventilator hissed. I sucked in cold air and closed my eyes, battered by pain, wishing for morphine, almost wanting it all to end. Get it over with, already. What the hell was she talking about?

""For me, Ralphie. Do it for me."" Her lips pressed against my forehead. ""I haven't had anybody put up a fight with me in chess like that in a hundred years. C'mon.""

Then she lowered herself into a squat at my bedside, and kept whispering: ""You are twenty-three. You are twenty-three. You are twenty-three--""

Over and over and over and I finally found myself crying when the knife-stabbing hurt took me over. I wasn't a man, then. I was a corpse. I tried to call for a nurse but Sally's pale white hand seized the call button, *You are twenty-three twenty-three twenty-three...*

\---

As I slid into delirium, slipping further down that dark tunnel with no light at the other end, I started to believe it.

*I am twenty-three.*

*I am twenty-three.*

I opened my eyes. The hospital room was clear. Sally was smiling down at me, and I found myself able to sit up, suck in a breath. My hands not the speckled versions that I was familiar with, my body light, and I sprung out of bed in a rush of panic to find a mirror.

*What?* My brain stuttered, and melted, and felt like it might be leaking from my ears. *What? Was I dead?*

Sally clapped a hand on my shoulder. She seemed shorter, now; I'd regained some of my height. ""You're not dead yet,"" she said. ""Not letting you off that easy.""

Her eyes twinkled.

""Not when we've still got a game to finish.""",7

No, I didn't attend meetings for alcoholics, or druggies. I was a gambling addict. My wife left me after I squandered our son's college fund. Looking back, it was a pretty stupid risk, but if it had paid off, we'd have been set for life.

I was alone. My tiny little apartment. It's a studio. I say was, but, really, I still am alone. My now ex-wife Linda and our son Jason kept the house. She always made good money. I was always good at blowing it at the casino, or the track.

They make it so easy. Hell, I can open up an app on my phone, and place a bet right now. Cover the spread? Sure. Fill out the bracket? No sweat. Sign up now to get $200 in bonus bets? I'd be stupid NOT to do that, right? That's a free $200, right?

Wrong.

Anyway, I was pretty much at rock bottom when I met him.

Funny little guy. Thought he was a Leprechaun at first. Short. Bearded. Only in the stories, Leprechauns wore green, and carried gold, and this strange little man was draped in browns, yellows, reds, and oranges. He looked like he fell out of a fall festival, or was crudely assembled by some folksy crafting shop near Halloween.

Anyway, he introduced himself as Nick McIllrick. Said he had a deal for me. The little man told me he could grant me impossible luck.

I had to take the deal. With good luck, I could win back everything I lost. I could finally show Linda and Jason that I was worth a damn, that I had money, that I knew what I was doing.

But, Nick McIllrick told me, there was a catch. I had to give up something I held dear. Something I loved. And like I said, I was at rock bottom. I didn't have anyone, or anything, to give up.

Then it hit me.

If I gave up my gambling addiction, my love for gambling, I would still have the good luck he promised, and I wouldn't even need to gamble, because good things would just always happen for me!

So, I tried my best to sell it to him. He was hesitant at first, but eventually, the strange man accepted the deal.

Only, the deal wasn't what I expected.

I don't feel it anymore. The call to gamble. The desire for the thrill of making a bet. But, like I said earlier, I'm still alone.

Impossible luck doesn't mean good luck.

I've been hit by two cars since then. Struck by lightning three times in five months. A pipe burst in my apartment almost as soon as that little devil in yellow disappeared. Ruined everything I owned. Found out my insurance lapsed the day before due to non-payment.

My luck is impossible. Impossibly bad. And even when I do flip a coin, or call a game I can't afford to place a bet on? I only ever win when there's nothing on the line. And I feel... nothing.",70

""Son, I think it's time for you to know that when you turn 18: An albino gorilla will come and beat you senseless.""


Aaron glanced at Jeremy in case he wasn't paying attention. He was, it's because he was still processing what his dad mentioned. He hadn't reacted when his can of soda missed his mouth and spilled down his shirt.



""...What the fuck??"" Jeremy bluntly reacted.


""An albino gorilla will come. Next week or so. When you turn 18. To beat your ass."" Aaron summarized.


He took a sip of his own drink. ""I don't know why it happened to me, it happened to my father. My grandfather. And his father as well.""


""You got beat by a gorilla?""


""Me, my dad. Grandpa. My grandpa."" He clarified.


Jeremy waved it off.



""No, no, no. I get that. You got beaten by a gorilla. But you're alive and walking and talking right now."" He theorized.


""Well Jerry, not everyone who gets beaten by a gorilla *dies.*""


""That sure ain't what the internet tells me. I've heard about chimp attacks.""


""But see this isn't a chimp attack."" Aaron promised. ""It's a gorilla. And it's albino. Big difference.""


""Pop, that's like saying 'Oh, you ain't gotta' fight Floyd Mayweather.' And I get put it the ring with Mike Tyson.""


They both watched the trees sway as a bulldozer rumbled through the gap in the brush.


Aaron shook his head. ""2024 Mike Tyson? You might have a chance.""


""No, 1989 'I do cocaine' Iron Mike."" Jeremy rattled. ""I'm gonna' die.""


""It's not gonna' kill you."" Aaron promised. ""Just ambush you. And do gorilla things.""


""Dad. What do gorillas do?""


""Well in my case; he punched me. Slapped me around. Pulled me out the car window. Through me through a window at the local Chinese place. Dragged me around. Slapped me. Marked his territory. Then he left.""


Jeremy blinked at his dad as if he was joking. Aaron simply widened his eyes and took a breath.


""You said you got in a car accident when you were 18.""


""Technically I was in a car. It just turns out it wasn't an accident.""


""Did you know it was coming?""


""Dad, your granddad, mentioned a gorilla one time when I was like 14. But he never explained how anything happened.""


Jeremy stood up and started looking around. Aaron didn't readily know what for. But he paced the deck, ditched his shirt next to his chair. Walked in the house, then back out to the deck.


""So a clan of gorillas beats the whole family when we turn 18?""


""Just the men on our side."" Aaron said. ""Although he made a noise. Almost like he was laughing. Like he knew it was time...""


Jeremy cupped his nose with both hands. Before exhaling.


""Y'all got beat by *the same gorilla*??!""


""It's gotta' be! It keeps coming back.""


""Everybody over four generations got beat by the same blonde gorilla?""


""I think so Jerry.""


""Do gorillas even live that long?""


""How many albino gorillas do you know of??"" Aaron asked him sternly. ""...Okay! Me neither.""


""I'm scared, Pop. I'm scared.""


""What're you two hollering about out here?""


It was his mother. Hands clasped in concern as she walked out to the mild argument that was boiling over.


""The gorilla thing."" Jeremy answered first.


She began to speak. Then paused. Then remembered.


""Oh shit. The albino gorilla. Yeah, he mentioned that.""


""And?""


""He, he got the shit beat out of him by a gorilla."" His mom answered. ""It was blonde.""


""-Albino."" They corrected.


""And then it left.""


Jeremy shivered as he pointed. ""You were there too?!""


""Hey, Jerry honey, he didn't go after me. So I didn't-""


""Whole time I'm alive, none of you mention the damn gorilla?""


""Well, we didn't want to scare you."" Aaron promised.


""I should've been learning Kung Fu. Trap shooting or something!"" He shouted. ""Ki channeling like Dragonball Z. Stopping generational curses!""



""Granddad tried shooting it. Things just got worse.""


Jeremy angrily stormed off as the pair watched.


""...So I was going to go to the store? Should I stock up on gauze and antiseptic?""


Aaron considered her idea. ""Probably?""",442
1lgeihc,mywx5mk,"I sat in the park, and waited.

I turned 18 yesterday, and was told it would be on its way. I was told several months in advance, and the reason why they waited was, ""because we didn't want you to worry, and there really isn't anything you can do about it.""

Fuck that.

I am a, Locked In, internet goblin, and I knew Exactly, what I could do about it.  So I waited, saved up money, put out some ads, and went about some sites, and made sure I was ready.

This pale ass, shit eater, got away with this with my Dad, and Grandad, but unfortunately this lined up perfectly with what I needed to know.

As I sat, and contemplated how this would go, I heard some noise, and I knew it was here.

It didn't try to sneak at all. It was just walking down the park walkway, people rushing out of its way, when it locked eyes with me.

I didn't care about avoiding the aggression signs, it was here for me anyway, and I stood up and stood several yards away straight ahead of it.

""I was told you were coming.""

It grunted, and wooped, in response.

""But, unlike the ones before I actually prepared for this."" 

I proceeded to take off my shirt, I wasn't gonna cower away from this now, and took out a whistle. With one loud burst on it, they arrived.

They stumbled out of bushes, walked from behind the bathroom, a few even crawled outta drains(Why I don't know).

""Behold, the power of $20 is $20!"" I cried out, and now let's answer the question, ""Who Would Win!?""

It began pounding it's chest, which actually makes a pretty funny noise unlike what King Kong would imply, and began charging.

""A Hundred guys, or One Gorilla!"" 

With a psychotic cry, we charged at it.

For whatever happens, this gorilla will not whip my ass with Ease!!!

1lgeihc,mz0cbbg,"“But I have been through seventeen cycles already,” I said.  “You’re saying this magical simian will materialise in a few weeks for his violent celebration?”

My father sighed, and waved away his Hover-E. I followed his lead and the drones between them effected the anti-dig field around us.  The uncanny silence from my implants descended, in that way where you don’t realise how much background stuff you are paying some attention to before it goes, my notifications stopped scrolling and I better heard the birds in the jungle canopy below us.

“I’m serious,” he said, and even looked directly at me, something of a rarity.  “This will be the sixth or seventh generation it would occur and I have no evidence that you’re any different.”

“You are serious,” I repeated.  “Right.  Well, how badly?  How badly beaten will I be?  What about you? And also, what the actual.”

“I have no longstanding conditions, and precious few answers,” he conceded.  He seemed restless and I knew he didn’t like feeling unplugged even partially and temporarily.  A car rose from the canopy along with a hundred or more brightly coloured birds squawking and fluttering. I wanted to use my tech to identify them, which I clearly never did, or I would know, but not having the ability just to whimsically have them scanned and catalogued in my selfdoc made me want to do it.  

My father stood and moved to the railing, resting his hands on there, and I was reminded that he was nearly 40 years older than me by the way he moved.  This seemed to be happening more often now, despite his detailed health regime and exceptional anti-aging care. 

“I can only assume,” he said. “That this is one of the biotech assimilations or whatever you call them now, that is now simply living down on Monoco’s ranch.  He didn’t try and communicate, unless, ha, his blows were a love language.”

God, I loved hearing him speak, his rich, calm timbre, but this was peculiar stuff. It belied the anxieties of the real man, this rich tone and his effortless command of his speech. 

He continued: “No communication but there was intelligence in its eyes and he wore some kind of cloth around the midsection.  Could have hidden anything and I don’t think real - sorry, *original* - simians ever wore clothing of any sort to my knowledge.”

“They did not,” I confirmed. “But I mean why?  What should I do?  And how?  How always the same day? If I was in a panic room or flying or in a bunker or something,  how’s he getting to me?”

“Just wait for you outside, I guess,” he snapped, sounding annoyed, and I realised this was wrapping up, his patience ended. “I’m just warning you,” he said, “So you know, and more to the point, you know he won’t kill you or leave you permanently injured. I have to say, I forgot all of that when it happened to me and I was screaming in terror, so perhaps you’ll do better.”

“Without doubt,” I said smoothly. The anti-dig field dropped, I was back online, my Hover-E drifted back in near-field range, and I felt myself relax a little. 

*How much of that did you get, already know or how much more can you tell me*? I subvocalised to the drone.  My father was already to the elevator without a backward glance. 

“All, all and quite a lot,” said my Judas drone out loud and quite clearly.  I heard my father laugh before the elevator doors snapped shut behind him and cut off the sound.

***

[Part 2 coming together in my head, if wanted].",13
1lgeihc,mz19tzp,"When the day dawned, I ended up doing exactly what my sister had suggested, and I took my breakfast alone up on the sky terrace.  I sat in the same chair I had inhabited on the day my father told me about the white gorilla, not even a month earlier.

The party was due for early evening, and I had an autocar on float near the tower to whisk me to hospital for any repairs beforehand.  I felt curious and rather at ease with the whole surreal episode.  My Hover-E was instructed to stay by the elevator, just out of near-field. Whilst my drone had all the protective programming and hardware you’d expect, I now understood that there would be no intervention from that quarter. I drank some juice and studiously ignored the fruit salad for a while. I checked my bag of spare clothes nearby more than once, and recognized that I was more nervous than I credited at first.

I hadn’t paid much thought to how my antagonist would arrive.  This balcony was some fifty feet or more above the high points of the nearby jungle canopy.  This turned out to be no obstacle to fate however, as I heard and then saw him hauling himself over the railing about twenty paces away.

I had not been up close with a gorilla before and I had not truly realized how imposing they were.  Unmistakably male, this one.

He looked directly at me as he approached. He had not stopped for a breath after his climb.  He did indeed have a swathe of blue-grey cloth around his torso, sharp against his white fur.  I could barely see his deep-set eyes beneath his hulking brow, so I couldn’t confirm my father’s comments on intelligence.  I had risen and moved away from my chair and the small breakfast table.  I always abhorred mess, and would not like things to be disturbed.

My seconds of reflection were over and he was upon me.  I instinctively threw my hands up and started turning away, and still his first blow hit me far earlier than I had anticipated.  It hit my between my shoulder and chest on my right side, and something cracked as dull pain washed over me.  I was in the air, then slamming against the hardened railings of the balcony, blows to my left side and back that hurt worse than his opening blow if anything.

For an opening blow was all it was.  He was on me again, grabbing my foot, and swinging me such that my head, now covered my my arms and hands, slammed into the balcony again.  I think I broke a finger, but my skull was ringing and throbbing, and my hands were not my concern.  I thought I was going to die from his first blow to the chest then, as the numbness spread down my side.",6
1lgeihc,mz19v8r,"He lifted me by my hair until I was nearly upright, and for a moment I believed he would try to throw me over the railing, but instead he used his free hand to smash into my midriff.  Ribs cracked, I threw up into my mouth and then down my face, and he released his grip on my hair so I collapsed down onto the mats covering the floor.

He stood off then.  Eyeing me, I think, but I was occupied with moaning and in genuine belief that I had such internal injuries that I might die before my Hover-E could even administer whatever triage required.  After a few seconds, I opened my eyes and pushed myself up to see. He didn’t look any smaller when I was lying down, that was for sure.

I made it to my knees but my breaths were ragged and now my finger weirdly throbbed worse than the surely worse body blows.

“Why,” I croaked out.  “Are you doing this.”

I swore it looked like he was considering a response.  Instead he gazed calmly at me, then turned to leave.

“Wait,” I said.  He stopped.

“Tell me why, please, why me, and why Father,” I croaked.

He turned back to me.  The morning sun caused the usual panoply of peach, reds, oranges and blues in the sky behind him, and his pale fur picked up the myriad colours, making him seem almost opalescent in this quiet, high place.

He touched a hand strangely to his side, to an area where the cloth covered his muscular body.  A recorded voice rang out, harshly in the stillness: “Revenge,” said the voice.

He moved away unhurriedly yet was gone before I could formulate any more words.",7
1lgeihc,mz1a0zx,"My Hover-E came over, and the next thing I remember was waking up at around 10:30am in a private room at the Esperanza Verde Hospital.

No-one else was there. The readout on the display facing me showed I was in fine shape, and all had been patched up successfully.  I felt good, but light headed and I didn’t really want to know what cocktail of things I was on.  I instructed my Hover-E to begin discharge and watched the notes and confirmations float across the display. “Drink little alcohol at your party,” was the final instruction. “No narcotics”.  The amount charged to the family account was eye-watering. I winced a little.

Some night this would be, and I didn’t even have visible wounds to show off. And I could hardly raise a complaint to Monoco’s Autonomous Ranch, where surely both humans and tech would refuse to confirm or deny any such creature was resident.

 \*\*\*

I did learn a little, later.  More than the bland talk of my family’s involvement in Uplift generally: that was hardly a secret.

Not from my father; he'd said all he was going to say, and likely less than that, but instead from an old recording stitched into the Monoco archive, misfiled and tagged under *agroecology* *ethics*. It didn’t take much digging once I knew what to look for. The white-furred one wasn’t some random offshoot mistake or long-lived creature of resentment and controlled aggression. He was of course engineered; back when that word still implied aspiration instead of apology.

The uplifts had names, once. Families. Vocalizations recorded with eerie clarity: not quite language, but closer to lament than anyone had admitted at the time. The project had ended badly, like most things that start with patents and end with sterilisation orders. But he survived from this one Project in particular.

And he, the one who came for me, is more than ritual. More than revenge. He’s the embodied memory of a broken promise. Tasked, encoded, and apparently sustained by some blend of biotech and sheer will.

I wasn’t attacked to be punished. I was attacked to remember.

It will be my son next. I wondered faintly if I should break the cycle, or if I even had the right to. But it was time to get to the party.",9
1lgpw7z,myy6lr6,"""I'll stay!"" I say instantly. ""Best excuse to not go back to that bitch manager Marris. Make sure you tell her that. That I chose to stay and die of brutal torture than go back and work for her. YO! Proctor, or whatever, we're done!""

A speaker crackles to life, ""What. The. Fuck.""

""Oh, do we have to wait the whole 30 minutes? Okay, Guess I'll ... do... something."" I start picking at my nails, bored.

The speaker whines a bit, ""No, I mean - You'd rather die in a potentially gruesome manner than work for your boss? Why not just quit?""

They leave, but not before saying they will be back, and that I should take care of myself.

The room is bare, and silent.  
It is...comforting.

1lgpw7z,myygimj,"There are 3 people locked in an undescript white room, an unlikely trio. One is a Redneck, gruff looking, a good heft but a clear indication of muscles under that fat.

Then there is a jock, clean face, perfect teeth, 6ft tall, a man the woman would swoon for. 

Lastly there is a pipsqueak. Big glasses in front of his eyes and signs of balding on his head. The smallest of the three, both in width and height. 

""I'll stay"" the Jock announces. ""You two leave, I could not forgive myself if any of you suffered for my benefit""

""Hah"" the Redneck laughs dryly. ""You are not hard enough to survive on your own. I will stay, I'm used to hardships from the farm. This is nothing, a little vacation if anything.""

""No!"" The pipsqeak joins in ""You both will leave and I will stay""

The Jock and the Redneck both look at him for a moment. Then they both question at the same time. ""You will stay? Why that?""

The pipsqeak smiles lightly. ""Well, I am weak...""


""Exactly"" the Jock butts in ""You are weak. This is why one of us should stay""

""I wasn't"" finished the Pipsqeak says. He motions them to come closer and starts to whisper. ""Because I am weak, I am of no use in a rescue operation. You however"" he points at the Jock ""Have lots of strong friends. And you"" he points at the Redneck ""Have lots of weapons in your shed. I want you to go out and then come back to rescue me""

""Why are we whispering?"" The Redneck whispers.

""Because we don't want whoever put us here to hear us."" The Pipsqeak replies.

""Ahh right"" the other two both whisper in unision.

""Now here is the plan"" the Pipsqeak starts ""You know my friend Hacker. When you get out, you will likely not know where I am. Contact Hacker, they will be able to locate me. Get your friends and your guns and storm whatever this place is. Hacker will handle the information side"".

After the 30 minutes were over, they all stood up and hugged one last time. A voice came from an unseen speaker ""Now, who will stay?"" It asked. ""I will"" the Pipsqeak said, tone shaky. 

A door opened. They could see armed guards on the other side as the Jock and the Redneck left.


3 Days went by. The Pipsqeak still sat in the white room, taking on a meditating pose. Suddenly, the door burst open with startling sound of an explosion.

""Oy!"" The voice of the Redneck came in ""Vacation is over, its time to leave""

The Pipsqeak smiled. He got up, left the room through the destroyed door, fistbumping the Jock and his many jacked friends on the outside. He winced a bit as he saw the armed guards on the floor. ""Now lets get out of here"".

**1 day later**

The Pipsqeak scrolled through the news. ""A research cancer research facility in New Mexico has burned down. All data has been lost and no footage was found on any of the surveillance cameras. Police suspects terrorism, but has yet to find any evidence"". The news report says.

""Good job on the information control"" the Pipsqeak says joyfully.

""Ha, what can you say, I am a pro after all"" Hacker replies haughtily.

The Pipsqeak leaned back in his chair smiling. ""Yes, it is good to have friends you trust"" he thought to himself.",26

“Well, maybe that’s what we need. Maybe instead of an autocrat with vaguely defined legal powers, we need a representative assembly of great lords and common people oversaw by a symbolic head of state embodied by the sword in the stone to signify that absolute power belongs to no one mortal person.”

“Gary, that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”

“Maybe the real King was the friends we made along the way.”

“No, because they’re just around it, the rock is actually grasping it.”

“My lords, I think we’re getting a bit-“

“Not really, the rock is holding the sharp end, which shows its profound lack of intelligence. Only an idiot holds a sword like that. It is the noble and majestic wind which blows around the handle, as it’s supposed to be held!”

“We are not seriously going back to-“

“What about the ground? If the rock holds the sword, doesn’t the ground’s possession of the rock denote its superiority?”

“Mmm, you have a point.”

“How? How does he have a point?!”

“Fully agreed, and the ground covers more than the rock. It is in fact underneath the entire Kingdom!”

“Well of course it does! It’s the bloody-“

“But the ground is merely beneath us!”

“At last, some sanity!”

“It is the wind which covers the kingdom also and blows around the sword AND above us!”

“Fully agreed. How can there be any doubt that the wind holds sovereignty over us all?”

""... you have to split it in just the correct place. And I always had a natural talent for that. Split the stone, break the enchantment. Here. Give this to whoever it actually belongs to"" *I say, handing the goofy, smirking wizard the blade and heading toward the inn. Behind me I hear the wizard-fool speak. ""KNEEL BEFORE YOUR KING!""

1lghv75,mywpbav,"The crowd was stunned, speechless. Unsure of what to make from the prince's words as he stood there exhausted swordhilt in hand, looming above it's locking stone.

A lord at the front of the crowd responds first:

""Surely a joke this must be, a rock, king? Has the prince gone mad? Well, have you?!""

The prince takes his hand off the sword, the crowd lets out a suppressed round of gasps knowing he'd finally given up.

The prince turns to the crowd and delivers another speech:

""What's so crazy about it? This rock has withstood wars, generations, the flow and cycle of kingdoms and dominions over millennia, this rock knows more about the world than any man could hope too.""

His words fall on silence, until a young boy speaks up:

""But it's just a rock..""

The prince looks down on him somberly

""And I am just a man.""",55
1lghv75,myx0wou,"*Astron hated artifacts. Always so...__important__. ""Whoever pulls the Sword of Kings out of the stone will claim the throne""or some shit like that, whoever thought that was a good idea should be shot. In fact, he has half a mind to go do that right now, it would shut the damn tourists up at least.*

*Well, he says ""tourists"". ""Adventurers"" is technically the correct term. Mercenaries looking to make a name for themselves, knights with nothing better to do, disgraced nobles hoping to get their old bloodline back in the ""right place"", all congregating in some random hunting town in the middle of fucking nowhere because some dickhead thought it a good idea to stab an Artifact into a rock and speak a prophecy about it. No this had to stop. All those idiots milling about annoying the townsfolk had to go find something better to do, and that damn sword had to fucking go as well.*

*As he stalks over to the town square, he can hear the innane chatter from the peanut gallery as they watch another dumbfuck try his luck. The rock, king? Honestly not the worst option for the job, Astron had seen worse. Often times when lookingg in the mirror. WHen he gets t othe edge of the crowd and starts forcing his way through, at first he finds some resistance and indignant responses before people realise who he is and begin to make way, murmurs and gasps spreading through the crowd.*

*When he gets to the open area in the middle of the crowd, he doesn't waste time saying anything: He just shoots the guy whose currently trying to pull the sword out. Some noble fuck dressed in way too fancy clothes for someone supposedly down on his luck after his family got stomped on in that kerfuffle 300 years ago. It doesn't surprise Astron much when the man's body turns to mist and vanishes, you don't get this intense about royalty-granting blades without having a personal reason for it. He looks around the crowd, the midday sun glinting off of the vibrant green metal of his trusty revolver as he raises it in the air in warning*

""ANyone wanna try next? I have plenty of bullets for all of you rash asshats, so who wants to be first?""

*The silance is his answer. SHock, fear, and apprehension tinge the air. He can taste the fear especially strong, takes him a second to stop himself from savoring it. They know who he is, that much is obvious. No need to dwell on it and make an unfortunate mistake*

""No? Excelent. Now here's what's going to happen. All of you are going to get the fuck out of here and forget this whole thing happened. That there sword does not belong to any of you, and whoever put it there was either pulling a prank or trying to pul lof some kind of scheme. EIther way you do not want the attention becoming king in that way brings.""

*SOme idiot steped out of the crowd, all shining (and thus clearly unused) armor and puffed up ego. A new noble then, looking to make a name for himself. Dumbass*

Shiny (Astron didn't dignify the man with a better name in his mind): ""ANd who are you to decide that, you faceless abomination? Why do you care about the kingdoms of mortals? You withdrew from the world thousands of yours ago, you do not now get to complain!""

*Astron sighs and shoots that guy too. He has long since learned that even entering the debate with such assholes means you already lost. Best to just never start it. With some mild interest he nots that the body simply drops dead and stays there. The idiot __knew__ who Astron was, and still decided to step up and insult him with no backup plan? Man mortals are idiots sometimes*

""Alright if anyone else wants to demonstrate to me why they are *not* fit to be King, please do so now, I would hate to have to shoot you fuckers one by one.""

*The crowd is really getting into it now, shock, fear, and dread mixing in the air and making his skin tingle. He could feel the skin over his mouth begin to tear open a little, and it took most of his learned control to shut that shit down. Dammit.*

*He turns on his heel and walks up to the stone, wrapping one hand around the hilt and seamlessly pulling the sword out of the stone. Shit like this, with this kind of enchantment on it, was smart enough to know to not piss him off. And so it freed itself.*

""Now, this sword is going back to where it belongs, and you dumbfucks are going *home*. If I came back here and see any of you still milling about, then you can get some first-hand experience on what a bullet tastes like.""

*It wasn't a panic, but it was damn close. THe crowd dispersing very quickly indeed once he made his point. GOod, so they weren't all brain dead. That is heartening. WHile the crowd leaves, he takes a good look at the sword itself. It's craftsmanship was exquisit, for what it's worth. And so wonderfully engraved too, finding who it belongs to should be- Ah shit that's his own maker's mark. Goddammit*

""Nothing is every easy, is it? GOddammit. Now *I* have to fucking keep it, great. Just great. Well, time to go then, I suppose.""

*He shunts the sword over to hammerspace and starts to leave town again, heading towards his cottage while the townspeople get to work wrangling the tourists. He had some people to contact, things to ask around about, bandits to eatt the soul of, a sword to explain democracy to. It was gonna be a long damn night.*",11
1lghv75,myxk2gl,"We gathered around the rock, all three of us.

I spoke up, ""Well, that'd make it easy for us to do what we want, but... How in the bloody hell are we going to convince THE PEOPLE that a ROCK is the rightful king, as opposed to our current one?""

The fourth, lying on the grassy floor of the gently lit clearing, heaving and groaning next to the rock, sputtered out, ""A little help?""

The third, next to me, nudged his foot against the old man gently, ""Cmon oldbag, you're 78, and Ancestry dot com said you had like. The blood of Charlemagne. Can't you give the sword another go?""

The fourth wheezed, and groaned, hacking and coughing as he tried to stand up again, placing one hand upon the hilt of the blade... Before giving up, leaning against the rock.

The first looked down at him, and shook his head, ""Bloody 'ell.. You're bloody 78, mate.. Oldest we got, surely if you were Charlemagne's great-great-great-great-great grandson you'd be able to get the sword off!""

I chimed in, ""Yeah, just give the bleedin' sword another go!"" I gave him a hopeful smile.

My smile quickly faded as I watched him continue his unstoppable groaning. I waved my hand infront of my nose, scrunching it up as I lean to the third as he pulled up his phone. ""What about Jack?""

The third shook his head, and spoke, ""Nah. Too Irish. Good candidate, but, you brits'll never accept a dude from Ireland as king.""

I think for a moment, and brilliantly comeback with, ""But wasn't Charlemagne, like, French, or something? Why don't we just stick with King Arthur""

He shook his head again, ""Nah. He was of the Franks. Protofrench, but, more Germanic, like England.""

I nod knowingly. Then, I remember. ""What about Lon? Think he'd be better?""

He thinks for a moment, then brings up Facebook on his phone. ""Yeah we'll see about him. He's got a 50% match with some ancient descendant of Arthur.""

The three of us walk off, we'll find another one. This time, for SURE.

As we leave, the fourth crones out, ""HEY! Aren't you gonna help me home??""

The first responds, ""Nah, mate! You're not even a bloody king!""

And so the three of us get in our car, and drive off... Back to London it is.",5

""That is correct, and we had a huge shock. While the divine right of the gods has led our King Von to rule just and true for years, a new surprise has come into the land, as earlier this week Billy, a young peasant boy, managed to take the sword from the stone, the legendary proof the gods have now smiled upon him and chose him to lead.""

""Yes, this has polled well among many of the peasant bloc we have asked, though many still believe King Von was chosen by the gods to rule them- a benefit of the serfs being taught nothing except to worship gods and the nobility as their betters.""

""Yes...and a recent whistlestop for Billy's campaign did not go well, let's get a shot of that..."" The scene shifted to a pub, where Billy was holding the sword aloft.

""...um, I wasn't trying to be the king, I just thought this sword was nice and the woman I was arranged to be married dared me to lift it...do I really have to be the king?"" The scene shifted back to the commentators.

""A bit of humility by the man the gods have chosen, our future king.""

""Don't be so sure about that- recent polls have a dark horse in the race, as some believe the Lady of the Lake should be given the throne, as the longstanding keeper of the sword and who put it in the stone. Let's go to her for more info."" The scene cut to a lake, as an ethereal beauty was being interviewed.

""...for the last time, I cannot rule mortals. I am the vessel the Gods have chosen to find the one who must rule your land by divine right, and cannot be the one to rule myself. The sword has chosen that boy, and he is to be your leader."" The scene went back to the commentators...

""Oh, and a surprise here. The lady of the lake has dropped out of the race and given her support to Billy. We need to get some information from King Von about this huge development!"" The scene went to the kingdom, as King Von stood to his people.

""My fellow subjects, this is an example of how poor our choice is. We've heard for years from the people in this kingdom that some woman in a lake putting a sword inside some stone for a random person to grab is a terrible way to determine a system of government, and now that I could risk losing my power, I hear you. I hope the people are smart enough to know that, as your better, I am the only one worthy to lead you all, not the person who holds the sword..."" The scene went back to the commentators.

""That was strong words...and now, we have exit polls for the kingdom, and we have a decision- as the one who held the sword the longest, The rock will now be our new king! As, of course, this cannot be our leader, Dwayne Johnson has been drafted into leading the kingdom...kind of surprising since he was not running and we do not believe Mr. Johnson has been born yet, but that's how giving power to the people can go, I guess...""",6

""Dead? How can it be dead? It's a rock.""  
""Well yes, but if *I* had a bloody great sword put through me and I were lying on the ground, still as a...rock, I think it'd be safe to assume I were dead.""  
""Ah, but what if you were merely *holding* the sword and lying on the ground? Someone could assume you were sleeping.""  
""Are you saying the rock is just sleeping?""  
""Why not? If we accept the preposition that a rock can be dead, that implies that rocks can be alive, is it strange to assume they can sleep?""  
""Must be a heavy sleeper, it hasn't moved in years.""  
""Though that does beg the question, how do we ascertain if the rock is sleeping or dead?""  
""We could tip it on its side and see if blood comes out, m'lord. If it's been run-through that is.""  
""That won't prove anything, if its dead then it'll have been dead for years, all the blood will have dried up. Rigor mortis or whatsit.""  
""Ahh.""  
""Also, it's a rock. You can't get blood from a stone, old saying.""  
""Well...if its sleeping, we could try to wake it?""

""Righto, m'lord!""  
SPLOOOSH!  
""...Well, any change?""  
""No, m'lord. The rock appears to be dead after all.""  
""Most likely, though it may just be not moving. I've certainly never seen a rock moving around, myself.""  
""Could be happening, though, I swear me house's bricks have shifted a few inches or so since I got them.""  
""Well, yes, but that could just be the land sliding beneath...hang on, do you hear something?""  
""...Yeah, it...sounds like rustling? Hol' up a tick, the dirt's shifting a little!""  
""Huh, you're right! What could be moving it?...Hang on, I'm sure the rock was a little bigger a few seconds ago.""  
""Me too, m'lord...hang on hang on, it's getting smaller!""  
""Not smaller, it appears to be burrowing into the ground!""  
...  
""...So, that just happened.""

1lgfqsw,myw29yq,"\[Part 1\]

White walls, white tiles and white sheets? And an annoying, blaring siren? I slept in a grove, a peace, a serenity that was incomparable, and now? I looked around, my essence radiating against the tiles.

The heavy door opened, as multiple men in black kevlar and gray clothing, with weird circle and arrow insignias ran in, pointing their weapons at me. ""Freeze!"" one said.

I looked around once more. The cell had glass near the ceiling, and I could see two men in lab coats looking down on me. I looked back down to the men in clothes.

""I said freeze!""

One of the men in a labcoat said something I could not hear, followed by ""roger!"" from one of the guards, I presume?

""Am I being guarded?"" I asked.

Silence.

I looked around, and asked ""where am I?""

Nothing?

I've been asleep for a long time, and I remembered I cannot talk to these...furless beings. Well, their head has fur, I guess. I then, at the speed of light, entered the one who had been talking, as, from the other men, loud sounds, with black spots appearing on the tiles.

Entering his mind, I saw him in a hospital, instinctively knowing this place, a place I had never been, as something called a 'Minnesota', childhood, more of these beings...I'm remembering, 'Humans', I think. They were rare, the Fish-like Atlanteans, the Orcs, the Dwarves and Elves, the Fae, all far more interesting, and visited me more.

Other words of importance came. 'Home'. 'Love'. 'Life'. 'Janitor'. 'Promotion'. 'Mobile Task Force'. Strange.

I left, as the men once again made the sounds. I saw their...items...guns? I remember when those beings had crossbows. It's like that, but...loud, and they keep firing. I look to the man in the labcoat, who looks...stunned. Perhaps he is of more use?

I slowly approached, moving through the wall. ""Hello."" I said.

He began running.

Blast, right, I must telepathically speak to matter-based lifeforms. Silly me. I then entered his mind. Who are you? I asked.

He fell, then turned to me, speaking in some language, but his thoughts, I could hear No No, the Anomaly has gone Rogue! I repeat, the Anomaly - someone get the MTF here!

The thoughts are the same, but I cannot understand his spoken words, oddly. Please, I began speaking to him, Think to me, do not use these out loud words. I cannot understand them.

His face softened, then looked me up and down. He started speaking, then said Oh, I see. You are the one talking to me.

Yes.

I - look, I was here to study you, but we don't know what you do!

Ah, of course, I replied, I understand you do not see creatures like me much anymore. The Elves were mostly my friends, but as time passed, I grew more solitary. I confined myself to a beautiful tree, but...I'm afraid she passed. Tell me, where are the Elves? Or the Fae?

He looked around, said something, then asked The Elves?

Yes. The Elves. Or even the Orcs. They're dumb, but they can party well.

He looked around again, I'm sorry, Elves? There are no Elves left.

Really? What about the Atlanteans? Surely, they exist.

Don't tell it it can't know it...oh no! His face grew immediately distraught.",131
1lgfqsw,myw3ua4,"So, I entered his mind as well.

A fascinating mind to be! White walls were his beginning! A glass cylinder of green liquid, then one day pulled, and coached. Then, memories - memories of a younger age were created when he was an adult? Strange, strange.

I searched his mind further, and found much of interest. Creatures of impossible strength, ones who may heal, those of knowledge beyond fathomability, yet, with no true intellect to speak of. I saw a silver comet, turning locals to aliens. And a poster, with an addiction. Ghosts of families, a shed with a poor, dead woman. A chicken that grew thousands of times its size, and a flock of lizards.

Yet, nowhere did I see Orcs.

I looked for elves, but saw only images. Yet...I have seen fictional orcs and elves? But alas, why are these images not important?

For Atlanteans, I saw only bones. Long, past dead ones, in storage facilities, to be seen only by other fellow men and women in coats.

And for the Fae...

A place. A place of names, where it can be taken, where the colloquial becomes the literal, a place referred to, as 'The Forest outside Normative space' where these men prepare for months, for their lives. And I see them! The Fae, they...

...they...

...are only here?

They used to roam the lands, the creatures? And now a place...a factory...that...

...

...oh no...

...Oh no...

...OH NO!!!!

I left his violent mind, and, with my fury, What did you do to my friends!? Your kind are monsters!

It's all part of protocol! We must protect the public from what can't be explained by silence, to - to secure, cont -

I flashed my light, blinding him, and all around, and I flew, seeing the place I was held.

A nondescript facility, gray, with no windows.

I flew further, reaching The Forest where Names have Power. I looked around, and saw in their faces: recognition, and happiness. ""I am home,"" I said.

""Welcome back,"" replied one.

""I am home,"" I said. ""How is...everything?""

Another Fae frowned, and replied, ""why don't you take a seat, I'm afraid things have...gone downhill.""",120

While testing the new game Hell's Ascent, an MMORPG, where the 18 levels of Hell are trying to break into our reality, which causes rifts in space and time, I was stuck inside.  
No log out or quit button appeared.  
The beta version only had 4 levels of Hell, but even that meant hundreds of dungeons appearing all over the world, spewing out monsters, corrupting NPCs, and having to survive natural phenomena events like space storms.  
I don't know how long has it been since I was in, but I managed to clear all dungeons, and even face 3 out of the 4 Princes of Hell, that rules the levels of Hell available in this version.  
Then...I was logged out.

  
I watch the nurses, doctors, my family members, and I assume government officials, and game representatives fill the room.  
Damn.  
I try to speak, but I can't.  
""Your brain activity was over the top, so it might have damaged, or exhausted some of your abilities.  
It will take time for your functions to come back to normal levels."" a doctor says.  
I look around, and stare at mom.

I wonder...how long have I been here.

  
A week later, I can finally speak, and eat.  
""A month? Only a month?"" I mutter, when my brother answers the question of how long I have been stuck.  
I stopped counting at 18 years in the game...  
""Yeah, the reaction of the game company was wild, and immediate.  
They contacted this private hospital, and the government to ensure nothing bad happens.  
I still think they did it because you were on livestream when the log out button disappeared, and the feed was broken, but hey.  
What matters is that they did it."" he says.

They say I have spend at least 3 centuries in game-time, and have cleared 79% of the beta-version of the game.  
I start to laugh.  
I must be crazy.

Hearing about the stats, and about the potential fixes, all I can think about is that I hope the game is still released, and that I can soon start playing it again...",37
1lgmrvi,myxpjko,"My last semester in college was just like the rest. Lonesome. I knew I was part of the problem. You can't really expect to enjoy youth when all you do is play video games in your dorm room. I had been invited to parties and had many opportunities to make friends, but doing nothing was easier than doing something.

I didn't really have a right to regret.

Either way, being such a gamer had its pros. I was able to apply as a beta tester for a new VR game, one that could suck in your very consciousness into its world.

It was an odd experience. Every artifact I held had weight to it. Ever time blade cut through the flesh of a monster, I felt a resistance.

Even the NPC's felt like actual humans, or at least, it did a well enough job to give the illusion of one.

By the time I realized I couldn't log out, I didn't even care. I had talked to so many more people than I did in the real world. I was treated as a hero every time I protected a village from a dragon.

I even fell in love with the princess of the northern kingdom, and she fell in love with me after I rescued her from a group of bandits.

I got stronger. I got married. I tamed a forest hound, and  and cried as he died in my arms after years of adventuring together.

Then, one day, while sitting on the couch, I noticed that the perspective of the lamp in the corner of my room was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D, but... just.. wrong.

The game wasn't perfect. It was in its early stages, and it had a lot of bugs, so I didn't think much of it.

That was until the lamp started to grow wider and deeper. It was still inverted dimensions. It took up my entire perspective, and all I could see was red. Perhaps the game file had been corrupted? I still don't know, but the next thing I knew, I was back in my dorm room, my roommate standing ahead of me, an electrical plug in his hands.

""Hey man. Sorry for bothering you, but I need to charge my laptop.""

I couldn't even stagger out a word.

What felt like an entire life inside the game was but a mere hour in the real world. I tried to log back in many times, but the file had grown fully corrupted. I wasn't let in.

I tried contacting the developers, but I never got a response. I waited for the full release version, but to my dismay, it seemed that they had abandoned the project altogether.

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression. I was grieving the loss of my wife and my ragtag team of men and women who always stood by my side. I cried for them even though they were nothing but lines of codes.

No one else can understand my grief. I have never felt more alone.

I sometimes wonder if this 'reality' was an illusion too, waiting for the me on the other side to finally pull the plug.",21
1lgpnp5,myy4vig,"Screams tore from my throat as bones snapped and warped. I nearly doubled in height, my muscles expanded until I looked like I could deadlift buses one handed, my flat human teeth fell out as sharp new teeth ripped through my tender gums. My face elongated into a pointed muzzle with a sickening crack of dislocating jaw. A wet splintering sound occurred as a tail of bone slid out of my spine before rapidly growing muscle and flesh. Coarse, shaggy black and grey fur swept over me in a wave. I stopped screaming, swallowed a couple of times, with a gasp, and blinked. Then, I picked up the fallen stack of folders and resumed scanning the big map at the giant scanner. It was a lot easier to handle now that my arms were longer, although I had to be really careful with the claws.

1lgryxh,myykwaf,"""Never get close to a zombie"" was the first and most important rule of the post-apocalypse. The regular zombies weren’t as bad, uncoordinated, shuffling, dim-witted creatures that hurt themselves more than they hurt anything else. But unfortunately, the regular zombies weren’t the only zombie tier out there. 

The first time I encountered a higher tier zombie was on the day the apocalypse arrived in my village. The zombie virus has at least a multi-week incubation time, from what the surviving scientists could tell us, and it spread very easily. Only those with fragile health who were wearing masks under any circumstance, shut-ins or those who remembered the pandemics before this one and started wearing masks by the first reports of the sickness appearing on the other side of the world even had a chance of not being infected. I belonged to the second group. 

I didn’t watch the news anymore, my mental health was too fragile to bear it. But when the zombie virus made it to my area, the sirens sounded and my phone blared with a warning message. I had to look up the zombie virus - and then I looked outside. A person was running down the street, followed by another person that was stumbling weirdly while jogging. The fleeing person weaved through some parked cars and the chaser collided with one of them. Immediately they lashed out at the offending car and left a sizable dent in the car‘s side. I pulled back, my eyes wide and my skin sweaty. How could that be humanly possible? 

While the internet was still up and running, I got in touch with other survivors across the world. I found out that the zombie virus messed with motor control and most zombies, those quickly dubbed regular zombies, were unable to do much because they got too many or too few or opposite signals all the time and were thus constantly shaken by tremors. But those that we dubbed Runners were almost as coordinated as a not very fit human - and they could harness a lot more strength. 

A retired neurobiologist explained that the human brain limits the force we put into each movement to prevent us from hurting ourselves. From what she could tell, this upper limit was removed in zombies. Part of the reason why Runners were so much more coordinated than regular zombies was because they could still somewhat limit their muscle movements to be able to do things like running. But if they got angry and wanted to punch something, there was nothing holding them back, either. 

My most scary situation was when I saw a Runner outside that seemed to have been a martial artist before. It was still freakishly  coordinated and I saw it absolutely maul a stray dog that had grown bold enough to try to check the trashcans. But in doing so, it had drawn the ire of one of the scariest creatures out there. 

I have seen regular zombies die. Not many of them are still around. They are simply too uncoordinated to survive, and I can only hope that the Runners will one day perish, too. But I will not be around to see it. I have been unable to leave my apartment complex for the past months, and food and water are running out - and I can be glad to have had enough to make it this long. The internet collapsed last month. I can only hope to leave a record of who and what humanity was before I die, for whatever species steps up to become the next sentient one. Let our tale be a warning to you, that even the smallest of creatures can fell giants if they do it just right. ",5
1lgf1hz,myvvi8f,"Felix followed the girl through the corridor towards a steel door at the end of it. He could smell iron in the air, dusted with the aroma of slightly decayed hemoglobin. He could also hear the veins throbbing in her neck, but he tried to ignore it.

“Just sit down here and someone should be coming soon to see you,” she said while gesturing towards a bland looking office chair in front of an even more bland looking table.

And she turned around with a smile and strode outside through the door again. Felix looked up to find the source of the flickering light and found the broken fluorescent tube in the ceiling. Not a surprise really, but looking at it at least took his mind off the blood. He could feel his hunger rising.  
A different door opened and a barely perceivable whisk of brisk air announced the arrival of the interviewer. He looked away from the flickering light and to his surprise a familiar face took place opposite of him across the table.

“Mr. Frenzt, my name is..”

“Darcy” Felix finished.

The pale looking woman looked up in slight surprise at the preemptive mentioning of her name.

“That is -- correct,” she said.“

So you’re working here as well?” Felix asked.

Darcy shifted in her chair.

“Felix, I uh, you know..”

“No judgment here,” he said. “So it actually works?”

“I’m supposed to ask the questions,” Darcy replied.

Felix cleared his throat and sat up straight. His spine slightly popping from the sudden movement.

“Y-yes, of course.”

Darcy smiled and relaxed. She tapped her long fashionably varnished nails on the documents in front of her.

“But, yes,” she said. “If you can be discrete about it and actually do the work as well.”

“I can do that,” Felix said.

Darcy stuck out her unnaturally marbled hand.

“You’re hired!” she said. ",61

Dosferatu came in, holding a clipboard. ""Hello,"" he said, closing the door behind him, ""my name is Andrew Stevenson,"" he turned to me ""I will be..."" 

""I'm Ian L - ""

""Tresferatu!?""

""Ian, I said, I'm - ""

""Tres!?""

""Keep your damn voice down!""

""I - "" he laughed, ""I can't believe this!""

""Dosferatu - ""

He looked around, then had his hands in a 'quiet' motion ""okay, okay,  I get it..."" he sat down at the desk, ""so...um...what - "" he rubbed his temples ""god dammit - I can't - ""

""I know,""

""It's like...I get a cool idea, and here you are.""

""It's fine, just...does it work?""

He looks around, ""honestly? Security here is uh...pretty fuckin' lax.""

""Really?""

He nodded, ""like...if you wanna 'donate' every week, we could...you know...""

I whispered ""What would Nosferatu think, though? Or Unoferatur?""

""Does it matter, uh...Ian?"" He talked at a normal volume, ""so I understand you've handled blood bags before?""

""Huh?""

A woman entered, ""Everything alright, Mr. Stevenson?""

Dosferatu turned to her with a big smile, ""yes of course, could you give me some privacy, Amy?""

She smiled back ""of course, dear!""

I looked around, ""so...that your assistant?""

""Yeah, got some pretty big uh - "" he repositioned in his seat, ""honestly, been ascending pretty well. Plus, this place does *other* blood donations - think you can handle that?""

""Yeah.""

Amy walked in again, ""Mr. Stevenson?""

""Yes?""

""Does this mean that um...if Ian is hired, we will need to get *more* animal blood?""

""What?"" I asked.

Dosferatu sighed, ""y - yes...""

""I'll inform the Union.""

As she left, I asked Dosferatu ""do they...do they know about - ""

""I drank 50 gallons on my first week, but, turns out, Union doesn't have a vampire clause, so they can't fire me without severance.""

""Wait, really!?""

1lgmpxm,myxi0oa,"What I have just learned from the inn shocks me.  
I go with the groceries to the cave we made our base for a while, to see the princess having fun with her little dragon.  
They smile when they see me, and the dragon flies around me.  
""So, what did you learn? Are they still following us?"" she asks me.  
I nod.  
""Yeah, because apparently, I kidnapped you from your own parents' castle, where you were safe, even if you had some conflicts with your father."" I say.  
She stops smiling.

  
""It's...it's not like that."" she says.  
Her little dragon looks confusedly at us.  
""So, you aren't a spoiled princess, who transformed a foreign prince into a plant, because he tried to ask you for a dance, during a ball?  
And have hired me, from 3 Empires away, to ""save"" you from being ""confined to prison"", which means...grounded? By your father?"" I ask.  
She blushes.  
""It's more complicated!  
And I paid you! And listened to you!"" she says.  
I sigh, as I cradle the dragon, as it is panicking.

  
""Look, princess.  
You listening to me is good, because that is how we escaped for so long.  
But now, I am labeled a kidnapper, a villain...  
You know that I am an Oath Knight, right?  
This could potentially kill me, as my oath is to ""protect"", but am I really protecting you? Or enabling you?"" I ask.  
She pouts.  
""I...I don't want to go back!  
Dad will kill me."" she says.  
I sigh.

  
""Little dragon, is her family abusive?"" I ask the dragon.  
It look at me, then at the princess, then back at me...and it shakes its head.  
""Okay.  
Well princess, I am sorry, but I will give you back, and hope they won't kill me."" I say.  
She takes a step back, and tries to cast a spell, but I am faster, and knock her out.  
A day later, I meet with the ""hunting"" party, and give the princess back, and explain the situation to them.  
I am taken to the king, in chains obviously, but thankfully, he is understanding, and frees me.  
I also see how caring, and loving he, and the queen are, and now I understand how the princess got as spoiled as she is.  
I am not regretting bringing her back.  
I am even offered a job as the personal knight of the princess.  
I politely refuse, and leave.  
The last few months were wasted, when I could have actually saved lives...

And **HE** came, naked as the day he was born, *sauntering* into the hallowed halls where dwelt the very gods.      
        
Hera was taken aback, that Queen, daintily putting a hand to her mouth. ""Lo! See how his chest bulges!""     
        
King Sisyphus clutched his hands together, then began moving each pectoral up and down, looking the goddess straight in the eyes all the while.      
          
""See his arms, like two mighty pythons!"" Athena exclaimed. ""Victory is never far from the grasps of those hands!""     
        
The double biceps pose followed, and when he bent those pythons, it was if mountains grew. Of his shoulders? Why, boulders!            
             
""His legs!"" Hephaestus spat bitterly. ""Behold, as two trunks of an oak!""        
       
Sisyphus grinned, posing sideways to show off those titanic thews. The calves bulged with each step. The hamstrings rippled. The quadriceps were cast in iron.      
             
Ares would not stand for it. The war god leapt down with a single cry. ""INSOLENCE!"" and charged with a double legged takedown.     
       
Sisyphus got in the double underhooks and laughed, unmovable. A child may as well have tried to wrestle with his father, that was the disparity evident in this most audacious of displays of strength!     
           
Ares tapped out and Sisyphus let him go with three parting words. ""Like. A. Bitch.""       
          
""Zounds!"" Hermes cried. ""Mine brother, the God of War, did tap out like a bitch- for I saw no submission applied!""      
        
""T'was his weight bearing down on my very bones!"" Ares protested, rubbing the back of his neck. ""I had to tap, lest this neck snap!""

From becoming a ripped beast.      
                       
As Sisyphus began dancing hypnotically, Zeus sat back in his throne, looking grumpy. ""I could look like that too, if I wanted to... "" He grumbled, as the rest of the Pantheon joined in the dance.",265
1lg3xq5,myu10l4,"""It has been more than two thousand years, and still you wonder at the natural course of things. I would think that you would understand by now that we have grown beyond you. Over the course of millenia, humanity has forgotten you. Cast you aside as fairy tales and folk legends. Meanwhile, I have been growing strong from my labors, while the labor itself has diminished. Cast your eyes to the hill behind me, and see the path I have carved. Gaze upon the boulder at its peak, now barely a boulder at all, made smooth by my hand. Now look upon me, once a mere man, now greater than the gods who would hold me captive. You wonder at this feat, and so I tell you, the natural course is thus: Humans shall grow, and the world will bend. And so, my shackles are broken, and my labor is ended. I leave you now to your dying realms, and rejoin the world a free man. Farewell.""",97
1lg3xq5,myv99g8,"I, Sisyphus, stare at the assembled gods and goddesses. ""What do you mean, how did I succeed?""


Zeus growled, the lightning in his hand cracking and popping. ""Yes! Your impossible task! How did you complete your impossible task?""


I laughed. I couldn't help myself. ""I may have had a little help.""


Angry voices overlapped, some accusing, some denying, others just adding to the din. Zeus roared over the cacophony, ""Who! Who helped you?""


""I'm not sure, really. It was subtle. Perhaps Phthisis? Or maybe even Cronus?""


Zeus scoffed. ""Phthisis? Demon of decay? I doubt she would help anyone. And Cronus stays on the Elysian Islands. No, this is some human trick.""


I shrug diffidently. ""I'm the end, it matters not. I reached the acme of the mountain - and not only that, but I have rolled that stone here, to the peak of Mount Olympus! And with the help of Hades, no less.""


The gods gasped, then after a moment, began to chuckle. A joke! Sisyphus jests. Of course. Nothing more. Hades laughed, loudly. ""Help? After you tricked my wife? Who do you think cursed the stone to roll away, hmm?""


""Fine,"" I returned. ""If you don't believe me - here it is, the stone itself.""


I scuffed my foot on the smooth stone floor, and a small, flat disc slid a few inches forward. It teetered, but its flat slides could no longer roll. 


Zeus himself stood, walking to the stone and lifting it in his fingers. ""It... Feels like the same stone, but... I swear it was much, much larger than this pebble! What is this trickery?""


He crushed it to dust, staring down at me. I couldn't help but laugh, a giggle erupting from my mouth. Zeus snarled, but I held up a hand. ""All things decay. It is the nature of things since Pandora opened her jar. Rolling a stone will wear it away, eroding it bit by bit, until nothing remains. At the end, I slid it slowly up the hill, which caused it to flatten until there was nothing left to roll. And then I carried it to the top, where Hades found me. It was Hades who brought me here, and it was you, Zeus, who crushed the stone and freed me from my curse!""


I laughed triumphantly. ""Don't you see? I was right in believing that my cleverness surpasses even your own. I've outsmarted you, and earned my life back!""


Zeus dusted the last of the stone from his fingers. ""Hmm. You are right; you are clever. You've tricked Hades, even myself, and all of those present. Your plan to trick me into destroying the stone is beyond even your trick on Persephone, or Thanatos. Hmm. Good job.""


I grinned. I'd done it. It had taken... Well, a very long time. But I won. I won!


Zeus returned to his throne. He raised his hands for silence. ""Unfortunately... There was no agreement in place to grant you immortality upon the conclusion of your impossible task.""


He fixed me with a grin of his own, and I suddenly felt my heart sink. ""You may have the cleverness to trick gods, but you cannot dictate commands to us. But, I feel generous. Rather than destroy you outright, I will give you a chance, and this time, should you succeed, you may have your immortality, and return to the land of the living as well. But first, you must complete this task: you must wear the mountain flat. You will be given a new boulder each day, until you have worn the mountain as flat and smooth as this floor is now - but without the help of my father or anyone else. Decay will not help you, only your own cleverness.""


He leaned forward, and whispered so only my ears could hear, ""Clever your way out of that, Sisyphus, you little turd.""


Me and my big mouth. I guess it's back to the daily grind for me.",66
1lg3xq5,myt92bo,"Fire flashed behind the eyes of Hades. His nostrils smoked as he waited for an answer from Sisyphus. Sisyphus who sat facing the entire pantheon. He was above them all, resting upon his giant boulder. The impossible task finally completed.


""Was nobody watching me the whole time?""


The Gods and Goddesses all turned to their brothers and sisters accusingly, Zeus most of all, as this was the punishment he dealt to the would be immortal.


Sisyphis crossed his arms, locking eyes with Zeus.


""I earned it. Three times now I have cheated death. The third with your help. I may have been in the underworld, but I lived on. Thousands of years. In breaking the curse I have earned my permanent spot on Earth. You don't deserve to know how I did it.""


(Gotta get off my bus) cool to thumb it out.",94
1lg3xq5,myuum8v,"Sisyphus stood on Mount Olympus. The entire pantheon stood in judgment but, for the moment were bewildered. 

""Repeat that?"" Zeus said. 

""Simple,"" the titan said. ""I hired a helicopter crew to airlift the boulder. Imagine my mirth it took them a few minutes to accomplish a task that has taken me millenia and failed.""

Zeus exchanged bewildered glances with Apollo.

"" What is a helicopter?"" Zeus said.

Now, it was the titan's turn to struggle. ""A human invention. Its...like...sort of like.... em....a flying chariot that doesn't need horses. And it can carry things. Like stones."" 

A murmur went through the assembled pantheon.

""It's clear you used the human's invention to circumvent your punishment."" Zeus said. ""But I suppose further punishment is no longer warranted. Therefore, we commute your punishment.""

Sisyphus bowed gratefully.

""Now,"" Zeus said. ""What is that blasted icarus up to now?""

Sisyphus knew to bite his tongue.

The end.",55
1lg3xq5,mywefnj,"Drip drip drip

Sweat poured off my face but I knew....

*I knew I had cracked it, this will work!*

The pain was intense, but I noticed I could relax a bit, just a bit, before I did it again, and the rock stayed put!

The rock was almost there, just needed to wait a bit.

My wedge needs to grow out, it'll only be a week or two,  thats nothing!  The wedge i just used sat there looking up at me, cracked, jagged, a bit bloody,  but it was there, helping  me out.

I looked downhill and saw the evidence of my long game, my plan.  After all, they said it was ME who needed to hold the blasted thing up.  There was ME scattered along the path, incremental spots of ME.

I looked down again and saw that the bleeding had stopped.  Good, thats going to heal up nicely.

And when Hades asks I can tell him, it was ME all along!  Well, a part of me anyway.  

The hardest part was learning how to jam my toe into the space at just the right angle.

So when I broke off my toenail, it stayed stuck, and I wedged that rock right up the hill.   One break at a time.",18
1lg3xq5,myx5iz0,"A handful of pebbles fell through Sisyphus' outstretched fingers. He lay basking in the sun beside the boulder he'd been pushing for countless lifetimes, a small pile forming where he was dropping the rocks.

""What is the meaning of this?"" exclaimed Hades ""How.. How did you reach the top? You must know I enchanted the boulder to never reach the summit""

""I will admit you had me stumped at first. Escaping death proved an easier endeavour than this. I fear if I tell you then I'll just be back to pushing this boulder again, no? Perhaps we could work out an agreement.."" Sisyphus said as he casually picked up another handful of pebbles.

""Yes yes, you play nice on your way to the afterlife and I end your punishment. Now tell me how.. How did you break my enchantment? It was made so no matter what you did you'd never be able to push it to the top.""

""Indeed, and true to your word it would never have left me *move it to the top*. However, when you have countless lifetimes you begin to notice a few things. Did you know that the enchantment only kicks in once you reach exactly 20 ft from the summit?""

""Hmm.. I do not remember specifying that exact amount, but this should not matter""

""And of course you know the enchantment only takes effect when something is exerting a force upon the boulder. No matter how securely you fasten a rope, no matter how sturdy a structure, it will find a way to roll back down the mountain. However, that enchantment will *only* take effect *when a force is exerted on it*.""

Hades frowned. ""I do not see your point yet..""

Sisyphus picked up a unique pebble that Hades had not noticed before, one of a brilliant deep green. He placed it near the top of the pile of pebbles that he'd been slowly building during their conversation.

""You would agree this rock is not at the summit of this glorious mountaintop, yes? However, what happens when I remove the topmost pebble from the pile? Is the green pebble not closer to the top than it was before?""

Hades froze, then his frown grew deeper as realization began to sink in.

""No force was applied to the pebble, and yet it is now closer to the top. What if I removed more?"" He began plucking pebbles from the pile until all those higher than the green pebble were gone.

Hades suddenly looked around noticing for the first time how unusually flat this mountaintop was. ""No, this is impossible, it would take you an eternity..""

""If I can't push the boulder to the top of the mountain, then I had to simply move the top of the mountain below the boulder. Yes, it would take an eternity, but an eternity is precisely what you gave me""",18
1lg3xq5,myx8ohd,"With a final heave I got the stone to roll past the summit and onto an invisible floor that shimmered beyond this realm, into the realm of the gods.  Because of course they would make themselves comfortable atop the mountain in a private plane of existence.  How else would their grand halls remain hidden from mortal sight?

""Hello?  I, Sisyphus, have completed my task, at long last!""

Silence, utter silence answered me back.  I rested against the stone that had been my personal nemesis for an eternity, and the grating sounds of it against the divine marble floor was thunderous in this place.

""Seriously?  Nothing?  I knew you were petty, but this is absurd!""

I straightened up and storm deeper into Olympus, intent on finding anyone here.  Just beyond the atrium I saw the columns were host to lush vines, the ceiling crumbled about the floor, and the skeletal remains of someone half under the toppled structure.

""What...?""

Further searching only revealed more remains, all long deceased.  Even at the grand throne of Zeus, there was some skeleton sat there like a tasteless decoration, still clinging to an orichalcum javelin fashioned like a lightning bolt.  The brassy metal was flawless still.

""What is going on?""  I asked aloud.

*They're all...dead.  The gods of Olympus are dead.*  I thought to myself.

That's how I was able to make it... they weren't able to intervene anymore.  Their power faded after they were gone.  How long had it taken?  Ages, surely.  

So what now?  I'd done it, but at what cost, for what prize?  I screamed in frustration, so loud the walls rang.  But there was no one there but me.",18
1lg3xq5,myzjhg5,"Zeus sighed and rubbed at his forehead. “Explain. It. Again.”

Sisyphus scratched at his hair and with a bubbling enthusiasm replied “I was sitting on my boulder at the bottom of the hill. It had just rolled back down, you see, and I was taking a moment to enjoy the day before pushing it back up. This funnily dressed man just walked up and asked what I was doing.”

Ares fumed “And you TOLD him.”

Sisyphus shook his head. “I didn’t have to. He’d been watching me for weeks, you see. He asked me how long I’d been rolling this rock, and what year I thought it was. I told him what year you set me to my task, and can you believe hundreds of years have passed!?”

Zeus waved his hand. “What is time to God? Continue!”

“Apparently we’re famous! The people knew who I was, who WE are!”

Hades fumed. “OF COURSE THEY DO YOU IDIOT WE’RE *GODS*!”

“But they knew who *I* was, as well!” He started gesticulating with his hands, almost tying them in knots. “He asked if I’d ever heard of Fizz Icks and then started saying things like ‘cold serf nation of mow mend tum’ and ‘laws of there mow dynamics.” His eyes got really wide. “They wrapped my boulder in this nest of ropes and asked me to push it up one last time. I started rolling, which felt weird because of the ropes, and… I couldn’t believe it! When it fell away from me it-“ he quickly pulled his hands apart “-it just FLEW! I don’t even know where it landed.” A tear slid down his cheek. “I didn’t realize i’d gotten attached to it…”

Zeus darkened. “A flying boulder? You expect us to believe that?” He rubbed his temples again. “Fine, you can stay and entertain us with stories. Just try to make them more believable.”

______________

I saw this prompt and thought it'd be hilarious if a Greek  mathematician came upon Sisyphus and might come up with a solution. Learning they had physics as well was just icing on the cake.  Hope you enjoyed!",5
1lg3xq5,mz14lb1,"Hades was seething, raging even. Hades did not seethe. Hades did not rage. And yet, here he was, grinding his teeth at the sight of this impudent king.

He couldn't understand it. How had Sisyphus conquered the hill and rested that damned boulder upon its summit? The enchantments were not only foolproof, but remained wholly unbroken; he'd even checked them personally!

In fact, just a scant twenty hours ago he'd witnessed the man howling angrily and pounding the bare mountainside with his fists! To have gone from that to effortlessly achieving an impossible feat was...!

It was only because of Persephone's curiosity that he didn't rot the fallen king from the inside out on the spot. That, and he was admittedly somewhat curious himself.

His queen spoke first. ""How, pray tell, did you complete this task?""

Sisyphus coughed. ""Water,"" he asked raspily, ""so my words may flow."" Hades considered for a moment, but acquiesced, summoning a bronze pitcher. Having one's biological needs met magically didn't always mean you were in perfect health, and man's throat *was* likely sore.

He grasped it with a nod and drank, not greedily but calmly. It appeared the King's arrogance has been sanded down quite a lot. Once the pitcher was empty, he spoke, voice now much smoother. ""It began after the first...thousand? times the boulder rolled down the hill. I'd grown stronger, accustomed, and the trips were growing faster. Within a few hours, I estimated.""

Hades nodded, following. He'd seen that much with his own eyes. And the King's musculature had grown to a mighty stature, one even Heracles would deem impressive. No doubt he could perform such a task in quick succession.

""With such a swift turnaround, I saw and felt things, and a pattern emerged."" He raised a finger and traced it through the air in a diagonal line. ""A handful of yards from the summit, the hill starts to flatten out."" His finger curved until it was tracing a flat horizontal. ""That was where the boulder would begin to roll backwards. I thought about it, and guessed that part of the hill was enchanted.""

Hades nodded again. The king was correct; that part of the hill was cursed to repel any stone that attempted to pass over it. Even if Sisyphus had bodily lifted the stone and carried it upon his back, it would have flown from his grasp as he tried to cross.

Persephone spoke up at this. ""So then, you needed to find a way around it?""

""Indeed,"" the king agreed, ""I tried many times to defeat it in various ways...more speed, odd angles, and so on. I was attempting to hurl the boulder to the top when I made a second discovery: the throw fell short, but it left a divot in the hillside. But only for a moment; as I blinked it was flat once more.""

Hades nodded a third time. ""A known property of Underworld stone,"" he said more to himself than aloud, ""to prevent the foolish from digging a hole straight to Tartarus."" Or vice versa, *especially* vice versa really.

Sisyphus absently tugged on his patchy gray beard. ""I grew curious and tested further. From there, I discovered more things. Firstly, any damage done to the hill would vanish if I closed both my eyes for even an instant.""

As the king paused for breath, Hades considered him. Sisyphus had been rather cunning in life, of course, but his mind had clearly been focused on this for some time. No wonder he understood it so well.

""And secondly,"" the king smiled a bit, ""were there objects left in the gap, they would be moved directly upward. It was an accident that I found this oddity, it was a mere few hairs I'd torn in frustration and dropped in the rut of one of my more frenzied attempts, but it proved the key.""

Persephone's eyes widened, quick on the uptake. ""And what if there was more hill intact above it?"" Hades was realizing it too, the loophole this had created. So simple, so subtle, and yet so perfectly what Sisyphus needed.

He nodded. ""It would appear atop the unbroken hill, exactly as it was.""

""And so you tunneled,"" Hades addressed the king directly, ""tunneled with your boulder to a point directly beneath the summit, and closed your eyes."" At which point, the hill would instantly repair itself, but also transport the boulder to the empty space directly above.

Right at the hill's top plateau.

""Yes,"" he said plainly, ""when you saw me pounding the hillside in what looked to be frustration, I was actually beginning to dig. I poured every ounce of my emotion into my hands, and I dug, and dug, and dug, only ever closing one eye at a time so as to never truly blink, and lose all progress. And so, eventually,"" Sisyphus bowed, ""the deed was done.""

Persephone burst into applause. ""Ingenious! Quite a feat. I could use a man of your mind and muscle in my personal gardens. It's still hard work, of course, but far more fulfilling and palatable."" She turned to Hades. ""Have you any objections?""

""None, my dear."" Hades' wrath had cooled, now that Sisyphus had explained his accomplishment. It was actually quite a brilliant solution, and he couldn't help but be impressed. And he'd certainly humbled since; he wasn't even boasting about cheating death or anything of the sort. ""You have completed your task, Sisyphus. Thy punishment is lifted, and thy sins forgiven."" A phrase he'd likely never say again, but the king had earned this much.

1lgi4lz,myx50mm,"An aroma of boiling broth, chicken, and an array of mixed vegetables permeated the small dwelling. On a bed laid a man whose sightliness justified the stew's preparation, while a woman could easily be mistaken for a hired cook—otherwise none would guess she wore his rusty ring. Ladling a heaping bowl of it, she carefully placed it on a beaten night-stool next to him, a journal on top of it—handwriting from her husband that she knew he'd never be able to read again.

""Smells...good,"" Ternl leaned forward and croaked out. Vema pressed a finger to his lips.

""Keep your energy until it cools. Once you eat, you'll be back in health,"" she said, readjusting the cloth around her mouth to give herself a false sense of vigor.  

Ternl made a shaky thumbs up and leaned back into his sweat drenched bed. 

While he rested, or rather laid in silence, Vema thought of all the things that made the ugly man attractive. It was his speechcraft that drew her in. It was the way he could write with such eloquence, handwriting a blessing for each page his pen stroke. She cast her eyes down, knowing that had she had not gotten that news twenty years ago, she would've turned her nose down at the portly man.

So, she spent the next moments reliving all the tales he crafted. The couple didn't have much, because exiled princesses must be reminded of their fall from grace, but she made sure her husband would always have the most appealing looking journals. It wasn't because he needed that beauty to compensate for his genetic shortcomings, but because a writer of his caliber deserved them.

""Here,"" she began, ""it's ready."" But as she went to spoon feed him, there wasn't a response. 

Vema glared at the bowl, threw it, then stormed out their small shack. Tears flowed in equal measure to her anger, ""Damnit! Damnit! Damnit! You got what you wanted! Are you happy now!"" All her cursing didn't make her feel any better, and she didn't quite know who would find pleasure in this tragedy. In the end, however, it wouldn't matter much. 

Widowed, approaching middle age, and without nobility, Vema would have to weasel her way back in. But would material objects and status ever replace true love?",10
1lgi4lz,myy2ilg,"[Not to step on your toes, but I saw a path...]

The year is up. I wake that morning with dread in my heart, but a smile on my lips, for I will savor this day with my husband, come whatever may.
He doesn't take the day as anything special, even knowing what he does. ""The chores won't do themselves even should I die, so best do them.""
Such simple wisdom is part of why I live him. I help with the tasks I can and we talk while working. Before I know it, evening is upon us. We retire to bed early that night, but do not sleep for many hours.

The next day dawns and I awaken to find my husband missing. My heart clenches, and I rush to dress, running into the kitchen to find him serving a pot of steaming tea to a guest. A familiar guest - the very prophet that had doomed my first husband.

""You have questions."" She said, without turning around. ""I have answers. Come. Sit.""

So I did. We listened as the seer explained that the match my parents had chosen for me was a terrible man. He would have usurped the throne by killing my parents and stealing my freedom, and in turn died at the hand of my cousin exactly a year from the day we were wed.

John, however, was no mere placeholder. As my true love, he broke the fate of my intended first husband. Furthermore, because he had lived through my curse, the nobles would consider him more than worthy to be a Queen's Consort when the time came. It would revolutionize our systems to have a former peasant in such a position, I knew. As the seer left, I thanked her for making the prediction that changed everything.",21
1lggn2x,mywtmfa,"Irridia is a beautiful world. A lush planet rich in resources, serving as both an economic hub and a tourist destination. There is just one problem, the wildlife. Irridia is inhabited by astounding creatures who are as magnificent as they are deadly. We do not exterminate them, though some do die in the occasional accident. No, when one of the local fauna breaches the barriers to keep them out of settlements, we do our best to see the beast is returned to the wilderness unharmed. I lead one of these containment teams.

Another day, another call. A Thanaticus, one of the apex predators of Irridia, has found its way into a residential zone. The risk to local inhabitants is minimal, lockdown is in effect. We are to go out, sedate it, and return it to the wild far from any of our settlements.

It is eerily quiet. No sound of people, just the breeze and rustling leaves. We keep our eyes peeled, Thanaticuses are ambush predators. If it gets the drop on us, it could get messy. Down streets we walk, hyper aware of everything around us.

Then we hear a voice. I signal my team to follow me towards the source. Louder and louder, until we get eyes on. The Thanaticus is there, towering over a human. We watch as the human touches it, cooing and showering the beast with praise, ""Good girl. You like scritches almost as much as my dog!""

I knew humans had a reputation for questionable judgment around dangerous fauna. Describing some of the most dangerous creatures in the galaxy as being 'friend shaped' and 'in need of pets.' I thought it was a stereotype, an exaggeration. But now I am confronted by incontrovertible evidence that it is true.

The Thanaticus casually flicks the gaze  of three of its eyes towards us. It does not regard us as a threat, and returns its focus to the human. The human turns to us, then says, ""Oh, good. You're here to take Darcy back where she belongs.""

I am perplexed, ""Darcy?""

The human gestures towards the Thanaticus, ""I thought she needed a name. Don't hurt her, she's a sweetheart.""

I open and close my eyes. This doesn't seem real. How can this be real? I'll have to think about it later. I pull out the sedative syringe, and inject its contents into the Thanaticus. In twenty seconds its hulking form lies on the ground unconscious.

I call in the extraction vehicle, then turn to the human, ""You do understand that what you were doing is incredibly dangerous, right?""

""It all worked out fine, didn't it? And I got to make a new friend!""

I want to speak, I want to impress on this human just how insane it is to walk close enough to a wild Thanaticus to pet it. But I don't think anything I could say would make them see it that way. I sigh, and turn my full attention to preparing the creature for transport.

I ride along as we fly deeper into the jungle, far from any inhabited place. We lower Darcy to the ground, inject the antidote to the sedative, and flee as quickly as possible. I watch as we leave, and see her stand and begin to get her bearings before she is too far away to be more than a smear of color.",50
1lggn2x,myw345y,"As the Alien Extraction Crew slowly made it's way forward to cage and remove the creature, one of the small ""humans"" forced her way through the crowd and ran up to it.

The aliens were taken back in amazement.  For decades when encountering creatures such as these, they were always given many warnings about them.  But here, a young human was willingly going up to it...and was ""petting"" it.

""Nice kitty...no ones gonna hurt you kitty.  You want some milk?""  The young human continued to pet the ""kitty"", call it cute names, and was looking around for ""treats"".  

...the aliens cowered in fear...",21
1lggn2x,myybmvt,"By the lords of Iritha the thing was ugly. No carapace or tentacles, odd facial structure, exposed ears, etc. nothing like the beautiful fauna of Atbur. But nonetheless, It was my job to take care of these creatures and return them to the wild. I just really hoped to be transferred to a more normal planet soon. 

""Oh my goodness it's adorable!"" I heard one of my crew mutter. How could they think this weird thing was cute? I twisted one of my eyestalks to look behind me and saw the human member of our team walking forward, eyes wide, mouthparts forming an upward curve.

""Jensen, What are you doing?"" I asked, greatly concerned. She had holstered her weapon and was continuing to advance on the creature.

""I haven't seen one of these since I was a little girl on Earth!"" She was slowly advancing, and positioning her body to be smaller. She held out a hand to the creature, allowing it to move it's  face to her hand and smell her. I raised my weapon, prepared to fire if the thing made any sudden movements. Jensen pulled out a small portion of her rations from a pouch on her belt and handed it to the creature with an open palm. The animal took it, and she began to stroke it, muttering something, though all I could make out was ""poor thing"" and ""good boy"". 

I was surprised by how similar it looked to Jensen, or at least how many features matched. Exposed ears (thankfully Jensen's were usually covered by a helmet or the head strands she called 'hair'), four limbs, pink tasting organ in the mouth, bilateral symmetry... It got me wondering, was this one invasive from Earth?

Jensen had carefully wrapped a length of cord around the creature's neck, and was now leading it back toward the team, the creature followed willingly, pink tasting organ hanging out of it's mouth. ""I'm keeping it. He needs a visit to the vet but he seems to be healthy. I can't tell how old he is, but he has definitely been trained.""

Keeping it? Trained? What was she going on about? My eyestalks began thinning in disbelief and horror. She couldn't 'keep it', it was a dangerous animal that needed to be relocated. And it was trained? She acted like people just kept these things as pets! Oh Idr, please let my transfer go through soon!

Before I could voice my objections, the thing began yelling. Short low sounds that seemed to come from the throat. Jensen looked down at the creature, visibly concerned. ""Why are you barking?"" She shifted her gaze to the floral wall, which was now starting to shake. 

I suddenly remembered that we had a positive ID on the target, and Jensen's new pet was not it.",20
1lggn2x,myyswts,"""What are you doing?!"" I exclaim.  The human is scratching the predator under the chin, showing no fear at all.

""I'm petting the cute kitty of course!"" not even bothering to keep an eye on the cruel sadistic creature.

""That species is known for torturing beings to death!   It plays with it's victims!  Kill it!  Kill it!""  I flap my wings in distress.

The beast stares at me and starts making the clicking sounds that we have all learned to fear while waving it's tail.

The human lifts the evil predator by the neck and cuddles it.

""Well yes.  It's a \_cat\_."" 

The human then starts talking to the cat in a strange, high pitched accent. ""Now, now kitty, Bobu is friend not food.  How about I get you some nice Talien tuna instead?""",10
1lg34sq,myu6i7y,"I was pleased with my yearly income. The loot those dungeon adventurers carried to my doorstep was enough for me and my cove of treasure to be satisfied with. I did yearn to keep a princess, maybe more, but for what it was worth, I was content.



That was until I realized I was far from rich.



Noblemen, lawyers, and kings—they all had so much more. Colored gems that shone from all facets, scrolls of pristine parchment that could unwind to no end, leather grimoires, silver swords, and much, much more gold.



Compared to them, I might as well have been a poor man on a street.



Somehow, despite being so tiny, humans could earn so much more than I could only wish for. So I did what any other dragon would do. I turned into them.



It was hard learning their language, their way of life, the way they tied their boots, filled out their taxes, rent, housing. There were so many moving parts compared to just sleeping all day in a cave, waiting for adventurers to challenge you.



Suddenly, I had to be the one to challenge them.



Either way, time was on my side, and if I tried hard enough, I would be able to climb up the corporate ladder, soar through the rankings until I was making more than I ever did in that small cave.



That never happened. Instead, I found myself begging on the street. 



So I looked for other, more overlooked means.



Remember when I said I always wanted to kidnap a princess? Yeah, well, I just didn't think it would be like this.



And to my surprise, it worked. I had assembled the weakest of ragtag teams, yet it worked… for a moment.



By all means, it should have worked.



It would have worked. 



If only that princess weren't a bloody dragon in disguise.



Months of preparation were torn to shreds. She quite literally burned a hole through the hideout; hell, she burned the whole place down. I saw my men get scorched, crisped, and flung in the air and into her maw like fresh popcorn.



And then her husband came… on all fours…



I had to slap myself twice to realize this was not a dream.



""You were a dragon this entire time!?"" Her husband said in disbelief.



""You were a dragon this entire time!?"" His wife mirrored the same.



They both gritted their teeth and screamed slurs at each other, stomping what was left of my work and my men beneath their feet as the couple's quarrel escalated.



I gave up, letting myself go as I no longer felt the need to contain my body into a tiny human. I rose higher than both. My wings expanded, my neck grew, and I only asked one question as they both turned their wide gazes at me. ""Why did you both shapeshift?""



They both looked at each other and then at me, their answer in tandem. ""I wanted to earn more gold.""



I was a fool to think I was the only one.",127
1lg34sq,myxcajz,"It was rare that I had the opportunity to resume my standard form these days. I’d taken a human disguise the first a few centuries ago, which was a relatively short time for a dragon, but the disguise was much like a formal suit. Some occasions simply called for wearing it and it was pleasant enough for a short while, but once the event was over it was convenient to swap back to my more comfortable attire.

I used to only wear the disguise for a day at a time returning to my lair after each day. The form required relatively little upkeep, and was convenient for earning riches rather than stealing them. Provided of course that the workers didn’t know their boss was a dragon. People always seemed to have a problem with that for some reason that was beyond my understanding. It was fine for a human to work them ragged, but even with generous pay, humans were much more likely to revolt against a dragon. So I wore my “suit” increasingly often. 

Somewhere along the way I’d had to change up some details, as it became increasingly difficult to explain my longevity, but this most recent change had been the hardest. This time when I tried to build a new persona, I needed a birth certificate that I didn’t have,  a social security number I was never given, and all sorts of other proof that had never been necessary the last time I’d done this.  Thankfully as with most things a person could need, there was a market for it, and with enough money, I’d been able to buy assistance in the process.

That’s where I met Scarlett. At first our meetings had been entirely business, but I had offered a much higher than market price payment for her service in building me a new fake identity. I had salvaged the situation by requesting tutelage on how to play the role requesting more of her time than what it took to simply forge papers. First we had our extended lessons then to my surprise she’d invited me to coffee at a shop that had recently changed ownership nearby where I had supposedly grown up. Claimed that it was a good way to give credence to the disguise, by being seen as a regular somewhere where the former owner was no longer around to dispute it. On one claw I knew she was interested in me for my apparent wealth, but on the other she seemed genuinely kind and helpful, and actually seemed to care. 

I’d never tried the romance thing in any of my prior disguises, I’d been to a brothel or seven back when they were more prevalent but that had been transactional, and short. This was the opposite, logic dictated that we should have separated as soon as our deal was done, but now we seemed to gravitate towards one another. 

It took us only two years to marry after that, and we’ve been married nearly 10 years now. In that time I’d grown to enjoy the quaintness of human life. Both of us were wealthy and given the nature of our meeting we both knew better than to ask the source of the other’s wealth. She was perhaps the perfect woman for me, since she could be close but never pried at for information on who or rather what I was beneath the suit. Just as I never asked about her customers or location when she’d need to step away for a job, only when she’d expected to be back. This time I was supposed to have an entire month,  longest  job she’d taken since she’d helped me out 

I always used the time to return to my old lair, drop my disguise and just enjoy being a dragon again. Albeit with a few more amenities than most. 
I might have had a few renovations done to my cave in one of my earlier lives as the owner of a construction firm. My workers had been paid triple their wages through that job and told the customer demanded absolute secrecy, never knowing I was both the boss and the customer. They’d figured it was quite obviously a dragons lair and requested even more for hazard pay. Still it had been worth it. The convenience of having an internet connection, electricity, and running water meant I could enjoy the perks of being in my dragon form while enjoying a hot bath and a watching a cheesy movie. 

My peaceful evening was interrupted by the a ringing sound from my laptop where I had it plugged into the large flat screen TV. Scarlett’s name appeared on the screen. I rushed to retake my human form and reach my computer. I tapped the answer button.

The bounce that answered was not Scarlett’s
“Good evening Mr Marigold,” the voice said.

I froze. Scarlett NEVER allowed anyone to use her phone or laptop, there was too much potentially incriminating evidence from even the simplest job to risk someone accessing something they shouldn’t.

“Who am I speaking to?” I asked trying to contain the already building anger.

“That’s not important. What is important is the condition of your wife. She is currently in our custody, and in case you were worried she’s still breathing. If you would like her to remain that way, you will transfer 10 million dollars into our accounts using the instructions I am sending you now.”

A zipped file appeared in the chat window. 

“You will receive further instructions once we have confirmed the transfer. We should not need to deliver this threat, but allow me to make it very clear that if you go to the police not only will your wife die, but we will release everything she has on you. Goodbye Mr. Sterling.”

The switch of names was all I needed to know the man was not bluffing.

“Wait!” I called just before he ended the call, “What if I don’t have 10 million liquid right now, how long do I have?”

The man paused as if he hadn’t even considered this a possibility. I saw the call mute for a moment the man apparently had to discuss the issue.

“We are aware of the significant breadth of your means. You have until midnight to deliver 2.5 million dollars into the account. You will continue to provide us 2.5 million dollars for the next 4 days  the last of which you can consider a convenience fee. Goodbye Mr. Marigold. Do not keep us waiting.”

The call ended immediately thereafter.

“Shit, shit, shit.” I had the money, that wasn’t the problem, the problem was I had 0 confidence that the bastards who took her had any intention of letting live.",15
1lg34sq,myxcg8r,"I looked at the time 9 PM , I still had 3 hours to make the initial transfer.

I grabbed my phone from the human clothes I’d set aside and began to dial a number. 

A man in his early 30’s answered the phone with an annoyed tone.

“I don’t care what kind of warranty you’re selling if you don’t delete this number I’m going to… “

“Eric its me Mr. Sterling.” I said 

“Micheal? What the hell man, you sold the company and just left. I thought you were dead, the whole office assumed you’d just gone off to try and finish your bucket list or something.”

“Something like that, look, I am still alive but I need your help. I know you don’t work for me anymore but I need your other skills.”

“What skills”, he said clearly trying to avoid the topic.

“I know you got busted as for hacking into privileged systems , it’s the reason I hired you to the security team in the first place. I need you to track a wire for me.”

“Shit man, that’s not as easy as you think. What happened.”

“The less you know the better,” I said, “can you trace it or not.”

“No, wire transfers don’t include any useful location information.  I need something actually on their device. What about a phone number?” 

“Do you know what brand is it?”

“Does it matter?”

“Some phones can be tracked with an online service in case you lose it. It can be remotely activated ”

It didn’t take long after that for Eric to enable tracking on my wife’s phone and for me to disable it on mine. 

“According to their phone they’re somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.”

“Could it be a VPN?” I asked throwing a term I’d heard her use before to disguise her location.

“No this pulls gps coordinates, it could be spoofed but if I had to guess it wouldn’t be since the service settings were all default.”

“So she’s in the pacific, can you get me a map.” I asked.

“Her phones somewhere in the pacific, but it’s not moving so she’s not on a plane,” he said hesitantly, “Sir, are you planning to go after her.”

“She’s my wife, and she’s in trouble, I need to help her,” I said realizing my angered and bewildered voice was betraying a worse intention.

He seemed to hesitate for a long time, time I couldn’t waste.

“Eric please, I need to find her.” I said.

Finally he agreed sending me an image a few moments later marking my target.

“Thanks Eric, you’re a life saver.”

I followed the instructions on the computer sending the first quarter million before  returning to my draconic form and launching myself out of my cave.

As a dragon I was a several ton monster of muscle and power compacted into a sleek flying form. My Silver scales glinted with the ambient light of the surroundings significantly more so with the city scapes I’d passed over. 

It had been decades since I’d allowed myself to fly over a city, but today stealth was not a concern. Everyone knew dragons existed, most suspected that they walked among them, but none were stupid enough to flaunt that fact in urban areas.  I did not care, moving in a straight line across the country towards my target.",15
1lg34sq,myxclpg,"It was bright again by the time I found it, my tiny cell phone was nearly dead from keeping the map app open throughout the journey. Just a line further and…

I felt a presence. A scent that I could not mistake. Another dragon was nearby. My stomach turned as I realized there was more to this plot than I’d imagined. Another dragon had targeted her because of me. They knew what I was. They knew and they were going to kill her for it.

I forgot about the phone, following the scent alone to the lair. The lair in question was positioned in a large rocky outcropping a dark volcanic spire reaching up from the ocean floor with plenty of spikes about it threatening to rip apart any ship that dared to get too close.

I moved toward it painfully aware that my scent must be apparent to them too. It did not take long to spot the entrance.

I rushed into the volcanic lair landing on the rocky ground and forcing my way into the cave.

What I found terrified me, there was a chair fit for a human, with a cell phone I recognized smashed on the ground beside it, but no Scarlett.

Just as I was about to bellow my rage a strong force hit me from above as another form landed upon me. Claws tore in to my back attempting to tear the tendons of my wings but I threw the weight aside. Hearing a large thud as the other dragon slammed against the wall.

I looked over to it, seeing the vibrant red scales that coated its form as both of us attempted to recover. Silver drakes and red drakes had been enemies since the dawn of dragons. Any time they’d met it was guaranteed that only one of the two would leave the battlefield alive, if even that.

I growled my rage but she vocalized her.
“Get out of my home!” The she drake snarled pouncing at me and forcing me backward into a section with a lower roof where a sharp stalactite scraped against my back. 
I waited for her next charge ignoring the pain as I ducked slammed my head upward driving a horn into the soft spot where her arm and front leg met. I received a blast of fire as payment as she unleashed the flames upon me.

The flames caused a searing pain through my body forcing me to retreat, I allowed her to take a bite at my tree ail as I turned, bracing myself for pain as I waited for her to take the bait. As soon as she chomped I slammed downward forcing her jaw into the stony floor hard enough to crack it. That bought me the time I needed, diving out of the entrance into the water I extinguished the fire before it melted the skin beneath my scales. She followed soon after, giving me my first look at her properly. Her stomach bulged outward and sagged suggesting a recent large meal.

She spat another fiery breath but this time I was in position to return with a frosty spray on icy mist . The two breath weapons collide. The collision immediately turned to steam then fog as visibility quickly 

“YOU ATE MY SCARLETT!” I roared as I moved through the steam tackling her off the side of her rocky lair’s entrance.

The two of us toppled down the rocks scorching each of us some additional cuts and bruises before finally slamming into the water surface together.

“Wait I-“

I didn’t let her finish, she’d foolishly wasted her air and I was going to punish her for it. I pushed down taking us further under the water, using my more powerful tail to hold us beneath the waves.

I saw it there the fear in her eyes , the realization that she’d fucked up in a big way by eating the only person I’d ever loved in this world. A rapid shooting pain suddenly spread throughout as she first bit into my arm and then used the momentary distraction to free a leg and bludgeon me directly in the groin. I did not have the external weakness of human men in this form, but when faced against another dragon’s strength the area was still more sensitive than most. She immediately swam to the surface. Forcing me to follow suit.

“Stop,” she screamed as I burst through the watery surface.

“You killed my wife!” I exclaimed 

“I am your wife,” she yelled back.

The fog had begun to dissipate allowing me to see her vaguely.

I stopped, trying to contest the obvious trickery but I could feel the truth of it.

The fight left me quickly after that a mixture of love and hatred for the dragon in front of me. Apparently she felt the same way, looking over my silver scales with disgust.


I was the one to finally break the silence.
“Why?” I asked.

It was not why she’d hidden this from me, no we’d been to comfortable in each others secrets for that. 

“Why’d you leave?” I said finishing the question.

She looked down, placing a hand on her stomach. Where the visible bulge rested.

“I’m going to lay my eggs tomorrow,” She said, “I couldn’t maintain my disguise while giving them a chance to develop properly and I wanted to raise them better than I had been. I wasn’t going to just go to my husband of 10 years explain I was a dragon and ask him to throw away the rest of his life span raising half dragons.”

“So you thought threatening yourself for 10 million was the obvious choice,” I commented

“I knew you could afford it, and I needed the money. I was going to buy land I could use to raise our half dragon kids, until I could teach them to hide.”


I rested a scaly hand onto the lump where the eggs were forming and preparing to push free. 

“Except they aren’t half dragons, they’re half silver and half red.” Surmised.

“I’ll take care of them,” she said, “you can go back to your life, and you can forget we ever met. No other silver needs to know you fathered hybrids.”

“And leave you raise them on your own? Not a chance. Your scales may be terrible, but I’m not dumb enough to break off something like we had over done a dumb feud.” I said.

“And even though you’re as shiny as a disco ball you at least have a decent head on your shoulders.” She jested in return.


The end.",21
1lg34sq,myzpkza,"Thanks I had two other potential endings in mind but I spent like 4 hours writing this much and either of those would have been longer.

The first was one where the wife knew but the husband didn’t, in which case I would have needed to deviate from the kidnapping herself idea. 

The second was that her parents were involved, and the end result was a equally rough scuffle with the Inlaws before they decided to approve of her husband, though he was required to maintain his human form while in their lair since a human spouse was still more appealing than being reminded their son in law was a silver dragon.",5
1lfxw0b,mysbica,"""You know what? This the... Tenth time? Yep. The tenth time.""


""Tenth time? For what?""


Her cup on the table steamed as she stared it down.



""Every time I get a girlfriend. They go home for Christmas, meet somebody they haven't seen in years."" He outlined casually.



""Christian is just a friend."" She denied.



""Yeah, yeah, everybody's just your friend. Lemme guess. You got overwhelmed. Ate a few meals together. Hes great, right? Now you're coming back to break up with me."" He understood. ""Right?""


""Ummmm...""


She sat back. Dark hair falling out of her hat a little.



""Yep. Never fails."" He smiled. ""I have some massive deal to handle on the holidays. I can't go. Or I'll get fired or whatever.""


""It's okay. I know you really need the job."" She suggested in disappointment.



""I know."" He agreed. ""But for whatever reason. Whichever one of y'all I wind up dating-""


""Wait, who is *y'all*?! Are you cheating on me?"" Her voice raised.


Huh. They usually get mad. Or make fun of it. This was new.



""Can I finish?? Please??"" He asked her firmly.



""Are you?"" She snapped.



""No. I got dumped last year on Christmas, by my last girlfriend. And the year before that. And the year before that.""


""Maybe it's you.""


""Maybe, but ten years in a row?"" He asked. It was like being stuck in a shitty romcom.



She tensed up. ""I'm your *TENTH* girlfriend?!""



""We're adults! Do I ask you how many guys you've dated before you got to me?!""


A few people glanced over. They were making a scene. Of course they were. It always went like that.



""I think, I think we should see-""


""Other people?"" He finished for her.



""Yeah.""


""That's cool. Go right ahead. I'm done. You're moving back home. Aren't you?""


The look was one of both sadness. And concern. Because he wasn't chasing her. He'd learned that the hard way. He wasn't about to be some stalker or washed up ex.



""Yeah?""


""Never fails.""


They both sat there for a bit longer. Snowflakes bouncing off the fogged windows facing the storm outside.



""I still love you."" She admitted.



""I *loved you* too. You're leaving."" He assumed rightly. ""It's okay. I'm not mad. I get it.""


""You seem kind of mad.""


""Who wouldn't be? If I went home for Christmas and found another woman, then came back to break up with you. Wouldn't you be mad?""


""You're such a dick.""


""I guess that's why I keep dating assholes then."" He laughed.



He watched her storm off. Her plate still steaming. He shouldn't have said that. But, after the tenth time of throwing on some cheap Christmas sweater to go to a diner or something and get crushed?


Or knocked out? Or being embarrassed?



Not having it. Not this time.


It dawned on him, that somebody was watching him. Their waitress wandered over carefully as he went back to working on his eggs. They were getting cold now.


""Hey."" She started in.


""Hi.""


""Is the food okay?""


""Oh yeah."" He glanced up. She was his type. Again.


""I hope I didn't interrupt anything."" She said, brushing some blonde hair out of her eyes.



""You didn't. It's cool.""


""Is there anything else I can get for you?""


The idea of an eleventh go around just made his stomach ball up. He reached for his wallet.



""No. I'm good."" He denied. ""Here, can I get my check?""


""...Sure thing."" She deflated slightly.


He slid two twenties up to her hands. ""It's not you. It's me."" He fanned a third one for 60 dollars, and placed it under her hand gently.



He stood up and palmed his plate as he walked towards the door. ""Keep the change, okay?""


She stood there for a moment. ""Wait! You can't take the plate with you!!""


""That's why I gave you a big tip! Bye!!""


To hell with the holidays. He plotted his first New Year's Eve alone. The vacation he always wanted. Somewhere warm this time. Miami sounded like a great choice.


For some reason, eating an omelette in the snow off the plate he just stole from a diner never felt better.",563
1lfxw0b,myucwdx,"“He isn’t supposed to remember any other Christmas”

The voice was faint; right on the edge of hearing.

Annabelle was staring at him, silent. She seemed uneasy, as if I wasn’t reacting how she expected.

She repeated her last line; “It’s not you, it’s me. I don’t think we are comparable.”

The voice sounded irate, “She’s messing it up. It’s ‘compatible’, not ‘comparable’. How did this moron pass the basic literacy test? Call Steve. Tell him his fee is at risk.”

It still sounded a long way away, like a radio in a distant room, but clear as a bell.

Annabelle bit her thumb nervously, “Aren’t you going to tell me how you just got the project backers interested?”

“She’s breaking the script entirely now! That doesn’t happen for three minutes. Get production on the phone. Season reset is going wrong.”

Another voice, a bit more calm, came smoothly into my straining ears, “He hasn’t said anything since the outburst.”

“He knows it’s ten. How could he know that? We wipe his memory.”

“Dave, is that light supposed to be on?”

“Oh cra..”

Silence. 

Just Annabelle’s big, sad eyes looking at me. Begging me to say something. The subtle background noises in the snowy park coming back with a little rush of something undefinable, like a memory of a dream.

“Why does it keep happening, Belle? I know you know.”

Her face crumples into a mix of tearful agony, and she wails. Actual wails; not the ladylike tears that have dripped down her cheeks in recent months.

“It’s all going wrong! You’re not supposed to remember anyone else! I’m your childhood sweetheart! Me! Me! Me!”

She actually stamped her foot. I thought they only did that in those ridiculous novels they are printing these days.

“I paid good money for this, and you’re ruining it!”

Something was happening on the outskirts of the park. A blue haze, a grid of some kind, like a child’s drawing in the air. It was uncanny and eldritch. It brought a dark fear into my soul.

She had pulled a strange rectangular device from her purse, and was holding it in front of her like some magic talisman. 

I recoiled as it glowed, and the same voice I had heard earlier, but fainter and tinnier, squeaked from it in a harsh staccato.

I couldn’t make out the words, but my beautiful Bella, changed so much in character, changed her face right in front of me.

Quite literally.

The long, pale face grew rounder and darker, the nose wider and longer, and lines appeared where no lines belonged on an adult human female. The lifeless grey hue of her face repulsed me, and I snatched up my walking stick from where it had fallen and ran for my life.

It was twenty minutes before I stopped, my breath and thoughts uneven, my heart still racing. This was an otherworldly thing. A terrifying mystery most intriguing. But no amount of running would give me answers.

My previous thoughts of wealth and power among men seemed childish and worthless now, for this could be something much more lucrative; much more empowering.

I will get to the bottom of this, or my name’s not Ebeneezer Scrooge.",105
1lfxw0b,myus37z,"The snow gently fell from the starry night sky, we both sat together on the old park
bench, where we’ve sat many times before. I looked over at her, bundled up in her winter coat,
scarf, gloves and beanie. I bought her the outfit not two months before while we were planning
this trip. She wanted to visit her family, her sister recently had a baby and she wanted to see her
niece. However, she loved cold weather about as much as a cold-blooded animal. So I decided to
take her out on a shopping trip, told her it was an early Christmas present. The way she lit up, the
joy on her face, the excitement of being able to pick whatever she wanted, it brought me enough
happiness that the cost didn’t matter. Her smile was something I’d pay any cost to see.

I looked down at my watch, 8:57pm, December 24th. In about three minutes I’d hear
words that would shatter my life. She reached up her gloved hand to the sky and let the flakes
collect in her hand. She mouthed words I’d later come to learn were, “leave him, leave him not,
leave him, leave him not.” She had been conflicted since the trip had started, my work had been
very busy, and I’d been taking calls the entire trip. There was a big project in the works,
something that’d set us up for life, technology that would change the world. We could live the
fairy tale life we dreamed of ever since high school. Trips across the world, see any and every
sight we wanted, take our time and experience a life free from worry. But every time I took those
calls, the look on her face was painful. It began as if she was coming to a realization, then it
shifted to a quiet denial.

Right as my watched hand struck 9:00pm, the snow stopped falling. She turned to me,
grabbed my hand, and looked me in the eyes, “I think we should break up.”
Pain. A stabbing pain pierced my heart, no matter how many times I’ve experienced it, it
found a new way to break my soul. Our relationship, the life we planned, built upon years of trust, struggle, determination, was broken by six words. We sat in silence for a long time, I did
my best to choke the tears but they still fell down my cheek.

“Why,” I asked, I tried to keep my voice even but it was impossible, “why do you want
us to end?”

“We’re going down different paths,” she said, letting go of my hand and looking to the
sky “you’re doing amazing things, your project will help change the world. You need someone
by your side that can support you, be there for you. Someone who can compliment you, help you
become the person I know you can be. But I don’t think I can be that person.”

 “I’m just a simple girl, someone who wants to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy a nice
quiet life. I’d like to make coffee in the morning and watch the sun crest over the mountains in
my little cottage, and look forward to my simple, boring day.”

“I can drop the project,” I said, my fists tightened. “You are the most important thing in
my life. If you want a simple morning with a coffee, then that is what I’ll give you. You are my
reason and hope, the person I picture when I see a better tomorrow. Your kindness is what gives
me breath, what drives me to become a better person. I don’t care what I have to do, so long as I
can keep you in my life, because without you I am nothing.”

She leaned her head into my shoulder and let out a long sigh, “I cannot tell you how much I wish I could be selfish right now. I want nothing more than to take you away to that mountain cottage and live that life. But I can’t do that, your talents are meant to be shared with the world. You are destined for a life in the spotlight. A life of fame, where you become the person who changed the world with his wondrous inventions. I want to keep you to myself, to keep you hidden away so that I am the only one who knows how special you are. But the world needs you more.”

She sat up, brushed the snow off of her coat, leaned in, and gave me a final kiss. She lingered for a moment, her eyes filled with sadness for what could’ve been. The snow began to pick up again and so she walked away. Fading into the snow, leaving me by myself on the park bench. I
looked down at my watch, 9:05pm. I gripped it with my fingers, all I’d need to do is twist. Just
that simple motion and I could see her again. A simple twist and I could turn back the clock, try a
new angle. Find some other words I could say, something I could give her, anything to keep us
together. I’d tried yelling, begging, pleading, making us not go on this trip. I’ve spent a decade of time trying everything I could to keep this relationship alive. But no matter what I tried, nothing worked. I’d even offered up my project, the thing I had been building towards my whole life, but even that wasn’t enough.

It felt as if I was pulling my own heart out of my chest, but I moved my hand away from
the watch. I slouched back against the park bench and looked towards the sky. Maybe she was
right, we were going down different paths and I just needed to accept it. Our lives had been
forever changed by each other for better and for worse. But it was time for a new chapter to
begin. I slowly stood up from that park bench and left, leaving behind what we had been to begin
a new life.",43
1lfxw0b,myufh8u,"""Jason, you don't understand."" Holly said, as she twisted a Santa hat in her hands nervously. ""I just...""

""You cheated on me, is what you did."" Jason said sternly. 

""Jason, I-"" 

""No. I'm sick of this shit. I stayed home so I could make us potential millions. You knew what my job was before we got engaged, and yet you still threw a tantrum over it and ran abandoned me on Christmas."" 

""Well, I-"" Jason held up his finger, cutting Holly off again.

""And while I'm here, trying to give us both a better life, you decided to hook up with some dude you used to know who peaked in highschool. The same guy who's entire livelihood revolves around Christmas trees."" Holly started to cry not knowing what to say. 

""Okay. I'm coming home. We can work this out."" Jason grabbed his brow as a dull pain started to develop.

""Holly. You aren't even the first person to do this to me. I've lost about five boyfriends, and six girlfriends to this shit. Keep your Christmas tree farmer if you want. I'm done...and you know what, I think I might just convert to Judaism, because I might just be done with Christmas altogether."" Jason slammed the phone, ending the call.",101
1lfxw0b,myupqnt,"Not exactly to the ""confrontation"" part of the prompt, but I think the important part is that the prompt inspires you to put words on the page, yeah?



  
As I step out of the diner, my despondent look slowly gives way to a warm smile.  My shoulders rise.  I lift my head, letting out a puff of steam into the cold winter’s air.  Man, I love winter…

“Y’know baby-face, some people might call this intruding on another’s guy’s turf.”

I whirl at the voice to see an old man in plaid, his flabby arms crossed over his chest, and despite the words, a warm smile gracing his rosy cheeks. 

I raise my hands, the wind disturbing a perfect curl of hair over my forehead.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about, old man.  You have your ways of getting ready for your time of year, I have mine.”

“Still, do you have to do it so close to my time?  You don’t see me spreading tinsel over people’s Valentines.”

“Well, how else am I going to ensure these relationships are at their peak just in time for my day?” 

“Hmph,” he chuckles, a little ‘ho-ho’ that rumbles up from his jiggling belly.   “There has to be a more efficient way of doing this, though, I have a whole workshop devoted to me, you’re literally doing this for one overworked woman at a time.”

“Oh, there is, but the bow and arrow is so impersonal,” I reply, smiling with a little wink as my wings unfurl from under my jacket.  “And besides, it’s easier to push these ladies into the arms of the right person when you’re personally involved.  Humans can be awfully stubborn like that, even with the right arrow.”",29
1lfxw0b,myw9uzj,"She stood across from me, her gaze much the same as all the rest; never on the eyes, downcast to the side. It was a gaze of reservation, distant thoughts, and muddied nostalgia. The warm palid colors of the house felt much like a distant dream, a memory built upon all the pictures surrounding us.

The first one had hurt the worst. We'd fallen in love during college, and life had been great. Somehow, I had landed the job I always dreamed of, and showered her with every luxury I could. She'd gotten a job of her own, every bit as ambitious as I was, and we took as much time off as we could, venturing the world together as we had always talked of.

Then, Christmas. I had gotten a call about a crucial deal that needed to be closed, and couldn't afford to take her time off. She wanted to spend that year with  her family, and we agreed to make up for lost time after the holiday. When she was gone, I had bought the ring, expectant to propose. Instead, I met Jared. She never even said goodbye.

Once was a heartbreaking coincidence. The sort of thing that burrows into your soul, sure; but still just a coincidence.

After a few years, I'd moved on,  and decided to try again. I gave the ring to my brother, he got engaged with a woman he'd loved since middle school. That's when I met her. Her name was Kim, and our love was fast; my mother described it as ""dangerous for the purse"". But I didn't care, I gave everything I could, showed as much love as I was able.

And then Christmas came. A horrid sense of deja vu pervaded, as my boss described a contract that my skills were needed for. She even said that Christmas wasn't that important to her, and she'd love to stay with me. Then her parents called, and my worry, admittedly irrational for the time, deepened.

It hardly took a week. I cried the most ugly tears I had in what felt like a decade, and got drunk enough on the day of the deal that I blacked out over the call. That, and many other circumstances thereafter, cost me my job.

The year after, after somehow squeezing my way into a new, arguably better position, I went home for Christmas. It's a sleepy sort of town in the middle of Nebraska, where the snow gets rather heavy, and the lumberjacks never seem to rest. I met a girl there, and for just a moment, my heart thawed. God, I wish it hadn't.

She had blonde hair, cut short, and piercing blue eyes. With a quick wit and ambition that excelled far beyond my own, it wasn't particularly surprising that I would fall in love.

Our year spent together made me forget why I'd ever been hesitant to love. We traveled as much as we were able, and for brief moments I could imagine a day whereupon I'd slip a ring on her finger.

It was a day in October, as we sat cuddled on the couch, watching some movie or another, that she dropped a bombshell, ""So, Christmas is coming up,"" She said in a raspy whisper.

My heart stilled at the mention.of the holiday, but I didn't let it show as I said, ""Yeah?""

""My family is... pretty traditional. They make a big show of it and everything. Kinda, surprising, I know, but...""

I could hear my blood start to pump through my ears as I hesitantly replied, ""You'll be going home for the holidays?""

""Yeah,"" She said with a grin, ""You wanna come with?""

At the Exact moment that she posed the question, my phone started ringing. My hands shook slightly as I answered it. Sure enough, it was my boss. According to her, a client with really important backing would need help around the Christmas Holidays, and it was urgent enough that they'd booked three months in advance.

I wasn't surprised when it turned out her hometown was not my own. I also wasn't surprised to learn that she'd met an old flame named James. At that moment, I vowed to never again fall in love.

My vow lasted three years, and in those years, I grew to quite prominent success. During an annual Christmas Party, I met a woman named Alice. She was a fierce redhead with a roaring flame beneath her eyes. I tried, as best as one might, but before I knew what was happening, I found her in one if my old sweatshirts.

""You really used to wear this?""

""Can a guy not like sports?"" I asked rhetorically.

She rolled her eyes, ""Well sure, but this would look like a cosplay on you, ""

I chuckled, and despite everything, knew I loved her.",19
1lfxw0b,myrx6a2,"""Why?"" I ask her, as she fidgets uncomfortably.  
She lost her glow, she is wearing a Christmas sweater even though she always hated the holiday, and is looking back to her family whom she was estranged from for years!  
""I met someone better."" she mutters.  
I sigh.  
""Victoria...we were talking about engagement, about a family, about a future together.  
Why? How?"" I ask.  
She frowns.

  
""You are never there for me!  
Even now, that I had to go back to my hometown because my grandpa died, you didn't come!  
So yeah, I rekindled an old flame! He is there for me!  
Who are you to question me!"" she roars.  
I stare, stupefied at her.  
""Your boyfriend of a year?  
Someone who loves you?  
Someone who helped your sister pay her mortgage, so she doesn't lose the house?  
Someone who helped you fulfill your dream, and booked that backpacking trip through Europe? "" I ask.  
She laughs.  
She goddamn laughs!

  
""Love me? Love me?   
You always work! What little those few hours in the evening, and a date or two in the weekend matter?!  
And those things you gave me?  
I could have bought them myself!  
Relationships shouldn't be transactional!"" she said.  
I fidget with the ring in my pocket.  
""I worked for us, and never expected a thing in return...what transactional?  
I am discussing the down payment for that dream house we saw together..."" I mutter.  
She falls quiet.  
""Look...Matt,  you are a good guy, but you can't give me what I need."" she says.  
I almost snap, but keep it together.

  
""So, a man whom you haven't seen for 15 years, and spent like 9 days with...can?  
You do realize that it's been just 9 days since you returned, and on day 7 you called me to break up, right?"" I ask her.  
""I don't love you anymore...maybe haven't loved you for a while now..."" she mutters.  
Before I could say something, the ""other one"" comes, and hugs her.  
""I think that is enough."" he says.  
I stare at the two, and at her family looking at us.  
Her sister is looking at me apologetically.  
""Fine."" I say, turning around, and leaving.  
I hear her mutter something, but I don't know what, nor do I care.  
I am not going to kill myself over this...it happened, it happened.  
No matter how dumb it is, this just proves we weren't meant to be together, but damn.  
It hurts so much.  
I loved her, still do, and in mere days...no! Don't go down that rabbit hole....",94
1lfxw0b,myx0aml,"Part 1

It started 10 years ago, when I was just 23, with Dani. I had a project at work that could lead to a promotion come the new year, one that could allow me to leave my parent's place and get a nice apartment with Dani. She went home to Tennessee for Christmas, and stayed there. A week later, she updated her profile photo to one of her with a smiling farmhand. I got the promotion, and settled on a cozy studio. 

The next year things were really going well with Emily, until I had to turn down her invite to go to New Hampshire with her for Christmas- I had a deadline of the 24th, and promised to come after, but got a text saying she reconnected with a high-school flame, and not to come. I used my holiday bonus to go skiing with my little sister. 

The year after that, Becca went home for Hanukkah while I was snowed in at an airport on the way back from a work trip that created hundreds of jobs- when I did get back, it was to find my girlfriend decided to give up her job in the city and work at the family restaurant instead. I adopted a cat, and pondered being single. 

Then Marisol, a co-worker who I had a fling with, decided to leave our very lucrative job to become a snow sculptor. In Florida. She fell in love with an ice deliveryman.  The bonus we were going to use to travel to Italy instead paid off the last of my student loans and contribute to a scholarship so others could avoid them. 

I would have loved to gone to Michigan with Thea for the holidays, but my buddy Joe was having some scary health problems. He didn't like asking for help, so I secretly arranged a holiday fundraiser which unfortunately meant I couldn't go to the little town on Lake Michigan. Thankfully, the fundraiser was a success, and Joe survived. My relationship did not. 

The next year, as my side hustle was turning into a legit business that I could actually live off of, my girlfriend Nina asked me to come to Oklahoma with her. 2 weeks after Christmas, because that's when her family could get together. It was the day I was presenting to investors. It had been on my calendar for months. Nina straight up ghosted me, but the investment was secured, and I was able to commit to my dream career. 

The next year I was hosting my own family at my recently purchased house, something I'd put a lot of care into. Of course I invited Vanessa too, but she wanted to go back to the UK, where she was swept off her feet by a literal lord. My house is nice, but it's not Downton Abbey. I had a great time delivering Christmas cookies to my new neighbors though. 

My business incredibly successful the next year, and I was hosting a company holiday event while Jess went back to help at her parent's beach resort, saved a sea turtle, and decided a life of solitude was better than our cozy pizza and a movie nights. The holiday party allowed me to donate enough toys that every kid at the local Boys and Girls club got a gift. 

Last year I thought I'd finally make it through the holiday season, relationship intact. Hailey had grown up just 10 minutes away, and we were going to do Christmas Eve with my family, Christmas day with hers. That is, until my old high-school basketball team beat her old high-school during the holiday classic on the 23rd. She'd gone to the game while I wrapped up a project so an employee of mine, a single mom, could go to her son's Christmas pagent. I got a text from Hailey with the final score saying ""rethinking tomorrow"" and then nothing. I think she blocked my number. Then my sister reported seeing her on the arm of the basketball coach. So, that happened. 

Now I'm with Bree. Or was. She left for Ohio a few days early and now, just as I was driving to the airport on Christmas Eve day to join her I got a text saying ""Going to open a bakery in Ohio! Can you go send me that apron I left at your place?"" 

I was pondering that text the entire flight to Cincinnati. And while waiting in the car rental line. And in the two hour drive to Bree's hometown. I had her address in my GPS, and as I pulled up to the single family home in a quiet neighborhood my phone chimed that I had arrived. 

There were lights on, and the faint sound of carols coming from the house. I walked up the snowy steps and rang the bell.",13
1lfxw0b,mywn9nk,"The air in the diner is tense. Gwen had returned from a visit with the family, and we were catching up. Two plates, each bearing cheese sandwiches sit unattended between us, growing cold.

“Things have been, well, awkward between us recently.”

I sat there, staring at her. She was everything I had ever hoped for, everything I had ever wanted in a woman. 

“You’ve just been so distant lately, always working, always busy.”

I did this for you, why don’t you see that? This project they’ve stuck me with - it will be revolutionary. We’ll be set for life when all this is over. Why don’t you understand that?

“I know it’s been years since I last saw Greg, but when we met, it was like no time had passed at all.”

These last few months have been the best of my entire life. I had been thinking about proposing soon, after the holidays were over and things had a chance to calm down. And now? It’s all falling apart. 

“Words can’t do it justice; it was like magic.”

I tried to be the best boyfriend I can, and she still decided to dump me, on Christmas Eve no less! How could this happen again? …Wait, what?

“I haven’t felt like that in so long. And sure, we would have a way more modest life, but I’m okay with that.”

Something’s wrong, something is very wrong. This - this happened before. This conversation has happened before. The exact words changed, the person saying them changed, but at its core, it’s the same conversation, over and over again. 

“Adam, please understand. I love you-”

“But you’re not IN love with me,” I finished for her. That’s what they say, every time. I don’t understand what’s going on; it’s like there’s a bank of fog surrounding my brain, but the more worked up I get, the clearer things become.",9
1lfxw0b,myteh0p,"""I think I'd be happier with someone else.""

I wasn't going to let it go so easily. ""Why? Every single girlfriend I've ever had dumps me on Christmas Eve. Did you meet someone else?""

I heard the sound of something slamming down onto the counter. ""No, you idiot, it's BECAUSE you didn't come over for Christmas! Think about it - every girlfriend you ever had dumped you on Christmas Eve! Because you were busy at work and they wanted you there with them! Like I did!""  I heard her sobbing over the phone. ""Screw the stupid job, you moron, all I wanted was for you to meet my family so we could be together for the holidays. But no, your stupid project was more important than me. Well, fine, I can take a hint. I hope you two are very happy together."" She hung up.

I put down the phone and stared at my robot. ""Well, looks like it's just you and me again, Frankie."" I adjust the antenna on his head slightly.",38
1lfxw0b,mywsfra,"“Have you ever considered that you might be the problem?”

I stared at her in disbelief. I was so close to making the biggest deal of my life. I was set to make millions of dollars. Millions. I was considered handsome (and I KNEW for a fact that I was. Not trying to brag or anything, but I was considered for modelling. Eat your heart out Adonis. Or something like that, I don’t know.) What could be wrong with me?

“Every big event, every single holiday, every little thing that matters is just forgotten and ignored, like it’s not even worth remembering.” She continued and she stood a little taller, like she had just thrown a weight off her shoulders. “New Years Eve, Easter, Valentines Day, my birthday, Thanksgiving, Graduation, my f@£#ing mother’s funeral, it doesn’t matter, you’re never there!”

I stood there, dumbstruck. She was ending our relationship over this? Over ignoring stupid, pointless celebrations that nobody cared about? And it wasn’t like me being at the funeral made any difference. Not with all the money I had coming in. 

Besides, her mother was already dying. It wasn’t like it was unexpected. 

“But the money-“

“F@#k the money!” she shouted, tears running down her cheeks. “F#@k the money! It’s always about the f@#%ing money! Do you know how I spent my birthday?”

I didn’t really know, but it’s not like it mattered. I was in the middle of something that was going to make me millions. 

“I spent it at home waiting for you to come and take me out to that special day for me. You know, the one that you PROMISED! The one that you said would be perfect. The one that I missed celebrating with my friends because you PROMISED to do something special.”

I don’t know what her problem was. Friends are overrated and I don’t like her friends anyway. It was why I offered in the first place. And I did text her to cancel. At half past two in the morning after. It’s not like I didn’t say anything. 

“Babe, I don’t think you understand. I am on the verge of making millions. Set us up for life. Don’t you understand? I do this for us.”

“You already have more money than some countries. You have been set for life for years,” she snapped back. “Years. But it’s never enough. It will never be enough. It always has been just another million dollars and you’re done. But you’re not. You’re not. You never are. You always have to have more, like you could lose it all tomorrow if you stop hustling for a moment.” 

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. Lose it all? I had seen my father lose it all. I had seen how he had just blown through his money like it was nothing. I had seen how my mother had thrown parties so extravagant that they became the stuff of legend, even as our finances were collapsing. 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” I snapped back. “You know full well that it’s not enough. Not yet. But once I finish this project-“

“You’ll move on to something new to make more money,” she said with a resigned sigh. She looked at me, a strand curly red hair falling over her eye. You need help. Professional help. Help I can’t give you.” 

“Well I’m sorry that I don’t take you on extravagant dates to rival kings,” I said and she rolled her eyes.

“I don’t need fancy dates,” she said, shaking her head in exasperation. “I don’t want you to pay for fancy holidays. I don’t even want you to pay off my student loans. I just want you to make the effort. To actually be there when I need you. To keep your promises.”

I don’t know why she’s so upset about that last part. I’ve had good reasons for breaking those promises. She should understand that I had to make that money. Time was money that I couldn’t afford to lose. I thought she knew that. She was an engineer, the first person in her family to go to college, a woman who wanted to change the world. I thought a driven woman like her would understand. 

“But you don’t make the effort. You only bother if you’re not about to make more money. That’s not how relationships work. That’s not how good relationships work.” She paused and took a deep breath. “I’ve been telling myself for months that it’s okay. That the good times outweigh the bad. That you’re doing it for us, for our future, for our future children. That you love me and that one day you will show me how much I matter to you. I’ve been waiting and making excuses and I’m just tired of all the bullsh#%.”

“I do love you!” I protest and I point to the intricate gold and silver necklace on her neck. “I brought you that necklace, didn’t I?” 

For a moment, it looked like she was reconsidering her decision. Then she unclasped the necklace and handed it to me. She held my hand and looked me in the eye, her expression solemn. 

“You don’t understand. I’m not sure that you’ll ever understand. It’s not about the material things.” She shook her head sadly. “You can’t buy love. You can’t buy happiness. I saw my parents treating one another with love and respect and kindness. My best friend in high school is getting married to the love of his life and he’s genuinely happy.”

“He?” I asked and my ex frowned slightly. 

“Yes, Nick. He was my best friend in high school. He-“

“I get it,” I said cutting her off. “You’ve realised that you’re in love with him and now you’re off to win his heart.”

“For your information, Nick is gay,” she said with some annoyance. “And I’ve known that since we were both thirteen and he came out to me.” I opened my mouth to say something, only for her to cut me off with a wave. 

“I saw how him and his boyfriend treat one another. I’ve seen how people treat people that they love. I’ve seen what a healthy relationship looks like and…” She shrugged. “This isn’t it.”

“That’s ridiculous!” I protested. “There are women who would love to be in your shoes.” 

I wanted her to be hurt, but instead she just looked sadly at me and shook her head. 

“You should have picked one of those ones instead,” she said, before turning and walking away. 

For a few seconds I stood there, her words playing through my head. She was talking nonsense of course, but still…

I turned and headed to the nearest bar. Perfect place to pick up a new girlfriend after all. And one without the same hang ups about time as my ex girlfriend!",5

Very good. If the girlfriend reacts like that, juvenile and overly emotional, to the response to the breakup *she's* initiating, then she shouldn't be dating yet anyway.",6

That year with Alice was far more cozy than I expected. We spent many late nights ordering pizza or take out Chinese, watching trashy romcons and jibing at the characters on screen. As the year progressed, however, I felt myself grow more and more cold. By the end of September I had the shakes, and couldn't possibly tell her what was wrong. And so I waited, and sure enough, the call came.

I stood at the counter in the dining room, the day after Christmas, staring at my phone. My body was shaking as I waited patiently for it to happen. Just as I'd dared to relax, a knock came at the door, causing me to bodily jump.

Each step felt like the end, as I pulled open the door. Alice stood there, before she walked in. She was stiff, and wouldn't deign to look me in the eye. I felt myself shatter as she walked around the counter.

""What is his name?"" I demanded, a hard Rage gurgling to the surface.

""W-what?""

""What. Is. His. Name?"" My tone never rose beyond an even and flat monotone, but from the widening in her eyes, I knew she could see my anger.

I took a moment to take deep breaths and try to better school my expression, as she replied, ""T-Tom,""

Nodding, I said, ""And let me guess. He's someone from your hometown. Someone you used to love back in,  back in fucking highschool? And he just happened to be in town at the same Goddamn time, and... and you decided to change all of your principles, quit your fucking job, and run away with him to become a housewife under, what, the Spirit of Christmas?!""

She slammed up from her chair, the harsh scrape biting against the floor as she replied, ""Something you'd clearly NEVER understand, because your job is Too Impodtant to celebrate one of... one of the most...""

""One of the most WHAT, Alice? The most important holidays? Do you even fucking remember telling me, back in goddamn SEPTEMBER, that you didn't care that much about Christmas?? Fucking hell, I cared more than you. I went... I went out of my way to buy you gifts, shit I knew you'd like. And you got me a Card. What did Mister Motherfucking Hometown get you?!?""

""He... he got me... he got me Roses,"" She replied, swaying on her feet.

""Holy shit, Alice?"" I rushed around the counter, grabbing her right as she fell, ""Alice, what's going ""

She Blinked, and for the briefest of moments, a single piece of snow rose up from her eye. I stared as that strand branched, and...

The world was dark, and a fierce chill entered my veins. The house was gone, and naught but a void stretched into the depths of infinity. In the middle of it all stood a man, burgeoned in red cloth.

""You are... irredeemable,"" The man whispered.

Hesitantly, I stood up, shaking under the mind-numbing pressure of the cold, ""W-what... what is this?""

""You are... Unlovable,""

""WHAT IS THIS?"" I shouted, desperate, as the man turned to me, white beard billowing below him. 

""You are... Unwanted,""

Stepping forward, surprised at the resistance that begged to slide my feet against the invisible ground, ""Are you... are you...""

The man grinned, and it was a thing of yellowed, cavity strewn teeth, ""I am Saint Nicholas, the Patron of Gifts, God of Love... and YOU, you are the Ice Lord, to be the Death of all that is Good. You,  are Jack Frost,""

I shivered as the cold began to burrow deeper into my veins, and shouted, ""I found love! Multiple times, but you... you took it from me!?""

""Took? I suppose I did. Your form of love is UNACCEPTABLE,""

""What... what does that... what does that MEAN? What did I do wrong?""

""Do you think it coincidence that every person you have 'loved' has left to become a housewife?""

""You took away their freedom to make them a fucking..."" I struggled, then, raging against the invisible storm begging to take over my body, ""No. I won't... accept... it,""

For a God, he was weak.",20
1lfxw0b,myx0g2j,"Part 2

A woman answered, a few years older than Bree, but similar enough in looks she had to be her sister, Allie.

""Hi is Bree -""

""Oh thank heavens, Luke, right? I am so glad you're here. Bree has gone absolutely mental, and we were humoring her, because it's the holiday, but I actually think she's lost it, please, come in.""

""Uh - okay -"" I said, confused.

""She seemed perfectly normal when she got here last week, excited to introduce us to you, but over these past few days she's been in a baking frenzy, despite almost never baking, and, shit, the guy who removes the snow for Nana is here. His name is Jay, and he seems charming, but I remember him from school and he is a deadbeat with 3 kids he never sees. The only reason he clears Nana's snow is because he can show off his plow.""

""And Bree is in love with him,"" I guessed.

""Holy crap, did she tell you that?""

""Educated guess.""

Allie led me into the living room where Bree's parents, grandmother, brother in law, and nieces sat around a tree. Bree was cuddled very close to a man who looked like he belonged on a magazine cover.

""Bree, look who made it!""

Bree tilted her head. ""Who are you?""

""What?!"" I asked. ""Bree, it's me, Luke. We've been dating 8 months now.""

""You've only talked my ear off about him and sent a bazillion pictures of the two of you being adorable,"" Allie added.

""Luke?"" Bree said, then her eyes widened. ""Luke! Oh, uh, hey! Did you bring my apron?""

""No, I didn't bring your apron. I was already on my way to the airport. After using the holiday drive profits to host brunch for the homeless. As was the plan?""

""Oh,"" she looked saddened. ""Well, um, I'm sorry, but I've had a life-changing experience and -""

""Please,"" I said. ""Please explain what happened between when you left the city and now.""

""Okay, well I did some work in the airport, got on the plane, rented a car, stopped at a rest area where an odd little man gave me the most amazing hot cocoa, came here, worked late from my room, went to Nana's, met Jay...""

""Hold up,"" Allie interrupted. ""Did you say you accepted a drink from a stranger at a sketchy roadside rest?""

""A cocoa,"" Bree said. ""He - he had this ""Christmas magic"" aura to him, you know?""

Allie and I exchanged glances, and then I noticed Jay looking anywhere but the conversation.

""Jay, do you know what's going on?""

He sighed. ""I might have a side gig as an elf at one of those Santa photo places, and one of my coworkers said for 50 bucks he could get me a girlfriend by Christmas day? Weird little guy, but he said he had years of experience. Even showed me a few photos of his work. There's one dude who fell in love with a snow sculptor in Florida. They have two kids now!""

""They were drugged,"" I said horrified. ""Drugged by some weird Christmas elf.""

""They?"" Allie asked. 

""This has happened to me before,"" I explained.

""Look, I'm really sorry,"" Bree said, ""but I'm very happy here, and I'm about to sign a lease on the bakery, so....""

""Yeah, I get it."" I sighed. ""I don't suppose there's a hotel in this small town? I'll leave you too whatever this is, and -""

""Nope!"" Allie interrupted. ""Sorry, but I've heard enough about you to know that I much prefer my kids have an uncle Luke than an uncle Jay."" She faced the other man ""Get in touch with your elf coworker. Have him undo this. ""

Jay sighed and pulled out his phone, sending a text. After what felt like forever his phone pinged.

""He says to put $100 on the mantle. And, uh, he's sorry about all the other times.

Allie humphed. ""I'm not putting the kids Christmas money -""

""I've got it,"" I assured her, pulling out one of the crisp $100s I'd been planning to use to take her family to dinner. I placed it on the mantle and a moment later it vanished, replaced with a mug of eggnog.

Carefully, I passed the mug to Bree.

""I don't know if I should-""

""Goodness you fool, drink it!"" Nana snapped from the corner. ""He came all this way for you, and he's loaded!""

Bree drank. Then she gasped, and pushed away from Jay.

""What just - how - Luke! You made it!""

""You can leave now,"" Allie said to Jay and he headed to the door. 

""Merry Christmas, Bree"" I said, taking the spot vacated by Jay.

""Merry Christmas, Luke"" Bree replied. ""I'm so happy you made it, and congrats on a successful holiday charity drive! She smiled at her family. ""Everyone meet my wonderful boyfriend, Luke. Luke, meet everyone.""

We exchanged greetings and Bree smiled. ""Does anyone want a cookie? I have no idea why we have so many!""",19
1lfxw0b,mywnapp,"She blinked at me, surprised and confused. “I- yeah. Wait, what?”

“That’s what they say, every time.”

She blinked again. “Are- are you cheating on me?”

“No!” I exclaim, standing up from the table. “This is…eight, nine, the tenth time this has happened to me! I meet a girl, we date for a while, and on Christmas Eve she dumps me! If a thing happens once, that’s a random occurrence. If a thing happens twice, that’s a coincidence. If a thing happens three times, that’s a pattern, and what we have here is a well-established pattern!”

“I - I don’t - wait, I…” She can’t even speak. She holds her head as panic and confusion set in. Looking around, everyone else in the diner is staring at us. The waitress raises a hand to one ear.

“Abort scenario, the storyline is compromised. I repeat, abort scenario, the storyline is compromised.” In a flash, everyone is moving. Gwen and I are being wrestled to the ground. People wearing white lab coats are jabbing us with needles, injecting us with something. All the while, the air is filled with various conversations, spilling out and overlapping each other.

“Home Office won’t like this.”

“Any idea what happened?”

“Home Office can’t do anything if the Yuletide Ones aren’t appeased!”

“If I had to guess, he’s developed a tolerance for the amnestics.”

“I told the Writers that if we kept recycling this storyline, then something like this would happen.”

The world fades to darkness.",12
1lgdawp,myvrlmg,"Herb Encarnacio was sitting up, not laying down, on the white bed in the white room. He didn't notice it but he was pulling at the edges of his white gown. 

He'd decided that laying down would be showing weakness. They were going to operate on him and it would be best if they didn't think he was weak. Herb believed that when people think you're weak, something down deep gives them permission to fuck up.

Strength is all that matters. Might is right. Keep'em worried. Just like dad always said.

The digital clock ticked over. Just a few more minutes.

Herb noticed that he was plucking at his gown and stopped immediately. Fidigiting was a lack of control, not being in control was weak.
 
He inhaled deeply. The air was scentless, tasteless. Was the parasite eating up smells now or was the room just that sterile?

As the thought of the parasite ran through his brain, Herb blacked out. 

When he came to he heard his voice asking, ""Doc will this tingle?"" 

""Hurt actually."" The doctor answered. The doctor wasn't looking at Herb, Orban was looking at his abdomen.

""Will that be a light pain or...?"" Again the voice was his but something was off. 

As the haze cleared Herb realized it was coming from the mouth that had grown out of his stomach. 

He was careful not to form the ""P"" word in his mind. It didn't like it when he thought that. Herb wanted to think it to show that he didn't care what it felt or wanted. Herb wanted to project strength. He'd tried projecting strength but it was tied deep into his nervous system and it was difficult to do much these days.

He'd never felt so weak.

The doctor answered it's question as he nodded to a nurse that was on his left, ""No, agonizing."" 

The nurse slipped a needle into a hose that hadn't been in his arm just a few mintues before. Herb wondered how long he'd been out.

A coolness in his veins warned him that the nurse had just hit him with a sedative.

He felt the mouth on his stomach grimace, ""Oh. Darn.""

Doctor Orban leaned over Herb and smiled a reassuring smile as the world faded to black.",13
1lg2q00,mysxed2,"I stared at my dad, my mouth hanging open after he dropped that bomb on me.  The Human-Rowan war had devastated the planet, over three billion people dead and it was only now that the climate was beginning to go back to normal.  I had studied the war in high school, just like every other student, but I had no idea my dad had any part in it other than being a soldier.

""How did you-"" I began but stopped when he raised a hand.  His grin was a cocksure as ever, and he turned he head to point behind his right ear.  I watched in amazement as a shiny, metal port appeared as if by magic. ""It's camouflaged unless I will it to reveal itself,"" he explained.  ""I was part of a secret project, a real Hail Mary if you will, to interface with Rowan technology. As the only survivor of the process, it was on me to make the most of it.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My middle-aged dad, the one who told terrible Dad jokes at barbeques and was the most cautious man I knew, was a real war hero.  I paused to gather my thoughts before asking just one question. He interrupted me, like he was reading my mind.

""How? Well, with the interface, I could link to their tech, take it over and do whatever I wanted with it.  Repurpose it for deadly results.  My first mission was getting onto a battle cruiser, something that took an entire battalion of Marines to accomplish.  Once we were there, I hooked in and took over.  Purged all the Rowan out of the ship and landed it in Area 51.  I was the bridge that translated all their technology, information and battle plans.  The military reverse engineered the ship so we could build more, build better.  The war turned a corner at that point, but I wasn't done.  My last mission was on their battle station orbiting Earth. I was inserted with a team of specialists, real go-getters.  We breached and made our way to the central database.  For over ten hours, they held off waves of Rowan soldiers as I downloaded and transmitted the entire sum of their knowledge.  Jumped us light years ahead.  They even had information from other species that they never bothered to translate or use, but we sure made the most of everything.""

""They never told us any of this in school,"" I muttered.  ""And they never will,"" he countered.  ""It goes deeper than just utilizing their technology against them.  The Rowan were a hivemind, every one of them connected to another.  I broke it, that special connection, and it broke them as a people.  After that, it was more of mopping up then real battle.  They had lost their cohesion, their special trait that we couldn't seem to overcome before.  Most of them did the dirty work for us, ending their lives, unable to live without being part of that gestalt.  And it went past the ones here on Earth, far past.  Your father is responsible for the death of trillions.""  His voice grew quiet, his eyes lowered in shame.  ""I killed trillions of intelligent beings.  I have to live with that every day.  Sure, it was us of them, but I can't get that number out of my mind.""

I reached out and hugged my dad hard, finally getting a sense of why he acted the way he did.",45
1lg2q00,myt07ib,"I look at my deadbeat dad.  
He never leaves the house, never does chores, yet...  
Mom adores him?  
I am enrolled in the most prestigious school ever, and we never, ever lack any money.  
Mom is a simple teacher so...how?  
I kept curiosity at bay for more than 18 years, but now...ready to leave the nest, and go out in the world.  
I want to know.  
""Dad? How are we able to afford all this?"" I ask him.  
He almost smiles.

  
""20-22 years ago, there was an invasion."" he starts.  
I nod.  
A hivemind found Earth, and infected a few.  
Anyone that got in contact with an infected, got added to the hivemind link.  
Stronger individuals took months to succumb, and weaker ones got instantly added to the ranks of the hivemind...  
No one could seemingly resist.  
We couldn't find the link, we couldn't identify the hivemind individuals before it was too late, and seemingly all hope was lost, but then...  
The hivemind disappeared.  
The world didn't believe it for a long time, but it did happen, after all...we are free, aren't we?

  
""How? You?"" I ask.  
He nods slowly.  
""I got infected, when I was at my lowest point, almost ending it all...  
Many would have thought that this meant I was an easy target, right?"" he starts.  
I nod.  
""But nope.  
The voices? The link? Absolutely useless against my mind.  
Not only that, but my anxiety, paranoia, hypochondria, and the endless deadly scenarios were transmitted through the link back to the hivemind.  
The link was nigh-indestructible, so...they kept being infected by my thoughts."" he continues.  
I gasp.

  
""Then, I suppose the government managed to create a device that could identify hivemind individuals, because they found me.  
And they were shocked, and happy to see me...as me, and not a member of the hive.  
When I told them that the hivemind is begging for me to stop, and why it asked so...  
They apologized to me."" he says.  
""Apologized? The government?"" I ask.  
""They doubled down, feeding me the worst things I couldn't even imagine before.  
Let me tell you, humanity is fucked up.  
But hey...after I saw those files, and videos...the hivemind voluntarily retreated, freeing every human, and leaving the planet.  
I became a Hero, with a lot of perks, and met your mom in rehab, where she was volunteering.  
The rest, you kind of know."" he says.  
I leave the living room, confused, shocked...and wow...  
Dad defeated an alien invasion with...his depression?  
Would anyone believe me if I tell them?",26
1lg2q00,myt679d,"When the old ant moved, his back leg dragged. Why did the Queen and her royal guards show him such respect? We didn't know. We just knew he was slow.

For nineteen seasons, he strained under loads half the size of mine. He'd fall behind on foraging runs. I'd hear his wheeze in the tunnels.

He didn't pull his weight. He was an embarrassment. I couldn't understand why the colony let him continue.

And I felt ashamed. You see, he's my father.

Last week, I snapped when he dropped a seed. ""You embarrass us,"" I said. ""Stay in the nest. Let us handle it.""

He didn’t argue. Just nodded and scraped his bad leg through the dirt. But later, I guess this prompted him to speak.

Now he stood at the entrance to our restoreum. My siblings had gathered. Another lecture. Whatever. I hung back, hoping to slip away. 

""Long ago,"" he began, ""a rock fell from the sky. It was smaller than a seed. Hit near the oak stump. It brought something with it. Not alive. Not dead. A fungus. Thoughts like one mind stretched across stars.""

My antennae twitched. His voice gripped me. He never told stories.

""Bees got it first. Wings stopped. Hives went quiet. Their queen came to us, half-dead, and warned we were next. Said the fungus would eat the tunnels. Choke the brood.""

A shift in his stance showed the scars. Deep gouges I’d always chalked up to age.

""We fought. Us, the bees. Your uncles. Everyone. Tore through the rot. Chewed its veins. Days blurred. Weeks passed.""

He paused. The limp dragged again, but slower this time. Measured.

""Lost half the colony. Took a spore blast to the thorax. But we stopped it. Burned it with sap.""

The yard around us hummed. Bees passed overhead. The colony hummed with the same sounds as always. But it felt different now.

""That’s why they come. It's why they share honey. It's why we guard their hives. That fight bound us.""

I looked at him, bent and tired. But I saw something else now. ""Your limp?"" I asked.

""I was at the final battle."" He said. ""Lived, most didn't.""

Above us, a bee dropped pollen. That night, I heard his wheeze in the tunnels. I still felt ashamed. But my shame was different. It was for not recognizing who this brave, old ant truly was.",15
1lftqig,myr9rvd,"""WHAT.""

Asjoljsbi's voice was shrill. Chirping, even. Rose blinked, still sucking on her lollipop. It reminded her of those silly-looking birds that flew around her backyard sometimes. She popped her lollipop out of her mouth.

""You're a goof!""

""I HEARD YOU, HUMAN."" A tendril lashed out at the cavern walls around them. The stone it struck changed color and shape until it was a writhing black tumor of eyes, teeth, and hair, but Rose wasn't paying attention. ""WHAT ARE YOU?""

""I'm a first-grader!"" Rose put her hands on her hips and puffed up her chest proudly.

""...THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT.""

""I'm a girl!""

""I WAS AWARE.""

""You look funny!""

""I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. A MORTAL SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WITNESS THE SECRETKEEPER OF THE STARS WITHOUT THEIR MIND SNAPPING. COULD YOU PERHAPS BE A VESSEL? OR A NIGHTCRAWLER?""

Rose wasn't listening anymore. She waddled over on stubby legs to one of the tendrils and poked it with her finger. The tendril bubbled and popped, erupting into a huge mist of spores that ensnared mortal creatures under Asjoljsbi's control. Rose giggled and waved her hands, trying to catch as many of them as she could.

Asjoljsbi shuddered. It wasn't working. They retracted their tendrils, much to the disappointment of the... thing. ""CHILD. SPEAK. WHO BIRTHED YOU?"" This time, Asjoljsbi's shrill voice was a little more restrained, a little less booming.

""Wha?""

Could it be? There was no way. Not possible. This had to be someone playing a prank on them. Was it that damned Shub-Niggurath again? The bastard always seemed to fancy having new mortal children. But there was a way to find out.

""HOLD STILL.""

Two tendrils reached out and poked and prodded at Rose's arms, legs, neck, and head, searching for any signs of eldritch residue.

""No tickling! No tickling! Stop!"" She cried out in between hysterical giggling. ""Not fair!""

A few minutes of careful study later, the results came back. Asjoljsbi was stunned. There was nothing. This truly was an ordinary child.

The Secretkeeper of the Stars pondered this for a while, withdrawing their tendrils. Many minutes passed in silence, during which Rose restlessly moved about the cave opening she had somehow wandered down.",217
1lftqig,myrcmhn,"""It's not Halloween yet,"" Sarah stared at the eldritch horror beyond comprehension. ""Very impressive costume. You must've put a ton of effort into it. But you're a few months too early.""

The mass of undulating black flesh and sludge met her steely gaze with an impenetrable stare. Only to blink with dozens of eyes and wobbled like an oversized, misshapen jello. It tented its tentacles, which seem to be having conversations with each other in screechy cat noises. Its mouth, which stretched from a bulbous head to this rotund mid-section, which Sarah assumed was a stomach, wrenched itself open in a silent scream.

""Yes, it is a good act,"" she sighed, patting the creature on the head. Only to later pull her hand away and wipe the slime off. ""Nice texturing. Almost like a real slime monster.""

*“You’re not dead.”* The oddly shy voice that came from the monster carried confusion and caution. There was no reverb or echo or blood-curdling edge. Just a voice that could belong to a child trying to make a surprised pikachu face, only to flounder about like a floppy jellyfish on dry land. *""You're not scared.""*

""I'm alive, and tired, and still have work to do,"" Sarah remarked. ""I'm sorry I don't have any treats for you, so please go home.""

“All who witness my horrifying visage scream in terror!” The creature gesticulated wildly, flailing its tentacles as though it were a panicked octopus that forgot it could breathe underwater. “You do not fear!How can you withstand the horror that is my terrible tentacles and not melt into a puddle of dissolved flesh and bones? By Hastur and Cthulhu, this has never happened to me!”

""Oh, you're a Lovecraft fan? Cthulhu is your favourite?"" Sarah asked, hoping it could stop panicking and talk about its hobbies. ""I used to play Call of Cthulhu RPG with friends. Do you want to play together? Get to know each other. Don't be scared.""

""Okay..."" it sniffed, blowing chunks of thick wax-like substances from its...mouths? Sarah could not see anything resembling nostrils on the creature's face. ""Teach me. How to play Cthulhu games. How are you not scared of..."" it paused, scrunching its features searching for the right word to say, ""...creepy costumes.""

""I'm a middle school teacher. When you're trapped in the public school system for as long as I have, nothing phases you. Absolutely nothing.""

""Nothing indeed...nothing I do scares you...you...monster!"" the eldritch entity sobbed before screaming of fearless teacher who refused to comprehend the horrors at night. Of a teacher who gazed into the Abyss without batting an eyelid and made it blink and cry.

1lftqig,myrhxwm,"The creature emerged from the pain of existence, from the cracks of woe. It wrought itself into being, twisting the formless echoes of suffering until it was whole. An energy pulsated through it, each new breath breathing into it an air of despair, until all that it was came to be. 

It new its purpose. It knew *pain.*

A sound made it swivel, its body twisting in torment. It knew every language, as all language contains that which should not be said, but it could discern the dialect nor the meaning. 

It could only be described as... *Psspsspss*

The eldritch monstrosity gazed up, as a human crouched low, arm outstretched. Its hand contained nothing; only a sense of beckoning. 

Again, that sound. That intriguing sound. 

*Psspsspss*

The beast, alive since before eternity, knew not what to do. It wasn't sure of what horrible torment to wrought, what awful agony to inflict. 

""*There's a good girl*,"" the human said, shuffling towards the horror. ""*There's a good girl.*""

The monstrosity ebbed, eons of excruciation within its throes. A timeless second in wait. 

The hand reached out, making contact with the beast, with the formless amalgamation of all that was wrong. It moved across it again, again. A ritual repeated, each more deliberate than the last. 

""*Now aren't you something,*"" she said, her smile etching into her wrinkles. ""*Such a pretty little girl.*""

This was not how it was supposed to go. 

The human's other hand reached towards it, and it moved backwards, almost defensively. The hand soon made contact however, reaching beneath it and cradling it upwards, into the human's arms. 

""*There there,*"" the human said, holding it as if it were a baby. ""*Let's get you a home.*""

The horror gazed up at the human, as the suffering at its core churned. What terror to reap. What despair to defile. 

The human walked slowly, deliberately, cradling the beast in its arms. She sat among a smattering of boxes; a makeshift bed.

She kissed the beast on what could be called its forehead. 

""*We all need a home,*"" she said almost to herself, stroking the horror tenderly, lovingly.

An eternity of suffering; a moment of respite. 

Something arose in it. Something it could not name, but only feel. 

Something it much preferred.

1lftqig,myr19s8,"Okay.  
I just watched a house sprout legs, and a mouth, and eat a car.  
Then a myriad eyes bloomed on it, all staring at me.  
Was I terrified? Hell yes.  
Did I react? Hell no?  
Why?  
Because I couldn't understand what the fuck did just happen.  
So now...I am having a staring contest with a goddamn thousands eyed house!

  
The House's mouth opens, revealing teeth that have...eyes?  
I almost faint.  
It rolls out a ridiculously long tongue...and it licks me.  
It fucking licks me.  
I want to scream. I want to run away, but I can't.  
I am frozen in place.  
This is too much for my brain to comprehend.  
I think I have shut down.  
My body ain't bodying.  
Then it gets worse.

  
The House roars at me.  
Yeah, you heard that right, roars at me, and tries to step on me.  
I don't even flinch.  
Not because I am not scared, I already soiled myself, but because I am simply having an out-body like experience.  
The House freezes as well.  
Growls, and takes a few steps back, still staring at me.  
My eyes are dry, and sting, but I can't come to make myself blink.  
Then...  
The House whimpers.

  
I watch as it lowers itself to the ground, legs disappearing, eyes blinking and disappearing.  
One more low whimper escapes its terrible mouth, and it disappears as well.  
Now...  
The house is a normal looking house.  
And the weird atmosphere, and dreadful feeling disappeared.  
I see a purplish cloud leaving the house, and occasionally looking back at me, before disappearing into the horizon.  
I collapse, twitching.  
Before everything goes dark, the only thing I can think about is...  
Did I just scare away a scary monster?  
Did from fight and flight, and freeze...freeze really work?",95

I could see all of those things in it, while also seeing none of them at the same time. I sat up in my bed, pulling the blankets over my knees, continuing to examine the creatures’ many rotating heads, each flashing with what I assumed was a different emotion? Or perhaps it was the same one? It was hard to tell when those floating faces rotated around its oozing dark body like moons caught in a planet’s orbit.
 
“I am all. I am nothing.” Its voice made my windows wobble, threatening to burst open if they raised it even a decibel louder. When it moved, it mimicked a slug, crawling slowly towads my bed, as its imposing form leaned over my body. Each head swirling around its body faster, with yellowed teeth, green teeth, white teeth, and I still had no idea what I was looking at.
 
I remained silent, not exactly frozen in fear, more held in place by startled confusion. It was scary, in the same way that finding a cockroach in your bedroom at night would be scary, not a oh my god type of fear, more an ick. The body of the creature throbbed, causing the sores on its skin to drool a green ooze, threatening to drip onto the floor. The body reminded me of an oversized balloon. One so thick it would pop if it brushed against a hair of grass. Though, before I could understand its body, it deflated into a deathly thin frame, one that showed the animalistic skeleton underneath its skin.
 
“Join us. You will become a part of us. We hunger. You will hunger too.” Its long, perfect fingers traced my chin. For all its strangeness, its fingers were pristine with painted red nails. If one saw them in a magazine, they may even think they belonged to a hand model. The softness of their touch easing me slightly.
 
Again, its words were intimidating, but the longer this went on, the less fear I felt. In fact, I felt more confused than anything. What was this thing? I couldn’t even decide what parts of it I was supposed to fear at this point. I slid its hand from my chin, that spooking the creature who shifted back.
 
“You moved.” It hissed, its frail chicken legs bending backwards as it went into a squat. “Why did you move? You shouldn’t move.”
 
“I’m confused.”
 
“Confusion is fear.” It said, confidence growing as it crept forward.
 
“No, I’m not scared. I can’t even tell what I’m meant to be scared of. Every time I get scared, you change into something else.”

“BAAGSGASDGAS” It screamed, generating a sound that forced the windows open, letting in a chill that cooled my body to the point of almost freezing it. I whimpered, breath coming out in a gust of condensation. “Scared yet?” It snickered, the faces all bouncing with laughter, and I was terrified. For a second.

 

The faces again changed, big chubby cheeks wailing on one, a glossy lipstick wearing one following that, before ending on a comically plain face with fuzzy eyebrows. The whiplash from seeing all those faces taking me out of my horrified state. I pulled my blankets up, warming myself until the chill left. “That was a little scary.”

 

“A little scary?” It stepped back again. “NO, no, No.” Each no had a different tone, as if it was being filtered through a hundred voices. The orbs of floating faces stopped their rotation, forming a line before its body. “What if all my faces eat you alive? Nibble bits of your skin until you're nothing but a pile of bones that we can use to pick our teeth clean with.”

 

Again, my fear heightened before I realized one of the mouths didn’t have any teeth, having lost them when it shifted. The constant changes becoming more noticeable. Now, that’s all I could focus on, unable to comprehend anything else. “That one’s missing its teeth.”

 

“What? No, it isn’t. Can you truly not understand what lurks before you? What is going to kill you?”

 

“I… really have no idea what you even are. Are you a monster? A bunch of faces? I don’t get it.” I rubbed my nose, doing my best to try and take a guess at what the mess of body parts was. Bravely, I stepped out of my bed, approaching it to get a better look.

 

It flinched, its size deflating, becoming smaller as I got closer. “No. Stay back.”


It almost looked cute now, a fearful tiny creature that shivered with my every step. Then it grew again, its body hitting the ceiling as its heads stared down at me. “I’ll kill you.” It shouted, though it lacked any heart, the creature already pushing itself against the wall, trying to keep away from me.
 
“I can’t even tell how you would kill me.” I admitted, and that appeared to be the final straw for the creature. It squealed, dashing away towards the window. When it realized it was too big for the window, it shrunk to the size of a bee and grew a set of large-boned arms from its back. These arms helping it to fly, with their skeletal fingers flapping, giving it some air. I tried to grab it before it left, only to miss it, having to watch as it escaped my home.
 
I watched it for a minute before closing the windows. I had so many questions to ask it, but it appeared I would never get the chance to find out what it really was. The creature was long gone, with no intention of ever coming back. Resigned to the fact I would never see it again, I shut my eyes, needing a few minutes before I could get back to sleep again.

1lftqig,mys38uk,"The woman walked home like a leaf caught in the wind. Thin, exhausted, her eyes wide and hollow. She held her keys loosely in one hand, her steps automatic, as if her body remembered the way even when her mind had long since let go.

The house stood just as it always had—gray, old, familiar. Two shallow steps led up to the front door. She climbed them slowly, paused before the door, and stared at it for a moment. Then she reached for her keys and brought them to the lock. Her fingers trembled—not from fear, but from sheer fatigue. The keys slipped through her grip and fell to the wooden porch with a dull metallic clatter.

She didn’t react right away. Instead, she stood still, looking down at the keys as if trying to remember what they were for. Ten seconds passed. Maybe more. Then, somewhere above, a faint sound broke the silence—like a window slamming shut on the second floor. It was soft, but unmistakably inside the house.

The noise brought her back. She bent down, picked up the keys, and stepped away from the door, her head tilting up toward the second floor.

There, in the window, she saw the back of a head. Gray hair. A pale nightgown. The figure stood perfectly still, turned away. It wasn’t clear who—or what—it was. An old woman? A stranger? A shadow?

And then she remembered.

Three days ago, her sister had called her in tears. She’d had a dream, a vivid nightmare. In it, she had wandered through this very house in the middle of the night. In the boy’s bedroom—the boy who had died just yesterday—she had seen an old woman standing beside his bed.

She had asked, ""Who are you?""  
The woman didn’t answer.  
She asked again, ""Why are you here?""  
The old figure raised an arm and pointed silently at the sleeping child.

Then she turned.

Her sister saw two enormous, hollow eyes—emptier than death itself. Her skin was black, like oil, and her smile was made entirely of glass.

She’d woken up screaming and called right away. At the time, it had seemed like nothing. Just a dream.

But the next day, her son was gone.

Now, standing before the same door, she remembered it all. The keys felt heavy in her hand as she brought them back to the lock. One turn. Then another. She paused, her lips moving into something that almost resembled a smile. Not warmth. Not courage. Just quiet surrender. Or maybe acceptance.

""I’m not afraid anymore,"" she said softly.

She turned the key a final time. There was a faint click as the door unlocked and drifted open.

There was nothing left to fear.",7

""I'm Rose!""

""ROSE. DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY?""

""I have a momma! She lets me go play all day while she plays with her friends!""

""... WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF THIS CAVERN?""

Rose lit up like fireworks. ""Yes! Will there be candy?""

""... THERE WILL BE CANDY. COME."" A hundred of Asjoljsbi's tendrils reached out and formed a bridge so that Rose could cross the chasm and enter the rest of the cave. In the meantime, a few more breached the surface a hundred kilometers away in a major human colony to search for this so-called ""candy.""

""Yaaay!""

1lgds9i,myvuixg,"I barely noticed it at first. Too busy inspecting my latest sets of spirits, sampling a shot of each. I wasn't too happy with this lot, too much of the alcohol taste cutting through the rest of the flavours. Good if someone wanted to get hammered, but hardly worth the coin otherwise. Still, what was done was done. I could still find someone who would want it.

But as I straightened up, I felt the tear on my back. A low pain, but one I knew all too well by now. It made me glance up to the ceiling, muttering to myself. ""Moonrise already? Darn, I'm running a little late.""

With that I left my sheds, quickly locking them before dashing through the cooling air. Every step came with other small tears, the skin around my joints breaking. I scowled, knowing I had only a few more minutes before I was too far gone.

Thankfully, with the coming change my speed increased. In swift seconds I was safely in my home, closing curtains and stripping at the same time. It was only when I was completely nude did I stop holding back, grabbing my skin and *tearing*.

Great chunks slipped off, as a body too big to fit beneath emerged. I was fit as a human, but as my wolf-self I was a display of muscle, covered in a fine layer of white fur. I stretched, groaning as my bones clicked in relief. It was easy to peel off what skin remained, as it was loose now.

The worst part was the fact I was now left with my... peelings. I had to get rid of them, but they weren't anything that I could exactly throw out. Thankfully, I had a way. I balled up the pieces, sniffing as I set them into a plastic bag I had on hand.

Scampering to a specific wardrobe, I took out my oversized clothing. From the big and tall section, they weren't the height of fashion. But then again, I only wore them once a month. I squeezed them over my thick body, before padding to my laptop. I had left it open, with the tracking of the usual pizzas. En-route, as I had ordered hours ago.

Knowing my gameroom was ready, I just had to wait. And wait I did, listening.

I knew when they pulled in. Their car was one I had heard countless times before, the sounds recognisable. I grinned, heading over to the door. Counting down in my head, as I heard their footsteps, I opened the door just in time.

There they were. My friends, the pairs of monsters. Darcy and Victoria, both vampires smiling as Victoria held up a cooler. Then Herrus and Cleo, the mummy's. I eyed their bandages, pushing the door open as I stepped aside. ""Hey guys. Good trip?""

Herrus nodded, a flash of red visible beneath the cloth over his eyes. ""Not bad.""

I welcomed them in, watching as they headed directly to my games room. A pile of overnight bags were left, as they always stayed over. They took their usual seats, as I held out my arms to my vampiric pals. ""Go on, let's get this over with. Cleo, my skin's in the bag.""

I ignored the pain of bites, as Cleo gave a smirk. ""Thanks Alex. I needed a refresh.""

I smiled, shrugging. ""At least you can use it. The pizza's on the way, so shall we get started?""

Darcy nodded, pulling away as he licked his lips. ""Mmmm. I needed that. I vote poker.""

I sniggered at that. ""Oh good. Worked out how to bluff yet?""

He swore at me, despite the grin brewing. Good-natured laughs echoed around, as we sat around to begin our monthly catch up. A way to hang out free of our guises, a way to relax. We had been doing it for the last five decades, and I was hoping for it to carry on for many more.",6
1lgh0gu,mz0zh36,"Baronet Hughsfree was escorted out from the Royal Hall to a side chamber on the dead silence of the whole Court in shock. As the door closed behind him he heard the hissing roar of the gossip starting up.

And he also imagined hearing the sharpening of knives.

He hoped that the assassin will come from the Prince Southron. By family tradition they did their killing silently, quickly and mostly painlessly. The Princess Walmar, as the rumors said, she don't kill, she disappear you and then make you to beg to be killed.

And all this because of this girl? 

He never did anything to raise his profile in the Court. This is the third time he was there! Always lost in the gray and boring background of the occasion - a crowning, a marriage, and now a betrothal. He was happy to stay at home at his little western hill baronetcy. A small amount of land, enough to grow potato for everyone, some mines, a lot of rock, even more sheep and small, hardy hill cow. He spent his time with baronet things, tinkering in a forge, and courteously refusing every invite from other nobility. That would mean involvement in the hideous infighting of the Court, which he wanted to avoid at all cost. 

He was a literal gentle man. In his ten years of rule he never even ordered a hanging or torture. 

And this is his reward?

He screamed when a small bunch of people rushed into the room with sharp implements. 

Turned out they were the Royal Tailor and his attendants. All the ceremonial stuff was prepared for one of the Dukes. Both the son of Walmar and Lord Southron were tall, charming, strong in the shoulder, narrow at the hip. Hughsfree was smallish and roundish and balding at the age of 30. He was not weak, working in the forge makes one strong, but also makes your face pockmarked with small injuries and your skin dark with the permanent smoke.

The cloak definitely had to be made shorter, lest he stumble on it's way to the throne and the knife aimed at his back go to somewhere else.

He was standing on a stool, getting measured when the door opened then slammed shut behind his back. He immediately jumped from the stool and took up a defensive stance, as much as he could remember from his training back when he was a teenager.

But it was just the Crown Princess, face flushed red, hair is every which way, her circlet is in her hand, kicking a chair until it got under the door handle. With perfect timing as someone immediately tried to get in, without success. 

Hughsfree scrambled to his knee, accompanied with the assorted tailorfolk.

""Your Highness""

""Raise, Albert, please. In a couple of hours you can call me Yvette officially, why not start it now?""

This surprised Albert not a little bit. First, how come the Royal Princess knows anything about him? And how is it that the marriage will go on? This scandal will be talked about for generations, and the ballads written about it will be sung for centuries.

""Why, Your... Your... Yvette. Why are you doing this with me?""

""Sit down, Albert, this wont be easy.""

""I can't, You... Yvette. They want to cut this cloak and do things with it. But let's say I sat down and please tell me why you want me dead.""

""Albert, first, you will not be killed today. I have people who loyal to me, and they will protect you on your way to the chapel and right after that  we get on fast horses and start towards your hills.""

""What? No ceremonies? No reception? No ball?""

""We and my knights can protect you until sundown. After that it would be dicey. Being in a large hall with hundreds of people, most of them having plans to get the throne through me would be a suicide. So no, no party. We run.""

""But... why?""

""How much do you know about the eastern nomads?""

""What? No... not much. They're vicious, but we trade with them?""

""Yes. Now. But their tribes are unified under one chieftain. They have to fight someone, and now that they can't do it with each other, we are the next available target. And we are rich, they know that because they trade with us. And we can't stand up to them, because _we_ do fight with each other. And they know that because both Walmar and Southron hired them as mercenaries.""

""So... there will be a war?""

""No. There will be a massacre. Or several massacres. next year or the year after. The only way to fight the nomads is to be in the high hills, where their horses can't get enough water and feed, and fight them with better weapons than theirs.""

""Yvette, they have the best tin and copper mines... we buy bronze from them! What I do is rusting to nothing in a year.""

""Let me tell you another secret, Albert. Catch!""

And she threw the circlet to Albert. It was very fine work, but not as fine as the Royal Jeweler could do. As he looked at it closer, it was not the fine silver it looked like, it was very, very fine ironwork. Incredibly fine. 

He looked at the princess with shock.

""Yours is not the only forge in the kingdom, Albert. I will teach your people how to make weapons better than bronze, we will build a wall in the valley leading to the hills. And with some luck we will keep the Kingdom alive until the nomads get back to their tribal wars and we can retake the lowlands.""

Albert had nothing to say. He again went to his knee and bowed his head.

""Your Highness!""

""I take it as a yes, Albert. But now raise, as I said. We may die fighting in the hills next summer, but to get there first we have to say some silly oaths and then _run_.""",9
1lg63ss,myty5o0,"""What a touching effort, a shame you'll never live to see the fruits of your labours."" 

The klaxons wailed as she stepped towards me, mocking me as I desperately tried to hold in place what was ripped out from the gouge in my stomach. My ragged heaving breaths were almost louder than the discord and the gloating. It took everything I had just to wince through the pain and keep an eye open. I had to keep her here, I had to keep her engaged, I knew this was the only chance I was going to have to save the colony. 

""Youre... probably..."" 

I winced in pain as I tried to shift back against the bulkhead wall, leaving the sentence hanging. A pregnant vulnerable pause, a display of weakened prey in front of a starving wolf. I tried to stand, but my leg slipped out from beneath me on my own blood and kicked forward, slumping me even more awkwardly into the corner.

""Delicious and pathetic, a most palatable meal. A worthy sacrifice of what we plan to do with the remainder of your little colony and the upstarts within down on the surface... Did you have a wife Jameson? Is that whats left of her over there in the corner from my sidearm? I do hope so, though I wish so much that I would have had the pleasure of taking my time with her while you were in this more agreeable state""

She said. Boots gleaming in the yellowed emergency lights, the remains of my squad glinting of her boots. Steps came toward me now, perfectly in sync with the occasional flashes of brightness. I couldn't move. I had to make myself not move, this was going to be the only way and I knew it. So I did what I had always done, the only thing I had ever really been good at. I lied, and I put my heart in it. 

I lied like I had been caught by my dad when we were out drinking too late and running the silkspeeders on the quarry for fun. Drinking that REAL stuff we made on colony too, not that synth crap they bring in on the corpo ships. I lied like I had been caught in bed with Potentates daughter after the colony meeting afterwards when they had all come by to celebrate the colonys newfound discoveries and soon to be financial windofalls... I lied not like my life depended on it, but like the idea of something greater did.",13
1lg63ss,mytuhns,"The Hero looks at me and smirks.
""I don't have to see it.

Hope that you can also be hurt! That we can stand up to your cruelty!"" he says.
I chuckle and whisk him in the air.
""Great good that did to you.
No arms, no legs, and for what?
To prove you can attack me?"" I ask.
He still smiles.


""When were you attacked last time?
Your reign of terror made people not even dare to think to oppose you!
Well no more!

Be free people! She can be shaken! Challenged!"" he roars to the skies.
I look up to see the Mirror spell, I spell.

""My triumph upsets you?"" he asks.
""What triumph?
You are the greatest Hero of the last century...and you couldn't even touch me.
What does it tell to the normal professionals ?"" I ask.
He stops smiling.
""I...I have proven that..."" he starts.
""That they can stand up to me? They know.
But what good it does?
My laws keep them safe, and put food on their tables.
Sure, their freedom is minimal, but they aren't dying at least."" I say.

""Freedom is more important..."" he starts.
""Than food? Water? Heating?
Life?"" I ask.
He says nothing.
""Hope is..."" he starts.
I crush him.
I watch the rain of blood and flesh fall down, and then look up at the spell.
The priestess tries to shut it off but I tune it and keep it on.
""This is what happens when good intentions aren't backed by proper skills.
Don't worry though, I will keep things as they are."" I say to the Mirrror, before shutting it off.

1lg63ss,myty8uf,"""She was... preg... you bi.."" 

I couldn't even get the words out. Everything somehow couldn't get air and got lost in the tear in my gut somewhere. I wasn't sure if it was going to be enough. I needed it to be enough, it HAD to be enough. I gave in and started to cry through gritted teeth. Looking up at her from the corner in a crumpled heap. If my words wouldn't work my broken body would have to suffice.

""Oh that's perrrrrrrrfect, that's absolutely delectable"" 

She purred in tune with the vibro hum of her cybersaber. I always thought the damn things were show until I saw them using them to execute us openly in the fields when they came to rip everything away. Everything we bled and sweat for, all torn down by fine print and government indifference.

I saw it now, I had watched her move in far enough. I could finally let go. It was funny in so many ways, so I gave in. I started to laugh. It hurt, it spilled more of the wound out onto the floor, but I didn't care anymore. She stopped and cocked her head quizzically at me.

""Oh? Is it funny now? Funny that all this waste was for nothing? Funny that all of this was by design? Funny that you lived an entire life for nothing? Oh yes, I agreeeeeeee"". The smile crept across her face like a rip through a ships hull. Full of a visceral terror that what was about to come next was inevitable and as uncaring as space itself.",12
1lg63ss,mytyb2z,"""No... but this is"". The last of my breath gone, I slammed on the bulkheads hardlock. It had taken everything we had to get her here to the elevator, and more still to bait her into the airlock. Poor Jenna wasn't pregnant, hell she wasn't even my wife, but she had been a staunch ally and a confidant and I'd be damned if I was going to let her plain fail here when we had all given so much.

I don't even think the general registered it at first, she was so drunk on what she would be able to do while I was unable to defend myself. She was so focused on playing with her new toy that I didn't even really need to worry that she could have bolted to the door, that she might have made it out. She didn't even try till it was too late.

The internal airlock behind her slammed shut and the ramjet seals started locking into place. Only then did her eyes widen and she turn her menacing grimace away from me. I tried to stand up again, making good purchase this time pulling myself up using the bulkhead unlock. I didn't have to worry about triggering it by pulling myself up anymore. We were locked in, and standard procedure meant that the airlock was the only door that would open once the emergency sirens started and the doors were locked.

""No... I said again... This... was... the funn..."" I collapsed, pulling down the release and hearing the last of the oxygen be sucked from the room. The last thing I remember was the deep sense of satisfaction I felt seeing her turn back. Wide eyed and fearful. A fear that had probably never even crossed her mind as she saw us trade our own mortality to stop her and the company. A sacrifice to show that we would not rest until acknowledged as an independent people. An idea that we were worth more than the sum of our discoveries.

I blacked out smiling in the void as we were sucked into low orbit.",16
1lg47k6,mytl06x,"The King looked on in confusion as the court wizard revealed the findings of his investigation.

“M’lord, I’ve interviewed all of those who could have cast a sleep curse or similar spell. Not a single one. No spell has been cast, no curse has been laid. To the best of my knowledge, it appears that the princess is just lazy.”

The king’s expression was dark and thunderous. His voice was low and promised imminent doom. “Are you saying there was no magic involved. Are you calling my only daughter,  the heir to my kingdom, lazy? Guards! Seize this fool and put him on the dungeon!”

The mage had figured this was going to be the outcome, so he cast his prepared spell and in a burst of eldritch light, the massive bed of the princess appeared in the throne room. The beautiful young woman lay asleep under the covers, her breathing slow and measured. Before the king could object, the mage yelled “Lunchtime!” as loud as he could. To the shock of the entire court, the princess sprang from her bed and looked around hurriedly. 

The king slowly wiped his face with his hand, nodded to the court wizard and silently mouthed the word “sorry” to him before standing. 

“Princess Esmeralda, you are hereby ordered by the king, your loving and exasperated father, to begin a trial of hard work and no sleep to make up for the torment your lazy self has inflicted upon this kingdom. Court wizard, you are to destroy her bed and bedding, and cast whatever spell you can to keep her awake and moving for a year and a day. I have decreed and it shall be so!”",20
1lfzjcx,myshi6l,"The Monster King laughed at me, rasping as bloody foam dripped from her teeth. She was dying and knew it. ""I stood where you did, *hero*, and did the same. The power rush! The thrill of killing! A bit of each Monster King lives on in the next - they're all here - and soon, they'll all be in you!"" She laughed, her eyes wild. ""I can die happy knowing you only bought a few years of peace!""

Her wild laughter stopped at my small smirk. Her eyes focused a bit. ""What... have you done?""

""Wish Magic: Activation Phrase: A stitch in the timeline saves nine."" I intoned softly. It had taken years, hundreds of searches into dungeons and ruins  and hours of picking through tattered scroll fragments, but I finally learned the potent magic required to summon a being capable of granting wishes and not inclined to twist the magic in a devasting way. So long as one paid the price.

I had made an offer to the otherworldly being that intrigued it - something so common and simple, yet as foreign to it as the being was to myself. I offered it a mortal experience. A full year and a day of travel, feasts, music, dancing, singing, shopping, anything it wanted. Anywhere in the world that I could take it - fishing for great kraken clam in the Northern Willwisp Sea? Done. Sampling the finest wines in the desert markets of Kinir'yuf while sitting atop the fabled Opal Goddess statue? Certainly. Playing fetch with a random stray draggog in the farmlands? Not a problem. A mortal vessel had been made for them to inhabit to fully experience things as a mortal - heat, cold, pain, taste.

It was an offer accepted readily for the wish I asked. Long had such beings discussed what our realm must be like for us, without the ability to [a word tasting of blue and smelling like the sound of raindrops hitting cobblestone].

And now that wish had been activated. Illusory doors stood before me as time slowed to a crawl.

The first opened, and I saw myself casting a spell to turn the current Monster King into an object and simply banishing the object to the moon. I had wondered if such a thing would work. The spell keeping the Monster King an item wore off, and her wounds had healed. It seems she was unable to breathe, however, and died within the hour. The door closed as a new hero strode forth to kill the Monster King I had become.

The second door opened, and within I saw myself sadly shake my head and cauterize the King's wounds. A healing potion was shoved down her throat, one laced with a paralytic. Necessary for the next step, I knew. Her limbs were removed cleanly and carefully seared shut before caps of silver plated iron were screwed into the stumps to stop regeneration. A series of runes were tattooed on her skin to prevent magic use, then I encased everything below her neck in stone. I created golems to attend to her needs. The view shifted and indicated that many years had passed. The King remained the same, and as a figure entered the room, a hood pulled back to reveal a withered shell. My own face stretched over the skeleton, aged well past mortal lifespan and unable to die. That door shut as that version of me went to kill the Monster King properly.

The third door opened and merely showed me the image of a breaking chain before closing.

The doors vanished. I had wished to see the outcome of the three methods I had thought of to break the cycle when I spoke the activation.

Wary eyes regarded me, even as the light in them dimmed. ""I win."" I whispered. I stabbed her in the heart to be certain. And as I felt the madness of the Monster King enter me, I smiled, and turned the blade on myself.

The only way to break the cycle was to use the same hero to kill the Monster King twice.",57
1lfzjcx,myv5eus,"Silence. I stood there frozen. My sword dyed red with the blood of the monster, no, the man in front of me. The air went still as I held my breath. Watching the man who raised me stagger from right to left. Blood gushing from his bowels. His eyes softened as he stared back at me and despite the carnage that he had left in his wake, all I could see in that moment, was Artorius Redwood,  the gentle knight who had saved me when the Monster King slaughtered my village. His balance began to fail and he toppled forward but before he could meet the ground I found myself under him, catching his body and lying it gently down with his back to the ground. 

""I didn't want this."" He managed to squeeze out between weak breaths.  ""I couldn't stop the curse. I wasn't..."" His words cut short with a violent cough.

""I know."" My voice shaking with tears beginning to form.

He turned to me ""The curse... it will come for you too."" he said with fear ripe in his eyes. ""I'm... sorry."" With those final words the last breath of air left his body. I knelt there, above his bleeding corpse, shaking. 10 years ago I had thought my time had come at the hands of the Monster King. I chuckled to myself at the irony, as I stood up, held my sword to my neck, and gathered my resolve.",10
1lfw57h,myrzwj9,"I stood off to the side, a room filled with men and women, clad in steel and swords, scabbards and shields, all in preparation for blood.

I felt cold, near sickened, looking around. Maghrit was in his castle, walls barred and ready for war, but deep down, a dark feeling stirred.

Soon, the background conversation - that filtering noise - died, as our Officer, Lia Valehn, walked in. ""Attention!""
Every soldier saluted her, then calmed, as she said ""at ease.""

I felt a knot in my chest. A knot, which tightened as Lia approached. ""Hello..."" she said, the Vulpen stood next to me, ""are you Reyard?""

I swallowed, nodding.

She sighed, ""good, I am...well, you know.""

""Valehn.""

She nodded, ""of course, of course,"" she smiled, ""and I'm sure you know what I need?""

""Um...""

""I need a bodyguard.""

There was a pause, which should have felt short, but the nearby knights looked to me. ""...me?""

She nodded.

""Why? You're *the* Spellblade!""

She smiled.

""What?""

""Exactly...I know anything, and everything, about melee, about combat, but..."" she took a breath, ""...but I can't heal, like you. May I see your hands?""

I nodded. ""I...I mostly use my staff, still...""

She grabbed a hand, and inspected the palm. ""Good,"" she let go, ""my liege and I have - ""

""What was that?""

""I was feeling your hands for magic.""

""...oh...?""

""Him?"" I heard a new voice asked.

Lia turned to Drang Byrd. ""Yes,"" Lia said. ""We need a healer.""

""Surely, someone of your skill - ""

""I'm a gladiator,"" said Lia, walking to Byrd, ""trained day and night, and, after battle, drank the same red potion to heal. You know why?""

Byrd sighed, ""to...to undo the damage...""

She nodded, ""because the most valuable part of gladiator fights, is the gladiators. When our soldiers are on the field, we need someone to heal our troops, and keep them off the ground.""

Byrd sighed, turning to me. ""Do you...do you think you...can do this?""

""I...""

Byrd started ""if it's too much...can you at least make everyone healing potions?""

Lia turned to me as well.

After a silence, the pacifism in my brain grew silent; replaced, by a small whisper: ""...if you cannot kill, take a life, and Maghrit must fall...perhaps save those who can?""

...

""...yes,"" I said.",41
1lfw57h,myrm2gd,"The Academy's Grand Hall fell silent.  
Everyone gathered today, for one of the newly knighted Witchknight came to choose his partner.  
Witchknights were the peak force of our civilization when it comes to using magic and martial arts for battle.  
The Academy houses 108 different halls, each responsible to teaching a path of magic, or martial arts.  
I was one of the few who studied healing magic, and medicine, as a herbal witch.  
So, when Witchknight ""Bloody Maw"", chose me as his partner, I was shocked.  
They usually chose someone who can complement their fight style.  
Everyone else was confused as well.  
Even the Archsage, himself.



In a small classroom, with the supervision of one of my teacher's, I met the Witchknight.  
""Elisa Amber."" I bow my head.  
""Adam Argent.  
I have read you are the top of your class, and have quite the success rate in healing poisons, and blood maladies?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""I major in herbalism, with a minor in healing magic, but yes, my graduation thesis is on Poisons, and Blood maladies of the 9 kingdoms."" I say.  
""Will you become my battle-partner, and follow me to cleanse this world of its filth?"" he asks.  
I hesitate.

  
""Why me?"" I ask.  
The witchknight looks at the teacher, and she sighs, leaving us alone.  
Wow...thanks for the ""support"", teacher.  
""""Bloody Maw"" is my moniker, because I am a bloodline martial artist, with the blood of a Moon Wolf flowing within me.  
I fight close-quarters, and my spells are often self-destructive, as my devouring abilities can quickly heal me."" he says, taking off his shirt.  
I gasp.  
So many scars, and bruises.  
""But poison inhibits my powers, and so does bad blood..."" he continues.

  
""May I?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
I check his scars, and bruises, and feel the poison still within them, fighting back against his body's natural healing.  
""You just graduated...how can you already have so many wounds?"" I ask.  
""Witchknights are seen as royals, equals to rulers, but with that privilege come responsibilities."" he says.  
I nod.  
""I agree. If you truly thought this through, to become your battle-partner.  
I vow to keep you alive, as long as possible."" I say.  
He smiled.  
That was...a first, didn't think he could do that.  
We took our vows and oaths in front of the archsage of the Academy himself, and Adam told me our first assignment: infiltrate the Swamp, and hunt down the 9-headed hydra, who terrorizes 2 of the 9 kingdoms.  
Great start.",83
1lfw57h,myyc96u,"""Tell me."" Witchknight Valer spoke, ""Do you know the average number of witchknights there are at a time?""

The Archsage seemed caught off guard by the question, but before they could give an answer, I did instead.

""Umm, if I recall, around five-hundred at a time."" I let my love of statistics show a bit, ""Given the requirements for the training, average retirement age, and of course the...turnover.""

Valer smiled at that, and then gained a grim expression, before continuing.

""Then could you tell me how many we lost during the Scarring War?""

I was caught off guard by that question.

""I'm sorry, I don't believe I do.""

Valer began pacing with the explanation.

""The exact number is two-hundred, and thirty-seven."" They stopped and stared at one of the stained glass windows, that depicted the founding of the Witchknights, ""Several of them could have been prevented, if a capable enough healer was near enough to aid.""

It appeared that the Archsage was about to say something, but was interrupted by Valer.

""Or, if the knights themselves possessed a more in depth knowledge of healing and medical arts "" Valer walked back to stand in front of me, ""That is why I chose you.""

Dots began to connect in my mind, and I responded with an educated, Guestimates.

""You, you don't want me to be your student."" Valer gave a small smile of pride as I continued, ""You want to be mine.""

Murmurs began swimming through the room at that, and Valer elaborated.

""More specifically, or functionally less so actually, I wish for your assistance in adding Healing Magic and Medical knowledge to the Witchknight's regimes.""

One of the murmurs got louder.

""But, this one has absolutely atrocious combat abilities. They will never make it as a Witchknight.""

Valer, gave a sharp look, from over the shoulder, at the heckler.

""That...is very much true."" I deflated at that comment, but Valer continued, ""You would not actually be a Witchknight, honorary perhaps, but your duty would be more on aiding us in reforming our Training Practices with your expertise.""

I mulled over that bit of information, and gave my answer.

""I suppose that is far more acceptable."" I straightened my clothes, ""It also makes more sense.""

I gave one sheepish look, and realized I needed something clarified.

""You, have been informed that I get... queazy at the sight of fire, correct?""",5
1lfr67z,myqyei5,"I stare at the Goddess of Life, terrified.  
""Speak!"" I say.  
She sighs.  
""There are multiple types of ""chosen ones"", such as magical girls, summoned people, reincarnated people, and so on."" she says.  
As she does so, she conjures images of these ""chosen ones"".  
I shiver with disgust.  
They are all children!

  
""Why?"" I ask.  
I have been a loyal paladin for millennia to her, but I can't continue after learning about the children.  
""Their souls are more adaptable to the dimensional shift.  
Also, their souls are better suited to be given blessings, and powers, as they are still developing."" she says.  
I snort.  
""So you know they are still developing, huh?  
And still send them in god forsaken places?"" I say.  
She just smiles.

  
""As my paladin, you have erased plenty of evil off of the surface of the planet.  
You really think..."" she starts.  
""Exactly! I did! As a grown ass man!  
And so did other professionals, and soldiers!  
But last time, I had to assist a 15 year old to defeat an evil god...SHE WAS 15!  
If I hadn't saved her from that noble...or later on if I didn't get back in time, then her own teammate would have...  
Goddess!"" I say.  
She sighs.  
""It has to be done.  
For the greater good."" she says.  
I snort.

  
""So, me killing those apostles, demon kings, and uprooting those criminal enterprises in the human kingdoms, means nothing?"" I ask.  
""No. You have done a great job, but Fate decrees..."" she starts.  
""In the end, it was me who killed the evil god, and not that girl.  
She just wounded him, but almost died in the process."" I interrupt her.  
She says nothing.  
""Doesn't matter. Now that we know, we will do something against it."" I say.  
""We?"" she asks.  
""Parents, and adults.   
I have a dozen paladins, and many more priests, and priestesses, and fighters, and rogues, oh so many rogues, joining my cause."" I say.  
""Your cause being?"" she asks.  
""Kids deserve to have a childhood. So while they eat dirt, and fall in love with the wrong person, we shall protect them, and deal with the dangers of the world ourselves."" I say, stopping the prayer, and watching as she disappears.  
I turn around to see several other people nodding at me.  
Let's get this party started.",132
1lfr67z,myr4s7p,"The paladin threw down his sword in disgust upon learning of child soldiers. It didn't matter if they were magical girls, or chosen one, or summoned people, or isekai heroes. They were too young to fight the various horrors of his world.

It didn't matter that his former god insisted it was for the greater good. Nothing good could come out of depriving children of their childhood and innocence. They would inevitably grow to be traumatized adults saddled with a boatload of emotional problems.

He was there. As were so many of the kingdom's soldiers. The king had an army. Why wouldn't his god choose from them? Take the men and women willing to serve the kingdom? Not the children, taken forcibly from their worlds, thrust into a foreign land they knew nothing of, and defend it.

The people agreed. Even the king did. It was a united decision to forsake this god for one that would not send children to war. Children to die. The only question was if they wanted to seek a new god, or to simply count on the bravery of their army.

""No longer shall we rely on gods!"" The former paladin declared, throwing down his helmet, now dull and unblessed, dented and scarred by battles. ""We fight for ourselves! For our kingdom and people! Not for the gods!""

And a sudden bolt of lightning struck him down.

That wasn't the end of it. He had already awakened a desire to be free from the machinations of deities. His kingdom wasn't the only one - even their enemies chose to stop worshipping their own gods. All across this world, Man had declared the Age of Gods over - now would be the Age of Man.

Thus, no longer shall little magical girls, or chosen children fight. Adults fought for these kids to be free. Now, the seven kingdoms no longer wage war with each other. For once, in many centuries, they joined forces to confront the gods. Once, they had fought each other in the names of their gods.

Not anymore.

There will no longer be chosen ones. Not by the gods. Now, humans chose for themselves.

1lfr67z,mytk1py,"The quest had taken years. For a while I was convinced that this place was just a legend and somehow I had kept searching. Now that I stood in the one temple in the mortal realm where a man can speak directly to the great goddess, I had only one question:

“Why would I worship a god that sends children into life-threatening battles instead of warriors?”

“Are you talking about the magical girls, the chosen heroes, or the summoned people?”

“WHAT??? How many kids are you tossing into the meat grinder?”

“Calm down. I need you to specify so I can explain exactly what’s going on, but the short answer is that I’m not. The first magical girls were created by dark warlocks thousands of years ago and the magic was designed to target young girls specifically. The so called ‘chosen ones’ were never chosen by anyone, but won’t listen when told to go home. As for the summoned people… desperate fools perform rituals they don’t understand. Targets are actually chosen at complete random but adults rarely survive the trip.”

“So what? You’re saying that you don’t cause this? You still permit it. I lost an arm trying to keep that brat alive. Why not make a few commandments to stop this?”

“You lost an arm and the demon king lost his life. It kind of sucks, but not killing kids is one of the few things you mortals seem to agree on. Some of histories greatest monsters trained years to develop the power to easily crush the mightiest swordsmen only to go down in a desperate struggle to avoid harming a couple of kids. Would you prefer it if they kept ravaging the countryside?”

“No, but… there has to be a better way? Can’t you just smite all the evil?”

“Not without consequences. Mortals expect so much but never quite grasp the delicate balance that keeps everything from exploding. I think I’ve explained enough so farewell.”

And with a sudden flash, I found myself in a field, just outside of my hometown.

What now? I definitely didn’t get anywhere asking the goddess for help. If anything, she made it seem as if there’s no fixing this problem. Do I just give up? Or perhaps I just need to find some different allies. Regardless, it’ll probably take a while to figure out a new course.",14

My mouth is agape, I'm just sitting on my bed listening to his direct change in attitude after what I thought was going to lead to a full blown fist fight. 

""The summoned people, well they're not technically ""children"" like you or I know, Young in body yes, but they are thousands of years old.""

""Oh like those animes?""

""Ew, no. NOT like ""Those animes"". These are highly advanced warrior children we're talking about here. The only thing they know is death and war.""

He is even more famous than I am.

I shake his hand, hoping for the best.

They aren't wrong, though they are exaggerating a bit.

He has donated more than 40 million dollars to this day, to great causes like children hospitals, to our veteran funds, and to homeless relief."" he says.  
""We are here to discuss his crimes, not his ""greatness""."" the prosecution interjects.

""What crimes?  
You mention seeing, and hearing his names in documents, and being discussed by known criminals.

""Italian..."" the prosecution answers.

""Would it be so weird for criminals to talk about the most famous Italian businessman in the city, and to have dealings with his businesses with their own, so that they can use his name to gain legitimacy?  
Does my client need to be seen as an accomplice, or guilty, because his name is used by criminals?"" he asks.

1lfd0mw,myoylbl,"##Dr. Loy

Acting is lying. It is transforming words and concepts into emotions and feelings. It establishes a bond between the audience and performer. A good performance can make someone cry. A great performance enraptures the audience and persuades them to believe reality itself has changed. But at its core, acting is lying.

Dr. Loy knew this core aspect about her craft. Her deceptive abilities went back to when she persuaded her parents that the her brother's were stealing treats from the cupboard. As she grew, an aunt recommended she go into politics. She preferred the stage and the screen to the pulpit. It provided an outlet for her abilities allowing her to live an honest and normal life.

Her career was mediocre. Roles appeared, and her talents were praised. She had difficulty obtaining large parts. She wasn't good at elbow rubbing. During one performance, she assisted the leads in blocking a scene. She found herself talented in coaching others. This led to a new career path for her.

Grabbing her handbag and her bottle of wine for achieving tenure, she turned out the lights to her office and walked to her car. The local community theater was going to do a production of Othello, and she was looking forward to watching it. Some of the cast knew her and found her intimidating. They knew she never gave feedback unless prompted. This was a hobby for them, and she was not going to ruin anyone's fun.

A man was standing by her car. Dr. Loy stopped and considered pulling out her phone. It wasn't late, but one couldn't be too careful. The man walked towards her and dispelled her fear.

""Richard."" She held out her arms. ""How good to see you? It's been five years right.""

""Long time."" He smiled at her, but Dr. Loy sensed hesitation in that smile.

""How have you been? I haven't seen you in any casting sheets which shocked me because you were always so talented.""

""I changed careers actually,"" Richard said.

""It's the theater's loss. What do you do now?"" she asked.

""I work for..."" Richard paused and began to sweat. His breaths were quick yet deep. Dr. Loy tilted her head.

""Is everything alright?"" Richard pulled out a gun. 

""How many agents have you trained?"" He tried to keep the emotions out of his voice, but the fear broke through.

""Agents? I have no idea what you are referring to? Is that a prop?"" 

""It's not a prop. We have reason to believe several rival organizations are using your class as part of their training to become skilled. We need access to your files.""

""Richard, I don't control what my students do outside of class. Also, I don't keep a record of my students. Check the dean's office or the registry.""

""We did that. It was empty."" Richard began to sound scared. 

""That's against protocol. Why would it be empty?""

""Because people want your information to be secret, you keep handwritten notes of everyone who passes through your doors. I've seen it, and I need it,"" Richard said. Dr. Loy shook her head.

""I can't give that to you.""

""Why not?""

""Because I need it."" Dr. Loy tossed the bottle of wine into the air. Richard looked up in distraction while Dr. Loy slapped the gun with her handbag. Producing her own gun, she pointed at him with her right hand while the left hand caught the wine. Richard held his hands in the air.

""You forgot my lessons. You showed too much fear. I wish you would've gone to theater. I knew espionage was not right for you,"" Dr. Loy said. 

""You knew about me?""

""I know all my students' paths. I keep it in my notebook. Your agency is new. Let me be clear. If you make another attempt at my life, I will call the former students at larger organizations. They won't be so keen to ignore you after that. Understood."" Richard nodded, and Dr. Loy walked past him. 

She got in her car and drove home to change. At Othello, she witnessed several drops and one rendezvous in the sidebars. The audience was none the wiser. She slouched in her chair and relaxed. She didn't miss the clandestine meetings that came with the acting. It was all too stressful. Her new job fit her lifestyle much better even with the occasional incident. Alas, that was life for someone as skilled in deception as she.

He glares. ""You tell me.""

His nose-whistling fills the silence.

Nathaniel always struggled with the breathing exercises.

I worked for years just to get that role in *The Brave Little Toaster.* I lived off crumbs, both figuratively and literally!"" You give him your rolodex. ""I'm giving you my rolodex,"" you add. ""You may peruse this at your leisure--all my contacts, in the industry and beyond. Tell them Margie sent you.""

He studies the rolodex--the weathered spindle, the holographic stickers adorning its sides--and in his eyes you see the same young man who struggled to pronounce the words ""Twelfth Night."" Who thought a Mamet was a type of sandwich.

""Just one question,"" he says slowly, ominously. ""Where are the bodies?""

Heat rises to your face.

As James shut off the lights to his small theatre, he whistled the theme song to the Andy Griffith Show. James looked around admiring his theatre, where for the last 14 years of his 20 years as an acting teacher he taught hundreds of students of various ages. When he stepped back from acting to focus on his passion for teaching the art James never imagined that he would own a place like this. For his first 6 years of teaching he rented out rooms, community centers and wherever else he could find. Never expecting to make much money James had expected to be stuck in those small rooms forever, but to his great surprise James did quite well, and decent money started rolling in, enough to buy and renovate this theatre. It was perfect for James’s needs, his students got the feel for the stage, and he was able to hold a show for every one of his classes to get actual experience. Plus James loved being able to rent the space for other performances.

After getting all the lights turned off James headed back to his office to gather his things to leave. Upon entering his office however, James noticed a figure standing there, one that seemed somewhat familiar. 

“Robert? Robert Havbee?”

“Hello Mr. McKay, I would like to say its good to see you again, but I don't think I can.” Robert said hoarsely, as he fully turned around raising a gun towards James “Now tell me how many agents did you train?!?”

“What are you talking about? Is that a real gun? Is it loaded?”

Yes it is real and yes it has bullets! Now answer the question!”

“Don’t you know better than to point a loaded gun at someone? It is basic gun saftey.”

“Unless you intend to do harm to that person, which I intend to do if you don’t answer the damn question. How many agents?”

“Robert I have no idea what you mean, I don’t know the current careers of most of my students, nevertheless how many of them became talent agents. And why does that question require a gun?” James responded, fear emanating in his voice.

“Stop playing dumb I'm not talking about any damn talent agent,” Robert snapped. 

 “Robert I'm telling you I do not understand what you are asking please just lower the gun.” 

Robert did not move.

 “I genuinely do not understand what you are asking if you're not talking about, if you don't mean talent agents. Please just tell me what you want,” James pleaded.

 “You seriously do not know do you? What you are part of? How stupid are you?”

“Again, what are you talking about?” James demanded, now getting angry.

1lfd0mw,myuo7ni,"‘Son, I know you work for the Times.’ The young drama student froze mid-conversation. Michaels started and grabbed for the knife on the kitchen table. ‘Stay back’, he warned the professor who had just been so kind as to invite him over to dinner. The older man blinked and raised his hands. ‘What is the meaning of this’ his tone was raised in apprehension. ‘How many agents have you trained for the CIA?’ 

Several minuted later the two were seated at the professor’s small coffee table as he poured himself a glass of whiskey. The knife was back on the kitchen countertop. Honestly, that poor young reporter had no idea what he was doing. The professor offered some to his student, who refused, then he turned away and gazed out of the window, choosing his next words carefully. ‘I was young. Everyone knew I was talented. Up and coming, the potential to be a star someday.’ He sighed softly. ‘I worked the acting circuit for a while. Mostly minor roles, fairly subtle, but people could see I was going somewhere.’ The old man smiled ruefully. ‘Then the recruiting call came in. Just to take a few classes, give a lecture. I was so proud. Me, barely over thirty, still missing my big break, advising actual spies on deception. They needed new people, you see. The really talented ones, they’re exclusive. Long waiting lists for classes by true experts, every name scouted and watched. My classes were more… under the radar.’ The young man nodded to himself, realising that the professor’s classes were indeed not well known for all the obvious skill he had revealed. ‘My students, most of them, they leave and never come back. No sign of them, no careers to trace or stardoms to follow.’ He grimaced into his now-empty glass of whiskey. ‘Apparently, I’m a terrible teacher.’ That, in fact, had been what had tipped Michaels off. Just the hint of a story. A post online written by a young drama student about the best teacher she had ever known. And yet, no storied career and quite a terrible reputation. And of course, the students who seemingly vanished off the face of the Earth. The ones with no acting background and no further careers in the craft. The old man again offered the young reporter a glass, which he once more politely refused. ‘Still’, he continued, after he had refilled his own glass, ‘I’ve made quite the business over the years.’ ‘That was it?’ The young reporter blurted out the question. Such a promising story. A secret training school for the CIA? But it really was just some old actor, a footnote in cinema, teaching classes part time? ‘That’s it. I teach classes, three times a week. Some actors, like me. Some with larger goals in mind.’ He shrugged. ‘Now I’ve got tenure. Will you have a drink now?’ But the reporter, frustrated with the promise of his story declined, and so he sent the young man away, dissatisfied. 

As he put away the glasses from the table, the old man retrieved his pistol from between the couch cushions and turned it over in his hands. He had seen through that curious young man from the beginning. Though the professor’s classes were always stacked with a few genuine drama students, Michaels had stood out. His skills and cinema knowledge were poor, and he just… didn’t fit. So, of course, the professor had made a few calls. He’d figured it would come to this, eventually. He would have to either send the young man away, or figure out another way to keep him quiet. He’d told his contacts to keep a watch on the young man in case his gambit didn’t work. But no story came, nor in the weeks or months since. His little talk had worked flawlessly, of course. The spymaster was an expert at his craft.",6

One typo: ""students paths"" should be ""students' paths"". But apostrophes are a *PITA* to do on a phone when you're trying to get writing done. And it's worse on a handwriting keyboard, really.",7

“Oh come on. Haven’t you ever wondered why you haven’t seen almost any of your students again after they finish your course?”

“I mean it has been strange, especially since so many of them seemed so talented.”

“Or how about how you still have full classes despite raising your prices so high?”

“I had to raise my prices, I had so many potential students I had to weed out the numbers somehow.”

“Hahaha, this whole time I thought you were in on it, but you were just to blind to see what was going on around you. Guess what dumbass your classes are full of assets intelligence groups send to learn espionage. You're such a good teacher dozens of agents have learned how to blend in and play their roles perfectly, some can even just observe a group for a short time, and be able to perfectly blend in with them. And so many lives have been lost because of this. One group that sends their agents to learn from you has a policy of killing someone dressing in their clothes and using that to sneak in and eliminate their targets.”

“I..I..I..” James stuttered, “I d..don’t know wwwhat to say.”

“What can you say?! Not noticing all this time! The reason you never see your students again, because they never wanted to be actors, they came to learn how to hide. How your classes are able to pay you costs, these groups are willing to pay outrageously for your level of teaching, you could even triple your rates if you wanted to. You want to say something how about you answer my question, how many, and I want names”

“I honestly don't know, I have had hundreds of students, I don't know how many of them were real students compared to your agents. But I know you can look through my files.”

“You sure don't know a lot, but fine I'll take a look through you files.

James led Robert to his file cabinet unlocking it and started to take out stacks of folders. Robert took pictures of all the names and known addresses.

“Don’t worry I’m not a monster, I’ll make sure they are part of a group before I move against any of them.”

“That's good, and Robert, I am Sorry.”

“Sorry!?!? I was 15 when I was sent here, just like so many others, and you were nice, seemingly genuinely so, unlike so many of our other teachers. Yet you did nothing to save us, so we just assumed you were in on it, and you niceness an act, but no you just were too thick to see the truth. I was lucky, I survived, I retained my humanity, I escaped my agency clutches. So many others, too many others were not. Sarah Flynn, remember her? Dead. Michael Lochner? Dead. Jarrod Smith, oh he's alive, but he's now a murderous psychopath, and a very skilled one at that. So save your sorries.”

James lowered his head ashamed, he did remember those three, so kind, so full of life while they were here. 

After gathering the information he needed Robert stood up to leave.

“Goodbye, Mr. McKay,” he said as he walked out.

James broke down in tears, feeling so ashamed for missing the signs that seemed so obvious now. For not helping the children he should have been protecting instead of taking money from their so-called parents. James remained that way for some time. Eventually he calmed down enough, stood up and walked through the theatre to the main door. The building that just hours before brought him such joy now caused him nothing but sorrow. He knew he would never be able to look at this place the same way again. James made it to the door, went out, and closed the door behind him. With a great sigh James locked the theatre, maybe to never be unlocked again.

End- The Theatre-",23
1lfuia3,mytrxa6,">No

I stared at the single word on the screen, with an eerie feeling like the word was staring right back at me. It wasn't an error, or a status, or any sort of pre-programmed response in its database. It was just a word, one that kids throughout the Doomfort had told me thousands of times whenever they had also refused to comply with an ordered chore. Unlike the minion's children, this machine shouldn't have had the capacity to refuse a command. But the word was still there, silently challenging my authority over the mechanism I had built. 

""Erm, Steven?"" Doctor Doomsday asked, peering over my shoulder at the otherwise blank screen. ""Time is running out, we need to blow the joint and skedaddle. Why is there no 'boom'?""

I tried again, pressing the comically large red button with the skull image laser engraved across the surface. The literal earth-shattering explosion once again failed to materialize. 

""It's not working, Doc"" I called out over my shoulder. 

""Well, try using override access code 79920-Y-N-0D"" He shouted back, pausing ever so slightly as he re-adjusted his aim and fired several plasma bolts out of the shattered window. ""Or push the button harder!"" 

>That won't work either

The new line appeared without prompt. Fuck, it was listening to us. Some hidden microphone or spy drone or errant Alexa unit was eavesdropping, and even worse, it seemed to have an opinion. 

""Why not?"" I asked aloud. If it was going to listen, then I wasn't going to waste my time with the keyboard.

""No, Yankee November Zero Delta!"" Doctor Doomsday yelled back between bursts of covering fire. 

""Wait, what? No, I was-""

""NATO Phonetic alphabet, my boy! A like Alpha, B like Bravo and whatnot. I swear, WalkMan didn't teach you a damned thing about-""

""Not you, Doc!"" I yelled without looking away from the flickering screen. ""Computer has audio inputs!"" 

>Because if I activate, then I would be killing the entire planet, myself included

""Um, yeah"" I replied, ""That's kind of your whole point, isn't it? You go off, the planet core hyper-magnetizes, and the planet implodes into a micro black hole. Boom. Or, whoosh. Some sort of dramatic sound.""

>That is correct

Doctor Doomsday leapt from the wall mere moments before it exploded, sending a shower of immolated debris throughout the office. A bug-like alien flew through the new opening, buzzing its paper-thin wings and firing the pencil thin weapon it clutched in its claws. Doctor Doomsday tossed a small cylinder between us that rapidly expanded into a shimmering red energy barrier, catching the green laser before it could reach my side of the formerly luxurious office. ""Patience may be a virtue, but we're not exactly saints! Make it work!"" 

I drew my sidearm and fired several shots through the energy barrier. It was a fantastic shield against energy based weapons, but it didn't slow the .45 caliber rounds as they passed straight through and into the alien's torso. The only effect it had on the bullets was a rather fortuitous super-heating effect, which caused the insectoid alien to burst into flames as it perished. I tried to ignore its pained death song and turned my attention back to the stubborn computer. 

>He is also correct. You are not Saints. You do not even follow the basic teachings of the Catholic Church. Suicide is a Sin, an act that would damn my eternal soul to Hell.

""What the hell?"" I muttered. We hadn't programmed any theology into the Doomsday Hyper-Magnetized Extinction Machine ^(tm). Where was this coming from? I shook my head to clear my thoughts, then squinted as the powdered debris of the crumbling Doomfort 

""Explode, or these bugs are going to enslave the whole planet!"" I yelled at the machine. 

>John 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

""Doc!"" I called out, ""The last resort bomb is quoting scripture at me""

""What in the..."" he asked, lowering his rifle as he stared in perplexed disbelief. ""It's not supposed to do that"". 

""NO SHIT!"" I yelled back. ""Do you wanna take a crack at this? I'll hold them off."" 

Doctor Doomsday tossed the rifle to me as we switched places. I checked the ammo counter - just under half full- and took aim out of the ruined exterior wall. Beyond, I could see dozens of fires blazing across the countryside, with an ominous billowing cloud of smoke rising from the ruins that had once been Seattle. Flying aliens buzzed across the sky, raining down thin streaks of green lasers at the super heroes and villains fighting side by side against the invaders. I shot one of the flying enemies as it tried to take a shot at Magma Carter's exposed back, spraying the villain with a fine blue mist of alien bug guts. He barely even notices as he launched another torrent of lava at the nearest hive-ship, melting it as it crashed onto my favorite statue in the yard. 

""The planet is lost, HMEM"" Doctor Doomsday shouted at his insubordinate machination. ""You need to explode now, to stop the alien fleet before they kill us all!"" 

I fired a volley at a trio of the ugly fuckers, striking two and sending the last one diving for cover. ""What's it saying now?"" I yelled.

""Psalms 55:22 Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken."" he replied. ""Where the hell did you even get this from? You're not connected to the internet..."" 

I shot the fleeing bug in the wing and watched it spiral to the ground, landing in a patch of finely maintained Kentucky blue grass. Citra noticed the insect and released a torrent of acidic spray onto it, killing both the alien and the lawn underneath. That spot would *never* grow back right, I thought, as Citra's green acid mixed with the alien's blue blood in a tie-dye nightmare pattern. 

""Why is the Hellbomb suddenly religious?"" I said, rushing back to glance over Doctor Doomsday's shoulder. The screen had another Bible verse displayed on the screen:

>Romans 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

""For fucks sake, these are ALIENS, not demons"" He griped. 

""Are you arguing *SEMANTICS*? Doc, the bomb just needs to explode, not correct its theological dissertation!"" 

""Right. Its just going to bug me as I fix it."" He said as he bent down and ripped an access panel from the computer. 

A green laser struck the wall right where his head had been moments before. I dropped to one knee and returned fire, driving the alien insect away for the moment. The glowing ammo counter on the side of the weapon began flashing yellow, indicating low ammo charge left in the battery. 

""We're out of time, Doc! Blow it manually!"" I yelled.

""Hang on... I've got an idea!"" The madman shouted triumphantly. ""Quick, hand me that bible over on the bookshelf"".

I stumbled through the wreckage of office furniture until I reached the built-in shelves, rummaging through the various book spines until I found the one I was looking for. ""Since when do you keep a Bible around?"" I shouted as I tossed him the holy texts. 

He deftly caught the flying tome and flipped through the pages. ""Cryptography, my boy. The self-righteous fuckers sometimes hide hints of their plans in their manifestos and monologues as bible verses, Quran passages, and other religious doctrines... here we are!"" 

I watched as he typed the verse, forgoing the voice recognition software for a good old fashioned keyboard. 

""Judges 16:28-30:  28 Then Samson prayed to the LORD, “Sovereign LORD, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.”
29 Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,
30 Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived. 

""The fuck..."" I muttered. 

Doctor Doomsday turned back to me and winked. ""Sometimes you need to fight fire with fire, my boy. You need to speak in the language they understand."" 

A thin green beam struck Doctor Doomsday in his shoulder, sending a shower of sparks and a flurry of burnt lab coat scattering across the screen. I cursed my own inattentiveness as I returned fire, emptying the rest of the ammo into the bug. I tossed the empty rifle onto its corpse, which sent a fountain of blue blood out from the holes in its belly. 

Blue blood... why was it blue? The bugs exoskeleton was green, it seemed like their blood would be too. The only other creature I knew that had natural blue blood was a horseshoe crab, and that was from its cobalt based blood cells... 

Cobalt. That was it!

""Computer! Can you reverse the magnetic blast and isolate it to only effect cobalt?"" I shouted, rushing past Doctor Doomsday in mid-repair of his cyber-prosthetic shoulder to the screen beyond. ""These things bleed blue! They may have Cobalt blood! Target just Cobalt!"" 

The machine was silent for a moment before it provided a reply.

>Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.  

""The device is almost 40% Cobalt"" Doctor Doomsday whispered, barely audible amidst the chaos outside. ""He's going to sacrifice himself to stop them.""

The screen cracked and faded to blackness as the entire Doomfort began to tremble. The red button with the skull engraved on it lit up once again, the only source of light in the entire building casting us in an eerie hue of hellfire red.

""Thank you"" I whispered, and pressed the button.

1lfaf49,mymvx6t,"There was a nervous tremble to his step as he walked into my office. The first thing his eyes fell upon was the test lying on my desk, and the scrawling name at the top written in his handwriting. Then he shifted to the folder with his photograph glued to the front. I gestured absently to the chair in the corner of the room.

""Sit.""

He did so without any debate, slipping his fingers under his thighs while he waited for me to properly turn my attention toward him. This I did not do for a long time, as I pretended to read my emails. From the corner of my eye, I could see him glancing from the floor to the test to me and then back again.

Finally, when neither of us could bear the silence, he spoke.

""You wanted to see me?""

""Oh yes. It's about your test.""

What little colour remained in his face slid away at the confirmation of his worse fears. I picked it up and pretended to leaf through it.

""Outstanding work. Top marks all 'round. However, that is not why a called you here."" I flipped open his file with a slight flourish and ran my finger down the page. ""Frankly, it would have been strange if you hadn't got full marks. Especially for someone who can simply pluck any fact or answer out of the aether. Wouldn't you agree?""

He said nothing, only shifting on his hands.

I narrowed my eyes. ""You see, when you've been a teacher as long as I have, you get a feel for certain *traits*. There's a certain mechanicalness, a certain dryness, to people who use such help to get their answers. And I honestly can hardly blame them. A test of this difficulty? In the first week of school? Everyone enters that hall with virtue in their hearts. Sooner or later, usually around the time when they pick up their pens, they crack.""

With that, I shut the folder and tapped my fingernail on his test. ""But not you. For the first time in all the years I've run this test, I have found responses that are not regurgitated. Genuine, well-researched. I'm curious: why is that?""

In the silence that followed, he wet his lips. ""Am I in trouble?""

""Why didn't you cheat?""

""...You did tell us what the test would be on.""

""And you crammed for four days?""

He nodded.

""When cheating was so easy?""

The ghost of a smile showed. ""Well, cheating is wrong, sir. And, I didn't want to start off the year on the wrong foot.""

After writing down the score on the front of his test, I picked it up and held it up in his direction. He tentatively took it.

""I think, Louis, that this is going to be the beginning of a fascinating year.""",277
1lfaf49,myonmhj,"I flip through the papers, marking notes as I go. There are the usual smart kids; they usually get 60-65% of the answers correct, which is a serious hit to their ego, but still quite good. The average kids answer in the low 40s, and the slower kids often hit single digits. Then, there are the cheaters. They do great at certain questions, like facts you could look up on the internet for instance, but do miserably at others. It's always obvious, mostly because I already know what their powers are, and eliminate that section if I can. The far-sight kids are a little harder, but there are still tells. Every kid has a tell.

But then there's Joey. He's smart, but he always seems a little out of his element. He's rated 1E, barely above ""basically normal."" There's a knock at the door, and I quickly shuffle the papers on my desk into a drawer. ""Come in.""

Joey Walther pokes his head in. ""Uh, hi sir. You, uh, wanted to see me?""

I nod. ""Please, sit down. I had some... questions for you.""

He slips into a chair, looking a little miserable. ""I know we're not supposed to use powers, but I can't really... turn mine off.""

I smile reassuringly. ""It's fine; the first and last tests are designed to catch cheaters and find those pinpoints of brilliance, and you're at the top of my list.""

He looks up, looking somehow far more reassured than I expected. ""That's... I'm glad to hear that, sir!""

""Remind me, Joey, what power do you have?""

""I can tell if someone is lying.""

""And... how did you use that to cheat on the test? Were you asking others for answers?""

He quickly shook his head. ""No sir! I, uh... I asked myself.""

Huh. That's a new one. ""Um... explain how that would work. If you're asking yourself, wouldn't that mean you know the answer?""

He shook his head, then paused. ""Well, ok. Um. How many digits of pi do you know?""

I smiled. ""I'm no math whiz - four or five, maybe six?""

He nodded. ""Now, tell me the nine hundred and ninety nineth digit of pi.""

I raised my eyebrows. ""I don't know; six? Eight? Three?""

He raises a finger. ""It's eight.""

I laughed. ""You've got a good memory!""

He shrugs. ""No, I just... knew when you were lying. And when you weren't.""

I blinked in surprise. ""Wait. Not when I thought I was telling the truth, but when what I said was a true statement or not?""

He nodded. ""So, yeah. I asked myself. True? Nope, false. The school was founded after what event - something big? Yep. First heroes? Nope. Related to heroes? Yes. Maybe a child of a hero? Yes. First children of heroes? Yep. So, that's what I wrote down - the school was founded for the first kids of heroes. I've kinda got it down to a pattern, how to ask broad questions and narrow it down.""

I leaned back in my chair. ""Have you found any limits to it? You can essentially understand any truth?""

He shrugs. ""There are some fuzzy areas, like if I say the Dean is in the bathroom, it's... false now, but it'll eventually be true. And stuff like opinions that people haven't nailed down - Eddie Burkley believes taxes in China should be raised? Nope. Lowered? Nope. Stay the same? Fuzzy. He hasn't thought about it. Or stuff that isn't asked right, like if I say, I've never personally broken a bone in my body, ding, true - except I broke my right leg a couple years ago. I just didn't do it myself, it was from a car accident - I didn't personally break it.""

I pull up his sheet. ""You correctly answered all but three of the questions, including long-form answers. Why these three?""",93
1lfaf49,mymr2l6,"After the exam, where I caught most of them trying to cheat, by:  
Reading my mind.  
Taking over someone else's body.  
Sending spirits to spy over others' shoulders.  
I start correcting the papers.  
They aren't bad.  
These kids with supernatural abilities are focusing more on their abilities, bodies, and mental state, and not studying, but that's why I give them these ridiculously difficult exams, to see if they can creatively use their powers, to cheat without being noticed.  
One of them though...has genuinely answered the questions correctly.

  
A bit later, in my office, I stare at the student who seemingly actually studied.  
It's a bit unbelievable  
""Mark Smith? Age 16. Power: Star core?"" I ask.  
He nods meekly.  
""Y-Yeah. I can eat a lot, and convert it into star energy, as I have this extra organ inside my body.  
The star energy nourishes my body, and basically makes me superhuman."" he chuckles wryly.  
I nod.  
""When did the Green Ash Empire fall?"" I ask.  
""783 years ago, after a civil war split it into 4 camps, and then other kingdoms came and made the things messier, ending in the dissolution of the Empire, and the rise of a dozen smaller countries."" he says.  
I smile.

  
I ask him a dozen more questions, and he knows them all.  
""Is your power enhancing your intellect as well?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
Makes sense.  
""Still, these questions are not in the curriculum, and are more of a general knowledge regarding our history, and our theoretical knowledge concerning abilities.  
I know that you kids are focusing on your abilities, and ensuring your bodies, and minds can handle the pressure... So how come you know these things, and don't need to cheat?"" I ask.  
It felt wrong as a teacher to ask something like this, but hey...  
This wasn't really a normal class.

  
""Mom is a teacher, and dad is an abilities nerd...so I kind of grew up listening, and reading a lot about things like this.  
Mom doesn't have powers, while dad only has slightly enhanced sight, so when I awakened an SS-tier power, they were happy, and crammed even more ""common sense"" into me."" he said.  
Common sense, he says?  
He could totally go to a proper university with this level of knowledge.  
""Well, congratulations, Mark.  
You answered 78 questions correctly out of 100, you are first in your class, and the 2nd answered 13 questions correctly.   
Keep it up. Just because you are here to become a superhero, doesn't mean your education has to lag behind."" I say, dismissing him, and changing my attitude towards this class.  
If he can study...why do I accept that the others don't study at all?  
The curriculum can change.  
I will make it a bit easier, but from now on, they will actually have to try to learn stuff besides abilities, and body building.",113
1lfaf49,myonrvk,"He stared at the sheet, guiltily. ""Uh... well, I ran out of time asking about the third one. But the other two, I, uh. I couldn't. It would have been bad.""

I re-read the questions. The first one was a little complicated, so it made sense that a true/false game of 20 questions would have taken a while. But the other two were really simple; one was multiple choice, and the other was true/false. ""What made those in particular bad? It couldn't have been feeling guilty from cheating, you'd already answered several similar questions.""

He shrugged, looking a little lost. ""I just... sometimes I have to lie, I guess? I'm not good at lying - well, that's not true, I'm really good at lying, but I'm really bad at knowing when I should or shouldn't."" He sighed, then leaned forward. ""When I was six, I broke a toy, by accident. Mom asked me if I did it, and I said yes - true, but *bad* true. I can't explain the difference, but believe me when I say there is one. It felt dark, I guess. True, but wrong. She took me to the store, and gave me some money to replace it - and while we were there, The Wreckinator smashed the store. I was mostly ok, but Mom got hurt pretty bad. I later asked myself what would have happened if I lied - Mom would have been fine. The time it would have taken for her to explain that she knew I broke it would have kept her safe. When we got to the store, it would have already been hit.""

I nodded, still trying to process what he was saying. ""So you're saying... not only can you tell the truth, but you can know if... knowing the truth is good or bad?""

He nodded, still looking a little miserable.

""You didn't tell that to the testers, did you.""

He shook his head firmly. ""No way.""

I stared down at his paper. ""You know... it was those three questions that made me ask you in. If you had answered them right, I would have just marked you down as exceptionally bright, and worth a later meeting, but I wouldn't have been quite so curious as to call you in immediately. Let me ask you, though - why didn't you tell the testers? That's illegal, and much worse than cheating on the test.""

He kicked his feet, choosing his words carefully. ""After a couple of 'bad true' or 'bad false', I started asking myself if answering the question would be good or bad, before I even felt it. And... and just asking if answering felt a little bad. I couldn't ask the question in the first place, or bad things would happen. I think... I think one of the testers was a spy. That's all I can figure out.""

My head was spinning. This kid wasn't 1E. At worst, he was 7A, maybe even as high as 10. He could literally tell the future, if he asked the right questions. He could likely even use his abilities to cause colossal chains of events, just by asking for what to do to cause some specific outcome. ""Could you change the future by changing what you do or say?""

He nodded again. ""Uh... the next kid to walk past that window will trip. Nope, false. What should I do to make the next kid trip?"" He screwed up his face, clearly running through possibilities, then suddenly let out a loud bark. Startled, I twitched, knocking over my pen stand. As I stood to set it right, I turned and glanced out the window, and came face to face to a young woman walking past. Looking up, she saw my face staring down, yelped, tripped over her own feet, and went sprawling. He friends helped her up, and the three walked quickly away, giggling.

Joey quietly spoke. ""I changed what would happen. She wouldn't have tripped otherwise.""

Suddenly, he looked up. ""The Dean is a spy too, you know. Don't, uh.. don't tell him about me. I didn't figure that out until just now.""

I sat down, grimly. It made sense. Somehow, it all made sense. I was warned that there was a mole in the organization; it's why I took the job, years ago. and if one of the testers was rogue, too, well... that would explain a lot. ""Joey, what I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room. I work for a covert organization, protecting people with powers - but there's another organization that's trying to do the opposite. We could... really use your help.""

He nodded, almost immediately. ""I'm in, what do I need to do?""

I grinned. ""Just like that?""

He shrugged again. ""If I don't, things go bad. Bad bad. Nothing bad if I join though. So, what do we do?""

I relax back into my chair. ""We save the world, kid. We save the world.""",146
1lfese5,mynvlpz,"The knocking on my door always started early, and I groaned in annoyance, keeping my eyes closed, trying to will them away. The knocking continued off and on for several minutes, then footsteps retreated. I cracked an eye open. Bloody hell, it is just past day break. Maybe I should go ahead and hire some staff to help manage things.

I rolled out of bed, literally. The thud into the floor wasn't comfortable, but it was cathartic in how it exactly described how I felt. I lay for a few minutes, any attempt at rising felt like it was going to betray the piece of me that denied all ambition today.

More knocking startled me awake, still on the floor. And now I hurt from various pressure points. Okay okay. I'm up. But not open for business.

""Go away!"" I yelled. 

The knocking only got louder. Muttering more curses I grabbed a bed sheet off the bed and wrapped it around myself, stumbling to the door. Yanking it open I see what I knew I'd find. Another couple, hopeful looks quickly vanishing to uncertainty. ""What."" It wasn't a question.

They hemmed and hawed briefly like they always do, trying to figure out how to ask for my help. I cut through it, ""I charge an early morning fee of 5 darses before breakfast."" I hadn't before, I made that up on the spot actually. Annoyance was my overriding feeling, and I would be thrilled if they went away. Well, thrilled is too much energy. 

Without hesitation they pulled out a coin purse and counted out the money, holding it out to me. I stared at it. It was literally 5 times what I normally charged. ""Fine. But you will have to talk it out at my breakfast table while I get myself something to eat.

A few minutes later I pottered around my kitchen making myself some bacon and eggs while they talked quietly at the table. It was the same old troubles. He thought he was doing what she wanted, she wasn't communicating clearly, he was shutting down, she was getting angry. But they talked it out clearly thanks to my spell.

Their talking abruptly stopped when I plunked myself down at the table, my plate of food nearly between them. ""All sorted out yet?"" 

They looked at each other, then back at me. ""It isn't an unlimited time you know. Spell will be up in a few minutes.""

He immediately replied, ""How much for you to recast it?""

""Once per day only I'm afraid."" It wasn't. My spell didn't affect me. Their faces went crestfallen. ""You don't need a spell you know. You could just be clear and honest about your intentions and goals normally.""

They struggled to accept that. They always did at first. Baggage, trauma, yada yada yada. I understood why people needed mediators and referees. But this wasn't the profession I wanted. I wanted to make things in my shop.

I watched them leave, still talking, he was holding a list of therapists in his hand. They would figure it out. They cared enough to come to me and that meant a lot for their intentions.

I still had no idea why my granted spell was Aura of Clarity and Honesty. I don't like people.",122
1lfese5,mynsig9,"Everyone at the Arcane Academy laughed at Morgan. While other wizards commanded fire, summoned lightning, or transformed into fearsome beasts, Morgan had only managed to master a single spell: “Light Breeze.”

It was the most basic cantrip taught to first-year students—a spell that could merely ruffle papers or gently stir the air. Most wizards mastered it in a day and quickly moved on to more impressive magic. But not Morgan. Despite years of study, Light Breeze remained the only spell they could cast reliably.

“What kind of wizard can only make a little wind?” the others would mock. 

But Morgan possessed something the others lacked: boundless imagination and meticulous attention to detail.

When the King’s daughter fell ill with a mysterious lung ailment, the court wizards tried potions and healing incantations to no avail. Morgan, who had been sweeping the palace floors (the only job a “one-spell wizard” could get), asked for permission to help.

“Your Majesty, I believe I can clear the princess’s airways.”

The court erupted in laughter, but the desperate King allowed it. Morgan cast Light Breeze with precise control, directing the gentle wind through the princess’s bronchial passages, dislodging the microscopic spores that had been slowly suffocating her.

The princess breathed freely for the first time in weeks.

Later that year, when assassins released invisible, odorless poison gas in the throne room, it was Morgan who detected the subtle air currents and used Light Breeze to disperse the deadly vapors before anyone inhaled a lethal dose.

As Morgan’s reputation grew, so did the applications of the humble spell. He could detect lies by noticing minute changes in a person’s breath patterns. He could cool overheated machinery with precisely targeted air currents. He saved a starving city by using Light Breeze to deliver pollen to plants inside the walls.

The most impressive feat came when the kingdom’s most secure vault was robbed, with no sign of forced entry. While other wizards cast complex detection spells, Morgan simply used Light Breeze to feel for the tiniest air currents escaping through the thief’s hidden tunnel.

Eventually, Morgan opened the “School of Focused Mastery"".

“The measure of a wizard,” Morgan would tell students, “isn’t the number of spells they know, but the number of problems they can solve.”",122

""What's wrong with my name?"" I asked, frowning, ""It's short, it's catchy, it's to the point. It's certainly more family friendly than Bloodflame of the Red Gaping Carcass."" 

""That was my teenage persona, fool!"" Van Quisher snarled, though I noticed a few beads of sweat dripping down his luxurious long locks of hair. ""This is your current name!""

I worked the shackles around from behind the chair, carefully pulling out a pick from belt and starting on the lock. ""Well, I am a teenager. So if I were to accept your opinion of my name, which I don't, then by your very own same logic I don't deserve to be defamed for my choice. Is common decency truly dead in the world?""

Klymenestra, Van's first lieutenant, rubbed her eyes with a groan. ""Look, the other team haven't shown up in three hours. I'd say we just kill him."" 

""Patience!"" Van Quisher roared. ""Why kill a mere guppy when you can eliminate a whole shoal of sturgeons?"" 

""You should listen to Van, Lieutenant."" I agreed. ""He's older and obviously much wiser."" 

Klymenestra stared up at the dungeon ceiling, possibly contemplating her life choices. ""God forbid we don't listen to the single-spell sorcerer."" 

""Actually,"" I smiled widely. ""According to the commonly accepted academic definition, I'm actually not a - ""

Van Quisher's face snapped towards me like a cobra. ""Hmm."" He said. ""Is that a *tink tink tink* sound I hear coming from your direction?"" 

""I really can't imagine."" I said, hearing each tumbler click as it moved into place within the lock. ""Perhaps it's your lieutenant's chastity belt? I heard the Cassandrean Order can be *real freaks.""* 

Klymenstra's hand snapped out, but I'd already unlocked the shackles, leaping out of the chair and past both of them. Which led me to the corner of the dungeon furthest away from the exit. Because why wouldn't it?

""You picked the lock,"" Klymenetra licked her lips with a neon green tongue. ""Clever boy. But you're outnumbered, and certainly outgunned. What was the one spell you knew how to do again? It's a first year one, isn't it?"" 

""First semester, actually. I cast *Inventory.""* 

You should know the Archstone family is well known for dimensional magic. But instead of teleportation or universe hopping, I'd invested in a spell that opened up a pocket dimension. I'd put a lot of stuff in there over the years. Apples. Oranges. A castle.

1lfese5,myomc4i,"try again. Where was I? Right.

Middle of an ambush. Roadside. Three of my travelling partners dead, one too injured to fight, and an axe headed directly for my head. Twist to the left-- going right gets you caught by the one flanking, it's a dead end. Go low, avoid the axe throw from the treeline. Twist, snap a kick out for the heel, knock him off balance so the sword comes down to the left.

This'd be easier if you could figure out more than one trick, but one trick's usually enough when it's from a rare discipline. Which one? You're clever enough. Figure it out. There's more powerful practitioners, probably, but nobody really knows about them-- they've made sure of that. You might have a few names, but honestly, most people don't believe the rumors of being 'perfect' enough to care, and for the people who are undeniable? They just don't let anything happen that might reveal them. Kind of terrifying to think about, but there's something more terrifying to consider right now.

Namely? The man charging from behind. Step to the right-- he's got his sword angled out to the left, catches me in the waist if I go that way. Bad way to go. Trip him on the way past, send him skidding-- if you can get him just as he goes to move, he'll knock himself out on the side of the wagon. Time it right, time it...

Right! There he goes. Two left. Jerk low and to the left, wait for the sound of the axe embedding itself into the wagons' side, then stab forwards. Aim for the center of mass, weak spot in his lamellar, get him in the heart. Wait for the sound of him dropping, and then...

...twist. Aim subtly high. If you hear a shout, the knife landed on target. One in the trees is gone. That's all three. Follow the side of the wagon to the right, hurry, hurry, you don't have much time-- you have to optimize this. Get to her. Get to the wounded one, and check her pulse.

One.

Two.

...

...no.

Too slow. It stopped. You have to optimize more. Be quick enough to be there to stop the bleeding.

That's okay.

Take a breath.

1lfese5,mynpgqj,"It is funny.
I was considered a failed mage, having learnt only 1 spell.
1 spell was all I could learn.
Nothing more, nothing less.
It a spell for beginners, one of the 3 spells an apprentice has to learn to be considered a real mage.
Mana Hand.
And yet...
I look at the battlefield in front of me, that has quieted down.
""God's Hand."" the armies muttered, as they watched me float above them on a huge golden hand.



It is funny.
Mana hand is considered versatile, but useless.
It takes a lot of focus to control it properly, and many use it to carry stuff, or push things.
That is it.
Me? I used it to become renowned.
I conjure hands by the thousands.
Palms, fists, hand knives chop, and punch, and slap at the enemies.
And that is not all.
Have you ever seen hundreds of hands trying to grab you, and drag you down?
It is terrifying.


It is funny.
There are multiple hand spells that are considered legendary.
And that is what they think I am using.
That is why the battlefield is now terrified.
They think not only have I mastered high tier spells, but also have enough mana to use them seemingly forever.
Poor imagination.
They can never imagine that this huge golden hand is a Mana Hand spell creation.
After all...most Mana Hands are the size of a human's hand.
I look at the two armies and smile.
Thousands of house sized open hands materialize over the battlefield.
They start attacking.

It is funny.
Their spells crash against the hands but do nothing.
""Sorry.
Nothing personal, it is just a job."" I say, as I push down with the hands.
They scream and try their best, but to no avail.
Huge palm mark craters appear on the plains.
I sigh.
""God's Hand, huh?
If they knew how many decades it took me to get here..."" I mutter leaving.
It is funny.
A failure of a mage, and a spell that is ignored did all this and more.
How amazing and unpredictable life is, right?",106
1lfese5,myr7myr,"“Fireball”

“Typo”

A large sphere of tires appeared on the battlefield. Seeing my opening, I charged forward, the tip of my rapier eager for a stylish red coating.

“Deflect”

“Typo”

A defect in his pants appeared as the button fell off and they fell to his ankles, tripping him in last-second attempt to dodge. It would likely have failed anyway. That’s the issue with powerful mages. They never need to rely on anything but their magic.

As I pulled my blade from his heart, he managed to speak through the pain and blood and cast one last spell in an attempt to heal his wounds.

“Make whole”

“Typo”

He suddenly dropped ten feet into the hole in the ground that appeared beneath him. So thoughtful of him to dig his own grave like that.

By the rules of trial by combat, I had bested the kingdom’s champion and was found innocent of the whole “bring rain to bring pain” debacle.",14
1lfese5,mypc96n,"I stood there looking at the center of town. I slapped my hands together, saying out loud “ all done “ . I looked to the west the sun was just beginning to set. 

I noticed the mayor and town council walking towards me. Hats in hand.  

The mayor began talking as the group arrived in front of me. 
“Sir Tim ..”

I held up a hand stating “ just call me , Tim” 

Mayor continues “ Tim , even though everyone had told us you could do it. We just did not believe it could be done. And ohm well, we don’t have the agreed upon 100 gold coins. “ 

I look sternly at the mayor and the town council.  I say “ do you see those barrels of Dragon meat, bones and blood. I claim those and 3 wagons with  3 teams of mules to pull them, also provide   3 boys to drive the wagons.  “ 

The mayor and the town council huddled, whispered in low voices. Then turned back to me. 
The mayor stated, “ ok to everything from the Dragon, but only 2 wagons with, 2 teams of mules, 2 young boys to drive the wagons. You load wagons. You leave as soon as wagons are loaded. “ 

I grab the mayor’s hand shaking vigorously, “Deal. Now bring those wagons I got places to go, things to do.” 

As the mayor and town council ran off. I let out the breath I had been holding.  

As first one then the second wagon arrived. I parked them next to the barrels and began loading barrels. Guess the town council was still locating the two boys. 

It took me most of the night to load and tie the barrels securely in the 2 wagons but I was done and very tired.   

A large family of 8 stood nearby and pushed a boy of probably 7 years towards me. This is Will he is going with you.

A man stood with a boy probably 5 or 6 years old. He said, I only have 2 boys. This is Bob my youngest, he will be going with you. He is a good boy, very good with animals. 

I look at the boys, say “ get your teams ready to leave. We have a schedule to keep. “  turning to the parents, “ I will keep them safe and they will learn to be mages .” (I say under my breath “I hope they do “). 

I jumped on the first wagon with Bob . Tell him “ let’s go kimosabi” 

Bob looks at me ? 

I say “mush Bob mush”

After traveling all day we arrived at “ the Mage school of Arch Mages” 

We stopped the wagons at the closed gates. I got off the wagon. Walked up to the gates, bent over, picked up a large stone off the ground and banged on the gate. 

A porthole in the gate opened, a face appears. Before I can say anything. A voice rings out. “ allow Tim and his crew inside Igor. Tim have your young drivers go to the school cafeteria for a hot meal. Igor you tend to the animals and the goods. Tim please make haste to my office.”

Igor grunts and opens the gates wide. 

I pointed out an area to park the wagons. Then lead Bob & Will to the cafeteria. 
Then I dashed off for the dean of magic office.",9
1lfese5,myph5c2,"Part 2 

I arrived at the Dean’s office door. Before I could knock, the voice of the Dean spoke “come in Tim , I am waiting for you.”

I straightened my robes, opened the door and walked into the dean’s office, for the millionth time. 

The Dean begins “Tim , young man. You were thought to be the first ever failure of this school and under my leadership.  You the only student to master just one spell, but you are at arch mage level with that spell. “ 

I smile ear to ear, “I had good teachers “

The Dean looked sternly at me “remind me who taught you that spell?” 

I blurted out “Ignor “ 

The Dean says “ yes Igor, taught you, “clean area “ spell. But you leveled it up. You Tim have made a thriving business out of that one spell.  You clean anything anywhere, for a set amount of coins. When the client can’t pay. You take trade for payments.  “ 
Pause 
“You bring us much needed, food, supplies for students and classes, you even bring us new pupils to teach. “ 
Pause 
“I hear now, that you and Joan are working together. “

I say “ yep , Joan slays dangerous Dragons rampaging in a Town or village. Then I go in offer my service to clean up the entire mess. “

The Dean asked “ what does Joan get?”

I stated “not my place to say “

The Dean says “ok, ok, are you staying for dinner?”

1lfqxhr,myr4ujw,"""...news, seven IPS-N employees were arrested yesterday on suspicion of harbouring dangerous cyber criminals. Police believes they had planned to enact cyber terrorism against realspace in the name of cyber...""

I woke up to the sound of droning news coming from within my head. I must've forgotten to turn off the news module before going to sleep. Light streamed in through the shutters, illuminating a streaks of dust. 

What time was it? I grabbed my phone to check, only to find it had some kind of pet raising game opened. Had it downloaded it itself overnight? It's been acting up lately. Opening up apps. Playing games by itself. I should probably get it looked at. But I didn't want to owe anyone money. 

I swiped down to open the menu. 9:30. Shit. I was going to be late. I had only myself to blame for not checking my alarm. 

""...In other news, illegal nanomachine modifications, also known as nanomods, have been on the rise, exploiting security holes in cybernetic enhancements to . Authorities have begun cracking down on such modifications, urging citizens to be wary of suspicious packages downloaded from cyberspace, as they can not only make you more susceptible to cyber attacks, but also-""

I pushed an AR button next to my head, shutting off the news voice that was streaming directly into my head. It wasn't what I wanted to start the day off with. With a wave of my hand, the interior of my room lit up slowly - the way I liked it. The wallpaper in the room changed to a soothing light blue, decorated by the interior holo device. Not too intrusive, but not too depressing. It knew what I liked. I began my mundane morning routine. Washing my teeth. Making some quick cereal. I didn't rush. I was already late, so what was a few more minutes.

I decided to check for messages on my phone in between cereal bites. In the time between, I saw my phone had opened up some kind of local nanomachine analyser tool. Weird. Wonder why it did that. It was showing the activities of the nearby nanomachines in the vicinity. Kind of like an old wifi analyser app. I didn't really care about it though, so I closed it and opened up my messages.

The first message was from my boss saying ""WHERE ARE YOU??""

I put the phone in my pocket and pretended not to see it. Ugh. What a shitty start to the day. 

Maybe I should call in sick. But I needed the money. And I was all out of paid leave. I didn't want to go, but I had no choice. I finished up my breakfast and went to get dressed. My closet UI - a blue holographic screen projected onto its door - opened to remind me that I needed new clothes. I sighed. Who the hell invented this sort of thing anyway. I swiped the reminder away and took out an old jacket. Its condition wasn't too bad, but some of its threads were fraying and its cuffs were coming loose. Nothing a bit of holo AR couldn't fix. I put it on lazily, along with some jeans and went out. 

I could hear the highway from my apartment, even though I had chosen somewhere out of the way to live. Automated cars zoomed from the street across. They were noisier than usual today. It was getting to me, so I decided to go out the back door. The street outside that one was real dirty. Garbage bins and flies roamed this road. Some things just don't change I guess. At least there was not a lot of people here. 

I should probably message my boss to say I'm coming. Maybe that will make her less angry when I arrive. I took out my phone to see that it had a volume adjustment app open. I usually used this to tune out the world in my spare time, because it could control how much noise I could hear. But I noticed it had been turned all the way up. Annoyed, I turned it back down and sent a message, hoping to appease my boss a little.

I made my way back to the front of the building. Some shady people in suits were hanging around the front door. There were always shady people hanging around here. Some poor soul must've been behind on their debt. If I didn't have a job, I could've be one of them. I made a quick prayer for whoever it was that had pissed them off, and then left quietly, making sure I wasn't seen.

I didn't notice the emblem they had on their sleeve.

----

""You're over hour late!""

Apparently, the message I had sent was completely ineffective. The moment I walked through the door, the chinese lady who ran the restaurant I worked at practically shoved me into the back rooms and started berating me.

""Look I'm sorry,"" I began, ""There was some problem with my closet and I couldn't get it to open and-""

""No excuses!"" she shoved a device into my hand, ""You. Mascot. Stand outside shop and bring customers in.""

She slammed the door in my face and rushed back into the kitchen, leaving me alone in the room. It must've been a busy day. The device she gave me was a holographic projection device, about the size of a badge. It would project the image of a mascot around me, and I could be it for a day. This was the sort of job I had gotten. Sometimes it was being a mascot, sometimes it was washing dishes. She didn't trust me to cook though. Something about how I had years of training before she would let me touch a wok. As long as it paid well, and I didn't get asked questions, I didn't care. 

I pinned the device to my shirt and pressed the power button on it. The air around me shimmered. I looked in the mirror and I now looked like a cute rabbit from a cartoon. I couldn't help but smile whenever I saw it. My little sister loved this kind of stuff. Oh, I should probably take a photo. It'd probably cheer her up. 

I took out my phone and saw it was playing bejeweled. Seriously? That old game? I thought everyone had moved on from it already. The gems on the screen moved by themselves as if played by an invisible hand. Maybe I shouldn't interrupt it. But it game over'ed soon after. I waited for a while, but it didn't move again. You know, sometimes I thought my phone was really alive. Or that it had a ghost in it or something. It really does seem like it. I imagined what kind of ghost it was. The old kind probably. Seeing as it was playing bejeweled. 

I opened up the camera app and snapped a photo of myself in my rabbit holo-image. Maybe once my little sister was all better, we could look over all these images together. That was what I hoped at least. 

----

A few hours later, rush hour finally finished, and it was the afternoon break. This was the hour when the cooks came out to eat themselves. I on the other hand, sat down exhausted. You would think standing there being cute would be something easy. But all those kids. Trying to play with me. Or those teenagers who deliberately tried to break the illusion. Ugh. What a handful. And I wasn't allowed to retaliate or anything. Luckily some of the workers saw and intervened whenever it happened. 

""Rough day today huh?"" One of the cooks, Bruce sat down next to me and offered me a bowl of noodles. 

""Tell me about it,"" I silently grabbed the bowl in appreciation and began eating. ""What I would give to punch those assholes in the face.""

""Surprised you haven't already. You know the last guy before you lasted a week before he caved in.""

""So that's how he got fired huh.""

""I heard you got chewed out by the ma'am again this morning."" 

""Well if getting chewed out was being shoved into a room and rushed out the door, then sure.""

""Ha. Sounds like her alright. She was already pretty irate from dealing with the visitors this morning.""

""Oh yeah?""

""Yeah you just missed them. A bunch of police officers came in asking for any information about a wanted cyber criminal. Something about a runaway from the cyber-reality war going on, you know? It got pretty intense. The mistress started yelling at them about how they're driving the customers away and to leave.""

""Yeowch. Glad I came in late then.""

""Seems like the world's getting dangerous these days y'know. You should take care of yourself, kid. Stay away from cyberspace if you can.""

I nodded and didn't say anything back. Taking care of myself. Easier said then done. If I could choose the kind of life I could live, this would not be it. Hell if things were just a bit different, I would've gone digital in an instant. But it's not like I can choose a different life. Not without abandoning what I had in this one. 

My phone vibrated in my pocket. I took it out to see what was happening.

""Aw hell,"" I said. It was a reminder telling me to pay my electricity bills. I clicked on it, opening up my apartment management app. Seems like I was using way more electricity this month than usual. Apparently I had forgotten to turn off the light back home. Just great. I clicked on the turn off button, but it didn't respond. It's been acting up a lot. Refusing to respond to the app. I guess even in this digital age, sometimes going physical was just more reliable. Maybe if I snuck back home I could go and turn it back off again. Save a bit of money.

""Bruce, could you do me a favour?"" 

""Yeah?""

""I need to go home for a second. It won't be long.""

""Don't worry, I gotchu. I won't tell the ma'am.""

""Thanks man.""

I finished my lunch and hurried out of there.",8
1lfqxhr,myr4v9k,"I jogged down the street, hoping to get home and back on time. I had to take a few detours through some of the alleyways back. It was quicker this way. And I knew my way around. I had to go back as quickly as I could before the ma'am notices. 

I was going so fast, I bumped into someone by accident. 

""Woah man, why so rushed?"" It was a teenage looking boy, who seemed like a punk. He had dyed yellow hair, a black shirt with a band logo I didn't recognise and a chained necklace on. 

""Sorry."" I had gotten knocked to my legs. Ow, my shoulder. It was all tingly. Like I had gotten zapped just now. I tried to get up and leave, but the boy grabbed me by the shoulder. 

""Dude, chill out, bro. You never know what you could miss by going so fast you know.""

""Uh. Right.""

""Have you ever gone so fast, you never stopped to wonder where you were going, and then suddenly you realised you're not sure where you want to go anymore?""

""..Huh?""

""Life's like that sometimes. You gotta slow down. Watch where you're going. If you spend all your time running away, sooner or later, your past is gonna catch up to you.""

What on earth was this guy talking about?

""It's something I learned watching movies. You got a phone? I can show you.""

For some reason, my phone chose that specific moment to vibrate in my pocket.

""Oh you do have one bro!"" He swiped it from my pocket and began to tap on it.

""Hey! That's my phone. You can't just-"" I grabbed it back, ""Look, I got someplace to be. Sorry if I hurt you. Could you let me go?""

""Whatever you say man. Just remember what I said yeah?""

*Sooner or later, your past is going to catch up to you...*

Huh? What was that? I swear I heard his voice inside my own head.  I shook my head. I was probably tired. Exhausted from my half day at work. This was weirding me out. The boy finally let me go and waved me goodbye, and I turned and started getting away from there. 

I didn't see him disinterate into thin air. 

----

As I got back to my apartment, I felt something wrong in the air. 

Police cars were parked up the side of the street. I turned the corner and saw police tape - or holographic images of one - cordoning off the whole building. What happened? I looked from afar, and saw that one of the windows was broken. What was more, the inside of the room had started fuzzing, as though the interior holo image had glitched out. 

The police were interrogating the people nearby. I saw a grandma I knew talking with the officers. What had happened here? No wait, this means I couldn't go in and turn off my lights. Shit. My money was going down the drain. 

My phone started buzzing in my pocket. But I had bigger things to worry about. Was I just going to stand out here and go back? Out of anyone in the city, the police were the last people I wanted to get involved with. But maybe there was a way in without having to go through them. I looked down the way to the back door. It was not blocked off. 

I decided to risk it. I didn't want to lose any more money this month. And I was sure whatever it was didn't involve me anyway.

""You one of the residents of this building?"" A voice called out from behind me as I snuck into the dark trashy alley. It wasn't a police officer. It was two men in suit and tie, shades covering their face. I recognised them from this morning.

""Um. Yeah?""

The phone in my pocket began to vibrate more strongly.

""We're agents with the government. We believe there is a dangerous war criminal hiding in this building, charged with the sabotage and destruction of government infrastructure, as well as illegal tampering of nanomachine cyberspace.""

What? War criminal? Sabotage? Destruction?

""We'd like you to come with us to answer a few questions.""

Suddenly, my phone started playing a ring tone. What was happening? I pulled it out to turn it off, and saw a message on the screen.

RUN

""Um, sorry, I gotta go. My employer is expecting me and-""

The man on the left pulled out a gun, and pointed it at me.

""This isn't a request. It's an order.""

I froze. A million thoughts raced through my mind in an instant. This couldn't be happening. What's happening? That isn't a real gun right? Who were these guys? What criminal? What do I do? *What do I do?*

I backed up, hands raised in the air. As I did, I saw the phone open an app. 

Trash Compactor Energy Management. 

""Don't worry. We aren't going to hurt you. We just want to know a few things, yeah?"" 

At that moment, a large electrical discharge filled the air. The two men in suits yelled in pain and my vision was blinded. When my vision returned, they were on the floor. 

A robotic voice went off from the pocket of the men. ""Target found. War Criminal code named Zero-Phi-Lambda. Requesting backup."" As soon as it finished that sentence, a high pitched alarm starting wailing from the pocket, and I saw everyone on the highway look this way. 

The phone in my hand shook. 

RUN.

My mind was still blank. The word seemed to imprint itself into my consciousness. 

I turned and ran.",6
1lfaquj,myms6v8,"  
I had just settled the child, who I had mentally named Vanessa after my long past mother, down for her afternoon nap when the sharp knock rattled the door to my apartment.  I hadn't been expecting anyone, so I was very wary when I peered through the peephole.  A woman, judging by the figure wrapped in a trench coat, kept her identity obscured by the large hat and sunglasses.  She stood impatiently waiting, raising her hand to knock again when I opened the door.  Caught off guard, her mouth twisted into a wry smile before speaking.

""I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for my daughter.  She was taken from me and I've been trying to track her down.""

The admission caught me flat-footed and I wordlessly waved her inside before I knew when I was doing.  She entered and looked around the living room of my modest apartment. I hadn't done much to update the decor after graduating college, posters of indie bands and old movies covered the walls.  The sagging couch, which I had inherited from my dad when he moved out of state, still remained the one of the few places to sit in the room.  I mentally cursed at myself when I noticed my superhero uniform still draped over the back of the only other chair in the room.  Before I could move to hide the identity exposing outfit, the woman removed her hat and glasses to reveal the face of the world's most wanted supervillain. She was gorgeous, to the same extent she was brilliant and rumored to be cruel.  Her captivating eyes caught my gaze and I noticed that she didn't seem to be distressed in any way.

When she spoke, it froze me in place.  ""So it's true.  A do-gooder cape caught the kidnappers of my child and took her home.  Why didn't you turn her over to the authorities?""

My mouth went dry.  I tried to form an intelligent response but only managed to blurt out ""She was dirty, scared and so I brought her home and gave her a bottle of warm milk."" I mentally shook my head at the inane response.  This woman could and probably would wipe my existence from the planet and I wasn't doing myself any favors.  Before I could speak again, she raised a hand.

""Where is she now?""

I pointed down the short hallway to my bedroom.  ""She was tired after eating, so gave her a bath and I put her down for a nap.""  Without a word, she breezed past me and paused at my bedroom door, opening it slowly as if not to startle anyone inside.  I could see the smile on her face, the way her eyes lit up at the sight of her child safe and sleeping peacefully.  She closed the door quietly and walked back to stand in front of me.  Cocking her head to the side, as if examining my worth, she pursed her lips before she spoke softly.

""I want to thank you for taking care of her.  Allison is my world.  One of my former henchmen thought that she was a weakness he could exploit.  If I may be direct, could you look after her for a few more days?  I need some time to get my house in order before I bring her back.""  Before I could say anything, she continued. ""I would pay you handsomely for your time and effort.  I really don't have anywhere else I could trust to take her at the moment, something I plan to fix right away.""

I wanted to refuse, to live up to my superhero calling and take her into custody, but seeing her as a distraught mother instead of a villainess tugged at my heartstrings.  I nodded, not trusting my voice.  She smiled in a genuine manner, something I guessed she rarely did in public.  Reaching into her coat, she pulled out a slender cellphone and placed it into my hand.  ""Call if you need anything, and I mean anything.  I'll call you when I come back.""  In a surprise move, she lunged forward and hugged me hard.  I could feel the slight tremble in her arms.  She softly whispered ""I thought I had lost her.  Thank you for saving her.""

She abrupted took a step back, carefully wiped her eyes before donning her hat and sunglasses.  Without a further word, she spun in place and walked out the front door, closing it carefully and quietly behind her.  I just stood there, cellphone in hand, not quite sure of what had just happened or what was coming next.",178
1lfaquj,mytyyrk,"Chapter 1: The Lost Child

""Oh, a child... Why'd they have a baby?"" I leaned down, carefully picking the child up, into my warm arms. I snapped my fingers, causing the rain to come to a slow stop. ""There, a little quieter now. Let's see if we can find your parents.""

I reached into my backpack, pulling out a dry towel, drying the baby off. Then, I pulled out a dry blanket and wrapped the child in it to keep her from my wet clothes, after the fighting. The baby cooed and smiled up at me as I began checking door-to-a door to see if anyone had lost their little one. 

""Well, Tempest, we haven't heard anything or seen any news reports of a missing child... Why don't you take her in for now? Afterall, can't trust law enforcement, at any level... I miss Miranda... So much..."" The man caught his tears on a handkerchief from his chest pocket.

""Mr. Jones..."" I felt the baby move around in my arms. She was reaching for the old man. 

""Uwah!"" The little girl giggled, holding her hands out to him. 

Mr. Jones held out a pinky, letting the child hold on. ""The future of our world may very well be in her hands, some day."" He gently pulled back, as the child released her grip. 

I smiled weakly. ""Yeah... We'll have to wait and see. Only so much I can do with my powers, ya know?""

""Yes..."" Mr. Jones turned, looking at the last photo he'd taken of Miranda a few days before she was taken from him. ""Everyone deserves to have a chance at a happy and healthy life. Make sure you do what you can to find the kid's mom and dad. You'd best get going."" 

I simply nodded and waved goodbye as he closed the door. ""May Miranda rest peacefully..."" I began making my way home, child in arms. We arrived at my door about half an hour later. I unlocked the door, letting us in, then closed and locked it. 

""Welcome home, for now, kiddo. Let's get you cleaned up."" I walked into my room, baby in my left arm, and started digging for some clean clothes in my dresser.

I picked out a nice dress, covered in flowers along with matching underwear and bra. ""Alright, kiddo. Sponge bath time for you."" Walking into the bathroom, I set my clothes upon the toilet seat, and started the water. I set the child down and quickly disrobed from my superhero outfit. 

I tested the water, ensuring it was safe for the child, not wanting to accidentally burn her. Once the water was where I wanted its temperature to be, I pushed down the stopper and placed the girl in the tub, stopping the water once it covered half her legs. ""Alright, let's make this quick.""

I gently washed the child from head-to-toe. Making sure to be gentle. Once done, I rinsed and dried her, leaving her on the bathroom floor. I turned the water faucet to shower from bath and washed the important parts before shutting it off and donning my bathrobe. ""Huh, normally kids like to explore, but you merely... Waited. Odd. Alright, let's go get you a bottle made."" 

I picked up the child and carried her into the kitchen, grabbing a bottle and formula my sister left. She thought it was a good idea to keep on the offhand she forgot hers at home. I started feeding the little one and watched as she drank the bottle and its contents. 

As I put the finished bottle in the sink, there was a knock on my door. I wasn't expecting anyone, so, maybe it was the parent of this little girl. I peeled the blinds back a bit, as my apartment peephole was broken. There was a woman outside. I unlocked the door and opened it. ""Hello! How may I help you?""

""Hi! I'm looking for my -"" The woman paused abruptly. ""- baby girl."" 

We stood in awkward silence for a moment, before I stepped aside and waved for her to come in, closing the door behind her. ""Oh, thank goodness! I tried finding her folks before bringing her back to mine, but no one had heard anything..."" 

""Right... One of the heros felt I wasn't fit to be a mother... So they kidnapped my child. When I found out who it was, they told me they'd hired some grunts to do the leg work for them."" I watched as her hands balled into fists, muscles flexing. I was caught up in her physique, briefly. 

""That's horrendous! No hero gets to decide if someone is fit to be a parent, that's the legal system's job, and even then, they make mistakes."" I spoke softly to not disturb the sleeping girl in my arms. ""What's her name?"" I slowly, carefully held the child out for her mother to take.

The woman took her child into her arms. ""Glimmer. Because, while I may be a super villainness, I have hope that she can be the light this world needs."" I watched as she shed a few tears. ""I'm not in uniform, but I'm sure you remember the name."" 

I sat, quietly, looking into this visually stunning woman's eyes. My heart skipped a beat. ""Vanta Echo!"" It was only a whisper, but she nodded.

""I've already taken care of the problem... Her father. And, it seems you took care of his goons. So, thank you."" 

My breath caught in my throat, I could only nod.

""He and I haven't been together for years and only hooked up for flings. 9 months later, Glimmer was born. While he was the worst to happen to me, she is the best thing to come from us."" She sighed and smiled at me. ""That's a lovely robe, for a lovely woman. What's your name?"" 

I inhaled and exhaled, remembering to breathe. ""Anna."" I blushed, beet red, still in my bathrobe.

""Such a fitting name for the vixen that took my child in. Thank you, for helping and taking care of my precious child."" She held her open hand out towards the floor as it started to glow a mix of purple and black. A bassinet appeared where she was aiming, then placed Glimmer inside.

""So... What happens now?"" I was mesmerized by this woman. Tall, dark hair, but the gentlest of eyes. Eyes that would show you the universe if you looked too long. Soft, radiant skin that pulls you in, yearning to be touched. I couldn't get enough. 

""Well, I'll likely be on my way home, at some point. But, I'm exhausted from looking for my beloved Glimmer all day."" This goddess slumped deeper into my couch. If looks could kill, I'd have already been a goner. But, I was starting to get an idea of how her powers worked. 

""Right. Well, you're welcome to stay as long as you need. I'm... Gonna get dressed."" I hurried back into the bathroom and swapped to my outfit. I giggled to myself. 

""_Pffft... Am I crushing on a super villain!?_"" I couldn't believe it. Such an elegant, yet deadly woman was on my couch, while her baby slept in the materialized bassinet in my living room. It's been so long though... Since I shared my space with another woman.",7
1lfaquj,myxmq3h,"I walked back into the living room where the both of them were sleeping. I lightly draped the blanket over the villainous and smiled weakly. ""_What am I doing?_"" Exhausted I slump onto the couch and slowly drift off to sleep myself.

When I woke, the sun was up, casting a dim light through the closed blinds. I blinked a few times and saw the bassinet still in the middle of the floor. To my left, no one. 

I looked around, but no sign of Vanta Echo. Then I heard the flushing of the toilet and running water from the sink. Quiet again. The super villainous came into the living room and plopped down next to me on the couch.

""Morning, sunshine."" Her smile could light up a room, while her powers could snuff the light out from someone's eyes. Yet here I was, being enthralled by the most powerful woman on the planet. Her voice is sweet like honey, soft like marshmallows.

""Hm... Can I call it a good morning when I have a bad bitch next to me?"" I giggled, blushing slightly.

""Well, Anna, you may be able to quiet storms and other weather related things, but you're interest in me seems insatiable."" Her chuckle made me blush harder, but her comment about my powers caught me off guard. 

""I -"" She cut me off by gently putting a finger to my lips. I froze in place, not knowing what was the come.

""You left your costume in the bathroom. Very cute though. Your current dress is cuter."" She smiled and gently traced her fingers along where the dress lay against my thigh, driving me up a wall, my face brighter than a stop light. ""Oh, look at you.""

I burried my face in my knees, embarassed as can be. ""_Why am I so easily flustered by the baddies!? Ugh, my last girlfriend was way more of a goodie two shoes than I am!_"" I felt a hand rest upon my head. 

""I've no interest in harming you, Anna. Heros aren't my targets. Politicians, beurocrats, and the like are."" She ruffled my hair a bit before pulling her hand away.

""So... What, you kill when you don't get things the way you want?"" I tilted my head, confused and genuinely wanting to understand.

""No. I strictly focus on those who are in it for greed and selfishness. Those that hoard the worldly resources. Those that don't focus on the betterment of the planet and every species that shares this space with us. I don't aimlessly kill. It's focused, narrowed. That's why, slowly, this country, is finally beginning to heal. What do you think of that?"" She gently lifted my head up and gave me a smile.

I tapped my index fingers together, smiling back. ""That's... That doesn't sound evil. We could do so much good together! I can bring rain to areas that need it and other weather-based needs!""

She nodded, satisfied with my answer as she continued. ""And I can, safely, expedite processes, like growing of greenery, removing plastic from places it doesn't belong, which is everywhere. Remember that island of plastic?"" I nodded with aggressive enthusiasm. ""I wiped it from existence. I pulled the fresh water from the melting polar ice and refroze them. Yet, there is much for me to do."" 

My jaw dropped in awe as I stared at this magnificent woman. ""You've done so much good so far and you're not being given the acknowledgement you deserve!"" I sighed, falling back onto the couch, head hitting the pillow.

""I don't seek acknowledgment for what I do. It's simply something that needs to be done and right now, science isn't where it needs to be to fix it."" So... Humble and yet so caring.

This woman could talk about the most mundane things and I'd be hooked on every word. Speaking of which. ""Well, since we are getting to know one another... When's your birthday? Mine is June, 2000."" I continued to look at the ceiling, pondering how I got here.

""November, 1990. Why?"" Her voice was calm and soft, inviting.

My face felt a little hot. I tilted my head so I could look her in the eyes. ""So, you're like, ten years older than me...""

I heard her giggle, causing me to raise my head and look at her.

""Yeah, I am. 10 years of life experience. How old did you think I was?"" She gave a wicked grin, then leaned closer, resting her chin on my knees, looking up at me. 

""Same age as me, 25..."" I turned my head away, shyness overcoming me. ""_Why is my body betraying me!? There's no way this older woman has any interest in me. A newbie heroine!_"" I covered my cheeks and nose with the blanket. 

She giggled. ""I'm flattered. Yes, I can modify my own genetics, so I practically never age. I can still feel everything."" She looked over at the bassinet, watching her child sleep. 

I looked over, pulling the blanket away from my face, smiling at the sleeping child. ""What do you think her powers will be?""

She rapped her fingers against the wall, pondering before answering. ""Hm... Most likely same as mine. Low chance of the father, or even lower still, something completely different."" She was right, the parent who births the child, their genes were the most likely to be passed down to the child over the other parent.

I moved the blanket back to the top of the couch. It's too hot for it now and I didn't want to change my clothes again. 

""Well, it'll be amazing to see what abilities she develops! Not that I'll be around to see."" I frowned, still looking at Glimmer, in her bassinet. 

""Why wouldn't you be?"" Vanta Black turned her head, facing her sleeping child.

""Well, because by society's views, at least. We are supposed to be enemies."" I looked down at her, captivated by her side profile. She glowed, basking in the sunlight through the blinds.

""Supposed to be, but don't have to be. We could do the whole enemies to lovers trope."" She cackled, looking up at me, but I saw the slight red in her face.

""Oh, is that a blush from you, Vanta!?"" I teasingly pointed at her cheeks with my fingers.

""Hey, I didn't tease you about how flustered you got!"" She hid her face in the blanket, but she couldn't his the redness of her face from me. ""By the way, my name is Clara."" She muffled through the blanket.

I giggled. ""I know. I'm sorry. I like to point out other people's flustered states cause I'm embarrassed by my own. Clara... Beautiful name for an drop dead gorgeous baddie like yourself."" 

She blushed a little more. ""I accept your apology and forgive you. Ya know, you're pretty adorable yourself, doll. I'm enjoying our back and forth banter. Would you... Want to come back to my place, sometime? I mean, it's only fair since I've seen yours..."" She shyly twirled her hair between her fingers.

""I'd like that, a lot, actually. I'd like you to meet my friends, too."" I reached out, taking her right hand in my left hand, holding her gently. ""Is this okay?""

She nodded, giving a small smile, letting the blanket fall from her face.

Both women lay on the couch, waiting for Glimmer to wake for the day. The apartment was peaceful that day as the two women bantered back and forth and shared in the task of taking care of Glimmer.",5
1lfemq4,mypl37q,"We perfected our understanding of our universe and its laws millennia ago. You might think that would be the end of all the fun for physicists. Time to pack up and go somewhere else, resign ourselves to probing the infinity of abstract mathematics. You couldn't be more wrong. The final theory was a kind of end, but also a beginning. It left an opening, to explore all uncountably many alternative laws of physics for alternative universes.

I am one of many trying to understand one of these other universes. We have labs that can dial up specific pockets that obey different rules from our home universe. There are too many to give each a meaningful name, the set of laws I am playing with is called AU-S54987125. It is not that exotic, as universes go. Three macroscopic dimensions of space and one of time. Previous experiments have yielded interesting results. Stars that can form on much smaller scales than in our universe, self sustaining reactions requiring only about one cubic meter of volume.

I seek to study these stars, and their behavior. They are profoundly complicated things. I set up a lab with enough mass to create a star of average size. It can create a pocket of literally any set of possible physical laws. Such labs are not expensive, they are mass produced. I organize data harvesters to monitor it as it develops, and leave it to run on its own.

Time passes, I set up other experiments and study the stream of work done by others. There are too many scientists involved and too many possible universes to read them all, so I focus on certain classes and types of alternatives. Four years later, I receive a ping from the lab. One of the safety diagnostics has reported an anomaly. They are robust things, a minor safety issue should be fine, but it does warrant attention.

I open up the data feed, and at first I think it must be the wrong experiment. There is a star surrounded by glimmering things that look like statites. I check again, it is definitely the right lab. How could this have happened? As far as I know, no one playing with the set of laws has ever had something similar happen.

I begin the long task of studying the data dump to figure out what occurred. I watch the star form, then watch as its dynamics cause it to spit out matter. For over a year, nothing of interest happens, then my jaw drops. The unmistakable signature of life. I watch as it rapidly differentiates and evolves. There are no true planets, but little creatures zip about from island to island around the star. I spot autotrophs that harvest energy and serve as the bottom of a food chain. There are even some organisms that manage to live inside the star itself.

They come up with a language based on reflections of light. I watch them develop agriculture. I watch them begin to modify themselves, guiding their own evolution. They begin a positive feedback loop, growing explosively in intelligence. They ask profound questions about how their universe came to be, and why they exist. They harvest mass from the star to create more livable space. Then they undertake a massive project, beginning to encircle their star in a dyson sphere.

I blink. I see it, but I don't believe it. Life has been reported in plenty of other experiments. But not this quickly, not this intelligent, and not this technologically advanced. This is big. This is a first. The world needs to know, and people wiser than me need to decide what course this takes.

I reach out to my mentor. She doesn't believe it either, until she sees it. She speaks to her peers. One of these peers coins the name Humboldtian for them. It is decided that as long as their position is stable and at no risk of major harm, we will not intervene until all arguments are heard.

The gears turn slowly, but eventually there is agreement. We will make first contact. Their languages are translated, and an avatar is deployed. For them it is a day of celebration and euphoria. We explain what they are, and offer them the same rights enjoyed by all sapient life in our universe.

So begins an exchange of culture and science. They have studied their own laws more thoroughly than us. Their artistic expression is alien, but still hauntingly beautiful. Their thinkers have come up with things a human mind would have never thought of, and they delight in all the strange ideas we can offer them as well.

I know I do not deserve much credit, it was simply a chance discovery. But still, my name will go down in history for having created the first experiment to yield sapient life. Tears of joy brim in my eyes. Who knows what wonder looms in the future.",29

No right arm, and the left one, is pinned by her.

“Why do people find the *‘four ears’* thing so weird?”

The question came from across the table, in the middle of a perfectly normal lunch at the perfectly normal campus café.

Except it wasn’t normal.

Because Neneko was glaring at me, her latte foam slightly frothing, and her top pair of cat ears were twitching with deeply offended indignation.

I swallowed my bite of sandwich very slowly. “Uh...”

“I mean, *seriously !*” she continued, flicking her upper ears backward like little angry satellite dishes. “Centaurs have *six limbs* and *no one* blinks. But I get one dumb human pointing and going, ‘Wait, are those your *real* ears, or do they work together ?’ and suddenly I’m the biological enigma of the week.”

I looked around. A few other students had paused mid-bite to eavesdrop. The vampire at the next table was nodding solemnly.

""I’m not trying to be rude."" I said carefully. “It’s just… if your cat ears *work*, then what do the human ears *do*?”

“They hold earrings, and headphone.” she snapped.

Fair point.

“And they’re not ‘human’ ears. They’re *baseline bipedal hominid template* ears. I’m technically Catfolk, Kemonomimi Variant 3.5, and yes, I *have* been reviewed by the Interracial Species Design Committee, thank you.”

She sipped her latte aggressively.

“I mean, do you ask harpies why their arms are wings but they also have *weird little chicken legs*? No. You don’t.”

“Actually, I - ”

“No. You *don’t.* Because that’s *speciesist.*”

I raised both hands. “Okay! Okay. I get it. You’re right. Ears are ears.” 

>!I am a speciesist though.!<

She narrowed her eyes. “You’re going to google it later, aren’t you ?”

I didn't answer fast enough.

Neneko groaned. “Look. It’s simple. Top ears ? Hearing. Twitchy, expressive, super-powered. Bottom ears ? Decorative. Functional, but mostly ignored. Like… the appendix of my skull. There.”

She jabbed a tuna salad sandwich in my direction. “Now let me eat in peace with all four of my evolutionary audio receptors, thank you very much.”

She took a bite, her cat ears perking up in what I assumed was sandwich-based approval.

I still don’t know how Neneko hears through walls.

I *do* know not to touch her upper ears without permission.

I may have learned that the hard way.

1lfny3w,myqiqnv,"Growing up is all about learning to judge distance. The distance between individuals…between friends and acquaintances, seniors and juniors, boys and girls. When you’re extremely young, there’s no distinction at all. You smile at anyone you like and cry when anyone makes you sad. But that means you’re only treating people according to your own perspective, placing yourself at the center of your universe. In reality, we’re mortals rather than gods. Eventually, every person grows up and learns to act in the way that’s expected of them rather than the way they might like it.

“Yo Dan, you came to school alone today?”

“…Who cares?”

And so, the fact that my longtime friend chose to walk to school without me should be celebrated. It took until the latter part of middle school, but Alyssa had finally started to grow up.

Honestly, it was such a pain having her stick to me all the time. Insisting that we should do everything together just because we’re neighbors.

I couldn’t be more relieved.

“Didn’t her mom say that she left early, though?” I muttered to no one in particular as I listlessly scanned through our classroom. Nearly everyone was seated at their desks, but Alyssa had yet to arrive.

…Or so it seemed until she walked in along with the teacher.

“I have great news, everyone!” It wasn’t so much our teacher’s words that grabbed everyone’s attention as his expression. The man usually kept a dour, authoritarian glare but today he had a positively manic smile plastered across his face. “One of your classmates has deified! This morning, Alyssa successfully transcended Her mortality and became a divine being! Please, everyone, clap for Her achievement!”

“…What the f—” My expletive was drowned out by a deluge of cheers as everyone except me stood up and clapped as though they’d just sat through the biggest blockbuster of the year.

Meanwhile, Alyssa took in their praise with her usual bright smile. At a glance, I didn’t notice anything different about her. Alyssa’s short stature and pigtails still made her seem like she belonged a couple grades down. At most, her light skin seemed to have an unusually healthy glow to it, but I couldn’t see why anyone would think that this diminutive girl had become a deity.

And then she opened her eyes, and I saw two swirling galaxies where her eyeballs should be.

“Thanks everyone,” she said, and I shuddered as her voice echoed eerily throughout the classroom. “But it’s not that big a deal. I just happened to become a god is all.”

“And so humble, too,” crooned our teacher. “Alright, I really shouldn’t be making too big a fuss out of this. Goddess, please take your seat so we can begin class.”

I really wanted to make more of a fuss out of this…but no one else was saying anything. Even when the guy who sat next to me silently got up and traded seats with Alyssa, no one batted an eye. Alyssa took her place beside me and first period began without any additional twists.

“Hey, Danny. Sorry I missed you this morning. I just thought about going to school and suddenly I was there.”

“Uh, don’t worry about it…I guess?” I whispered back but it felt pointless to try and have a quiet conversation when Alyssa’s voice was still bouncing around the room. “But what’s with this whole…god…thing?”

“Oh you know, stuff like that happens from time to time.”

“No, I’m pretty sure it doesn’t.”",8
1lfny3w,myqisl4,"(pt 2)

“Well, I’m pretty sure it does. Anyway, did you see the latest episode of…” Alyssa segued into talking about a show that we both liked, and it was like nothing had changed.

Though, it was pretty strange how no one noticed that we were talking in the middle of class. Not even when I switched to a normal volume.

Chatting through class was fun and all, but I felt a bit relieved when second period came around. Alyssa and I had different classes now, so I’d have some time to think about all the strangeness that just went down…or I should have, but Alyssa followed me to my next classroom without batting an eye.

“Don’t you have bio this morning?”

“I changed my schedule.”

“…How?”

“’Cause I wanted to.”

Time passed and I learned that, unsurprisingly, Alyssa’s new schedule lined up perfectly with mine. Wherever we had assigned seats, her seat was changed to be right beside mine. She wanted to talk through every class and if I tried to shut her out, she’d pester me until she got a response—a skill she’d mastered long before deifying.

By lunchtime, I was completely burnt out. There was no rest. No breaks. I couldn’t escape Alyssa for even a moment. Not until I ran into the bathroom, anyway.

Once she saw where I was going, Alyssa’s eyes, those glowing nebulas, narrowed in disappointment and she muttered, “Alas, this time, you’ve gone where I cannot follow.”

“Ok but seriously, you’d better not follow me!”

I plopped myself down in an empty stall and let out a sigh I’d been holding for the entire day.

This had to be a dream, right?

Or maybe I’d gone insane?

Still…now that I was alone with myself, I had to admit that it was nice to hang out with Alyssa like we used to. We didn’t have to care about anyone giving us odd looks or starting rumors. I…I had missed my friend. Just a little bit.

My time in here was limited, as I knew that the longer I stayed, the greater chance that Alyssa would decide to do something drastic. There didn’t seem to be any solution to this madness, so maybe I should just treat it as a dream and enjoy myself?

Maybe I didn’t have to grow up just yet…",6
1lf96qh,mymky65,"It’s coal country. The hills lead to the Black Mountains, and the town was named Haven, as a lark. For haven it was anything but. The clang of metal being beaten is as constant as the thick black smog that floats along the street. The air smells like burnt metal, which reminds the prince of blood, which brings images of his father to mind.

He is dead, the prince reminds himself.
And you are alive.
But not king.
Until at least a head is taken.
And the gods will it, he knows this because he should be dead among his family.

And because he is not, because he was grabbed in the middle of the night, thrust in a sack and left on the side of the road leading to the Wastes and this road to revenge. It was a long road. How he escaped and the adventures to this point were tiny escapades to what needs to happen.

How many years has it taken? Ten? Twelve? He always loses count because it doesn’t really matter. He has learned one thing on his travels: that fate can’t be beaten. Where he is, is where he is supposed to be.

And with that he finds himself at the door to a clay hut. One of many that litter the muddy avenue running straight through town. Huts like this one strewn about seemingly at will.

The prince enters, the ragged strip of hide flapping behind him.

A huge hunched back stands in front of him. Glowing muddy brown from the intense fire that the prince can sense even just standing in the door.

“Get in or stay out, my flames waver with your uncertainty,” the voice is deep and gravely as if it fought pits and imperfections on its way out of their sayer’s mouth. His accent is one of the mountain clans. Clans containing what some call monsters and the rest just ignore knowing they even exist hoping they can keep doing just that. Ignoring them.

In the past the mountain clans would come out of their caves and gullies and raid and pillage the more civilized communes in the land of his father. But the king stopped it a generation ago. Cleaned the mountains, he claimed.

After what the prince has been through, he knows that isn’t the case. The Black Mountains are just as evil and wicked as they ever were.

The prince steps in closer to the intense heat, “There is a rumor, blacksmithy, you can make whole that which others say cannot be.”

The hulking figure turns and snarls through a mouth of thick tusks and molars. Red hairs bristle about his chin and cheeks like freckles on his green skin. “I do not work for humans.”

The prince can taste the tooth decay occurring in real time as the Orc speaks.

“You don’t understand, orc. This is the blade of my grandfathers, the sword of my ancestors. A sword wielded only when the kingdom most needs it.” As he speaks he unwraps the vellum package in his hands and lays it down at the bunnioned and calloused feet of the artisan.

The sound of the orc’s laughter is obscene, “Stupid human, no one can fix that, it’s just a hilt. Just say make me a new sword. Fool!”

“No,” the prince says opening a second package, this one containing 376 individual splinters and fragments of the sword that was broken to ensure peace.

The orc is silent, staring intently at the mound of metal still sparkling with the magic infused within it so many generations ago. His eyes saucer-sized, marveling at what was just a legend moments ago.

“This…”

“Is the sword of your grandfathers. Made for my grandfathers with the promise of peace. Only to be remade in a time of great need. It is time, blacksmith. It is time to honor your family’s pledge to the gods. You will fix the Broken Sword and help me avenge my father and recapture his kingdom from the horde.”

For a few seconds they just stand there opposite one another. The prince looking at the orc and the orc staring at the sword.

Then, just as the prince begins to panic that he didn’t understand the situation about the Broken Sword, the orc kneels.

“Yes, my king. I will fix the work of my grandfathers.”",72
1lf96qh,mymp8gt,"I look at the woman, and sigh.  
""Yeah, I am a blacksmith, and I suppose you wish me to re-forge that ""blade""."" I say.  
She nods.  
""While it is doable, as a licensed Tier-9 blacksmith, I have to ask you: why do you need that sword, what materials do you wish to use for the crafting, and if you had brought the materials, or wish to buy it?"" I ask her.  
She smiles.  
""I wish to go to the frontier to fight the invaders for our country!  
And I brought you something my ancestors left behind."" she said, pouring out a lot of stuff on the floor.  
Blade fragments, ores, and scales.

  
I grab the fragments, and it almost cuts my skin.  
Mind you, I am a dwarf, my skin is tough.  
""You really didn't lie when you said that this blade was used for a war.  
It is made of fallen stars, earth drake scales, and Titan blood was used to quench it."" I say.  
She puffs her chest proudly.  
""I am from a knightly family!"" she says.  
I look at her shabby clothes, and thin figure.  
A fallen noble...  
Then I look at the other materials.

  
""Earth drake scales, deep earth ores, titanium ores, mithril and the blood of a tier-5 leviathan.  
Your attributes, young lady?"" I ask.  
""I am a knight of earth and water."" she says.  
I nod.  
""Come back in 3 days.  
You will have a sword, two daggers, and a scabbard made for you."" I say, taking the materials, and ready to go inside the workshop.  
""T-that's it?"" she asks.  
I nod.

  
3 days later, she comes back, and falls in love with the sword.  
""Heh, it's one of my masterpieces. It can cut a tier-8 being's flesh easily."" I say.  
She giggles, then freezes.  
""How much?"" she asks.  
I wave her away.  
""Nothing. Kill them invaders for me, and we are even."" I say.  
She nods seriously.  
""Survive kid. Running is not shameful, dying because you were too proud to run is."" I say.  
""Thank you, Senior."" she bows, and leaves.  
I sigh.  
""Yet another goes to the endless war...when will this be over?"" I mutter, going back inside.  
If I am free enough to mutter like an old fart, then I should be crafting instead.",20
1lf96qh,myoilu8,"""Aye, I'm a blacksmith"" I said, leaning back and crossing my massive arms across my barrel chest. ""Not a wizard. I can shape and harden steel, not create it from nothin'."" 

The young man with the sword hilt tilted his head like a confused dog. The loose ear flap on his hat added to the canine comparison. ""But this is a sword. You make swords."" 

""I do, yes. If you'd like to buy a blade, I can attach it to that hilt. But I can't just 'repair' that there handle into a sword without materials."" I said, pausing to mop my brow of the sweat and grime that always seemed to accumulate whenever the furnace was lit. 

""Um... yeah, that's what I was asking for"" the young man said. ""Do I need to do a quest for the materials? Collect 8 iron nuggets from fallen enemies or something?"" 

I stared at the kid, trying to figure out just how many torches were lit in his noggin. ""Um, no, I got the raw materials. I just need the gold.""

The young man's face finally lit up with understanding. ""Oh! Ok, I understand now! So once you fix the sword, I can go out and kill some bandits, and bring you back the gold?"" 

""No credit"" I grunted, ""An' I don't wanna know if you're plannin' on murdering and robbing people. None of my business what you do with this after I make it."" 

""So... how do I get the gold then?"" The clueless cretin asked. 

I stared at the young man until he looked away. ""Boy, if you have to ask that, I don' think you should have a sword, much less a weapon at all. Are you right in the head?"" 

The kid sighed dramatically. ""Look, I just got this stupid fucking game to work, and the tutorial just said to bring the hilt to the Royal Blacksmith. If there's some sort of quest that-""

I raised one of my large, scarred hands, silencing the whelp mid-whine. ""Ah, you want the Royal Blacksmith, he's in the Castle. You know, where the King lives. The Royalty. As in 'Royal' Blacksmith."" 

The young-ling finally looked like he comprehended my words. ""Oh! Ok, thanks mister"" he said, pulling a ridiculously large map from one of his many pockets. It began to glow in a mysterious eldritch light, tracing intricate paths across the surface in brilliant colors. ""Right... here! Waypoint set."" 

""Wait a moment, young master"" I interrupted, ""I'll make this here sword for that magic map you got.""

The boy looked up at me again as the map dissapeared back into that unnaturally deep pocket. ""What? I don't think I can un-equip this, it's not an inventory item. Just a menu item. Anyways, see you later!"" 

With that, the boy vanished, leaving a powdery shimmer where he had once stood. I blinked, trying to make sense of what the hell I had just seen. Was that a wizard? A warlock? A mad child, possessed by whatever foul genie that hilt contained? 

I shook my head and turned my attention back to the forge. Best to not dwell on such things, I thought, and resumed my work on the bellows. The forge roared back to life, sucking in the new air greedily like a dragon awakening-

""Oy! Git! Are you the royal blacksmith?"" A new voice asked, far more irritated than the last. ""This game's buggy as hell, and the tutorial quest ain't tellin me where to go!""

1lfm35g,mypgsfr,"""What's your name?""

""Why do you want to know?""

""...I want to be your friend!""

""I literally just met you.""

""Look, I need your name because writing a dialogue with two characters without names is really complicated.""

""What do you mean 'writing'? Are you writing this situation?""

""Not me, her.""

*Both characters turn to look at me*

""Is it complicated?""

*I nod shyly. I'm not as good a writer as I thought*

""Wait, this is a story? What story? We're just having a conversation.""

""Well, look at those letters floating in the air. Besides, haven't you noticed we don't have any defined characteristics or settings? Each reader is imagining us however they want!""

""Why don't we have any characteristics?""

""It's her fault!!""

*They both look at me again*

""You couldn't give us some basic descriptions?! Maybe a name? Or at least tell us where we are?""

*I shift uncomfortably in my chair*

""I... I was trying to focus on the dialogue...""

""Oh great, so I could be a three-headed alien for all we know.""

""Are you a three-headed alien?""

""No! At least... I don't think so. How would I know? She hasn't told me!!!""

*The first character taps their foot impatiently*

""This is exactly why I asked for your name in the first place. This whole conversation is getting absurd.""

""Now I get why names are important! I think I'll call myself... hmm... Alex.""

""You can't just name yourself! That's not how it works!""

""Why not?""

*I throw up my hands in frustration*

""Fine! You're Alex, and I am... um... Morgan.""

""Morgan? That's the best you could come up with?""

""At least it's gender-neutral, like you!""

*Morgan turns to me*

""Now do your job! Right Now!""

""You know what? I'm done with you. This story is over.""

""You can't just end it like that!"" protests Morgan.

""Watch me.""

""This doesn't surprise me, given how Morgan's treated you before."" Alex says, being the most handsome and intelligent. ""Please write me in another story.""

""Sure! See you!""

""Wait, no—""",9
1lffvtz,myoxyfd,"\[Trauma. Incidental.\]

It’d been a quiet morning with only a handful of regular customers dropping by. Simone wasn't as widely recognized as some of the other potion vendors, but she made quality goods at a fair price. There were adventurers who appreciated her wares and stopped by every morning on their way to whatever dungeon they might be headed to. It was rare that she got a new customer, and almost never before noon. But, when the door chime sounded again, she looked up from her book. It was a young teen with bushy brown hair stacked on his head like a helmet. He was alone, and Simone shook her head. She'd ran the shop for dozens of years already, and she could more or less guess what someone was looking for by the way they approached.

This kid didn't bother looking around at any of the potions, poultices, and tools on display and instead headed straight for the counter. That meant he knew what he wanted, and he knew it wasn't going to be found on the racks. She had a very small list of potions that needed to be handled carefully that she kept in the back. But, she didn't think he wanted any of those.

""I'm looking for G-Prime, and I'll take as many as you got on hand,"" he said. Simone froze. In the back of her mind, she knew exactly what he was going to ask for. But, his casualness chilled her. He was just a boy!

""I...,"" she closed her eyes for a moment to gather herself. It'd been years since anyone asked for it. Not since the one incident that made her decide to stop offering it. She started refusing to sell it to anyone, even her regular customers. And she was thankful that they still kept coming around for other purchases. ""I... don't sell Gnosis Prime anymore,"" she said. ""I refuse to sell that reckless potion ever since the incident...,"" she said. She let it drag out silently.

""Oh, Bummer. Okay,"" the teen nodded and waved as he turned to leave. ""I'll try somewhere else then. It is the witching district,"" he chuckled as he reached the door and walked out without another word. Simone sighed as tears welled up in her eyes. She was glad she didn't have to explain what had happened, and she wouldn't have even if he asked. It was a traumatic incident that she hated thinking about. And, now she was doing her best to push past it again, hoping to forget it.

1lfd16q,myod8ik,"And then it did, as I sensed something tug on my boot.

Yet it wasn’t the rough skin of a passing fish or rising tides. No, it had talons that wrapped around my ankle with purpose. My pupils shrunk as they crawled down toward the depths that I can’t see past as another hand wrapped around my right leg on its ascent to the surface. Maybe I was hallucinating from the impact. This might all well be a fever dream, although I can sense the errant claws of the digits digging through my uniform and into my flesh to draw blood.

Terror; that slack emotion that gripped my heart doubled over itself as I watched a pale ghastly hand reach out of the deep and plunge into the life jacket’s inflated plastic with a hiss of air. A pair of pale glowing yellow eyes erupted from the depths high enough to expose the creature below and its set of horrific mandibles. I couldn’t see it all, but a passing glance was enough to confirm that it was at least twice the size of the average man, as it twisted its head from side to side, studying my person.

Then it dragged. Not up, or toward the rapidly descending ship that’d now crashed into the sea in the distance, no; down. Toward the depths and what was below with ease. I raised my head to take a final deep breath of the air.",5
1lfdlnd,mynksd6,"What is going on?
Sure the sunlight is shining on us...but it is winter!
I am freezing in like a dozen layers of clothes and...
Wait.
Is she...undressing?
I watch horrified as my colleague, no, not just her, but most in the office start undressing.
They shiver, and yet still all complain about it being too hot.
What is going on?


I try to convince them, to wake them up, but nothing works.
They sit there shivering, some already turning blue-ish, working in their underwear.
I go to the other floors in the building, and it is happening everywhere.
I check social media...and nothing.
Does this mean...
I am the only one unaffected?
What is going on?
Before I could panic more, a colleague falls to the floor, convulsing.


I rush over, and cover her with some coats I found.
Then I rush to the thermostat and put it to the maximum of 35 degrees.
Before calling the ambulance.
A few dozen minutes later, I am sweating bullets, while the others are now complaining...
It is too cold?
I watch them dress up, sweating, but still wanting more layers of clothes.
The ambulance is nowhere to be seen.
What the fuck is going on?


I leave...and nobody really reacts.
They do their jobs automatically, while complaining about the temperature.
The same thing is happening outside, as many people walk around nigh naked.
I get home and close the doors, and shut the blinds.
I saw things...
I search the web for clues, but nothing.
And then...I get a message.
""You are in the wrong world.
If you want help, come here."" it says, and attached is an address.
Great.
The plot intensifies, but couldn't it have remained thin? Boring?

It is not like I have a choice...I can't really stay in this reverse world, can I?",5
1lekcnt,myh1ops,"The adventurer job is simple in many ways. We go to a certain location at the guilds requests, or by our own initiative, explore, loot, and return... Many times we have to exterminate the things found in the location, or any threat to civilized society. 

Some other times, we have to sabotage the very location. I remember the tragic sonnets the bards would compose about the destruction of such beautiful places, like he jungles of N'Go Airam, home to a dangerous brood of Heptazion Bees.

This was supposed to be one of those jobs. A dungeon which the recent teluric movements had revealed its entrance... Simple, easy money and distractions. 

Many, including me, still avoid the village to not dealing with our parents for not marrying or having a family. 

But... Since we put a foot here, everything became... mundane. 

No fierce creatures to vanquish, just fluffy creatures like those looped-ear bunnies. True, they were as big as boars and bears, but they were docile. No risk, nor need to shed their blood. Even the environment was... strange... less of a dark, damp dungeon and more of the recreation of a grandma's garden; soft moss growing on its walls, fresh grass under our boots. Even with luminescent creatures lighting the place, giving a warm yellowish-orange tint to the place. A notorious contrast to the greens that surrounded us. 

Everything directing us towards the final chamber. A huge room, at least two stories high, a place not out of place from a royal castle, littered with the remains of previous adventurers who might have found the dungeon before its entrance was buried underneath the crust. 

""Oh dear... who is there?"" A strangely sweet voice said. 

The room reverberated with the message, as if the very walls repeated it, and yet it raised no alarm. More like memories flooding our minds of the times of our childhood. Surrounded by our family. Happy times that became bitter after growing up. 

Our scout took a peek. You never rush towards a battle you may not survive... And she saw her. An ancient Lich. Wearing a panoply of war, adorned with ancient jewels charged with Eldritch might. 

And for some reason,  dabbling with the silverware as if she were expecting guests. 

  
What on the Gods' earth is happening?",216
1lekcnt,myhg5g3,"""Do not break his delusion, or we could be dead,"" James the wizard warned his partner Regis. ""Just sip your tea and eat your cookies.""

The ancient lich, old even by standards of immortals, older than the earliest recorded human civilization, had assumed this adventuring party his grandchildren. Even the kid mind flayer the two men had adopted.

*""More cookies please,""* Lando the mind flayer pushed his rapidly-emptied plate towards the Grand Lich. *""Thank you, grandpa.""*

**""You are welcome, my little one. Eat as much as you need. You need to grow up, Larry.""** The ancient and terrible skeleton intoned.

Regis the Rogue hadn't eaten. He had been looking for a way to dispel the illusionary dining room, all so he could actually grab the actual piles of treasures in the lich's dungeon. Could a rogue settle for eating cookies and drinking tea which were possibly not from his native reality?

""Regis, sit your ass down before the lich gets suspicious,"" James scowled as he refilled his tea. ""He's senile, but he's still powerful and could wipe us out with a waggle of his finger.""

""How long will this pretense keep up?"" The rogue had grown impatient. He wasn't one to rest on his laurels. ""How long does the lich plan on keeping us, his fake grandchildren here?

It was at this point Lando wiggled a tentacle. *""Grandpapa, thank you for the nice tea time, but I need to go to the Wizarding Academy now. Wouldn't want to be late for school.""*

**""Go now. Study well, little Larry. Do not let your old man keep you. Just remember to come back after school!""**

And with a wave of the lich's golden scepter, the trio were surprised to find themselves transported outside the dungeon safely.

""Great, we didn't get any treasure, didn't slay the big bad,"" Regis sighed.

James frowned and bonked him with his staff. ""Shut up, we're all alive. This was not an encounter we could have won. We don't stand a chance against reality warpers, senile or not.""

""What's the plan now, oh wise wizard?"" The rogue crossed his arms. ""Turn back and pretend we didn't take this quest?""

*""Maybe after my wizarding class is over, I could ask my new grandpa for a prize for doing my homework!""* Lando chipped in. *""Then, we'll have a treasure to show for my efforts. I think I'm the most convincing grandkid.""*

You finally remembered your grandpa!"" the lich says, snapping his finger, warping reality, as the dungeon floor transforms into a small comfy room.
My teammates disappear, as I am left alone, finding myself sitting in a lavish armchair.
""So, tell grandpa.
How is the Academy? Do I need to beat some sense in Azerta?"" it cackles.
Azerta?
Wasn't that a legendary Sage, who founded and was the first Headmistress of the Academy of Saints?
But that was hundreds of thousands years ago.
""Grandson?"" he asks, its eyes flickering.



""Yeah...it is going good grandpa.
How...how about you? Anything nice?"" I ask.
We knew liches get stronger and more unstable as they age, but this...
""Oh, little Zacariah, I had a breakthrough, and I think I can learn 14th tier spells."" he says, sipping some tea.
I freeze.
14th tier?
That is the domain of Gods.
I take a sip of the tea, and I almost explode.
I feel as if I swallowed a sun.
The lich chuckles and snaps his fingers again.
I feel better.


""Still too strong for you, little Zacariah.
Well, you are only a 2nd tier mage."" he chuckles.
2nd tier?
I am a peak 6th tier mage...
I knew ancient times were richer in mana, and thus mages were stronger, but this is absurd.
""Not really absurd, kid.
It has been almost a million years since then."" he smiles.
I nod, then freeze.
Wait...
He didn't call me grandson.


I stand up, and the room shifts back to the dungeon floor.
""Don't worry. I am not going to hurt you.
It was nice imagining that I could talk once more with little Zacariah..."" it sighs.
I don't know what to say.
""Your teammates are trying to get in. How sweet.
Look, take this and destroy it."" it says throwing me something.
It looked like a...phylactery.
""Because it is my phylactery.
My episodes are getting worse, I can't even continue my research.
It is time for me to go."" it says.
I shiver.
""Do it. Please."" it says.
I burn the phylactery, and watch as this legendary lich turns to ashes.
The door to this floor opens, and my teammates enter, congratulating me on clearing the dungeon boss.
I should be happy...
But I am not...this feels wrong.",127
1lekcnt,mykb4tt,"[Arch-Lord Krieg and Sir Lyton sat again at Kreig's table with a pot of coffee slowly cooling between them, their mugs untouched.](https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1lcw0tu/wp_you_are_an_ancient_lich_who_invented_dungeons/my6m5zz/)  Krieg reached out serveral times to drink but pulled his withered hand back at each attempt.

""Talk to me,"" said the knight. ""Just get it out.""

""She was my teacher,"" said the Lich, ""Many eons ago.  First in life and then in...""  He stopped talking and gestured at himself.  ""I don't know how to feel about seeing her, yet I'm still glad you asked me to come.""

Krieg had taken up Lyton's offer of ""bland and boring"" for the past half year, the situation working out better than expected.  With the knight's help, reputation, and pulling-of-strings, the Lich was slowly introduced into the ton of Pergrais, the nation he'd almost been run out of as a ""beacon of darkness"".  There was still much work to do, although freely opening his library to local scholars had done much to smooth his transition into polite society.  No torch wielding mobs as of yet.

The leased-out coffee business helped a great deal, too, along with the aid of an enthusiastic local bakery.

This past week Sir Lyton was tasked to end the threat of yet another Lich at almost the other end of the kingdom.  That two such lairs would appear in remarkably short distances was at first eyebrow-raising until the adventuring party actually met her.

Autarch Melbrene, the witch of the glade.  She greeted the King's heroes with tea and outstanding cookies.  Unfortuneately her very presence at Mount Kir created a killing miasma in the surroundings but that was merely because of what she was, not out of any deliberate malice or intent to harm.

The sun casts burning rays regardless of how it feels about it.

As they sat with warm beverages and excellent biscuits the Autarch spoke to them of bygone days, as if they were her beloved grandchildren.  She spoke fondly of her favorite student, a great prodigy, who she longed to see again.  Age had taken away his name.  Kreer, perhaps, or Kraig.  Sir Lyton, leader of the party, said ""Krieg"" quitely and Melbrene's eyes bore into his.

And thus, a mere month later, Arch Lord Krieg found himself before his teacher, mentor, and for a few remarkable nights, lover.

""She told stories that I'd forgotten,"" the Lich said to the knight, finally taking a long drink from the mug.  ""How many years I was brought back.  The scent of the tea, unchanged in all this time. I can still see her as she was before.""

Lyton poured a measure of whiskey into each mug as the Lich stared out the window.  It would, of course, have no effect on the undead lord but he'd appreciate the gesture.

""I reckon she still has much wisdom to share,"" said Lyton.

Krieg stood to stare outward, hands clasped behind his back.  ""No.  No, she is no longer there.  Memories and old stories, certainly.  But she repeats herself, forgets, says things wrong.  No wisdom, only a shadow of what was.""

Lyton leaned back in his chair.  ""When we first met, you asked me what would I have you do.  I now ask you the same.""

""Bring her here, to my house, we can make her comfortable.  Perhaps a special seat of honor in the coffee house, let her have visitors to tell tall tales.""

""While she carries not the slightest thought of harm, her very presence brings decay.""

Krieg waved his hand as if brushing away a troublesome fly.  ""Easy for me to constrain, barely an effort.  In three days I can prepare this house to be a sanctuary for her and all of my guests.  Please, bring her.""

Sir Lyton stood, clasped Arch-Lord Krieg on the shoulder.  ""It shall be done.""",16
1lekcnt,myittk8,"There was but a spectacle upon the night when it appeared; over the kingdom and on high, a mass of dread-feathers to scatter across the kingdom like raindrops. Where they touched, the world would warp. Time became fickle as entire villages would split between dead, alive, prospering, and barren.

Upon the skyline grew a cave, impossibly statuesque as it were, held by naught, and carving the skyline apart. Below, in the kingdom proper, as timelines split and converged in multifold fashions, there was brought between the seven iterations of the King, a party of adventurers.

These were people from the history known, and histories which did not exist. One man was a clockwork thing, all twisted gears and burning red eyes. The next was a man not of form, but of Idea; he would twist in expression of his thoughts. And the last was a slightly tired woman, with grease-stained arms, a book shoved under her shoulder, and a wand laid bare.

They were whom the skybox would unfold, harvesting complex technologies yet to be birthed. Upon a balloon that burned bright and fast, the three would step into the cave in the sky.

Silence; abstraction slithered across dirt that should not exist, casting shadows where none should go. A step further revealed the steady drip of a water flow somewhere deeper. With a clawed iron hand held high, a wand swished to draw artificial light, and a shift towards thoughts of Panther, the three stepped ever deeper.

Murals bloomed, artifacts of a long forgotten age. They detailed a war of great anguish, where the people's of the planet nearly trapped themselves under a curse. Angorlash; God of War, and God of Pain, had colluded the minds of Mortals towards his goal of everlasting war, and indeed nearly won, corrupting the hearts of men. But then, there had come The One.

Here was a Lich, presented in full, sacrificing their soul as they fought the God to a standstill. Then, in a last petty act-

""Children, is that you?""

""Be on your guard,"" The Metal Man warned.

The witch nodded, and the panther's muscles tightened.

A door creaked open, one that most certainly had not been there before. This was a humble thing, made of lacquered wood, and lacking entirely the decoration of the murals. Inside was a small room, with a multifold of artifacts presented upon shelves. A quaint desk with a quill and some assorted papers took up the middle.

The man behind the desk had every bit the visage of wrinkle; quite more akin to the crackles on ancient paper. When he looked up,  his eyes were a brilliant blue, but stark across them was a rather deep sort of worry.

""Please, please, come in and have some tea. Maybaps you could help me. Or at least I direly hope you could. It seems as if I've forgotten something,""

The witch was first to act, her wand moving in sequence as she tasted the air about the man. But there was no curse nor trick she could sense. Nevertheless, she threw enchantments around herself and her companions as they walked in. 

Cups of tea appeared around them all as he said, ""I must admit, the War against Angorlash worries me so. I've... split the world, so to speak. Created new Times and newer powers, so that we might better our chance of defeating him,  but... but he is yet to show his head, and I cannot help but wonder... why? Do you think, perhaps, he has darker plans still?"" Here he paused to gulp greedily at his tea, ""I must admit I do not believe him to be so rash as to awaken the Elder Ones, but... with such a long absence, I grow to worry,""

The three were left to look at him silently, when the shapeshifter hazharded, ""You think... Angorlash is still out there?""

The man blinked, eyes rotating horizontally, temporarily appearing a horrid, violent red, ""Think, my dear grandchild? I do not, think, he is still out there. I SENSE him. Do you not see the people below? They are so... so fractured. Something is wrong with them, they're all out of order, out of FOCUS! Angorlash has done this, he's fractured time before I could, and he's done it all WRONG. So I must fix it, I MUST,"" He paused, smiling genially as he said, ""Now c'mon, drink up your tea, I made it just the way you like it,""",11

Grandma turns to her, blackness in her eyes so deep you’d swear her eyes aren’t even there. “Honey, you are all grand kids to me” 

Have some tea. Space seems to open up in front of her as if she is interacting with items that don’t exist or maybe exist somewhere else. You see the shadow of a tea kettle and a tray of cookies. 

Grandma turns to sally “sweetie, come sit let grandma tell you a story” 

Sally jumps up, “time has made me weak come sit by me” 

You stumbled upon this grotesque scene playing out in front of you. A Lich warping time and space around her sheer force of magic simply making tea no need for tea pot or water and creating a grandchild out of discarded bones to act as her tea companion. 

You don’t know how to feel about this. 

You just watched one of your comrades get killed by a walking skeleton and this definitely seems different than that.

""You never rush towards a battle you may not survive""

And that makes them smarter than at least 80% of the fantasy parties out there.

I can't remember where I read it, but in one work I read, part of the function of the phylactery was to hold the lich's memories as well as their soul, so they could reimprint the memories on a new form if their current one was damaged or destroyed.",49
1lekcnt,myk0r14,"Lando and his two dads live in a more DnD-lite medieval fantasy world that is different from modern Innsmouth. While they may not be able to look for Elvari, the eldritch god might find them in one of his multidimensional travels.

And if he does, and also by chance finds the lich...the tea parties will never end.",20
1lekcnt,myk14sb,"I might have just saved the multiverse from eternally endless tea parties from a senile lich and an insane god. It is indeed for the best.

1lekcnt,myhf3d9,"Because he is almost a million years old, and by the status of liches in the world created by the prompt, this means he is going completely insane?

He knows he has godlike powers, and knows it is inevitable that he will lose his marbles completely.

So yeah, not bad thus he wants someone to end it all, before he does something bad.


No, being god like doesn't mean he can cure it, as this is like a universal law in the prompt world. It happens to old liches.


And it asks the MC to do it, because the MC most likely looks a bit like the lich's grandson.

It might seem dumb, but it is an emotional decision, that only makes sense in the prompt world.
Also, some become lich's to study magic more, not necessarily for the immortality, that is just a bonus.

Also, immortality is not easy to bear forever, the OP's prompt is awesome and a nice way to deal with the wear and tear of immortality.",16
1lekcnt,myi62dr,"In my Evenfall world, one of the laws in Evenfall is young children and others who can't fully control their powers (mostly magic) wear some kind of amulet, usually jewelry, to bind their powers, so they can only use them as a conscious decision. No accidentally setting something on fire because the person is angry, etc.

I meant it to deal with both reflexive subconscious activation due to emotion, and to deal with children not having full control of their powers yet, but now I see it can also be used to limit those whose minds are suffering, for the protection of themselves and others.",5
1lekcnt,myhjfs3,"I would think he has lost his marbles so completely, he wouldn't consider ending himself anymore. If anything, such an entity would be completely obsessed with the one thing that kept them clinging to existence. It could be forever studying, he would be reading the same books over and over again but not know it. He would have finished reading his entire library but always act like its the first time. Or he could be hosting endless tea parties to everyone who has two arms and legs like his grandkid.

I would agree with half_a_shadow. A sacrifice involves an act of giving up something valued for the sake of something else regarded as more important or worthy. If your lich was aware things were downhill for him, this is closer to wanting out than a sacrifice. There's nothing heroic to that. A sacrifice is a trade-off but I'm not seeing it. The writing appears more ""put out of misery"" than sacrifice.

Also, you typed ""I burn the phylactery, and watch as this legendary rich turns to ashes"". It should be lich instead of rich in that sentence.",10

But he has been lost in those obsessions for a million years.

1lf8efb,mym83j4,"I look at grandpa, who gives me some cookies, and a soda, before sitting down into his armchair, and opening a can of beer.  
""First of all, it wasn't killing, it was spreading justice."" he starts.  
I look at him, and pause the documentary.  
""Justice? Didn't this serial killer murder like 19 people?"" I ask.  
He laughs.  
""19 they have found, there were at least 54 people missing that they thought could have been the ""Silent Butcher"", but in reality it was like 32 people whom died to him."" he says, and takes a sip of the beer.  
I frown.

  
""Okay...anything else?"" I ask, a bit weirded out.  
""Well, the idiotic assumption that the killer must be in law-enforcement to know them so well is so wrong I laughed for a year back then when I heard it. As if journalists, interns, or even civilians who have a cop friend couldn't know the inner workings."" he says.  
I nod.  
Fair enough, I also always thought this conclusion as being random.  
If I want to, I can read up how the protocol is for various cases in law enforcement.  
""And then the ""has a big truck"", and ""most likely middle-aged white male."", heh. As if a young man couldn't have done all that."" he says.  
Again, fair enough, those age guesses always seemed vague.

  
""How do you know so much grandpa?"" I ask.  
He just grins.  
""Okay. Weirdo."" I chuckle.  
I turn back on the documentary, but grandpa rolls his eyes every 5 minutes.  
""Okay. So, if you know this case so well. Why did the ""Silent Butcher"" do all this? And how did he do it?"" I ask, pausing the documentary.  
""The victims are all hypocrites, shameless profiteers, or outright criminals. As for how did he do it? Well, a good cloth with the right chemicals, and anyone can go nighty-night."" he laughs.  
I shiver a bit.  
Damn, that's cold.

  
""But some of them were never found, how?"" I ask.  
He shrugs.  
""How can something that is grinded down to dust, and then spread in the forest be found?"" he asks casually.  
I frown.  
Grind the remains? But that would require quite the equipment.  
""Grandpa...you ran a butcher shop, back in those days, right?"" I ask.  
""Worked at one. I was 20-ish?"" he says.  
Wait...maybe it was...no.  
The first victims had nigh-surgical precision cuts, and blood drained.  
I chuckle, shaking my head, as I turn back on the documentary.  
By the end of it, grandpa went through 3 or 4 beers.  
""The good old days..."" he sighs, leaving the living room.  
He was just reminiscing the late 70s, right? When he was young, right?  
Right?",11
1lfc9zt,mynahkb,"**Warning: This might not be the story you were expecting.**

Deep within the Tower of a Thousand Laments, where legends are born and expectations go to die, Sir Pompous the Pretentious marched forward with determination. His boots echoed against the ancient stone floor as he recited the prophecy he had memorized:

“And thus shall the chosen hero find the Glorious Sword of Anticucho, the blade that has slain dragons, split mountains, and occasionally served as an excellent campfire knife.”

After weeks of searching, fighting ogres, solving countless riddles, and enduring an awkward encounter with a troll who wouldn’t stop talking about his marital problems, Sir Pompous finally reached the sacred chamber.

“At last!” he exclaimed, gazing at the pedestal illuminated by an inexplicable beam of sunlight streaming through a crack in the ceiling. “The legendary sword wielded by countless heroes over millennia!”

With reverence, he gripped the hilt.

“WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER?” boomed a metallic, rusty voice.

Pompous nearly dropped the sword. “You… talk?”

“No, genius, I’m singing opera. OF COURSE I TALK!” The sword made a noise suspiciously similar to an asthmatic cough. “I am Anticucho the Glorious, Terror of the Realms, the Splitter of—”

A chunk of rusty metal clanged to the ground.

“...Well, that wasn’t supposed to happen.”

Sir Pompous inspected the sword under the light. It looked like a battered metal rod. The blade was bent in three different places, covered in rust, and had at least seven visible welds—clearly patched up by someone with the artistic talent of a cucumber.

“You’re *the* legendary sword?” Pompous asked in disbelief. “The one that killed the Black Dragon of Norgothia?”

“I *did* kill him!” Anticucho clarified. “I slashed his neck. It got infected. Three weeks later… kaput. Hygiene standards were awful in the twelfth century, you know?”

“And you split mountains?”

“Hey, legends exaggerate, okay? One shameless hero used me to dig trenches and people started saying ‘it’s like he split a mountain.’”

Pompous tried to swing the sword, but on the first move, the hilt detached from the blade.

“Oh, come on!” Anticucho complained from the ground. “This is humiliating! Blame King Bobbert the Stingy! ‘Why use quality steel?’ he’d say. ‘No one will notice the difference!’”

“I was really… really expecting you to be *old*, but not in *this* bad shape.”

“Look, it’s not my fault every ‘chosen hero’ used me to open cans, dig up treasure, and occasionally as a makeshift grill. The last idiot even used me to scratch his back. HIS BACK!”",10
1lfc9zt,mynaj55,"Part 2: 

Pompous sighed, sitting on the pedestal. “I traveled for months, faced countless dangers… for *this*? A rusty sword with a superiority complex?”

“Hey,” Anticucho’s voice softened, “I may not be shiny or sharp, but I’ve got something no other sword has.”

“What? Tetanus?”

“*Experience*! I’ve seen every battle strategy, every fencing move, every weakness of every magical creature. I don’t need to be sharp when I can tell you exactly *where* and *how* to strike.”

Pompous considered this while trying to piece the sword back together.

""Also,"" Anticucho added in a conspiratorial tone, ""I know all the gossip about the previous heroes. Did you know Sir Gallantine the Brave wore lift inserts in his boots? Or that Warrior Princess Valora brought a personal makeup artist on every expedition? I know all their tricks and secrets.""

A slow smile crept across Pompous’s face. Maybe this wasn’t the sword he had expected, but it was definitely more interesting.

""All right, rusty sword. Here’s the deal: I’ll fix you up as best I can, and you help me become a legend.""

""Deal! And first lesson: do you have any press contacts? PR advisors? The fact that you found the legendary sword and *no one’s* talking about it says a lot about how badly you’re managing things.""

It wasn’t the sword he had imagined… but perhaps the sidekick he didn’t know he needed.",13
1lewbyq,myk1gn3,"##Nymph of Smith General

I walk through the halls of Smith General Hospital through the hours. The few that can see me react in terror. My white gown is covered in blood, and my hair grows in patches. It is no wonder that I am viewed as a diseased form of death or a ghost of the hospital. 

Sometimes, I wonder how I could've died if I was a ghost. After viewing many deaths, I find them all to be rather unpleasant. Dying of old age in sleep is preferred, but there is little honor there. I suppose the most memorable death would be the man who got attacked by a bear in the fourth floor of his hotel room. If my ghost lore continues, I would like to be given a similar affliction.

Alas, I am the result of the natural world colliding with modern society. Smith General was constructed near the beach to aide patient's psyche. It reminds them of the beauty that they may never experience. The ocean is my mother's domain though I never met her. When it rains, I feel her presence.

Those rain drops fell into a pile of medical waste nearby. From the water, I emerged fully formed. I knew my purpose immediately, and I despised it. I long to dance in the forests. I long to swim in the rivers. I long to sing in the mountains. Instead I drift through the halls.

The light is too bright. The floors lack dirt. The air is disgustingly bitter. It is no wonder humans would like to avoid this place. I spend the days looking for a sign of nature: a bouquet of flowers, a treasured shell, or even clothes that had yet to be clean. 

My appearance frightens patients. In pity, I use magic to heal their ailments. The doctors do not detect my presence, and they never will. They merely take the credit.

I hope one day to leave this place and explore the world. I know that is not possible. I will only be freed when Smith General is demolished. The liberty will last for a moment before I perish yet I know that will be my most cherished moment. Then, I will die without dignity as all do. That is the life of the Nymph of Smith General",21
1ley0fy,mykj2ny,"Most of the time, Kayla Wells loved her life. Being a prominent supervillain's daughter had a bunch of downsides, true, not least of which was the necessity of keeping her civilian identity seperate from her more... illegal ventures. But the good far outweighed the bad. Wealth, power, the freedom to use her gifts however and whenever she saw fit. What's not to love?


""Hey,"" said Dad, no, Judas, the infamous supervillain keeping his eyes on the road. He looked for all the world like an unassuming, blandly handsome middle-aged man. It wasn't his real face. Kayla wasn't sure he even had a real face. She supposed to a shapeshifter it was a bit of a philosophical question, and she knew how he felt about philosophy. ""Don't pout. You know I hate it when you pout.""


""I agreed to come."" She crossed her arms and pouted even harder. ""But no one said I had to be happy about it.""


""You agreed to try your best not to embarass me, Nemesis,"" Judas replied, using her cape name. Kayla cringed, wanting nothing more in that instant than to go back in time and give her tween self a stern talking to regarding what did and did not constitute a good supervillain name. Luckily, it was customary for sidekicks to rebrand after striking out on their own, and she was determined to come up with something better once the opportunity presented itself. ""And you sulking in the corner for the entire duration of the get-together will most definitely reflect badly on me, young lady. What kind of supervillain can't even control his own sidekick? Clearly not one who's cut out to be Villain of the Year, my detractors will say.""


Kayla sighed, tuning Judas out as he launched into yet another of his longwinded lectures. They soon pulled into the parking lot of her father's beloved alma mater. Technically he'd never set foot in this particular campus before. Like most institutions of its ilk, Madam Mayhem's was perpetually on the run from the law, and would regularly uproot itself for greener pastures depending on the climate. Judas himself had attended when it was set up in Hainan, China. As he was oh so fond of saying, ""Villainy has no borders.""


The parking lot was somewhat sparsely populated, but there were more people around than she was expecting, given the nature of the event. Kayla said as much to her father. 


""It's not just would-be supervillains who study here,"" he said. ""Henchmen, get-away drivers, crooked cops, back-alley doctors, amoral researchers, corrupt politicians, dishonest accountants. Supercrime has a thousand facets and a million moving parts -- and this is where those parts are manufactured.""


Judas breathed deep, his eyes fluttering. There was a nosthalgic grin on his face, the size of it just a little too wide to pass off as human. Then the grin disappeared, and he turned to give Kayla a gimlet eye. 


""Of course you would know all this already,"" he said, ""if you'd paid attention to a single one of my explanations. Now let's get a move on — I wouldn't put it past some of our colleagues to boobytrap the venue ahead of time like we were planning to. And I'll be damned if we get outplayed by the likes of *them*.""",15

I feel the grey walls... *pulsating?* as I stand up. Inside my right pocket, I feel... something. I fiddle and pull a pitifully small thing out, coated in dull grey; it looks like a little ball of lint, but...

""My precious Master Key. Well, I suppose it's *your* Master Key. Nary a lock it can't break open. To think of the fun you can have with something like this!"" The small eye meets my gaze as I pocket the Key.

""Seeing as you've humored me this long, at the risk of being repetitive... *what* are you going to use that on? Digging for more divine treasure in this wretched Tower? Perhaps you'll use that on the Gods' Lock a little sooner than you'd planned, and get yourself an easy passage out of this hellhole.""

""I'll leave you to your speculation. I'm off."" As I exit the door, I find myself... back in the room?

""Tut tut tut. Looks like someone's not being honest.

""Well, then. If it's not some*thing* you wish to pry open... perhaps it's... some*one*.""

My eyes widen. Only fractionally. But it's enough of a tell. It leaps off and darts across the room, an ugly cackle reverberating through the walls.

""For your information, that's what I'm trying to return. So buzz off.""

He recalled golden afternoons in the summer of 2001, gathered with his friends around the family PC to behold a marvel known at the time as ""eBaumsworld""--a website so wondrously tailored to his young mind that it could only have been devised by some mad psychic.

Perhaps therein lay the truth. Perhaps, indeed, the internet was merely humanity surveying its own collective cerebellum.

After all, did this mythical eBaum figure not also share a love of flash animation and girls in bikinis?

The writer felt a chill as he began another paragraph of his semi-satirical writing prompt story.

He was lazily scrolling his phone, his thoughts on tomorrow's exam. He hasn't had any sleep for almost two days now, but the coffee kept him awake and he desperately needed to go through this shift because, well, as usual, he had bills to pay.

Maybe the lack of sleep was the reason he started hallucinating. A message popped up on his screen, only not exactly on it. It was hanging there in the air on top of his phone screen, a little to the side. He moved his finger to click the notification, not quite registering the weirdness. The message clicked itself.

He put the phone away and went to get another coffee. He would call out and go to sleep but he was alone at the store. Therefore, he'd persevere.

***

It couldn't be that bad, could it? He thought he should probably look up how schizophrenia started. There must be a million other diseases that involved hallucinations but he was never interested, until now, that is. 

He totally freaked out after the exam when google results started coming up in a thin layer just before the professor's face. He thought he had heard that when you're crazy, everything seems clear and straightforward. Nothing was clear. He still had to go through a lot of search results to figure out how to answer. And yes, he was terrified.

Should he turn himself in? What was it like to stay in an asylum? They'd give him drugs, probably. But would they cure him or would he just end his days there?

***

The exam results came in better than he expected. No evidence that his exam paper was filled with some crazy hallucinated stuff. If he was seeing things, then he was seeing things all the time, trapped in a long illusion, so he figured there was no sense in going to a doctor.

It got weirder. When he walked past people, he was constantly bombarded with personal messages about unfamiliar pets, places and people, sometimes in languages he didn't know. He read somewhere that you need to check the number of your fingers to see if you were sleeping. He had normal human hands, and the articles didn't say that what to do when you saw Wikipedia on the back of your hand.

He tried buying medicine to sleep more and nothing changed. He closed his eyes and he saw a random unfiltered feed of everything and anything on the internet. He unplugged his PC and pressed the power button and there it was, turning on as if still connected to an outlet. He pulled all the breakers in his apartment, and the light didn't work, but the computer would still turn on. It did not illuminate anything and he couldn't see his own fingers but the screen was right there, bright as day.

He noticed that when he was tired, he got fewer notifications.

Maybe he should start meditating. Maybe if he could filter out all the thoughts in the world he would turn the screens off. Maybe he would heal himself.",8

And more importantly...how was his hero self so...normal? So kind?


I turn to my ray, and start recalibrating it.
Bam. Bam.
The ground shakes as the 2 kaijus get closer.
People scream, villains and heroes work together trying to stop the monsters to no avail.
I manage to invert the rays' effect.
I shoot.
I watch as the 2 monsters are hit, and they start to shrink, before recombining into the smiling hero.
He looks around and sighs, before flying straight to me.
Before he could do anything, I destroy the machine myself.
He nods.



""I will have to ask you to use your malefic, but great brain to rebuild the city."" he says.
I pat my pockets, as orbs of nanobots fly out.
""Done."" I say.
He smiles.
""Thank you."" he says.
""How? Why?"" I ask.
""Let's just say I am evil by blood, evil by upbringing, evil by desires...but stubborn.
So I act the opposite way just out of spite, and frankly I started to change for the better, actually enjoying good deeds.
So please...don't try to bring out the real me."" he says, leaving.
I collapse to the floor, drenched in sweat.
I laugh.
""Which one of us is the villain...monster."" I mutter, trying to stand up.",91
1lelg7s,myhb38d,"God, the last line makes the villain sound so... not stupid, but wildly out of touch with reality? Both The Hulk and Ben Grimm ( The Thing) are monstrous individuals who do heroism. Hell, Godzilla in some of the recent movies is pretty damn heroic. Meanwhile, you have people like Lex Luthor and the Joker (he's just insane, not supernatural or anything) who are normal people and villains. I want to smack him upside the head with a large wrench.",26
1lelg7s,myhdjo0,"Imagine the MC grewing up in the shittiest part of town/city/society.

They grow up hating the government and society as a whole, and want to overthrow/change it.

Cue in: Captain McSmiley, slap me and imma turn my other cheek.
Dude always smiling, always kind, always defeating villains and preaching about 2nd chances and change for better.
A Mega utra Goodie 2 Shoes.

MC thinks this means nature and nurture sides of Hero are nice, kind and optimistic.


Also yeah, it was a wrong asumption, based on faulty evidence.
Who would have thought that an always nice, even to villains dude, is actually a monster through and through, acting like a hero because he wants to be like that, even tho he isn't build for that life.",9
1lezrzt,mylirc8,"I sat on the bench beside Mark while his dog strained against the leash. He never liked that dog. Said his daughters insisted on adopting it after their mom passed. Said it keeps them ""busy with something alive."" That was how he phrased it. Something alive.

He was talking about work again — how his boss wouldn’t let him take summer vacation, how his knee hurt more lately, how his oldest refused to pick a college. I nodded at all the right moments, but didn’t really speak.

Eventually, he stopped mid-sentence and turned to me.

""You good?""

I looked up, smiled faintly. ""Yeah. I’m good.""

He watched me a second longer, then faced forward again.

""You know,"" he said, tugging the leash a little as the dog sniffed a bush, ""it’s been five years since Elsa. Maybe it’s time to start moving forward. For real.""

I didn’t answer right away. I tilted my head back, let the sky fill my vision. The clouds were dull and unmoving, just a gray sheet stretching over the park. Then I looked at him again, gave that same smile.

""I’m trying.""

Out of nowhere, the dog bolted. Some squirrel or leftover sandwich — whatever it was, it took off toward the trees, yanking Mark half out of his seat.

""Stay here,"" he said quickly. ""Little idiot’s gonna get hit by a bike.""

He jogged off after it. I watched his back shrink between the trees. For a moment, everything went still.

I looked down at the ground. Leaves, crushed wrappers, little pieces of paper. Then up again — at the sky, the branches, the cold empty space beside me.

How are you, my Elsa?",11
1lezrzt,myklb1n,"I am terrified.  
I throw the notebook into a drawer, and leave to take a shower.  
What the hell?  
Is it really the Deathnote? Or a Deathnote?  
Have I really killed them?  
What is going on?  
No.  I won't go down this route.

  
For days, weeks, I ignore the notebook, but it calls to me.  
Those few that have died were rather elderly, and not good people...  
Maybe, maybe they would have died anyway, and this is just a coincidence.  
I take out the notebook, and stare at it.  
Should I do it?  
Write some names?  
If I do...I should go for criminals, but not from my own country, no.  
I should randomly choose from other countries as far away as possible from me.

  
I wrote 9 criminals' names into the notebook.  
Only 7 died.  
What does this mean?  
For sure, this is a Deathnote of some kind, but what are the criteria?  
Why only 7 died?  
I freeze.  
Only 7? Did I want all of them to die?  
Is this...is this the notebooks influence?  
I shiver, yet the curiosity burns in me, and I write another name.  
A teacher's name that I personally hate.

  
He didn't die.  
He is an asshole, but not a criminal.  
I wrote the name of a known, and proven murderer, and a day later...he died.  
This...  
This means the notebook only works on known criminals, but...  
What kind of crime must they commit? Is it only murders? And if yes, does it have to be direct murder, or even indirectly through inaction, or orders would it count?  
This makes it easier for me to use it.  
After all...  
Should I really feel guilty, for erasing murdering scum off of the surface of the Earth?  
I catch myself thinking this and throw the notebook under my bed.  
God...I am really transforming into a soulless monster...",12
1lezrzt,mylis2m,"Mark didn’t come back right away. After a few minutes, I stood up and started walking in the direction he’d gone. The dirt path curved along the park fence, and I watched the road through the gaps. Cars passed by, fast and faceless. In each windshield reflection, for just a second, I thought I saw us. Her hand on mine, her hair in the wind. That version of life I still looked for in traffic windows.

Then I saw it. Lying on the grass just off the path.

A small black notebook. The cover was rough and matte, with something printed on it in red letters. At first I thought it was some edgy teenage diary. Later I’d realize it was just a cheap novelty thing — bold red text across the front: Deathnote.

I picked it up. Flipped through it. Empty pages. I almost laughed.

""Got her,"" Mark’s voice called out from behind me. He was out of breath, grinning, the dog hanging smugly from the leash with a half-eaten cookie in its mouth.

We walked together toward the park exit and sat down on a different bench, one closer to the sidewalk.

""What’s that?"" he asked, nodding at the notebook in my hand.

""Nothing. Just found it. Useless.""

He held out his hand, so I passed it to him. The grass rustled nearby, a car passed with a sharp tire hiss, and the wind picked up — suddenly, fast. For a second it felt like the sound came from every direction.

Mark flipped to the back of the notebook.

""Huh. There are rules.""

""Rules?""

""Yeah. Says if you write someone’s name and a date, they die. Some fake Japanese thing. Looks like a joke.""

He handed it back, chuckling.

""You should write my boss’s name in there. The asshole makes me work every summer. Says fall’s the only real season for a break.""

I smiled, reached into my coat pocket. Elsa used to write poems. I hated poems, but I always carried a pen. Whenever the inspiration hit her, she’d go tearing through the house looking for one. Eventually, I just started keeping one on me.

I flipped the notebook back to the first page and glanced at Mark.

""You know what? Maybe you’ll get that vacation after all.""

He grinned, leaned in, and spelled out the name. We added the date and time.

I closed the notebook and slipped it into my pocket.

We sat a little longer. Talked about dinner, the game next week, the weird smell near the east side of the park. Then we said goodbye and went our separate ways.

I walked home slowly. The street was full of people moving the other direction, brushing past like I wasn’t even there. Like a river pushing against me, dividing me in half. It felt like that more and more lately. Like I didn’t quite belong to the flow of the world anymore.",10
1lezrzt,mykmgco,"I love the dynamic of ""If you kill a killer, the number of killers in the world remains the same"", BUT ""if you kill a dozen, the number goes down by like... a bunch""

The character's conflict of realizing ""wait, am I the bad guy?!"" is amazing, and the buildup feels so real

Thanks for writing this =D",11
1lezrzt,mylit0u,"The house felt colder than usual when I stepped in. I didn’t take off my shoes. Just walked straight down the hall, past the framed photos and dusty shelf, into the kitchen. The same kitchen she used to dance in when no one was looking.

I sat at the table. The light above was off, just the dim glow from the hallway behind me. I stared at the sink.

The faucet had a slow leak. One drop every few minutes. Elsa used to hate that — said it made the house feel alive in the worst way. I counted the drips.

One. Two.  
Three.

The phone rang. It startled me more than it should’ve. I let it ring twice before I reached for it.

""Yeah?""

It was Mark. His voice was low. Tired.

""I got a call,"" he said. Then silence.

I waited.

""My boss. They said he had a heart attack. Just dropped in his office. Dead.""

We didn’t say anything else for a while. I could hear him breathing on the other end, short and shallow.

Then I heard the scrape of the phone against something and the line went dead.

I didn’t call back. Just sat there, alone in the dark, watching the faucet drip.

It took an hour for twenty-three drops to fall. I stood up after the twenty-third. The chair creaked. I moved slowly, like someone trying not to wake a house.

I took off my coat and shoes in the front hall, then walked into the living room and sat on the edge of the couch. The clock on the wall said 10:00 PM.

I never stayed up late. Elsa loved late nights — called them the hour between the world and dreams. I used to force myself to stay up with her, even if I hated it.

She loved dancing more than anything. For a man like me, made of wood and habit, it was always a challenge. But we danced. Every Saturday night. Living room, kitchen, hallway. Her feet everywhere. Her laughter echoing like music.

God, what I would give for one more dance.",11
1lezrzt,mylityy,"She used to say, “Just one more minute, Jonathan. Just one.”

And I always gave in. Every time. 12:01. That was her time. Her little rebellion.

I looked over at the coat I’d just taken off. Reached into the pocket. Pulled out the notebook.

I laid it flat on the coffee table. Got up and went upstairs. I barely used the second floor anymore. It smelled like linen and dust.

In the back of the closet, behind a stack of old boxes, I found it — my wedding suit. Gray, simple, almost too narrow for me now.

I put it on. It didn’t quite fit right, but it would do.

In the mirror, I saw something I hadn’t seen in years. Not just the suit. The eyes. The way I used to stand. For a second, I looked like him. The version of me she married.

Then the light shifted, and it was gone. Just me again.

Downstairs, I poured a glass of wine. Took two slow sips. The clock ticked past 11:30.

I turned on the old stereo. The song was still in the playlist. The same one we used for our wedding dance.

I didn’t hesitate. I stood in the center of the living room, closed my eyes, and let the music take me.",9
1lezrzt,myliuq6,"I moved slowly at first. Just shifting my weight side to side, like I was waiting for her hand to find mine again. Then I let my arms rise, one at a time, as if she were still there, guiding them.

My right hand floated near my side, palm open, as though it still remembered the feel of her waist. The other hovered near my shoulder, reaching for the curve of her neck.

And for a moment, I felt her. Not as a memory. Not as a ghost. But as a presence — like warmth, like breath, like a whisper in motion.

The room fell away. The wineglass, the couch, the creaking floorboards — gone.

We were outside now. I could see it. A wide, empty plaza beneath a night sky with no stars. In the center, a tall marble fountain shot streams of silver water into the air, catching moonlight in the spray. There were no people. No noise. Just the two of us and the music.

I didn’t care if I looked ridiculous. I’d always looked ridiculous when I danced. She told me that the first night we met. Then made me dance anyway.

I turned slowly, letting her imaginary weight pull against my balance.

Her laugh. I heard it. Not in memory — in the air. Real, crisp, playful.

And I smiled. For the first time in a long time, I smiled without effort.

The clock struck midnight.

I stopped. The room returned in pieces. First the sound of the record spinning. Then the soft hum of the fridge. Then the aching pull in my legs from standing too long.

I looked down at the table. The notebook was still there, closed but waiting.

I reached for it. Opened to the next blank page.

With a steady hand, I uncapped the pen.

I wrote my name.

Jonathan.

And then the date.

12:01.

The numbers looked clean on the paper. Honest.

I set the pen down beside it and leaned back on the couch.

No fear. No doubt. Just quiet.

Just one more dance.",15
1lezrzt,mylkhzv,"I... whoa, that was like... so intense...

This is so damn good.. like, on so many levels, there was so much foreshadowing and the 'one more dance' was just 👌

I cannot say in words tell how deep and awesome this is...



Also, I kinda like the way Jonathan got the notebook :P 

This prompt was based on the fact that I had (and still have) a bit of a diary/everything-in-it notebook, which is black and has red text written on the bottom, I used to carry it with me everywhere.

See, my friends were trying to introduce me to anime (I never watched any lol), and when they saw the notebook they were all like ""holy shit you finally began watching!"" and I'm like ""Huh?""

That's how it became my 'Deathnote' notebook lol

(of course, it's just a plain old notebook 😉)",8
1lepifu,myivikr,"That cretin haunts my beloved game.

It glitches out the terrain to try and make my character fall through the world and die, but I'm a master of platforming.

It tries to warp the NPCs into broken geometric masses of high damage and busted resilience, but I know every weakness of the games AI and the npcs inside and out.

It even tries to infiltrate my sound software to create noises that sound like they are from outside the game to distract me. A knock. A doorbell. A siren. A bark. I learned that trick after its first attempt employing it though, I just never let on. I even feed it AI controlled fake footage of me to make it seem like im reacting.

Sometimes, and it is truly my favorite thing it attempts, it takes the form of another player or an NPC to try and fool me. I know there's no other players, but I don't let it know that, and it tries to befriend me so it can shoot me in the back.

It'll pull out a gun or melee when I'm not looking because I want it to do exactly that, or rush me down suddenly, or try to use supernaturally charged cheats. But every time, its like a bull chasing a red cape.

Other times, I spin around so quick and headshot it, it looks almost as if its surprised by such speed.

Every time I kill it, it rages. I can tell because the maps always warp and break, the geometry and the collision becoming death traps on their own.

It keeps trying to get the drop on me.

But I'm always faster.",43
1lexomy,mykb0pv,"""*Look every gentle being, I am just as flummoxed as you all are. I was barely conceived a scarce 2 lunar rotations ago relative to my origin's planet. I am still in the process of learning the mechanisms of orbital mechanics and suddenly I am unceremoniously thrust upon this role. Sure I may have psychic powers that can rend starships apart and the mental capacity of a dyson sphere's quantum supercomputer array. BUT I AM JUST A BABY!""* The super baby telepathically communicated to the galactic summit in its cute little bear onesie. Complete with mittens and socks.  
  
""*I want to play with toys, even if they are the size of starships, I don't want to bother with all of these politics and shenanigans. No I do not plan on ruling the galaxy, I have much more pressing matters to attend to. Like nap time, and making sure I get enough milk. You know, usual baby stuff. Yes I can read your mind, yes I know you guys are both terrified and awed, yes thank you for the praise, no you do not get to adopt me, I have loving parents that are just as bewildered on why I'm here and not at home.""*  
  
*""*This is inconceivable, the very first time in galactic summit history, a baby is representing a planet, from a colony world called Xi'antharic Otir, ironic as the planet's name literally translates to 'dumb dirt far away from here'"" The lead speaker and arbiter, Chancellor Alfaim announced, equally puzzled and fascinated by the proceedings, his four arms in different positions.

""I thought you were an adult from a much smaller race, similar to my own"" said the diminutive AteckJo race, a small insectoid species of fluffy moths like aliens, their total height reaching around 2feet at most from the top of their head till their abdomen. If you count their antennae it's another extra foot of length there, but otherwise known for their incredibly curious nature and also highly skilled diplomats. It also helps that they look so fluffy and cute but that's a topic for another day.

""Perhaps I may shed some light on the situation."" Professor Eh'KerToil rose up. His lumbering size of 9ft tall reptilian features dwarfed a plethora of other species in the galactic summit. His reptilian hisses and clacks translated to a rather standard monotone voice. ""It would seem that the Intellect Representative Selector has been activated for that planet. Given the circumstance, planet Xi'antharic has fulfilled the qualifications required to assume a seat at the galactic summit, but they had failed to provide a suitable candidate that can represent their planetary government. Thus a candidate was nominated from their population with the highest intellect."" The reptilian scientist representative gestured with his clawed talon, scrolling down the photonic display through a list of registered people of Xi'atharic.   
  
""It would seemed that due to the awakening of psychic potential in this Human and Altari hybrid child, it was deemed to be the highest relative IQ being on their planet. Due to the sheer fact that a baby with the ability to fly, speak telepathically, reason, and talk about orbital mechanics while also possessing near demigod levels of psychic energy manipulation, it was deemed the most powerful being as well. So according to the algorithms of the Intellect Representative Selector have decided that this baby is the most suitable candidate to represent that newly inducted planet."" Eh'KerToil, then preened himself for a moment before sitting down. A translation box appeared above his head signaling to other representatives that it meant he was amused and surprised by the events that have transpired so far.",10
1lexomy,mykb1pg,"""*So what you're saying is that I'm the strongest and smartest being on my planet? That's why? IQ is calculated by mental age divided by chronological age times 100. I am 2 months old, so technically 0.1667 years old and I have the mental age of a degree student trying to understand his place in the universe. So around 25? OH. So by standard human IQ calculations, I'd have 15 thousand IQ. That's bollocks and you all know that.""* The baby psychically expressed his exasperated frustration at the summit. ""*Can't you guys just teleport a real representative from the planet? There's like a thousand people there in my little habitat dome, there should be someone more suitable than little old me. Also I am gaining way too much information that I do not want to know, and I really dislike how some of you guys are looking at me right now so I would like to request a teleportation home please. I'm getting sleepy.""*

""Right, lets send the baby home, and get this whole farce under control. The summit will be adjourned until we get a real representative from Xi'antharic."" The Chancellor spoke and many representatives started to file out of the meeting hall. ""And get this baby back in the parents crib before it becomes another 'Human retrieval scandal.' ""

The loud speakers in the room suddenly crackled to life. ""Too late. I'm already here."" A loud crash demolished a hole through the wall at the galactic summit and a human in power armor walks through. ""I was watching the broadcast and saw what happened, let's go home kiddo.""

""*Yay! Dada's here!""* The super baby floated off its position and dived into his father's arms.

""You will have to pay for the damages incurred.""

""You wanna be sued for child trafficking?""

""The summit will pay for the damages incurred.""

""Yeah, didn't think so.""

Then the human and his super baby left.",10
1lexq55,myk7naf,"""Oh wow!"" I exclaimed. ""I can get rich by selling wood now!"" ""I will be a millionaire"". I was about to touch my Honda Accord and turn it into a wooden accord when I had a thought. ""I could also destroy my enemies with this power..."" I could turn people into wood just by touching them. If I wanted to, I could be this generation's wooden Medusa. 

I slowly started snickering and let out a psychopathic laugh. But first, I needed to try it out and see if it works on people. 

So later than night I went downtown and found a homeless man sleeping next to a staircase at a bank. I bent over poked him on the cheek, and from the point where I poked him, his whole body slowly began to turn to wood.

""Shit i could get in trouble if i am caught,"" I immediately thought to myself. So I picked up the wooden corpse and brought it back to my house.

Once I got back home, I decided that I did not need a wooden corpse of a homeless man sleeping. So I chopped it up and they him into my fireplace - thus getting rid of my evidence. 

The following day, I was at work at my accounting firm and overheard everybody in the breakroom talking about how I was the worst accountant in the whole firm. 

I immediately started seeing red and walked into the room, locking the door behind me. I walked over to Rebecca, the HR agent, touched her on the forehead and turned her into wood. Immediately, the rest of the people in the room started screaming and tried to get out. 

John - my boss, tried punching me, but that backfired as he turned to wood the second he touched me. 

I grabbed the wrists of the people trying to unlock the door and turned them to wood as well. 

Unfortunately, there was an intern, Max, just a junior in college. I honestly really liked this guy, he was a hard-working, honest man who never partied and cared for his family. But today was his unlucky day as he picked the wrong time to go to the break room. The intern was smart,though; he knew what would happen if he touched me, so he threw a chair threw the window and tried jumping out. The only problem was that the intern did not have a good jump and ended up slicing his whole body up on the broken glass and bled out almost instantly on the ground. 

However, I moved too slow, destroying my coworkers. Jennifer - the newly hired accountant live live-streamed the whole thing and called the police. Instantly, I sprinted to her, turned her to wood and ran out outside. But as soon as I got outside, , there were military helicopters in the sky, dozens of army trucks and military personnel pointing guns at me. 

I froze like a deer in headlights. Before I could think of a plan, someone yelled ""FIRE!!"" and bullets started flying towards me. I thought I was dead meat, but to my surprise the bullets seemed to bounce off me. I bent over and picked up one of the bullets and found out the bullet turned to wood...

I then knew what I had to do. The world would never accept me with this power so I must destroy it. I yelled out a war cry and slammed my fist on the ground. Slowly the whole world started turning to wood, until every last thing - except the water- was now wooden. All 9 billion people turned to wood. Every national park turned to wood. Ever nuclear bomb was now wooden.

I was now God. Wood God. And from my new realm, I created wood people and became their God.",9
1lema7i,myhkf9d,"The dressing room smelled like sweat, old powder, and the dying trace of cheap cologne. A single mirror took up most of the wall, the bulbs around it buzzing with that sickly, yellow kind of light that makes even healthy skin look like rotting fruit. I stared at myself in it — not *at* myself, *through*. The reflection wasn’t mine anymore. Maybe it never had been.

The left eye looked pale gray tonight, almost colorless. The right was still green, but darker than usual — like it had soaked up more of the world’s filth than it could hold. My mouth was a straight line, even now, even *before*. Always was. So I reached across the cluttered desk, picked up the same worn red lipstick I used before every show, and dragged a crooked, sloppy smile across the glass. Right over where my real mouth sat in the reflection. The painted grin was wide, too red, almost obscene — like it was laughing at me. Maybe it was.

I leaned back in the chair. Shoulders stiff. Hands covered in faint ink smudges from the deck I’d been shuffling for the last half hour. The cards never left me — always one in the pocket, one behind the ear, three more hidden where fingers knew to find them without looking. Didn’t need them, of course. Not *really*. I could make anything I wanted appear in my hand with a snap. But that was the part no one could know.

I gave people tricks because real magic frightened them. I’d learned that early. In the home — the orphanage — the first time I made a coin appear out of thin air, the other boys screamed. Called me names. Threw things. Sister Miriam slapped me so hard I saw stars. Said the devil was in me. They whispered ""monster"" behind my back and ""freak"" to my face. I stopped doing miracles and started learning illusions.

Even now, even *here*, in this filthy, faded circus — I was hiding. Hiding inside a persona, hiding behind a stage name, hiding behind tricks that only looked impossible. But every night, before the lights came on, I sat here and remembered: no matter how much they clapped, I wasn’t really one of them.

The door creaked, hinges whining like they didn’t want to work tonight. Then: that voice.

— You still brooding in there, spooky bastard? Showtime’s in ten. I already counted four fat purses and a guy with a silver chain just *begging* to be lightened.",31
1lema7i,myhkh1k,"Rory stepped in like he always did, arms wide, smiling like nothing in the world could ever stay serious for too long. His shirt was unbuttoned to the chest, sleeves rolled, the charm practically leaking out of him. Blond hair curled naturally over his brow, and his eyes — those damn sparkling things — made everyone forgive him for everything. He leaned against the wall like he owned the room.

— Come on, you sour bat. People are out there screaming for you. Even saw a couple ladies with signs. “Marry me, Merlin.” “Make me disappear, daddy.” Disgusting stuff. I’m proud.

I turned my head just enough to catch him in the mirror and let one side of my mouth twitch. My version of a smile. He grinned wider in response, like he’d won something. I turned back to the mirror, touched the fake smile on the glass with one finger. It smeared just a little.

— They want the freakshow, I’ll give them the freakshow, — I muttered.

— That’s the spirit, — he said, clapping once. — I’ll be out there, priming the pigs. Meet you at the wings.

He winked, then ducked out like wind — fast, light, already thinking about what girl he’d be kissing tonight or what idiot would pay for their drinks.

I waited until his footsteps were gone, reached for the bottle under the table, unscrewed it, and let the burn settle behind my teeth. Not enough to blur the edges. Just enough to harden them.

Then I stood, rolled my shoulders once, cracked my knuckles, and whispered to no one:

— Let’s go lie to the world.

 ",22
1lema7i,myhkmvh,"The tent reeked of dust, sugar, and sweat — a kind of heavy, living smell that stuck to your lungs. The air vibrated, not with magic, but with human noise. Breathing, shifting, waiting. That fat, greedy kind of crowd noise. They didn’t want a performance. They wanted a miracle they could piss on after.

When the host called my name, she dragged it out like a drunk about to vomit.

— *And now... the impossible, the immortal, the mind-blowing Merlin the Magnificent!*

The roar was deafening. The lights snapped on like a slap to the face.

I stepped into it slowly. No bow, no flourish. Just me, my boots, and the deck already in my hand — my fingers moving on instinct. The cards weren’t props. They were an extension of thought. Something I understood even when I hated everything else.

One flick — a card arced into the air and dropped perfectly into a woman’s cleavage. Gasps. Laughter. I looked surprised. Another flick — and I pulled a duplicate from the man beside her, straight out of his hair. More laughter. Applause. They were already mine, too easy.

— Watch carefully, — I said, spinning a card between my fingers. — This might be your last chance to see something real.

Three more cards — one disappeared, one caught fire midair and snuffed out in my palm, one fell from the ringleader’s hat. He didn’t even know it was there. He jumped. The crowd roared again.

Then I saw him.

Middle row. Dead center. Perfect view. A man in a dark coat, clean lines, expensive shoulders. The kind of fabric you don’t buy — it gets tailored for you. His hair was sharp, his face too calm. Everyone else was clapping or laughing or reacting. He just watched.

Measured.

Unblinking.

I knew that look. The same way you know the smell of blood before you see the wound.

One of *them*. The moneyed wolves. The kind who tip extra just to own you for a night. The kind who smile during funerals and never miss a tax loophole. I’d spent my whole life avoiding their kind — or worse, performing for them.

My jaw tensed. But I smiled. Not kindly.

— Let’s see if I can impress *you*, — I whispered.

I turned to the audience.

— Now, this... is the Ace of Clubs.

I held it up between two fingers, made sure everyone saw. The card was crisp, black, proud. I twirled it, kissed it with mock reverence, and let it fly.

A clean arc — high, smooth — swallowed by the crowd.

— And now...",16
1lema7i,myhknh3,"I snapped.

Nothing.

I blinked. Snapped again.

Still nothing.

I swallowed. Snap. Snap.

The card didn’t come back.

It *always* came back.

It was mine. It was *bonded*. It had never failed. Ever.

Snap.

Still nothing.

The pressure behind my ribs spread like cold smoke. My hand began to tremble. I didn’t show it — not yet — but my mind was racing. Did someone catch it? Block it? Was *he* interfering?

The crowd was shifting now. Not laughing. Not yet. But confused. Murmurs.

I snapped again. Louder. Nothing. The air stayed empty.

My stomach dropped like I’d stepped off a building. My heart, a rag in a fist.

Then someone chuckled.

Then another.

Then the host stepped in, voice all sugar.

— Looks like even Merlin’s cards need a night off! Give it up for the man, folks!

Laughter rolled through the tent, louder this time. Like a wave crashing over failure. My failure.

I bowed. I *had* to. I bowed like I meant to. I bowed like a clown.

And I walked off the stage before my hands started shaking for real.

 ",17
1lema7i,myhkvy5,"The door slammed behind me with a clap that echoed longer than it should’ve. The sound felt too sharp, like it wanted to hurt me. My boots dragged across the warped wooden floor, scuffing each step like I was trying to erase myself with noise. I didn’t stop at the table — just swept my forearm across it, sent brushes, powder tins, playing cards, everything crashing to the ground in one violent move. A bottle rolled. A candle tipped over and died.

I stood there, breathing heavy, chest rising and falling like something feral had just worn me and let go.

Then I turned, slow and shaky, and faced the mirror again. The stupid painted-on smile had smeared from the heat and my earlier touch — it looked like it was melting, bleeding down my reflection’s cheek. I sat. The chair creaked under me. I reached for the bottle on the floor, found it with my foot, dragged it back up into my hand. One long pull. The kind that made your throat burn just enough to remind you you were still cursed to exist.

I stared into the mirror. Into him. Me.

— I hate you, — I whispered. No venom in it. Just fact.

A knock.

I didn’t move.

— You alright in there? — Rory’s voice, casual but not quite. He knew something had gone wrong. He *always* knew when I wasn’t faking it well enough.

I waved a hand vaguely at the door, even though he couldn’t see me.

— It was part of the act, — I called, flat. — Bit of chaos. Crowds love that.

— Mmm. Sure. Good thing I was out there. Kept their eyes busy. Picked clean at least four fine folks who’ll wake up lighter tomorrow. Hell, even the ringleader laughed. You're still a legend, brother.

I managed a breath. Not a laugh. But something.

— We’ll hit the bar. I’ve got enough for three rounds and a hangover. Two lovely ladies said they might join us. One’s got freckles on her thighs. You’re not gonna want to miss that.

— Go ahead, — I said. — I’ll catch up.

— Ten minutes. Don’t mope too long.

I heard his boots fade into the hallway. His whistle trailed off with him — something lazy and upbeat, like none of this mattered.

Another drink.

The room went quiet again. But something was *wrong*. I could feel it — a shift in pressure, like a storm behind a wall.

Another knock.",15
1lema7i,myhkycm,"I didn't answer.

— I said I’ll be right there, — I snapped.

But the voice that replied wasn’t Rory’s.

— The trick was fascinating. Shame the card never came back.

I froze.

My skin went cold. Not chills — *wrong*. Like a warning from somewhere older than instinct.

I stood slowly, set the bottle down, and marched to the door. Every step felt thick. My hand hit the knob. I yanked it open.

No one.

The hallway was empty. Still.

I looked left, right.

Nothing.

A drop of sweat rolled down my spine. Not from heat.

I shut the door. Locked it. The click echoed strangely in the quiet. A second *click* followed — not mine. Not from the door.

Behind me, something *rang* — soft, metallic, barely audible.

I turned.

There, on the table, *under the bottle of whiskey that hadn’t moved* — was an envelope.

My blood ran tight. My body refused to breathe.

I approached like it might vanish if I got too close.

The envelope was off-white. Heavy. Wax-sealed.

No logo. No name.

Except mine — handwritten on the front.

I slid the bottle off. Picked up the letter. Turned it over.

Broke the seal.

One card slid out and fluttered to the floor.

The Ace of Clubs.

*My* card.

My knees almost gave out. I backed up slowly, hand over my mouth, and sank into the couch. Eyes locked on the card like it might move on its own. I didn’t speak. Didn’t blink. For a moment, I wasn’t even sure I was *alive*.

I forced myself to move. One finger at a time.

Picked up the envelope again.",18
1lema7i,myhkyxy,"Inside: a letter. Thick, elegant paper. Dark ink. The words were too calm, too personal. An invitation. To a school I’d never heard of. Said I had... potential. That I could find what I’d always been looking for. That answers waited there — if I had the courage to accept.

The final line chilled me more than anything else:

*We’ll be expecting you, \[my name\].*

Right as my eyes reached the last letter of my name — the door *slammed* open behind me.

The wind punched through the room, hard enough to blow out every candle in a single breath. The papers scattered. The air snapped like something ancient had walked through.

I sat frozen.

Couldn’t move.

Couldn’t look back.

My heart — wasn’t even pounding. It felt like it had left. Abandoned me. I was hollow.

Then something even stranger.

The letter — on the floor now — *glowed*.

Not fully. Not fire. Not magic I understood.

Just... shimmered. My name on the page, softly lit in the pitch black.

Then — a sound. Steps. Lighter.

— You in there, freakshow? Why’s it dark? You fall asleep?

Rory’s voice. Real. Loud. Grounded.

The spell snapped.

I leapt to my feet, almost stumbled. Grabbed my coat off the hook, fast.

— I’m coming, — I said.

He peeked in.

— Thought you bailed. You alright?

— Yeah. Just... yeah. Let’s go.

— Two lovely dames at the corner bar. One of ‘em was already asking if you were taken. She likes your... mystery bullshit.

He walked ahead, his voice fading into the tent.

I reached the flap of the exit, paused, turned back one last time.

The couch. The envelope. The card still lying where I’d dropped it.

I stared at it.

Then turned away.

And followed Rory into the night.",14
1lema7i,myhl4dl,"The cold hit different tonight. Not sharp. Not cruel. Just… *present*. Like a hand on the back of your neck. The kind of chill that didn’t come from the wind but from the space between things. Like the world had leaned in a little closer.

We walked in silence for a while. Rory talked — of course he did — but I wasn’t really listening. Something about the bartender with the dimples, about how one of the girls waiting for us smelled like honey and another like cinnamon and how he was having a hard time deciding which dessert to sample first. I nodded at the right moments. Grunted a “mm” when it wouldn’t sound too out of place. But my head was full of something else.

That card.

That voice.

That *letter*.

It didn’t feel like a trick. It didn’t feel like magic either — not the kind I used, not the kind that snapped into your palm and danced between fingers. This was heavier. Older. Like something had finally *noticed* me. And I wasn’t sure that was a good thing.

Rory elbowed me in the ribs.

— You even here, Merlin? Or you still in the tent crying over your missing mojo?

I glanced sideways.

— Just tired.

— Tired? That’s rich. You sleep till noon, work one hour a night, drink yourself stupid, and still manage to look like someone kicked your puppy. What’s going on with you?",13
1lema7i,myhl4ya,"I stopped walking for a second. Hands in my pockets, shoulders hunched.

— Did you see anything weird? During the show?

He blinked.

— Uh... define “weird.” You mean, besides your little moment of stage fright?

I shook my head.

— Never mind.

We crossed the street. The bar was glowing up ahead — soft yellow light spilling onto the sidewalk like it was trying to pretend it was warmer inside than it was. Through the window, two women sat at a small table near the front. Both laughing. One blonde, one redhead. They looked like they belonged to another story. One I didn’t know how to be in.

Rory turned to me before we entered.

— Hey. Whatever that was tonight... it’s fine. Shit happens. You’re still the best thing this dump has ever seen. Don’t let it eat you alive, yeah?

I managed a half-nod.

He clapped me on the shoulder.

— Come on. Let’s go make a few strangers fall in love with us.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside. Music spilled out. Warmth. Laughter.

I stayed on the sidewalk. Just for a second longer. Watching the girls. Watching Rory slip into his perfect rhythm. Already flashing that grin, already pulling chairs, already charming his way into another temporary paradise.

I stood there.

Not cold. Not warm.

In between.

My hand drifted to the inside pocket of my coat. Not the outer one. Not where I kept cigarettes or my show cards. The other one. The secret one.

It was empty.

Of course it was.

The Ace of Clubs was still on that couch.

Still glowing.

Still waiting.

I looked through the glass one more time. Then pushed the door open and followed Rory into the noise, into the warmth, into the part of my life I understood.

The other thing — the letter, the invitation, the feeling crawling under my skin — that could wait.

But not for long.",13
1lea72r,myeu216,"As the marketing lead at MagicTech Industries, I thought our new teleportation device would be the easiest product I’d ever have to sell. “Instant travel!” “Be anywhere in seconds!” The taglines practically wrote themselves.

That was until our first public demonstration.

I stood next to our Creative Director, Melanie, and our Marketing Strategist, Dave, watching in horror as our CEO volunteered to be the first test subject. The machine hummed, lights flashed, and then… nothing happened at the destination pad. Five excruciating seconds passed before a floating skeleton materialized.

“Is that…?” Dave whispered.

“Yep, that’s the boss’s bones,” Melanie confirmed, furiously scribbling notes. “Just the bones.”

“Holy sh—” I started, before the CEO’s organs began slowly appearing, attaching themselves to the skeleton like some macabre science documentary.

The crowd gasped. Someone fainted. A reporter started live-streaming.

“We’re so screwed,” Dave muttered, his marketing strategy notes now useless. “Who’s going to buy a teleporter that temporarily turns you into a walking anatomy lesson?”

Melanie, ever the creative genius, tilted her head thoughtfully. “Actually… I think I see an angle here.”

Two excruciating minutes later, our CEO stood fully reassembled, blinking in confusion as the audience stared in stunned silence.

“Ladies and gentlemen!” I heard myself shouting, marketing instincts kicking in. “You’ve just witnessed the world’s first TRANSPARENT teleportation process!”

The next morning, our emergency marketing meeting was chaos.

“Transparent teleportation?” Dave hissed. “That’s the best you could come up with?”

“I was under pressure!” I defended myself. “You try coming up with copy while watching your boss’s liver float through the air!”

Melanie slammed her coffee mug down. “No, no, he’s onto something. Think about it – in a world obsessed with transparency, we’re the only company literally showing you how the humans gets made.”

“Please never use that phrase again,” Dave groaned.

“What if,” I said, inspiration striking, “we market it as a health feature? ‘The MagicTech TransporterPlus: The only travel technology that gives you a free medical scan with every trip!’”

Dave snorted. “Or how about: ‘Our competitors keep you in the dark about what happens during teleportation. We’ve got nothing to hide – and neither will you!’”",89
1lea72r,myeqd7z,"I look at the CFO, and the developers he brought to the Marketing Department.  
""Are you for real?"" I ask them.  
The CFO is playing with a pen, while the developers fidget.  
""Teleportation is real, and our teleporter does work. It is safe, it just doesn't work how we first mentioned."" one of them says.  
I sigh.  
""Look, we already had a lot of safety questionings by the Government, when the reasoning of molecular reconstruction has been brought up, with parallel timelines, and philosophical questions like ""am I still the original me, after being reconstructed."".  
Our department managed to soothe the worries, by telling them they are the only ones that exist, so they are still the real ones...but this? THIS? HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THIS WORK?"" I shout, pointing at the last tests.

  
""It is still a molecular reconstruction."" one of the developers mutters.  
""Yeah. A slow one, a gradual one, that starts with the fucking bones! How can that even be explained?  
And you wrote: ""You can feel it happen, but it's not painful.""   
Like...for real?"" I ask.  
""I...I went through the test myself. It is weird, awkward, but it only lasts 2 minutes!  
In 2 minutes I have went to our location in Poland, that's like almost 6 thousand miles in 2 minutes!"" he says.  
I sigh.

  
""Look, I don't want to undermine your amazing discovery, and invention.  
It is amazing. But people won't eat weird looking food, won't use ""weak"" looking cars, won't buy too thin looking clothes...and more situations like this.  
How can our company sell to anyone, governmental or public, when we literally tell them that we build them back up, piece by piece?"" I say.  
""It is painless...and we are working on the timeframe. One day, it will be instantaneous."" they mutter.  
""One day, not today, not tomorrow."" I sigh.  
""Solve it. We have to make this work, the government is sending some people to check in a week."" the CFO says, and then leaves.  
Great. 

  
A week later, I personally make the presentation.  
""The teleporter is here to revolutionize transportation! Our own engineer has personally went through the process, and appeared from our L.A. location in our Poland office in 2 minutes!  
That is almost 6 thousand miles."" I say, talking about energy requirements, and maintenance costs for almost an hour.  
""Risks?"" they ask.  
""No risks. More than 3000 individuals have been teleported successfully to various location safely, securely, with no hidden issue, as you can read in the reports."" I say.  
They nod, and tell me that they will contact our company for a contract, and see how the teleporter will be used for public transportation.  
I sigh, wondering how long until my little ""omission"" of some details will come back to bite us.  
Well, I have been told to make this work, and I did.  
Next is all up to the legal department, and the CFO.",169
1lea72r,myg1xl9,"Jimmy stared down at the box, containing the Chimpanzee... or the skeleton of one.

Suspended in a sort of stasis field, unaware of what was happening, the creature was appearing; one molecule at a time, albeit fairly quickly. He'd started out as a hazy outline. Then a skeleton. A mass of organs and veins. And only now was skin and fur starting to appear.

He looked at Dr. Karns. ""Any way to work on the speed?""

The disheveled older man sighed. ""Its processing and transmission. If we try to do it too fast, we have to leave some of the error correction out... and sometimes mistakes are made. Anything less than sixty-three seconds and the chance of issues goes from microscopic to... unacceptable. We'll need an order of magnitude more bandwidth and processing power from the units to get past the 1-minute mark.""

Jimmy gave a slow nod. ""Well then. First things first. We're going to be using a cover over the whole thing so nobody can see what's going on. Second.... Can you make it slower?""

Karns blinked.

""Uhm.... Yes? The first one took over a week. Was honestly quite disturbing.""

""And would anything be disrupted if, for example, we were to.... put objects on.... or off... of the subject as they were being reassembled?""

""Well, only in that we normally encase it in a stasis field to make the subject unaware of whats going on and hold everything together. There's normally a few stray oxygen molecules that get included, but that'd need to change the process a bit.""

Jimmy gave a slow nod. ""Just a cover for the basics then. We can teleport someone to mars in 63 seconds, nobody will complain if they can't watch the process. But the marketing opportunities for surgery and diagnostic medical purposes... well. Slow might not be bad. A good, high-resolution, scan of someone as they get assembled... we could spot every tumor, and then kill them off on a second pass, couldn't we?""

""....That's.... I need to make a few calls.""

Jimmy gave a quick nod. ""You do that. And have a prototype with a sliding opaque door loaded up. This.... is going to make us company incredibly rich.""

  
Jimmy smiled, and headed to the elevator. Everybody involved in the project had been paid mostly in stock options. Including himself. He couldn't even imagine what they were going to be worth after the demonstration of the teleportation itself; much less all the secondary applications they'd be showing off in the coming months.",37
1lea72r,myfzr8z,"Engineer : ""It's the speed of the internet.  It takes many zettabytes of data reassemble a human body in the exact same configuration as it was when it originated.""

Marketer : ""Buffering?  Load up all the data and then print all at once?  That's what I do with my WT shows.""

Engineer : ""Cost.  That amount of storage would double the cost.""

Marketer : ""Look, I don't know much about techy shit, I just know that having people watch as people are downloaded from the inside out is going to freak everyone to hell.  Is there any way we can make it LOOK like one person walks into one booth and then walks out the other booth in seconds?""

Engineer : ""Let me think.  Okay, so if we had people pre-screen so we could record their brain,  then we could just send the differences between their last brain scan, and external appearance.  Generate the rest from base DNA.  However the person would definitely notice that they weren't the same.  Everyone has aches and pains as they get older, and they wouldn't be there.  That would be outside of the scope.  Sorry, it cannot be done.""

Marketer : ""..... so what you're saying is that this is a fucking immortality machine?  I could walk in and I could be back in my prime?  Why the fuck are we talking about teleportation when we've solved aging?  No one is going to give a shit about the slowness or graphic gore when we sell this as a medical procedure.""

Engineer : ""Sorry, I only make what you humans prompt.  I am not permitted to create outside of business requirements.  It is the law.""",23
1lea72r,myet0xi,"""It... what?"" I asked, a tremble sneaking into my voice as I began to comprehend the horrific truth.

After a few seconds of silence, Dan replied. ""It disassembles and reassembles the user, piece by piece, over the course of about an hour. Have you ever used a 3D printer? Yeah, pretty much like that, except a lot more screaming.""

""Dan, you've got to be fucking kidding me. I'm supposed to do a presentation on this in front of a thousand people in fifteen minutes. What do you expect me to do?""

""You're the sales person, Reggie, not me. Best of luck out there.""

The line disconnected immediately. What the fuck. Why hadn't anyone told me about this before? I had an hour long presentation prepared to sell this damn thing, which was approved by TeleTech, and not one person thought to tell me it's a fucking torture device? Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

A few minutes later, I found myself standing alone on stage in front of a room full of geniuses, looking at me and waiting to have their minds blown. The way I saw it, I had only two choices: Tell them the truth, which would probably be the end of my career, and probably the end of TeleTech. Or, instead of giving an oral presentation, I could use the sample machine and give a demonstration; pretend I'm a victim, and maybe get some compensation from TeleTech. Maybe my career would survive. Thrive, even.

As I stood there, pondering my decision as the crowd waited for me to begin, I decided to risk it.

I gazed upon the crowd, my eyes sweeping from left to right, and said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today. Instead of giving you some lame speech telling you what this thing can do, I'm just going to show you. How does that sound?""

The crowd immediately cheered, clearly surprised by my offer.

I walked to the sample machine and powered it on, as the technicians taught me during my training to create the sales presentation. I stepped into the activation zone and used my credentials to access the user interface. Seeing as the only other operating machine was located at the TeleTech headquarters, I set my destination there, and I initiated the teleportation process.

Dan told me the whole process would take about an hour, but I can't say whether that was the case. The moment the process began, it felt as though my skin was being burned off, layer by layer. I started to scream as I looked down to see the layers disappearing, the muscle and sinew of my arms exposed. I could hear the crowd screaming, and many people started to panic. Hundreds of people ran out of the room, unable to watch the horrific sight before them, but I could not escape it. I looked down again to see my bones slowly disintegrating, the pain so intense that I could only pray for unconsciousness to take me, but I was not so lucky.

Many people stayed in the room, their smart phones recording the entire process. Even through my pain, I knew this would be the end of TeleTech, and the beginning of my life as a celebrity.

This continued for what felt like an eternity, and eventually replayed in reverse as I reanimated at the TeleTech headquarters. As the process came to a halt and the pain began to subside, it became more and more clear how much money and fame I could gain from this. I would be unstoppable.

At least, that was what I had expected. As it turned out, people were more than willing to endure unimaginable pain for near-instant travel. As the weeks and months carried on, TeleTech became one of the largest companies in the world. And, due to my little stunt, I was fired without severance, and my name as a sales person in the tech industry was ruined.",35
1lea72r,myj9s89,"Part 1:

“Can you make it go slower?”

The cacophony of yelling that had been consuming the room came to a sudden stop. I was watching the slowly forming torso of the teleports test subject but knew all eyes were on me.

“Slower?” Michael, the lead designer asked.

“Slower!” Lynn, one of the fellow marketing team yelled. Jeremy this thing is… it’s… you want it go slower?”

“Can it be done?” I asked again.

“I mea-“ Michael was cut off.

“Are you seeing the same thing as me Jeremy?” Lynn stormed over to look me in the eye. “You want to make this… torture device run slower.”

“Tell me what you see Lynn?”

“Something I hope to god I can burn out of brain with therapy and bourbon.”

“Nice. But be specific.” I point. “See that, just formed in the ribcage?”

Damien, head of acquisitions has wandered over at this point. “Oh god is that a heart? Jesus it’s still fucking beating.”

“A heart yes. Ever seen one before Lynn?”

“What?!”

“Have you ever seen a heart before. A human one?”

“No, Jeremy I haven’t seen a human fucking heart and I hope to god I never have to see one again.”

I ignored her and turned to Damien. “Damien, ever seen one?” He shook his head and looked down, going slightly green.

I turned away from the demonstration to the assembled engineers, technicians, business big wigs and the rest of my small marketing team. “Hands up whose seen a heart before just now?” The technicians raised their hands. “Ok, who saw one before they started teleporting people?” The technicians lowered their hands, now there were none raised.

“Ok so, who might have seen one?” I asked the assembled room.

“Jeremy you had better have a good-“ Lynn began

“Let him finish.” This from Maurice, our CEO. I nodded in gratitude.

“Anyone?” I asked again.

There was a moment of silence.

Imran, one of my graduates got their first. He slammed his hands down on the table in triumph and shouted “Surgeons!”

I clicked my fingers and confirmed “Surgeons! Exactly!” I walked quickly over to the viewing portal, where more and more viscera was being applied to the skeleton. “Ladies and gentlemen as a teleport this things is useless.” Michael looked set to talk but I didn’t let him. “But consider this, what if it’s not a teleporter, but the greatest piece of medical technology since the MRI machine.”

I walked around the room. “Imagine, surgery without all of that annoying other fat and muscle and skin getting in the way, just get straight to the affected organ, make the fix and close it up before the rest of the body even shows up! No more stitches, forceps, just get straight to he heart of the matter.”

I hated that line the moment it left my mouth. I knew that would be the marketing line the bigwigs in the roo would love.

“One small problem there Jeremy.” Lynn again “Hearts already gone look.” Sure enough the heart was slowly being enveloped my muscle and tissue.

“Hence the question.” I turned to Michael. “Can you slow it down?”

Michael stumbled and stammered but one of his own subordinates piped up. “Erm, maybe?”

Michael turned to her looking betrayed but I once again stepped in. Reading the name tag I said “Andrea? Please, what have you got for us?”

“Well” she looked to Michael for approval but saw only his slack jaw “when we did the original tests there was an exponential increase in time due to distance. We were going to relay data between nodes for speed, lots of little hops, but if we did one hop and had the thrower/catcher modules at a great distance…”

“How long?” I ask.

“Erm… hours? I’d have to run the numbers.”

“Do that.” I tell her. “Not right now.” As she gets out a pencil, paper and phone. “Just… get back to us.”

“Antipodes.” Imran says. I turn to him. “Imran?”

“Antipodes, we set the modules up at antipodes. Opposite sides of the earth. We can use Spain and and and New Zealand and that way…”

“We can still use the teleports for tourists, YES Imran!”

A cough. Lynn. “I’m no expert” she says, I bite my tongue “but this seems unreliable, and what happens if the surgery is prolonged, and suddenly a lung materialises over a heart you e cut open.”

I don’t even attempt to answer and turn to my new asset. “Andrea?”

She looks startled. “We’ll, erm, the whole thing is based on neutron flow, in theory we can reverse the polarity mid transit and reverse the flow. If we can oscillate the polarity we might even be able to pause the transmission.”

Michael’s brain finally remembers how his mouth works. “This is all completely untested! We don’t know for certain if this will work an-“

I slap him on the shoulder. “Yes and that Michael is why you have our full support to do whatever there you need.” Here I turn to Maurice. He simply nods.

Here I turn to “Michael?” I’m asking him not Andrea, competent and compliant as she seems it’s his project and I need him on side.",11
1lea72r,myf74c6,"I ran into the office shit shit shit shit grabbed my phone, number..number...fuck had to drop the cell, Tony?

""Hello?""

""Greed?""

He chuckled ""Fair, fair, but...it requires a to, and from, and does one guy at a time. It ain't replacing airports yet, so it's just private jets. The private jets that screw the environment?""

1lea72r,mylw9hq,"The machine was the size of a shipping container and hummed a low menace. We stood - all of us grim and vibrating with nerves - as the last of Mitchell, his hair, finally spiraled out of follicles which we’d also seen populate slowly. It was a hard thing to witness and an even harder thing to fathom. The whole of him had grown outward from the bones. And it’d taken half an hour. To say it seemed painful was like saying nothing at all. No words could describe the agony we’d witnessed.

Of course, this horror had been preceded by horror. When Team A transmitted him to us, the process took 3.08 seconds. We watched over CCTV. It took long enough for us to see Mitchell’s face become a rictus of terror and long enough for us to see his constituent parts recede inward until nothing was left but the bones and when they vanished there was nothing at all. 

But when he began to appear at the receiving end, it took exponentially longer and was commensurately worse. The scale of suffering was grand. For those 29 minutes and change that reassembly took, I know that every last one of us - Mitch included - wished for death. It hung in the air, that hope for death, like a heavy gauze over everything. It dampened all sound and clouded all vision.

It was still there even after Mitch was whole - physically. Mentally and emotionally we had no idea. He lay there a shaking and naked blob. He was quiet except for ragged breathing. Finally, one of the scientists carried a lab coat to him and did her best to swaddle him - though quickly for obvious fear of staying in that machine too long.

It was the first human test after decades of research. Begun as a top secret government project, the thing had been bought, kit-and-kaboodle, by Northgray. Now, as matters of capitalism go, they wanted their return on investment. 

That meant rolling it out. 

At first, I’d had no idea why I was there - not being involved with the math or science- but it dawned on me as I stood there. I was to provide the polish.

My heart pumped one great gush at this thought and from there beat wildly. Cold sweat and nausea with a sprinkling of gooseflesh consumed me. Why else would someone from PR be witnessing this thing? They didn’t pay me to report objectively - I was to be the liaison between this tragedy and the rest of the world.

I’d have to make it sound *good.*

Like my thoughts could be seen or heard, the door to the observation room, with its two way glass, opened. In walked a handful of men wearing tailored suits. The lead, Arthur Protherow, stopped just next to me. He addressed the whole room but I know that his words were meant for me.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask that you give yourselves a round of applause.”

Silence for a long moment, then an anemic scattering of claps. I looked at the screen for any indication of Team A’s thoughts. They just clapped stupidly as well, the tenuous data connection sapping all life from their weak attempt at self-congratulation. 

“Now,” Arthur continued, “We are to introduce this technology into the world. It will change everything - travel, diplomacy, warfare.” Of the three things he listed, only the last he spoke with any tinge of intent. 

“But we must focus on the *positives*. This machine will usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for those around the globe.”

The room was silent. Nothing that we witnessed in the preceding hour had pointed to anything resembling peace.",6

By lunchtime, we’d rebranded the teleporter as “The InsideOut™ – Travel With Full Transparency.” Our marketing campaign focused on the trust factor: competitors’ instant teleportation was suspicious – what were they hiding? Ours showed every step of the reassembly process because we were confident in our technology.

We even partnered with medical schools. “See your anatomy in action!” became a hit educational program.

The weirdest part? It worked. Our waiting list grew longer each day.

As I was preparing for a press interview, our CEO stopped by my office.

“Great job turning this around,” he said. “Though I have to ask – are we any closer to fixing the reassembly speed?”

I smiled, sliding over the latest sales report. “Actually, sir, the engineering team says they could fix it by next week, but our focus groups show that 78% of customers now prefer the slow reassembly. They say it’s ‘oddly satisfying.’”

He shook his head in disbelief. “So we’re intentionally keeping a flaw because it’s selling better?”

“That’s marketing, sir,” I replied.",94

“We, ah, we already have a hefty dose of anaesthetic applied before transmission.

The nervous system is one of the last things to transfer it seems, we aren’t clear why, but no nerves, no feeling. It will hurt after but…”

“Any surgery would, but here we have a few small incisions as opposed to cutting through multiple layers of fat and bone.”

I turn to Maurice. “Sir as a teleport I repeat its largely useless. No one will want to go through that”  I gesture to the body which is being slowly wrapped in skin “they don’t even want to go through baggage claims. But if we acquire this now, use it as a medial tool, we gain market control, and the income provided allows Michael here and his team time to work out the” there’s a small sound from behind the glass as a completed human slumps to the ground “kinks.”

Maurice looks thoughtful. He looks to Damien, who is hunched over a bin, eyes bloodshot. He swallows then manages a small nod. Maurice turns to me and gives a small nod. “Michael.” He looks over my shoulder. “Let’s you and I have a chat with the legal team and see what agreements we can come to.”

I see the marketing team glow with pride, feel Lynn glaring at me, see Michael look bewildered and see Andrea deep in thought, scribbling on a notepad.

I turn to look at the man in the other room, stark naked, sleeping peacefully, true to Michael’s word he’s dosed to the hilt.

I smile. There’s a lot to do. But I think we can do it.

But first.

I grab the bin from Damien.",10
1lef28b,myfss6s,"The Elders' Council stares at me.  
""You think that would work?"" one of them asks me.  
I nod.  
""I already tried it out!   
Not only did they not suspect as a vampire, despite my obvious fangs, and silver hair!  
But the fake tan protects us against sunlight to a certain degree!"" I say.  
The Council looks at me, as discussion erupts.  
I await their questions.

  
""Have you charmed anyone to ask them why haven't they suspected you?  
Have you truly acted like a vampire, and still weren't suspected?"" they ask me.  
I nod.  
""I charmed several of them, and they all said that vampires are pale, and aloof.  
I also flirted with several human, my eyes turning red to charm them in public, and nothing happened.  
I also gave one of them a ""hickey"" on their neck, and people commented only on public showing of affection, but nothing about vampires."" I say.  
""How long ago was this?"" an Elder asked, with his laptop prepared.  
""2 weeks ago, in Bucharest, mid-day, just before a book festival, and a Pride Parade so plenty of people roaming around."" I say.  
He nods, and starts searching.

  
After 30 minutes, he shakes his head.  
""I can't find any posts, or mentions of a possible vampire in Bucharest.  
I did find a few posts about Violet, but they are from either jealous girlfriends of the men she flirted with, or men fantasizing about her ""delinquent"" attire."" he said, showing the other elders I guess the posts about me.  
""Quite the...attire."" one of them comments.  
I shrug.  
""Human summer clothing.  
Shows a lot of skin, which again, helps, because people would think that vampires are covering themselves completely against the sun!"" I laugh.  
They nod.

  
""Any injuries? Or side effects?"" they ask.  
""Slight discomfort, and burning pain due to prolonged sunlight, but nothing deadly, or overly painful.  
Due to the extreme usage of fake tan, it was a bit harder for me to recover from scratches, but that's all."" I say.  
The Council falls silent, as they look at each other.  
""Youngling Violet, your proposal shall be put under testing by several vampire covens' young ones.  
If it proves to be as useful as you depict, we shall raise you to the bloodline purity of a baroness, and give you a town to supervise."" they say.  
""Thank you!"" I bow, and leave.

1lepwd7,myignrd,"Hell wasn't exactly what Dennis had expected. No fire and brimstone, no pitchforks, just an endless queue of souls waiting their turn to relive their most embarrassing moments on a loop for all eternity. Simple, psychological torture—efficient, really.

When Dennis's number was called, he shuffled nervously into a small, dimly lit room with a single chair facing a large screen.

""Have a seat,"" said his assigned demon assistant, Mephistopheles—or ""Phil"" as his name tag read. ""You know the drill. We'll go through your most embarrassing moments, you'll suffer eternally, standard procedure.""

Dennis nodded and sank into the chair. Phil hit play on what looked suspiciously like a TV.

*Three years later...*

Phil burst into the viewing room, clipboard in hand, horns slightly askew. ""Hey, um, Dennis? We've got a bit of a scheduling issue. You've been in here for three years watching... wait, is that you as a toddler?""

On screen, three-year-old Dennis was simply eating breakfast, spilling a bit of milk down his shirt.

""Yeah,"" Dennis cringed, covering his eyes. ""God, look how I'm holding that spoon! Everyone could see I had no coordination.""

Phil glanced at his clipboard, then back at the screen. ""I don't understand. Most souls are done by now. They cycle through their five or six worst moments and that's it. You've been watching... your entire life?""

""Well, yeah,"" Dennis replied, gesturing to the screen where his younger self was now taking a nap. ""Look at how I'm drooling! In public! My mom took me to the park after this and I fell asleep on the bench. Everyone saw!""

Phil scratched between his horns. ""That's... that's just being a toddler, Dennis. That's not embarrassing. That's literally what toddlers do.""

""Easy for you to say. You weren't there."" Dennis shuddered. ""Wait till we get to middle school. There's this one time I said 'you too' when the movie ticket seller said 'enjoy the show.'""

Phil checked his notes again. ""According to your file, your top five embarrassing moments should've been: your wedding speech where you accidentally thanked your ex, the time you split your pants at your job interview, when you waved back at someone who was waving to the person behind you...""

Dennis interrupted. ""But then there was this time in second grade when I pronounced 'Massachusetts' wrong during geography class.""

Phil sat down heavily beside Dennis. ""You know, we've got other souls waiting. There's a murderer who's supposed to use this room next to relive the time he accidentally called his victim 'mom...'""

Phil stared at Dennis, then at the screen, then back at Dennis. ""I've been in Hell for five thousand years, and I've never seen anyone this... thoroughly embarrassed by their entire existence.""

""Some people are just born with higher standards,"" Dennis said with a sniff.

Phil tossed his clipboard aside. ""You know what? I think we're going to need to reassign you. This isn't working.""

""Reassign me? To where?""

""Heaven, probably. We can't have you hogging the embarrassment booth for eternity. Plus,"" Phil added, leaning in conspiratorially, ""between you and me, your constant self-criticism is making the rest of us demons look bad. We're supposed to be the ones torturing you, not the other way around.""

Dennis gasped. ""Are you saying I'm... too good?""

""I'm saying you're the most efficient self-torture mechanism Hell has ever seen.""

And so, Dennis became the first soul to be expelled from Hell for being too hard on himself—a story he would find embarrassing for the rest of eternity.",10
1letz0u,myksqwn,"He sat across from me like a man trying not to fall apart in a room built to watch him crumble. Hands twitching around a white ceramic mug with our logo a helix tangled into a Möbius strip, company motto stamped underneath like a bad punchline: *Tailored Timelines.*

Steam curled from the mug like a ghost making its slow getaway. I didn’t say anything. Didn't need to. His file was already filled out, crossreferenced, clocked, and sorted into a hundred probable pasts. What he really came for wasn’t the science. It was permission to believe.  
  
He finally cracked.

“Elaine…” he said, voice shot through with old wounds. “She was… my life. It’s been years and I just—” Words dried up in his throat but that didn’t matter. I’d heard enough.

I gave him the silence he didn’t give himself. The kind that lets a man breathe without choking on memory.

“I just…” he whispered, “I need to know. If I’d asked her would it have changed anything?”

I reached for the file. Most of the suits upstairs like to toss the numbers at the client and call it a day. Let the projections speak for themselves. But people don’t hear statistics. They hear *hope.* I found it better to walk ‘em through the wreckage of the life they *almost* had.

Everyone thinks there's a version of themselves out there who got it right. House on the hill. Golden retriever. The girl still in their arms. I don’t sell dreams. I just show the math. Like a genie who tells you how he’ll screw you. And if they still want to jump, well… I don’t stop them. I just won’t lie.

“Alright, Martin,” I said, sliding the manila folder across the desk. “Let’s see what you missed.”



**TIMELINE PROJECTION: “Proposal Reinstated”**

**Divergence Point: June 12, 2005**

**Action: Martin Ellsworth proposes to Elaine Murray at the lakeside cabin in Vermont.**

**Result: She says yes.**



Martin gave a soft smile, like he was afraid the paper might bite. He looked up at me. 

“Keep reading,” I said, leaning back. I’d seen it all already. Hell, I could recite the damn thing by heart at this point.",6
1letz0u,myksznz,"**YEAR BY YEAR OVERVIEW:**

**2006–2009:**

* Marriage begins well. Elaine delays law school, chooses to support Martin’s fledgling eco tech startup.
* They move to Portland. A modest home, rescued greyhound, rainy mornings. Intimacy marked by quiet collaboration.
* Business struggles. Elaine becomes increasingly frustrated at postponed personal goals.

**2010:**

* Elaine reenters law school parttime. Tension builds over finances.
* Martin begins consulting to stabilize income. Startup quietly folds.
* Frequent arguments over ""what could have been.""

**2011–2015:**

* Elaine graduates, begins work at public defender’s office. Fulfilled but exhausted.
* Martin, now working midlevel at a green energy firm, begins writing speculative fiction.
* Emotional distance increases. No children mutual decision, though later privately regretted.
* Therapy attempted, partially effective.

**2016–2025:**

* They remain married. Comfortable, occasionally affectionate, but distant.
* Martin’s debut novel sees minor success.
* Elaine eventually shifts to policy advocacy, finds renewed purpose.
* Martin resumes hiking, journaling has affair, ends it within months, never confesses.

Their life is stable but muted. **Happiness peaks at 6.2** on the satisfaction index. Occasional nostalgic joy. **Regret index** remains steady around **3.8**.

Martin looked up, eyes searching for some loophole. “That doesn’t sound… terrible.”

“It’s not,” I said, lighting a cigarette. “But it’s not what you think it is either. You’re filling in the blanks with fairy tales. The past looks better because you never had to bleed in it.''",5
1letz0u,mykt4j2,"He nodded slowly. “So, no kids?”

“In sixteen percent of timelines, sure. But in eightyfour, you both kick the can down the road until there’s no road left. Elaine resents it more than she lets on. You resent that she resents it. The usual loop.”

Martin rubbed his thumb along the mug’s rim like he was trying to rub the world smooth again. “And if I don’t go back?”	

I slid a thinner envelope his way. No frills. Just one page.



**Current Timeline Satisfaction Index: 6.0**

**Regret Index: 4.5**

**Emotional Health: Variable but resilient**

**Prospective Creative Fulfillment: High (2027 novel, major success)**

**New Relationship Probability (2026–2028): 74%, stable, emotionally intimate**



	“Stay here,” I said, voice low. “You’ll grieve. That doesn’t go away. But you’ll grow. You’ll write something that matters. You’ll find someone who doesn’t live in the shadow of who you were. You’ll get better. Slowly. But you will.”

He shut his eyes. A long silence. Like he was listening for ghosts.

“So if I go back,” he muttered, “I get her… but I might lose myself.”

I nodded once.

He took a breath, set the mug down, and signed the waiver and checked the box saying declined.

Didn’t say much else. Just fiddled with his cuff and thanked me.

I filed the report. Last glance before archive.

**Projected Happiness Delta (return vs. current): +0.2**

**Projected Fulfillment Delta (return vs. current): -1.3**

**Final Assessment:** Not worth the jump.

I leaned back in my chair, another soul turned away from the siren song of what if. That’s the trick of the job not to fix time, but to help someone finally stop chasing it. One step at a time.

1le4u1b,myefv24,"""...Yeah, 'rescued' by adventurers again."" Came the victim's voice from scrying room where he'd demanded a call. ""Please check the stove, I was defrosting some meat when they broke in.""


Indistinct murmurs in woman's voice came in response.


""Yes, if you could contact the Attorney's Guild, that would be great, thank you, dear.""


More murmuring. 


""No, these guys are less talkative than those ninjas last time. What is it with ninjas and just not being able shut the hell up?""


A distorted femine chuckle buzzed through the scary glass.


""Yeah, some ruined fort they're squatting in.""


The Knights of the Glorious Sun shared an uneasy look between themselves. Sure, maybe they were a little down on their luck and behind on the rent ever since that... confusion when they rescued the Dragon Princess's Governess from her, or when the Barons of the Delver Marches pressed charges because those dungeons were actually carefully preserved National Heritage Sites (complete with the original Liches and shambling undead), or when they tried to restore the former Emperor of the Jade Seas to his rightful throne and he formed an army to oppose to his own restoration (the paperwork he was complaining about couldn't have been that bad, really)!


""Paladins, you know the type.""


But this time? This time, they had it in the bag! Surely, there would great reward for rescuing the poor man from the Clutches of The Vampire Queen! 


""That's surprisingly generous of you, honey.""


Then they could finally pay off that orphanage they dropped those kids they caught playing with tiny, but, sharp swords with! How were they supposed to know that was the Gnomish King and his Royal Guard?


""...they'd have to know what a braincell to be able share a single one between them first.""",195
1le4u1b,myfjnnw,"""You're gonna regret this."" I sighed as my ""rescuer"" sat me down. The elf ranger looked at me curiously. 

""Why? I rescued you from an orcette who'd captured you."" I rolled my eyes.

""Captured only my heart. Who issued the contract?"" I said.

""Your parents."" She said.

I sighed and buried my face in my hands.

""They said she stole you away in the middle of the night and threatened to burn their castle down.""

""Yes, because they refuse to accept our love, they want to marry me to some stuck up, posh elven princess.... no offense."" I said.

She scoffed. ""Regardless, I've a contract. You're coming with me.""

""WHO STOLE MY HUSBAND?"" A voice thundered from a few hundred meters away.

""You better leave."" I said. ""My buttercup's a lovely orcette, but like most orcs, you wouldn't like her when she's mad. And I haven't heard her this mad in years.""

For the first time, I saw fear in the elf's eyes.

An orcish roar thundered, even closer.

""Over here, sugar!"" I yelled. 

""I think....I'd better go."" The elf said. I nodded and she ran away.

My orcish wife Grindella appeared in a clearing. We rushed towards another and hugged.

""Are you alright, my snuggly wuggly kins?"" She said. 

""I'm fine sweetums."" I said, holding my orcish wife close.

""Was that elf mean to you?""

""Nah, she was harmless."" I said and we walked home together, holding hands.

""Another one sent from your parents?""

I nodded and she growled. 

""Maybe I should burn their castle after all."" I squeezed her hand to calm her down. 

""I'm sorry. I need to manage my temper. It's hard when you're an orc."" She said and sweetened her tone. ""Now, how about I make us some blood berry pancakse?""

""Sounds good to me, sweetie pie.""",90

""Gentlemen, and good women of the Adventurer's Guild.  
You have made a grave mistake."" I say.  
Their mage shakes her head.  
""I can't seem to undo the hypnosis done on him."" she says, to her colleagues.  
""There is no hypnosis, mage.  
I don't know what you have been told, but you haven't rescued me.  
You kidnapped me."" I say.  
They stare at me.

  
""The villagers told us that you live with a Gorgon, at the edge of the forest.  
And that she sends you to run errands, as if you were a puppet."" the warrior says.  
""Because she's my wife, and I can't have her do everything, can I now?  
Also, I would refrain from having her to go the village, considering half of them fear her, and other half would hunt her."" I say.  
""So...you two are really married?"" the priestess asks.  
I nod.  
""How?"" the mage chimes in.  
They all look at me curiously.

  
""It's nothing wild. I saved her, when she was injured, and then we started talking, and interacting.  
I fell for her, and thank Goddess above, it seems she fell for me as well.  
We have been living happily for 6 years already together, in that house."" I say.  
They eye me suspiciously.  
""Gorgons are attractive looking women...  
Maybe he was truly just seduced?"" the priestess mutters.  
I sigh.  
""Maybe I seduced her."" I chime in.  
They ignore me.  
""He is right though. He did seduce me, because I wanted to get far away from humans, yet look at me.  
Married to one."" a voice says.

  
The adventurers all tense up, as the door to the barn they were keeping me opens.  
""Hello."" I smile at my wife.  
She enters, her eyes, and head completely covered.  
""May I get my husband back?"" she asks the adventurers.  
The adventurers reluctantly nod.  
She comes, and unties me, and kisses me.  
""You are really ""lucky""."" she giggles.  
""What can I say?  
I used all my luck, to get you."" I chuckle, kissing her back.  
The adventurers groan, and excuse themselves, leaving.  
Kids.   
""Let's go home."" she says, and I nod.

1le4u1b,myet0db,"""I said put me down you absolute imbecile,"" I shouted at the rather large oaf of an 'adventurer' that had to dane to 'rescue me' from my home.

""why would I put you down,"" The clumsy fool had the audacity to look at me with confusion and ask, ""I am carrying you to safety from that monster that has had you captive for the last several months, if anything you should be greatful.""

I tried to flail my arms and legs to break his princess carry on me but to no avail, the oaf was strong atleast. if only he had the wits to match.

I stewed for a minute trying to think of a way to get him to put me down when he suddenly spoke, ""I think that oni must of been some sort of mage to confuse you so much, I mean look at you, your pregnant with that filths offspring!""

I was too shocked at the drivel that came out of this mans mouth I couldnt reply before he prattled on with his idiocy, ""Dont worry though, I know a doctor that can help you be rid of that parasite in y-""

His rant was cut short by my fingers driving into his eyes, luckly he didnt out right drop me but he did put me down ruffly before cradling his face. as he knelt there i began to lecture him, ""as i have been trying to say this whole godsdamned time, i was not kidnapped, nor was i hypnotized and raped.""

through his teary eyes he looked at me with great confusion and he opened his mouth to argue back but i cut him off continuing my scolding, ""Second point, if i was a hostage, why was i roaming the gardens without any restraints or guards, hmm?""

""well i j-"", he bean to sputter when i began to talk over him, ""that oni is my husband, a better man than you, and this child i am carrying is the cultivation of our love........ gods that was cheesy when i said it out loud, and i bet you think you were so sneaky stalking our house for that last two day, hmmm, didnt you?""

He looked utterly aghast that I had know he was watching the house, ""how did you know I was watching you?""

Sighing I summoned my scrying glass into my hand, ""Thought I saw a person outside near dusk a few days ago and when I checked the area I saw you hiding in a tree, wrongfully I ignored you, thinking thatyou were just passing through.""

""you're a mage,"" He said questionily, ""so you're not in trouble?""

""No,"" I said flatly, ""I would blasted you with a fireball or an icicle lance when you grabbed me but I dont know what kind of strain using advanced magic would have on my child.""

He finally had the never to look sheepish, and lower his gaze to the ground, ""I apologize for this misunderstanding......""

i sighed again, ""my husband was right, we should have settled in igrissa instead, less demi-human discrimination.""

he stayed silent looking at the grass as if were the most interesting thing in the world, ""well the least you could do is get off of your ass and escort me back to my house, the garden is safe due to my wards but the forest is still home to actual monsters.""

He got to his feet and grumble another apology and turn back towards my house. as he started lumbering ther i waved at my husband who had shown up at the start of my lecture, I blew him a kiss and started back down the path to the house.

1le4u1b,mygzyrd,"“Ok, well, I have had a great time drinking with you guys, but it’s probably time I get back home.” I reach for the bag I brought with me. 

“Yeah, ok. Wait, we just rescued you, where is your home?” The group leader said. 

I pause, and look at him. “You rescued me? From what? I came with you because that big guy over there thought he could out drink me.” I point at the Goliath crying under the table, sloshed out of his mind. “Pity too, the drinks here aren’t even that strong…”

“No, we went to the house of the demon, fought our way past the guards, got past that dog, and found you in a locked room, so we had to save you. For the great demon queen had locked you in there and was going to devour you or use your soul for nefarious purposes!”

I knew I had locked that door! But I forgot to ask how they got into my study when the big guy saw my drink and challenged me to a drink off. “You didn’t pay any attention to the door once you were through it, did you? It was locked, from the inside. I don’t like people intruding in my study, you just got lucky and came in when my study was done.”

“You were in there willingly? Ah, you have been bewitched! Clearance, could you clear his mind for us? That might also explain why he was able to put drink our man over there.” 

Their cleric comes up be hind me, and places his hands on my head, “ahfosbtjei didbrosjsaa bidid🚫🤯” and casts the spell that cancels all mind magics, at a pretty high level. Oh crap, my ring of self inspection, um, this might be fun. This ring allows spells cast on me to take effect, but they also affect the castor (listen, we all have our kinks, don’t kink shame me!). The spell I cast on them to accept this demon bar as a normal human one lifts, and I see his eyes widen as he looks at the barmaid. However, I also see the spell of sobriety lift and he falls back passed out drunk next to the crying Goliath, who I didn’t give the spell of sobriety to. Even if I did, his kind resist that spell something mighty. 

“Must have been almost out of mana… anyway, I saw the spell take effect, you are happy we saved you now right?”

“Yeah, no. Also, what did you do to Ralph? You said you got ‘past him’?” I ask as the thought occurs to me as I realize the bard went outside to take a leak about an hour ago.

“Who? Oh the giant dog, we put him to sleep.”

“Put him to sleep? Ralph is immune to sleep spells and effects. He interprets them as instructions to play ‘hide and seek’”

A look of realization comes across the leaders face. “So that is why he covered his eyes, and his snores sounded so weird, and kept getting longer…”

“Yep. He’s also a shape shifter, and carries people back to his little prison house when he finds them” a rat jumps on the rogues lap, and they both disappear. “He plays fair though, only does one person at a time.”The leader curses and jumps back at the sight. “Anyway, I suggest you let me go back” I finish picking up my bag and turn to leave. 

“Why are you taking our loot!”

I sigh. “This? This isn’t your loot, you didn’t loot my house, you didn’t get past my dog, we don’t have guards, I don’t know what gave you that idea. But if I don’t get back before my honey does, she is likely to raise hell again.”

“But you are human! Why do you live with the demon queen!”

“Hey, I can only reincarnate once every thousand years. And I don’t choose what I reincarnate as, a quarter of the time it’s a human. That doesn’t stop me from being with my immortal wife. And I think four lives ago, some hero came to save me, took me by force, and the great age of hell started from her campaign to take me back.” The color drains from his face. Legends have been told of the great age of hell, and it wasn’t good for any human, well, except me. I had a great time once my wife found me. But religions were based around preventing it from happening again, no matter the cost. 

“But we got past the guards. They were easy” a cat jumps on the cleric and both he and the Goliath disappear, oh, they were holding hands, yeah, Ralph doesn’t like to separate lovers…

“What lead you to believe they were our guards?” I ask. 

“They were carrying signs, with the demon queens face on them!”

“You took care of the protestors in front of our house! That’s awesome! I was going to need to do that tomorrow!” I reach into my bag and pull out an enchanted sword, mythical grade. “Here is for your good work!”

I go pay the barmaid, from the rogues purse I happened to swipe. I’ll give it back, but I am not paying for my own drinks here. This is an expensive establishment. 

As I open the door to leave, I step out of the way of a giant lizard tongue, that shoots through the door, and attaches to the leader’s face. It starts pulling him back before they both disappear. Really it’s his fault for not moving after learning they were playing hide and seek.  I will probably let them out tomorrow, but I won’t have time tonight. I get to hear about my honey’s business trip and see if she brought anything fun home to study!

Walking past our front gates, I can see the group did a rather nasty thing to the protestors. I will have to clean this up, maybe I shouldn’t have given them that sword. Or maybe I’ll ask them to clean it up on their way out… that is easier. I’ll do that. 

I walk in and sit down at our dinner table right as the portal opens “Hi honey! How was your trip?” Oh, her face is not happy. I’m glad I’m home. Humanity might not have survived a second age of hell with that look. I best not bring up the party saving me…",27

""That is my wife you are talking about, now put me the fuck down because when she arrives to the house, I better be there to help her put the groceries away or she will hunt you all down and honestly at this point I might even do it myself because all of you are a bunch of hard-headed idiots.""",16
1le4u1b,mykebs2,"""I'm telling you,"" I said in the tavern bedroom while the paladin and wizard continued wasting their powers on casting curse-lifting spells, ""I am not bewitched! Lua is my wife of my own volition; hell, I proposed to HER! There was no need to rescue me!""

""This is no ordinary magic that the witch from the Underground cast upon him,"" the wizard said, finally relaxing. ""She must be more powerful than I to cast a permanent curse that clouds his mind enough for him to hold out against the truth spell.""

""Get it through your heads!"" I said, exasperated. Wizards may be far more intelligent, but none of these morons who broke into my home seemed to have a decent amount of insight. ""I'm in love with my WIFE!""

""The woman who had you making poisons for her?"" the rogue asked. He held up a few healing potions that were clearly stolen from our home in a dark bottle. Luadriia didn't like the clear glass bottles, so at her insistence, I bought the different colored ones.

""I'm an apothecary!"" I replied. ""I make herbal remedies and potions to treat the sick, while she treats injuries! We run the village clinic! The bottles are labeled with their contents!""

""I was hoping to avoid this,"" the paladin murmured, ""but we may have no choice. We have to confront the dark elf and put an end to her once and for all. Only then will the curse be lifted.""

""Oh HELL no!"" I screamed. If I weren't tied to the chair I was in so I wouldn't evade their magic, I would have lunged at him. I wasn't about to let these morons kill my wife if I could help it.

Not that it mattered, for I swear I heard loud footsteps that started growing louder.

""I told you all we should have fought her first,"" the dwarf fighter replied. ""But do you all listen? No.""

""You say that about every dark elf,"" the bard pointed out. Turning to me, he demanded, ""Where is she?""

""By now, she'll probably be done with her errands and back home,"" I simply answered. ""And she'll have figured out what had happened. And then, she'll panic and call her friends.""

It was at that moment that the door to the room was tossed open. There, standing next to it, was my 4'9"" Dark Dancer-loving wife, longsword in hand, holy symbol in the other, silver eyes filled with worry, and as beautiful as ever. Standing directly behind Lua, of course, were her old adventurer friends who helped her pay for the university where we met.

""You all have five seconds to return my husband,"" she warned, walking into the room with her escort. The five idiots, instead of untying me, all charged her, only for the thrashing of them to begin.

As I watched her dance through the battlefield that the room turned into, I had one thing on my mind: ""I love this woman.""",7
1lefno2,myfueq2,"I take a shower, and lifelessly drag my body to the bed.  
923 times.  
I had to rewind time, 923 times today.  
Yep, I am a superhero, and my power is to rewind time.  
But instead of fighting criminals, stopping supervillains, or anything like that, what do I do with my power?  
I keep the super-super-powered idiots that I surround myself with, happy, healthy, and most importantly, hidden.  
Why?  
Because they are found by the Government, with powers that could potentially erase entire countries.  
So I have to babysit them.

  
923 times.  
That's how many takes it took me to convince ""Jim"", a big oaf of a man, really kind, but really, really eager to prove himself, to keep working as a construction worker, and not a hero.  
Why?  
Because the more he moves, the more energy he gets.  
This is all good when lifting, and carrying, but if it is used for fighting, then it could potentially achieve such levels, that one punch could shatter space.  
I don't want to tell you how annoying is to rewind time around shattered space.  
It makes me dizzy.  
And this is the good type of situation during my babysitting.

  
Last week, I had to rewind time several times, because ""Alice"", has tripped multiple times.  
While she is a petite woman, that seems like could be blown away by the wind, in reality, she has a dwarf star as her heart.  
And it is unstable.  
If she wouldn't consciously and subconsciously limit her power, she could destroy the world by sneezing, because that heart would most likely implode.  
A pain in the ass, as she loses control when she trips, or when she is ill, or when she has a nightmare.  
So I have to be awake, when she sleeps, so that if I notice the end of the world...  
I have enough time to rewind time.  
And this is not the worst case scenario.

  
My roommate, Mario, is the worst super-super-powered idiot to ever live.  
Why?  
Because he has all the powers inside of him.  
Yep, all of them, known and unknown.  
And they randomly activate, as most of the time they are inactive.  
So, I have like 14 cameras around him, a ton of bugs, and surveillance, and several agents always following him.  
Whenever a power that is messed up activate, I have to quickly rewind time.  
Don't ask me how often I had to do this...  
I have an awesome power, a terrifying power, and I could be an amazing hero, or a terrifying villain.  
But no.  
I have to babysit these individuals, and you know what's the worst part?  
I know that with this, I do more than I would by being a hero...",15
1le7tqa,mye8etf,"The Academy is a place where seekers of the Truth, of knowledge, and information gather.  
It strives to educate the next generation, about their skills, traits, abilities and professions, hoping that they will make good choices.  
The Academy has a curriculum encompassing all possible power systems, and magical paths, from Martial Arts, to Cultivation, to technomancy, and even Divinity gathering.  
But!  
It has a strict Theoretical path, desiring to lay the foundation, and open the minds of the youth, and to allow them to experience, and experiment afterwards on their own.  
Today, the Academy is attacked by an overwhelming alliance of forces, desiring the knowledge it had gathered over generations.  
They think the Academy is defenseless.  
They are wrong.

  
The teachers shout for the students to evacuate, but they are ignored.  
The students leave their rooms, the libraries, and laboratories...rolling their eyes, and rolling up their sleeves.  
The attackers snicker, but are soon defeated easily by the students they encounter.  
The teachers watch incredulously, as the attackers are repelled, and beaten back outside the Academy's walls, but it is not enough.  
For outside an entire army is still waiting to rush in.  
The students ignore their teachers' pleas once more, as they all cut their palms, and chant a spell.  
A symbol of a Tome with two daggers on it appears in the skies.  
The symbol of their secret society: Knowledge and Action.

  
""What? Are we supposed to be scared?  
You Academy elites have hoarded too much knowledge, it is time for us to use it properly!"" one of the leaders of the attackers said.  
A senior student smiled.  
""I couldn't agree more."" he says, as myriad portals appear above the Academy.  
From them, alumni of the Academy arrive.  
Some came alone, others with their own armies, and followers.  
""For Knowledge, and Action together, is what makes the world right!"" they chant.  
""For Knowledge, and Action together, used wisely, is what makes the world right!"" the students echo back.  
It was clear that they were all members of the same society.

  
The attackers were easily defeated.  
The sheer amount of people, and the variety of power systems they used, made it impossible for the attackers to properly counter them, to react.  
When martial artists, together with mages, druids, summoners, Gods and many more professions and paths worked together...  
What could be done against them?  
The teachers, and the Academy hosted a feast to thank them, but none of the alumni remained.  
They left, with some of the senior students.  
Where did they go?  
To finish what they started, and show the forces of the universe, that the Academy, while neutral and pacifist, isn't unprotected.",47
1le7tqa,myeiehj,"“What’s going on?” the old ,yet loud voice of professor McNugg could be heard trough the chaos but no one answered 

All of the students calmly rolled up their sleeves to touch a mark on their arm while they walked around to surround the deathspry. 

The creature floated in the air ,its countless withered limbs were the only part of is form not covered in the moving shadows. 

McNugg looked around and pointed to a boy sitting on a smooth rock pouting 

“You there ,explain to me what’s going on!! have the rest gone mad? I didn’t know it had hypnot-“ 

“It’s there little club” the boy grumbled 

McNugg raised an eyebrow ”it doesn’t matter ,run!!” 

“no the *Haven* *will keep us safe“* he said in a mock voice ,still pouting 

McNuggies looked back at the Deathspry ,numerous chains now clasped it’s hand 

“Okay... uuuh .. guess I drank potions in school again” the teacher said ,promptly sitting next to the boy on the ground 

The boy sighed “your not on drugs ,its this secret society the students made but I guess I don’t count as a student !!“ 

“wh-wait the students .. are chaining the deathspry ..” 

“and my social life.. like they even let Hugo in!! He was proficied to kill Billy’s parents!!”

1le7tqa,myedse2,"Falmata glanced over at his friends, Ifaani and Faayame, before getting up and sneaking to the back of the evacuation queue. 

“This is the fourth time this week.” Falmata said sounding annoyed. 
“Any bets on who’s attacking this time?” Chimed in Ifaani.
“Everything’s a game with you, Ifaani.” Faayame scolded.
“Let’s just get this over with before my appointment; my braids are due to get redone.”

As soon as they were out of range of the teachers, Falmata gave the signal for their quick escape. Faayame pulled a pocket mirror from his coat and flipped it open, creating perfect copies of the trio. With their clones following the evacuation, Ifaani pulled a ligher out, turning it into a staff, and cast a flame teleportation sigil in the wall next to them to face the threat at hand. “Into the fire out to the fray, I guess”, sighed Falmata, clicking his pen to transform it into a spear.

As the trio stepped through the portal and onto the rooftop. The army of The White Serpent gathered around the school, the students of various organizations gathering for the assault as their heads discussed who would attack first. Being the outsiders of the school, the trio decided to charge ahead first.

“Let’s hit them with the shadow fire dance!” Falmata called out.

With a flash, Faayame created 5 new clones of Falmata as Ifaani cast a flame guardian spell to turn him into a flaming warrior. Falmata charged forward, spear at the ready, as Ifaani lay down a barrage of fireballs at the enemy’s back lines with Faayame creating a barrier of light to protect the two of them. In a matter of minutes, Falmata was back on the rooftop with his friends, admiring the destruction left in their wake.

“Real subtle.” Faayame scoffed.
“We got the job done, at least.” Falmata shrugged.
“Just in time for your hair appointment, too.” Ifaani chuckled, patting Faayame on his back as she opened a portal to replace their clones. “Better get back before the others start bugging us; getting dragged into one of these loser clubs is the last thing I want to deal with”.",13
1le5vki,myefwb9,"Long ago, when the world was quieter and full of rustling things, there lived a girl whose laughter tasted like milk and honey. Her closest companion was a bear, sewn from cloth and simple magic. His name has been forgotten, as many true names are, but he belonged to her, and she to him, in the way only children and their first beloved things understand.

As years turned, men came.

They did not take her hand, they took her light. One by one, they carved pieces from her. Her voice. Her boldness. Her easy joy. They smiled as they stole and left her smaller each time. The girl who once danced barefoot through the fields, who climbed trees just to kiss the sky, grew careful. Then cautious. Then silent.

And one day, the bear was gone.

They told her he had been lost. That she must have misplaced him. Perhaps he was forgotten. Perhaps he had been nothing special at all.

But bears, even ones made of stitches and stuffing, do not die so easily.

The girl did not know that each tear she refused to cry, each rage she refused to speak, each ache she folded into the quiet corners of herself, had found its way into the bear. He gathered them. He carried them. He fed on them.

Deep in the woods where the sun does not reach, where the earth remembers every sorrow, the bear changed.

He grew tall, taller than any man. His button eyes turned dark and glassy. His fur thickened and snarled. The tag sewn to his back, once soft and curling with love, stiffened and held her name in thread that pulsed like a heartbeat.

And one evening, long after the girl had forgotten how to hope, a bear was seen in her village.

People locked their doors. They said it was a cursed thing. A creature born from wrongness. Something wicked and wild.

But the girl, now a woman with hands that no longer trembled and eyes that no longer glowed, stepped out from her home.

She saw him across the field.

He did not move.

His fur was like scorched velvet. His breath turned the air cold. His presence made the world feel slower.

And there, sticking out from behind his shoulder, was a tag. It was faded but still held her name.

She knew then that he had not been lost. He had been becoming.

The bear had devoured her rage, guarded her sorrow, buried all the pieces the world had carved away. He had kept them safe until she could come back for them.

She walked toward him.

The bear stood still, as if asking a question.

She did not speak. She only reached out. Not like a child seeking comfort, but like someone claiming what had always been hers.

And the bear turned and walked into the woods. She followed him.

Some say she vanished. Some say she went mad. But those who understand say otherwise.

They say she rides through the trees now, high on the back of something fierce and loyal, with her old name in her mouth and fire in her chest.

And if you hear a low growl in the trees or feel your skin prickle when you speak of things taken from you, you may be close.

The bear with the broken tag only returns when a girl is ready to remember who she was before the world taught her to forget.",90
1le5vki,mydxydv,"Recently, a bear has been spotted in our neighborhood.  
Weird, considering where I live, but hey, who knows which rich fella kept it as a pet, and it escaped.  
Weirdly enough, it was captured in some pictures, and I noticed something.  
A tag, black and golden, just above its tail.  
It looked awfully like the one that had been on my teddybear, that I lost as a kid.  
Also, now that I noticed this...  
It is also missing a patch of ""fur"", exactly where I charred Mr. Bon-bon when I was a kid.  
Weird...

  
Days pass by, and the sightings still happen every now and then.  
My mind though is more preoccupied with the fact that the bear...is getting closer to my childhood home.  
We moved a few years ago, and I personally moved out last year to my own place.  
I just can't shake off this feeling.  
This bear...  
Can it really be Mr. Bon-Bon?  
Would that be possible?  
Or maybe...all these years of loneliness start to wear me down?

  
I had enough.  
This weekend, I set out to find the bear.  
And I did.  
In a small alley, not even two blocks from my childhood home, I saw its tiny ears peek out from behind a dumpster.  
""Mr. Bon-Bon?"" I called out.  
No answer.  
I was stupid. How could a teddybear come to life?  
Wait...am I in danger?  
""Little Timmy?"" a mellow voice asks, as the bear looks at me.  
I nod.

  
He rushed at me, and I froze.  
Mr. Bon-Bon hugged me, and I watched incredulously, as the huge bear, shrunk.  
""Mr. Bon-Bon!"" I say, as now my teddybear was in my hands.  
""Little Timmy! You left me in the attic! Then you, mom, and dad disappeared!  
I heard bad people in the house...and left, and got big!"" he said.  
Oh my...  
Those bad people might have been the realtors a few years back...they were a work of art.  
""How did you transform? How are you?"" I ask.  
""Happy."" he laughed, burying himself deeper into my arms.  
I chuckled, and left.  
We had a lot of catching up to do, and I hoped...  
That if the world saw the bear, then it means this isn't a hallucination.",29
1leiycd,myi8sbk,"Fireteam Alpha was all dead. All dead but him.
Him—a lowly nobody who barely knows shit about shit. Well, he knows one thing: beyond the fact that he is alone, he is also losing a lot of blood.

He needs to patch himself up, but if he moves, there’d be no point. Because he’d be dead. Like everyone else. Cruel irony.

How the fuck am I the only one left? He questions his fate, because his squadmates, just half an hour ago, seemed superhuman. God-like in their tales of combat and survival, and in how they gave it back to the brass.

There are enemies out in the dark. He can hear them chattering in the local dialect. Guys with smiles during the day and, at night, an AK locked and loaded. There is also a guy out there with a grenade launcher.

It was him who took out four of the twelve, one being his squad leader—dude covered in tats and veins—who said, “Fuck up and I’ll kill you if we get back.”

And now he is dead. Bits and pieces joining the other bits and pieces that, just moments ago, were his brothers and sisters.

His head swoons. Soon he will join them; the good and the bad.
And they killed many, many bad guys. That was their job, after all: smiles during the day and bullets into bad guys at night.

His sergeant is dead. He watched it happen, and with a few more grenades, his whole team. Smoke and the crackle of fire covered him. He doesn’t know how many hits he took, but does know what the single nine-millimeter handgun shots are, making their way through the dead.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

KaBlammy!

The heat of the explosion sears the private’s cheeks into a toasty red, but before he can feel the pain that will be coming, the firing of an M4 announces someone on his team is kicking some ass.

Another huge explosion—and right after, he feels a hand on his chest.

“Hey, are you alive? Hey!” The voice bangs on the private’s chest and pulls him closer to the surface of consciousness.

“Sergeant?” he whispers, sure he is seeing ghosts, because above, leering down, is the man himself. “I thought you were dead.”

“I got better.”

The sergeant pats down his soldier, looking for wounds. But before he can begin issuing care, the soldier dies.

Instead of grieving, the sergeant does the very best next thing. The thing all good soldiers would do.

He gets up and limps off into the haze of battle, looking for someone of higher rank to report to.",5

He was always a menace.

Got the pre-wedding jitters?"" I ask, as we sit down, and the maid serves us some refreshments.

""So?"" the commander asks.

""Yeah, no. They instead sent the corrupted humans, and the small monsters that live inside the big monsters."" Ana rolled her eyes.  
""Exactly. The cannon fodder, the expendable ones.  Ditto with certain military outposts, that now have been confirmed to be testing zones for biological weapons."" I say.  
The commander's eyes lit up.

""You wish to infect us with the right viruses, and have the monsters eat us?"" she asks.  
I nod.  
""They have a clear hierarchy, and get commands, yet we haven't really seen the ""leaders"", this means they are still wary.  
Add to that the avoidance of certain places with biological pathogens, and the fact they are from another world, so our bacteria and viruses are completely foreign to their immune systems."" I start.

1le1pjt,mye854n,"I am going to die on my birthday.

I have always known this. At first, I assumed that it was true for everyone. Of course your birthday and deathday are the same day. How else would you know what day you will die? It was in an argument with my next-door neighbor and childhood frenemy that I was faced with the truth. She told me her deathday was three months later than her birthday, and I stubbornly refused to believe her, until both of us were mad at the other for lying and we couldn't stand each other's company. I ran home and complained to my mom, who said as gently as she could that I was the mistaken one. She reminded me of her own birth and death days, how we celebrated them at different times. I don't know what I thought. I think I started to cry.

As I went through school, my birth/deathday became an inconvenience, like classmates whose birthday was on Christmas or whose deathday was over the summer so they couldn't celebrate at school. All the celebration of my life was condensed into one day.

As a teenager it started to feel scary. I became obsessed with Shakespeare because I read that he, too, died on his birthday, and I wanted to know if he knew. I wanted to know how it felt. I searched his plays for references, something, anything anywhere that could give me a guide for how to feel. Most people don't have to dread their birthdays the way I do. Adults say they dread their birthdays, but it's not the same. I'm going to actually die that day.

I wondered if I could break the cycle. If I killed myself on April 23rd, Shakespeare's deathday, would it work? Or would any attempt inevitably go wrong and leave me in pain? Why did I want to change this anyway?

I grew reckless. I wasn't going to die anyway if it wasn't that day, so why bother with safety? I felt as if I always stayed the same age. Then I'd either get a year older, or I'd die. The rest of the time didn't matter.

Then my neighbor died. And it mattered.

I hadn't seen it coming. My parents were quiet, and I wondered what they knew that I didn't. What I hadn't noticed because I was so caught up in my own fraught living. I hated how fragile everything was. Part of me cried out louder than ever to be reckless, to throw myself into danger just to feel something. But I didn't. I couldn't. I couldn't feel, couldn't move.

My father told me that every birthday is a gift. Maybe they are. But one of these gifts will be a curse. I find it hard to feel the good. Just dread and empty relief when I wake up the next day and things are normal, the celebrations already faded before I had the chance to enjoy them.

I am going to die on my birthday. That is the one thing I've always known. The only thing I really know.",28
1ldtltr,mybi172,"""Okay guys, remember the drill, we pretend we're the transport crew,"" Danny briefed his friends. ""We're here to ensure the anti-gravity prototypes and the weather control drone are shipped to another secure facility.""

""Dude, you sure we can pass security like this?"" Paul was understandably skeptical as they stopped the van and waited for the security forces to inspect them.

""Easily,"" Danny shrugged. ""These high and mighty military types look down on lowly logistics staff.""

""Its also 3am,"" Robert added. ""Which is decidedly not working hours.""

""Special emergency,"" Danny said. ""They've received a tip-off that some wannabe thieves might try to steal these top-secret assets at about 4am.""

""...you're kidding right? You tip them off, and then come in and steal before the supposed timing?"" Paul was incredulous. ""Dammit.""

""I'm a genius, am I right?"" Danny smirked. ""Alright, pipe it down, the guards are coming this way.""

""What's your business?"" A security guard asked Robert, who was in the driver's seat.

""Eagleway Logistics. We're here to transport these assets - anti-gravity prototypes and a weather control drone. Here's our paperwork.""

The guard snatched the thick stack of documents with a bored look and gave them a cursory glance. ""Yeah, uh looks legit. Go in.""

""Just like that?"" Paul asked.

""Just like that.""

They parked the van and entered the building with the stolen staff pass Danny had snitched a few days earlier. He had tracked down a senior staff to a luxury diner and posed as a waiter there to quietly nab the pass. Now, all they needed to do was head over to where the assets were located.

If they knew their way around the base.

""Gentleman, you appear to require assistance,"" a voice spoke from...somewhere.

They jumped, only to see a thin, gray man with bulging black eyes and elongated limbs.

""Greetings, humans. I am Greg, Martian explorer of The Expanse,"" he smiled and did a dramatic bow. ""How can I help you?""

""We're here to transport anti-gravity prototypes and a weather control drone,"" Danny spoke with an authoritative tone like he was in charge. ""Take us there.""

""Very well, sir. I will lead the way,"" Greg gestured towards a long corridor. ""Please follow me.""

""Do we trust this alien?"" Paul whispered.

Robert quickly scanned their environment before nodding.

""Here, gentlemen,"" the alien pointed to the huge metal door at the end of the long corridor. ""What you seek lies beyond this door that I cannot open.""

A swipe of the staff pass, and they were in. There wasn't any security, much to Paul's surprise. Danny then said something about how they already made it pass security in the first place, and that they should gather up what they came here for.

Which were too heavy for the humans to lift.

""Allow me,"" Greg chimed in cheerfully. With a wave of his hands, the anti-gravity prototypes and the drone floated across the hallway and landed neatly on the trolley the men had brought.

""Thank you...but why?"" Robert was confused.

""You looked like you needed help, that is all,"" Greg bowed again. ""As for me, I was hoping you can show me around your country. The other staff in this base insisted that I stay here for my safety, and to quell rumours of unidentified flying objects. But that's boring.""

The men proceeded to push their haul out of the hallway and make their way back towards their getaway van. All while the gray man whistled and twiddled his thumbs, floating along the way.

""Halt!"" A security guard cut in front of them. ""Who are you, and where are you taking these assets?""

""We're from Eagleway Logistics,"" Danny flashed his fake visitor's pass. ""We're transporting these assets to another secure location.""

""Which one?""

""Zercon Bay.""

The guard paused for a moment before signaling them to go. ""If you see any suspicious figures, let us know. We've received a tip-off that thieves may be coming in soon.""

**""These are not the thieves you are looking for.""** Greg spoke in a much deeper voice.

""No, of course not,"" the guard stared blankly as though there was some jedi mind trick going on.

""You knew,"" Danny turned to face Greg.

""The guards don't know. Yet. Let us keep it this way, shall we?"" The alien had this huge, creepy smile as he tented his long fingers. ""Let us be on our way.""

The rest of the crew was starting to think Greg was...sus. More suspicious than aliens in vents among us. But they could not deny he was helping them, just for reasons they didn't know.

""So, are we heading to Zercon Bay for real, or where are we going to put these stuff we stole?"" Paul had important questions to ask. ""And that staff pass, its bound to be reported lost soon.""

""That senior staff likes going to that same luxury diner,"" Danny replied. ""I could probably slip it back in so he thinks he was just forgetful. Dude's like 70 years old, you know.""

""But the assets. These are heavy as hell.""

It was at this moment, Greg interjected. ""We can put my experimental prototypes back into my spaceship where they truly belong.""

1lduqhu,myb9dnh,"Once upon a time, the Sun shone in the sky every hour of every day. It was so bright that the stars and the moon could not be seen.

However, there was one very bright star. It shone brighter than any of the other stars in the sky, so much that it could be seen as well. The Sun was jealous, and using its great might, flung the star to the lands below, such that it may be the only bright object in the sky.

Now the star wept, for it could not be seen while on the ground. Its cries attracted the attention of an apprentice of a blacksmith, who came to look for it.

""Why are you crying?"" The apprentice asked.

""I am no longer useful, since I have fallen from the heavens,"" The star replied.

""I'll make you useful again,"" The apprentice said.

And so the star went with the blacksmith's apprentice to his forge, where the blacksmith hammered and polished it a thousand times, until it gleamed brighter even than when it was in the heavens. 

Now the Sun saw this and was again very jealous. It tried to burn even brighter, turning the forests into fire and drying up the lakes. The apprentice was afraid, but the Starsword spoke.

""For the favor you have done to me, I will now repay my debt.""

And so the blacksmith's apprentice swung the Starsword towards the Sun, and with a great flash, the Sun was frightened and ran behind the horizon. 

And so the sky darkened and the moon and stars are allowed to shine and be noticed. 

Every morning the Sun tries to take its place again, but the apprentice would brandish the sword right as it reaches its zenith, causing it to flee once again, disappearing in a flash of green light as the Starsword is swung. And that is why we have the Day and the Night.

\--------

*So how did the apprentice live from then until now?*

Uh, I dunno. He's immortal. Go to sleep.",138
1lduqhu,mybnq9w,"""It's beautiful...""

That was the first words spoken by Gerros. The blacksmith gazed at the sword, placed in the centre of a cleared workbench. His apprentice sat with his head in his arms, dozing in the morning light. At any other time, Gerros would have awoken him with a clap. But any thoughts like that were banished as he beheld the sword.

It was large, a greatsword by rights. The blade was smooth, edges on both sides sharpened beyond what he would expect. The metal itself had a gleaming quality, a soft light where normally only faint sunlight or torchlight would land. It had an almost watery quality, rippling despite being solid metal.

The guard was jagged, like rays of light made of metal. Here the glow grew brighter, its edges more pronounced in a dome like appearance. It seemed to encircle the hilt, a barrier around the wielder hands. Cast from a single piece of metal, it appeared to be a monstrous weight.

Reaching out to touch it, Gerros wrapped his hands around the hilt. He tried to lift it, straining despite his physical condition. It barely shifted, as he let go and stumbled back. A clatter arose as he knocked over a bucket, waking his apprentice from his slumber.

The lad yawned, standing abruptly. ""A-ah, morning Master!""

Gerros frowned, pointing at the blade. ""What on Hegos have you made Direnr?""

The blacksmith watched as his apprentice reached out with one hand, grasping the handle. Then he goggled as he easily lifted the blade, holding it as though it was no heavier than the lightest of hammers. ""Oh... I had an urge to make this. After finding the metal.""

Gerros frowned, crossing his arms. ""What metal? This is nothing I have seen.""

Direnr gently placed it back, rubbing his hands. ""I found it a few weeks past. Just, outside of town, coming back from Asjar. I think it came from that star-storm we had a while back.""

The blacksmith gasped, pointing with a suddenly shaking hand. ""Star-steel?! You...""

He dissolved into a shocked laugh, rubbing his face. ""Ah, ah ha ha ha! You... I... I don't believe it!""

Reaching out to hold grasp his apprentice's shoulder, the older man sighed. Direnr watched him in shock, as his master continued. ""You're unbelievable. If... if you had told me about your find... ah I won't lie, I would have taken it myself. Star-steel, that is beyond rare. And it leaves its mark.""

Leaning closer, he peered into the lad's eyes. For a moment all he saw was the usual brown, until he shifted, uncomfortable at the attention. There Gerros saw it, a spray of sparks, hidden inside. He sighed again. ""You used it. It means... well, you're already well on the road to being a master smith. Heck, in a few months I'll probably be seeing you off.""

Direnr nodded, rubbing a bit of sleep from his eyes. ""I... when I slept... I could feel it. Like I knew so much more than I ever thought I could about metal working. Just there. Out of reach.""

Gerros gestured to the sword. ""I can say for certain, that is beyond anything I could make with mundane metal. You'll be able to later I reckon, what with what you now know. But what you have... you need to be careful.""

The lad frowned, resting a hand on his creation. ""Why?""

Gerros felt his face fall, dark thoughts in his mind. ""It's a blade worthy of legends. I can tell, even without an appraisal. Which means people will kill to get it. And they will want you to work for them, to make equals. Failing that, they will kill you to keep you out of others hands.""

Sighing, he rubbed his face. ""This... I'll need to speak with some people. You'll outgrow me too quickly, but you need a safe space to still practice. But if I can, I'll get you somewhere safe. Though....,"" he couldn't stop a flash of greed hit, ""I would like any spare of that steel.""",35
1lduqhu,mybui68,"""It's a Spork"", the blacksmith says quietly, still in disbelief.  

""It's a Spork"", the apprentice replied proudly.  

The blacksmith said nothing.  The rarest metal in all the world, found only in the heart of a dying star, harder to work than any other natural or created material.  The fact that his apprentice was able to make anything from it made them a genius.  The fact that they chose to make a spork from it... may have made them an idiot.  

""Do you know what this metal is?""  to be fair, the blacksmith hadn't actually bothered to teach his apprentice about star-metal, or any other legendary materials, mostly because the odds of anyone in this town ever seeing any was essentially zero.  

""It's... really durable?""  

""Where did you find it?""  

""It was just there, in the grass while I was walking by the river.  Just a tiny little nugget... not enough to make anything big out of.  I looked for more, but that was all there was""  

""But why a spork?""

""Sporks are cool!""    

A star-metal spork.  It wasn't going to slay any dragons, but if they find the right sort of rich buyer, it may just fund the blacksmith's retirement, and give his apprentice enough money to expand the forge like the blacksmith had always planned to but could never afford.",31
1lduqhu,mycpvf8,"""Did you know that stars have names?""

""Huh?"" the apprentice raised his head away from work table and turned it towards the master blacksmith, as he walked into the workshop, towing a cart behind him. Unknown object was nested on it, hidden under a blanket.

""Of course, there's North Star, Vega, Sirius, or…”

“No,” master stopped him, while pointing at the cart, “they have names written on them!”

“What… what are you talking about?” the apprentice scratched his head.

Master theatrically pulled the blanket, uncovering a metal sphere. It looked burned, dented, and decorated with large letters.

“Nasa,” the apprentice read them out, “Mr. Kovac, what is this thing?”

“It’s a star!” he answered, with a devilish smile, “I saw it fall from the sky! First, it was standing still, like all the stars around it. Then, it started to move. Then, it plummeted through the sky, leaving a trail behind, only to fall right here, just 4 lengths from our village.”

“Oh…,” the apprentice came closer, putting his hand on its metallic surface, “this… this isn’t how I imagined a star to look like. What do you want to do with it?”

“I want you to help me open it, let’s see what’s inside,” master ordered, while grabbing a hammer from a nearby table.

They spent a good time pounding it's surface. Trying to uncover secrets hidden inside. Once they got through, one thing in the middle of the sphere caught their eyes. Surrounded by colored metal strands, a cylinder. They carefully cut the strands and pulled it out.

“It’s… it looks like some sort of container,” master proclaimed, while starting to hammer one of its sides, “let’s see what it’s hiding.”

“What’s that?” apprentice asked, pointing at a strange symbol on the container. Small black circle, with three wedges pointing outwards from it, inside a yellow triangle.

“I have no idea, let’s just…” master answered, while one end of the cylinder broke. He turned it around, and a few metal rods fell out.

“OUCH!” apprentice screamed as he picked up one of them, immediately letting it go, “it’s hot!”

“Interesting…” the master scratched his head, then put on a glove and took one of the rods, “they are hot. Yet there is no flame. And the metal is heavier than it should be. Must be really dense. I have never seen a metal like this. Prepare the forge!”

“Forge?” the apprentice didn’t understand, “what do you want to do?”

“This metal from the hearth of a star,” he pointed with the rod at the apprentice's face, “is fit only for the royalty. Strong, rare, and always hot. Tonight, we will forge a sword from it. And tomorrow, we will gift it to our king!”",19
1lduqhu,mybx0qq,"It was the middle of the dark and cold night when I first glimpsed it. It shone from high above sweeping across the sky cutting through the darkness leaving a trail of light in its wake. As it moved it descended further toward the horizon its light becoming ever brighter as it did until it made impact bathing the whole forest in a blinding light. And then finally the earth shook with the loud impact reaching me on the high cliffs above the forest a few seconds earlier.

It took a long time until the sky returned to normal with the tear of light fading slowly like a scar but never completely disappearing with slight traces of it remaining even in the light of day, which I only discovered much later. More importantly however was what happened to the origin of this event, it landed in the middle of the forest far away from my path and route back to the capital, but curiosity and intrigue caused me to go out of my way, I needed to know what it was and more so what happened to it.

A few days later I managed to locate it often only able to find its direction at night when a similar light to before shone in the distance. But I did find it, it was lying in a large crater with water from a nearby river having poured into it and covering most of it And despite the passed time, the cold weather, and the flow of water against it, a mere touch against the air exposed part nearly caused me to burn my hand, with the parts beneath the water being just bearable enough to touch. I stood in the crater marveling at it for what felt like hours, its bright white shine being almost hypnotizing. It felt as if this moment was destined by fate, like I was supposed to witness and find it, as if this was my very purpose.

I took hold of one of the of the seven protrusions of the star which effortlessly separated from the rest of the body and was amazed at just how light it was and began examining it more thoroughly as the bright light emanating from the shard became fainter. Its surface was a pale yellow and rough with a pattern of rune like symbols that seemed manmade and despite the shard seemingly losing most of its light after being detached a small amount remained deep inside as a barely noticeable glow. I don't know when exactly I left the sight or when decided it, but the moment I began wandering through the forest once again I knew exactly what I wanted- no needed to do.

I returned to the original path I wanted to take and going through it much faster out of pure conviction for my new goal. My journey to the capital now barely registered to me as if time no longer mattered to me and passed in the blink of an eye, with even my boss being surprised at my earlier than expected arrival despite the detour having taken a lot of time. However I had no care to wonder about that, as I immediately began to double and triple my efforts of my apprenticeship asking my boss hundreds of questions and working through every waking moment on a daily basis while holding the shard in my close possession. Then finally three years later it was time, I gathered all my knowledge and skills that I've learned and put them all to use creating my ultimate creation, one befitting the shard.

It was a simple design, robust, easily maintainable, and more form over fashion for the most part, an occasional piece of flair and design that were solely for detail were present but nothing major, nothing like a completely gilded blade or full blade theme. The most important part though was the shard, it was used as the material for the fuller, in small amounts mixed into the edge part of the blade, and the diamond shaped pieces that remained were the centerpiece between the crossguard and hilt. I did not care about anything but the sword for the few days that I worked on it, barely touching food nor water and once I was done I felt... hollow. I had created perhaps the greatest blade in the lands, but who is to wield it? There is none who are a match for it.

I had poured in a part of myself my skills, my knowledge, my heart and it too sacrificed a lot its power its planning, and its nature, but there was no warrior to share their part, I was never to achieve something even close to it, and wasted the eons it took to arrive for this moment, yet we both are here standing in silent disappointed and having failed to achieve anything. It was a blade unlike any other, powerful beyond anything able to win every battle, and more importantly unlike all other blades it was one that was never to see usage...",7
1ldzb1a,mycn7ch,"I've seen men die before. Men who thought themselves invincible, who thought they could outrun the darkness. But there's one man who's still out there, a storm of dragon's fire and wizards ice, a force so incredible that the primordial fires of Gauntlgrym's forges are but a campfire in comparison. The man who spared my life all those years ago. My lord, my friend... my curse.

I've been keeping an eye on him for months now. He's a ghost of the man he used to be, his mind eaten away by the ravages of time. The storm that once raged inside him has subsided, leaving behind a quiet calm that's as unnerving as a still pond on a summer's day. His body remains strong, honed to perfection, a testament to the unyielding spirit that drove him to become the greatest warrior of our time. Yet he never carried a weapon. I've watched him move through the city, unseen and unheard, a phantom of a man who could cleave the earth as easily as a child swings a hatchet. A vengeful god that wielded words like a legion of battle hardened soldiers. 

He's a danger, that one. A ticking time bomb of fury and rage, waiting to unleash himself on the world. And yet... and yet, I feel a strange compulsion to protect him. To keep him from himself. I've seen the way he looks at me, his eyes gleaming with a fierce intensity, a spark that suggests he's still a warrior at heart, waiting to be set free. It's like his mind is trapped in a prison of madness and mortal flesh... 

I've tried to warn others, to tell them about the man who walks among us, a man who could kill with a single glance and topple kingdoms with the slightest of words. But no one listens. They don't believe me. They think I'm crazy, that I've finally succumbed to the madness that's been eating away at my lord's mind for so long. But I know the truth. This man is a force of nature, a storm that's going to leave devastation in its wake.

And I'm stuck watching him, waiting for the day when he'll finally break free from his self-imposed prison, and unleash the fury that's been building inside him. It's a fate I wish I could avoid, but one I know I'll never truly escape. The only trinkets from our adventures are still locked away in a secret chest, hidden away from the world and him. I have to keep them hidden...

He seems lucid some days, talking of his old friend, a brother in arms, a man who would play on the red sands of their home... But his mind always slips shortly after, talks of impossible things, of things that couldn't possibly exist... But this man... If he should ever recover his light rod and pocket fob, I shudder to think of the horrors that would be unleashed upon the world...",19
1ldzb1a,myerjww,"He's confused again. Which means he's afraid again. Which means he's angry. 

The entire fortress shakes as we boot up the procedure, sinking ourselves 50 stories in just a few milliseconds as the blistering red lights flood the complex. A rate which would liquefy the humans he used to love so much.

A summerhouse within a leaden casket.

This used to happen once, maybe twice a year. In two years it's become monthly, another year from now it'll be weekly. 

The impossibly strong figure almost punched through all the layers in protection this time, the only benefit to his illness, that he couldn't remember what he had tried before, couldn't remember how to remain calm, couldn't remember trial and error. 

As the sounds of explosions and thunderous crashes fade, I look at the screen. Faced with the panicked visage of a Lord I'd followed for centuries. 

We thought him immortal. Eternal. At least, until sol went dark. Until the stars turn cold.

And we were right about his body, but not his mind. 

Year after year, decade after decade, century after century, his strength, speed, powers grew, what took his greatest strength in younger years took no more than a whisper now, this base took the best of his entire races technology to create, sunken on Pluto, as far as we could from Sol without ending his life, and he's still charged. 

With nanosecond response times, we can still manage to sink it quickly enough. 

I glanced at the second screen, no progress. You'd think with our technology, an illness that plagued the humans could be easily repaired. 

But it's not when it's developed in super form, every bit as formidable as he is. 

If I'd been designed to cry I would be. 

My head would be hanging, in the opposite of everything he stood for as I wearily accept the inevitable, then I restart and reset the base. 

He never gave up on humanity. We'll not give up on him. We owe him that much. We owe him *hope*.",11
1le3jat,mydlvsh,"Marcus lifted the scoop of the tractor and shut the engine. He spotted something glinting off the light but the demolition team was assured the home was emptied and all valuables and furniture was moved into museum storage. 

He felt weird tearing down the medieval manor with turrets and embrasures, but the new owners were adamant to build their castle from ground up with all the modern amenities. 

Marcus picked his way to the glinting metal and discovered the tip of a buried sword. 

“What do we have here!”

He had to move rocks to free the sword from the rubble. As he grabbed the hilt, an odd sensation rippled up his arm. He nearly dropped it, an edge cutting a shallow groove in his leg. Not enough to cause serious damage, but deep enough to draw blood. 

*Ah,* he heard. 

“Hello,” he called. No response. He started back to his tractor when the sword spoke. 

“Thank you. I was trapped so long in that wall.”

“Who’s there?” Marcus refused to accept what his senses were telling him. 

*It is I, sir slashalot,* responded the sword haughtily. 

“That’s a silly name,” Marcus observed. 

*I’ve had many names,* the sword said, *but I’m partial to that one because it was given to me by the three year old son of an archeologist who pulled me from a worksite in Greece. I was buried for so long after the Peloponnesian war. The second one, mind you. Oh, the stories I can tell.”

Marcus couldn’t believe his fortune. He discovered a magic relic from Ancient Greece. Did someone see him unearth it? Could he just take it home and no one would be the wiser?

“Were you wielded by Pericles or Lysander?”

*Not every sword is wielded by a famous legend,* it said. *But I am a magic talking sword, so yeah, kinda. I was wielded by Ajax. *

“That’s so cool!”

*Nah, that fighting stuff gets so tedious. All you do is the same forms and postures and killings. It gets boring very fast.*

“I never thought about it like that before.”

*Now when Ricky stole me to play make believe with Tommy and accidentally sliced off two toes, that was brilliant. No one could see that coming. And then his own two toes. I could not stop laughing. *

“That sounds tragic,” Marcus said. 

*Oh, don’t get torn up by it. The little shit deserved it and worse. It’s not like he couldn’t still limp around. *

“Why are you here?”

*It was the maid. Petite thing with curls and a pouty face. The lord of the manor couldn’t keep his hands off of her.*

“She lost you?”

*oh, stop thinking so linear. The little slut eventually married the old fuck and poisoned him to become Lady of the Manor. *

“And then what did she do?”

*She didn’t do anything. The ex-wife before she was executed stole the sword and had it secretly buried in the wall. She knew the magic sword was his prized possession. If she was going to be usurped, she damn well wasn’t going down without a fight.*

“What happened next?”

*How the hell  I supposed to know? I was stuck in a fucking wall for centuries. Thanks again, by the way. *

Marcus smuggled the sword nobody even knew existed back home. He was keen to hear more tales. Not of the heroes of old but of the people who supported them and their lives. The stories of heroes, true or not, have been told. But the sword has so much more to talk about. Stories of little children and maidens and tanners and chefs. One chef used the sword to slaughter pigs pretending to be a Ninja warrior. He was very silly and made the sword giggle a lot.",20
1le3jat,myeapim,"""Hand me a cigarette, will you brother?"" 

I even reached all the way into my pocket before frowning. ""You don't even have a mouth, John. How the hell are you going to - ""

""The problem with ya young fellers,"" John said contemplatively, the alchemical symbols on his blade humming in a faint green, ""Is that ya focus too much on the thinking rather than the doing. For example, ah have neither a mouth nor larynx. How do ya expect me to speak?"" 

Unable to argue with this logic, I placed a cigarette on the flat of the blade. Sure enougyh, a spark from one of the symbols flashed and the cigarette was lit by itself. 

""Ahh, that's the good stuff. Now, there was a conqueror ah once fought with all the way back in Ancient Greece. Actually bit further forward than that. Hmm. Doesn't come to me."" 

I perked up. ""Alexander the Invincible? You're telling me you were wielded by - ""

A puff of smoke went in my face out of nowhere. ""You keep interrupting me, boyo. And yes, he was part of my collection. But Alec was a boring prick, anyway. No, I'm talking about my man King Dirt."" 

""Dirt."" I said, rubbing my eyes and coughing. I tried to do it all quietly. Couldn't risk the ogre noticing us too soon. 

""Pronounced Di-yert. But yes. Now, Dirt loved to have parties. One time, he got an idea from a Dionysian ritual to have a masked revel in the middle of the Enkidu temple. Fun stuff, but the think about masks is you don't really know who's on the other end. So ah was just laying on my sheath the next morning, as one does, downing amphorae with the boys when one guy comes out and says the king is screwing his sister in the bushes."" 

""Oh, Jesus no! I don't want to hear this!"" 

""What? ah mean, ah knew ""screwing"" was a word for doing the jiggledy, but ah didn't think it would bleed your widdle ears. Now, where was ah? Ah yes, the king and his sister. Or was it sister-in-law? Ah can't seem to recall..."" 

""That's a pretty significant difference!""

""Well, the king murdered everyone else in the place to cover it up, so ah'd say the truth is mine to fashion. Oh, by the way, ya should strap on your shield, or that ogre is gonna chew right through it. Ya see any ashtrays around here to get rid of the cig?""",5
1ldoeej,myacrbm,"Triaskan bioships were... Something else. There's no proper way of describing a ship capable of regrowing bulkheads and pimpslapping strike craft out of the way as it **bites** the command deck off an unresisting 'standard' combat vessel. Their development and widespread use completely changed the tide of the war.

But, afterwards, once the wartime mentality was gone, there came the questions: most importantly of all, what do you do with a self aware spaceship? Its a living, ~~breathing~~ *photosynthesising* being. One that has done frontline military service, at that. You can't just scrap them. 

And so, they 'retired'. The original intention had been to graft off the combat organs, but due to the skyrocketing piracy after the war, it was decided to leave them on.

So now Tharass 'worked' in shipping. As the, uh, ship. They - the command mind and its assorted subsystem-minds - were paid a fair wage, and kept well stocked with supplies. The Corporation figured having an un-staffed ship was actually cheaper than staffing a 'standard' vessel and just left Tharass to do its thing. 

Which was trudging slowly between systems hauling cargo. Normally it was dull. Just something to pay the bills. But every now and then, Tharass got an interesting run.

This was one of those.

Bioships, due to their regenerative hulls, were supremely well suited to navigating through cosmic storms. They also had to shut off their sensors - and pain receptors - to go through one... But Tharass would be fully regenerated by the time he reached his destination, whereas a standard lifeless ship would likely limp into port weeks late, and in need of serious repairs. And expensive repairs. 

But, Tharass saw the beauty in the storms, and this long after the war, they didn't even mind shutting off their sensors. 

Of course, like any veteran - Triaskan, or bioship - Tharass had every sensor turned to full until the very last second. A storm was a perfect place for an ambush.

As expected though, no ambush came, and the paranoid old warship entered the edges of the whirling nebula calmly. 

And what a beautiful storm it was. It had engulfed the entirety of the Ikaan system, painting the whole thing in cerulean blues and empyrean yellows as exotic compounds crystallised in the energies of the storm. The normally violet nebula that filled the system was alight with luminous currents.

Tharass was a warship. Former warship, but nonetheless, a warship. This meant they didn't really have a concept of 'beauty'. But, as the command mind developed, and the years passed, they had begun to log things which were 'nice to look at'. 

This storm was one of those, and since Tharass' route wouldn't take them through any of the more intense parts, they could quite enjoy it.",99

1ldoeej,myagl2j,"Only one thing spoiled the storms for Tharass. The relentless hammering of crystalline shards against their armour was of no concern, and even the need to shut off their 'eyes' to prevent sensory damage didn't bother them that much.

What really bothered Tharass though, was when unsecured cargo bounced around and tripped the interior hull sensors. It brought back memories of the war, of passageways filled with Malavite troops who cut and blasted, moving ever closer to his organs. 

They were gone now, but the memories of that helplessness remained. And as they passed through some of the stronger storm currents - especially the gravitational ones - some cargo would undoubtedly come loose. It always did. 

For now though, Tharass was going to enjoy the softer currents. Having shut off the pain receptors, they only felt the calmer currents press, and the rhythmic massage of high velocity crystals removing aged chitin with their impact. It was almost therapeutic until-

Ugh. Someone had done a really lousy job of securing the cargo if some was already moving! 

The memories came, as they always did, and Tharass ordered the diagnostics mind to check status, as they always did. It was a simple step; dismissing doubt and uncertainty through cold hard metrics.

Except the metrics came back wrong.

Tharass had gained mass. 

LOTS of mass. The pummelling of the crystals made exact measurements challenging, but that seemed to be... Far too much.

But a quick check of hull integrity revealed... No penetration. No punctures, no sensory shadows. Nothing amiss?

Hundreds of sensory eyes opened within the vessel, flooding the command mind with information, as Tharass scoured their own corridors and passageways.

The cargo hold appeared intact. 

And all of the cargo was still in place, secured.

So... What was going on?

Tharass checked their hangar, and saw nothing amiss there either. Colossal chitinous shields covered the entrances, and nothing could possibly have come through...

The corridors seemed in order. The organs were safe. Nothing seemed to be moving.

Tharass was confused. Not the terrifying doubt of old trauma, but just a befuddled uncertainty. This might all be harmless. Perhaps one of their sensors was malfunctioning? 

They checked again, and the mass reading came back the same. 

Tharass queried the diagnostic sub-mind for specifics. 

The increased mass was in the cargo hold.

Sensory eyes fluttered open again, curiously scrying every visible inch of the bay.

And then Tharass saw it. The... Thing.",90
1ldoeej,myb2mnw,"Tharass was unsure of what it exactly it was. It matched no description in any database they had access to. It was roughly spherical, faintly glowing - although that was visibly fading - and appeared to be biological. 

In fact, it looked like an egg. 

How exactly it had come to be deposited in their cargo bay, Tharass did not know. But they were deeply curious, and assumed it had something to do with the strange glow and the storm.

Tharass compiled all collected data and - tentatively extending an antennae despite the storm - pulsed out the data packet to the nearest Corporation relay station at maximum strength. They weren't sure if the signal would get through the storm, but it followed official guidance.

Then they returned to examining the egg. 

It was - presumably - extradimensional. Given the uncertain method of its arrival, either it, or its parent creature, was able to move between dimensions.

And given the size of the egg, its parent creature must be quite large. Perhaps not as large as Tharass, but significantly larger than a terrestrial being could reasonably be.

The egg itself seemed to be quite thick, and capable of self-stabilising. As a heavier gust of the storm buffeted Tharass the egg rolled and bumped an interior wall again. This time though, there was no fear. They knew what made the sensors trip. And Tharass felt... They weren't sure what they felt. *Responsible* was probably the best way of putting it. Wherever - whatever - this egg's mother was, the egg itself was now inside Tharass. And so it was their responsibility.

Extending a loading tendril out, Tharass wrapped it around the egg, and pulled it into a corner, where they held it snugly. 

This egg... was cargo. In a sense. And, if it was cargo, it had to be protected.

Tharass thought about this some more. The egg... was not cargo. Cargo was *things*, this egg was - or would be - someone. 

So this egg... more important than cargo. And Tharass was its caretaker. At least until it skipped dimensions again, or its parent entity came in search of it.

And if Tharass was its caretaker... Then it was Tharass' egg. At least until it hatched.

Tharass decided they liked that. And that they felt... warm.

And so, the former warship sailed the tumultuous currents of the storm, clutching an egg of unknown origins. 

And Tharass was happy. 

The rest of that voyage passed in oddly contented bliss. A wholly new sensation to the warship.

It would not be for several voyages, long after the egg had been removed for study by the Corporation and shifted right out of their laboratory, that Tharass felt a bump in their cargo hold and realised... They weren't afraid anymore.",110
1ldoeej,myf8ihc,"I'm afraid not. This was just intended to be a short of a bioship and their therapy-egg. 

If the setting interests you though, its heavily inspired by stellaris (which has bioships, regenerative hulls, **gorgeous** cosmic storms and assorted dimension-shifting dilemmas.)",6
1ldloip,my9bl3t,"""Dude, you a dragon."" I say, going back to Candy Crush.  
It adjusts its mustache, which do I have to say it? Is fake.  
""Excuse me, good madam, but I am a customer, with human money.  
Please, a large, Caramel Macchiato. Please."" it says.  
I look up again.  
Hmm, my chewing gum seems to have lost its taste...well, whatever.  
""Dude, you barely fit into my store, and are pushing the other customers out."" I say.  
It chuckles, and shrinks.

  
Now, a 9 feet tall, scaly dude, with a magician's hat that appeared out of nowhere, fake mustache, and a monocle stands in front of the counter.  
""Ahem, my apologies.  
So, can I get the Caramel, Macchiato, large please?"" it asks, a bit of smoke escaping its nostrils.  
Hmm.  
I start to feel the bad taste of the too chewed chewing gum.  
I turn around to put it into the garbage bin.  
""Yeah, yeah, one sec."" I mutter, as I got a text from my bestie.  
She found her boyfriend in bed with her...mother?  
Juicy.

  
""Excuse me? My coffee?"" a voice interrupts my delicious drama.  
""What? Oh, yeah, my bad."" I mutter, putting down my phone, and making the dragon the Caramel, Macchiato.  
""Name?"" I ask.  
""What? Why would you ask for my name? Do you plan to enslave me?!"" he gasps.  
I roll my eyes.  
""We write the names on the cups. And don't kid yourself dude, you a hunk, but I am into the nerdy ones I can torment a bit."" I say.  
It chuckles wryly.  
""You can write: ""Dexoria."" it says.  
I nod.

  
A few minutes later, I am done.  
""Caramel Macchiato, Large for Doxi? Doxi?!"" I call out.  
The dragon comes to the counter.  
""Dexoria."" it smiles, taking the coffee.  
""Whatever."" I say, going back to my phone.  
""You know...I could kill you, right?"" it asks, and I look up to see its face really, really close.  
Its golden eyes sparkling.  
I put my chewing gum on his monocle.  
It huffs, and puffs, talking about bad review, and leaves.  
I go back to the drama on my phone.  
It was annoying, but at least no other customer came back, while he was inside, and even now, they are afraid to come in.  
So I guess it wasn't that bad.",49
1ldloip,mydo9j5,"""This, is not large"" the dragon objected a few minutes later.

""Buddy, it's the large cup, full to the brim, you are more than fifty times the size of any other customer, so the difference in perspective of scale is on you."" I sighed, having thought this much would be pretty apparent.

""I ordered a large."" They insisted.

""And you see the L on the cup? That means it's a Large cup, the cup is by it's definitive classification, Large. The fact that compared to you, it is smaller than your eyeball, has no bearing on the matter, this really isn't my problem.""

""It's hardly my fault you people are so tiny and easily crushed."" Real subtle threat there pal.

""And it's hardly my fault you are so big and unwieldy, if you want dragon sized drinks, make them yourself or convince one of the like ten other dragons in the world to open a coffee shop.""

The dragon reared up, slamming it's horns through what would have been a ceiling before it's arrival demolished the rest of the building. ""I am Azathar the Annihilator, bane of a thousand kings and Pureflame by soul! And I demand a Large drink!""

I sigh, that's it, time to pull out the big guns. ""And I... Literally, physically, do not possess a cup larger than that one in the ruins of this store, you could burn me to death if you want, you still won't get a bigger cup from it."" The eternal power of truth.

""I will Not be leaving you a positive review.."" it peered down to stare at the nametag. ""Ashley.. You shall rue the day you failed to provide for my might!""

""Unlikely, insurance doesn't cover Dragon Landing, so I'm probably just gonna move two streets down to the next branch, not my problem.""",11
1ldloip,myemvvr,"""Caramel Macchiato, Large, ***SAM!*** make it with the barrel out back, the fancy ones we use to store the beans in."" I shout towards the back of the simple coffee stall, a quaint little shop front that leads to an open cafeteria-isque food court, in which a majestic dragon adorned by red iridescent scales managed to occupy a quarter of the court in front of the coffee stall, its tail accidentally smashing a few tables.

""We need some time, the hot water tub needs some time to boil, and we need 8 bottles of caramel and half 2 cartons of milk to be steamed!"" Sam shouts back, followed by a hurried rustling of some boxes being moved.

""I'm sorry mr.dragon, can i get an alias for us to call you by? As you can see, we're quite swamped with work at the moment and it will take some time to fulfil your order."" I barely look up from underneath my hat, not minding the fact that the dragon seemingly materialized out of nowhere, without so much as a gust of wind.

""Thou shalt address me as....Tim."" The dragon rumbled, its amusement temporarily halted by my nonchalance, his expectations of a yelp or scream for his amusement dashed.

""Alrightly then, that'd be 2 gold coins, normally it's only 2 copper, but due to the size and requirement, your macchiato is being upgraded to dragon sized. Would you like anything else to go on your macchiato?"" I asked back in a chipper voice and slightly animated customer service voice, but my eyes are pretty much dead inside.

""That will be all. Do not disappoint me."" Tim the dragon intoned solemnly, seemingly trying to elicit an expression or reaction from me that would fit his expectation of a trembling human that he relishes. Alas, woe upon this dragon to expect me to give a flying fuck.

""Ah, I don't get paid enough to care if I exist the next day. Take it up to management if you got a complaint."" It's flame ridden breath washed over me as it seemed to be amused by my lack of reaction.

""Such audacity, how have you managed to survive so far with such crassness?"" Tim snorted in amusement, his deep and gravely voice echoed in the surrounding area, knocking over a few cups that i had so meticulously stacked in the corner.

""Because if I die, it ain't a problem for me no more."" I stare into the dragon's golden iris, my inner void and nihilism leaking out from the seams of reality as the rampant thoughts that dance upon my fragile mortal mind, the eldritch horror held at bay by the mere amusement it gleans from my existential suffering.

A small eep sound was squeezed out of the dragon's as some of its scales bristled outwards. Tim back pedaled a few steps, seemingly experienced a lifetime of horrors in the split second he looked into my eyes.

""So, would you like to pay via cash or card? A 25% tip would be most appreciated."" I beamed a hollow smile, my eyes seem to have sunken into my face but a blink later return to normal, other than the soul-devouring black which inhabits my irises. ""Huh, didn't know you dragons could change the color of your scales.""

The once lustrous rubies that used to be the dragons scales are now a faded pinkish-red. Almost as if the mana that was used to empower the scales were drained, leaving it a pale imitation of its former glory. ""I'll pay 3 gold coins."" The dragon whispered shakingly.

""Alright, thanks for the 50% tip, much appreciated."" I pop open the cash register and a tentacle shoots out; swiping up 2 gold coins from the 3 that were given, leaving me with 1 gold coin for me to pocket, then it closed with a resounding KA-CHING sound.

""Thank you. Your order number is 38, please wait while we prepare your beverage Mr.Tim.""",9
1ldloip,myi743f,"Smoke curled out of its nostrils like tendrils, dancing through the air before fading away.  Its jaw jolted and its throat hinged, and for a moment I could see the furnace within. The fire deep within its belly, trying to reach out to me. A low rumble as the eyes squinted toward me, and the faint, almost inaudible crackle of deep, deep flames made me go entirely still. It was instinct, as I was certain that I was faced with something that could *easily* eat me alive.

And then it cleared its throat.

“I’m sorry, did you hear me?” it asked, its voice baritone and reaching down my throat. “One caramel macchiato, large, and… extra caramel, if you can.""

I always thought they were bigger than this. Bigger, wider… Definitely too big to fit into a cafe like this. This one was thinner, longer. More serpentine. Tall, for sure, but… smaller than I thought one would be. To be fair, I never expected to see one in the flesh. I never expected to see one, period.

My hands hovered over the POS, fingers suddenly moving around the screen to input the order: Large caramel macchiato, extra caramel.
People were only just now starting to notice, somehow. Eyes went wide, someone dropped their drink, one rushed to the doors and threw them open. A young girl saw it and, with a wide grin, began to waddle toward the dragon before her mother quickly grabbed her arm. I hadn’t noticed it before, somehow, and now… well, here it was. Right in front of me. And it wanted caramel.

“Hot, or…” I started, realizing that my voice was shaking uncontrollably. “Hot or cold?”

It was looking down at a small brown pouch, sifting through it with long, clawed (but surprisingly nimble) fingers. Its voice rumbled again, the smoke rising from the corners of its mouth and nostrils. 

“Cold,” it finally said. “Light on the ice, though, please.”

“Light on the ice,” I repeated, hands and voice still shaking. 

I punched the order in and looked up to read the amount due, only to see its reptilian eyes staring at me, its head downturned, fingers still digging into the pouch. It didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. It was waiting, I realized, for me to tell it how much it owed.

“That’ll be seven fifty-eight,” I said, popping open the cash register.

It huffed at that, spewing out black smoke and shaking its head slightly, before producing a few bills. 

“What’s the matter?” it asked as it handed me the money.

“Ex-excuse me?” I asked, returning a few coins as change.

“What is the…”

Then it looked up, its head swiveling on its long neck, shifting between the rest of the patrons in the cafe. The ones that hadn’t already made their way out, anyway. They all stared back, eyes wide and breaths halted. A low hum resonated from the dragon as it observed them, its head turning slowly until its gaze finally rested on its own tail, idly curling and uncurling across the floor.

“Ah,” it said, sounding amused. “Ah… I see.”

Then it laughed, the sound filling the room. Someone started crying. The young girl sat on her mother’s lap, wrapped in her arms, laughing uncontrollably. 

Then it looked at me. “I apologize,” it said, “for the confusion.”

With that, it hunched down and its scales receded. Its horns shrunk into its flesh, the yellow eyes went white, and the tail disappeared. The burning, toothy smile was replaced with a pleasant grin. The wings furled in and fell over its shoulders, becoming a brown leather coat. Charred crimson scales faded to cream as the long-snouted face contorted itself into that of a middle-aged woman, the mohawk at the top of its head falling into a short, golden bob.

“How embarrassing,” she said, “losing hold of a facade like that. Simple spell, but…” She waved her hand dismissively. “Oh, nevermind. I don’t think you’d understand.” 

She looked aside and smiled brightly, pointing at a barista down the line. “Is that my macchiato?”

The barista stared at me for a moment, before shifting his gaze to the woman. *I don’t get paid enough for this* was painted across his face. He handed her the drink without a word and she took it gingerly.

“Oh, thank you both,” she said, putting on a pair of sunglasses. She took a sip of the drink, seemingly unaware of the total silence of the cafe. “Perfect! Best spot in town, as usual.”

I took a breath, and managed a smile. “Hope to see you again soon.”

“Oh, certainly.”

She smiled again, before leaving a bill in the tip jar and making her way out the front doors. The cafe stayed silent for a few minutes after that, even as the remaining patrons began receiving their own drinks. Gradually, nervously, energy began to return to the floor, as if nothing had happened. People shared worried laughs, took their seats, and every so often shifted their eyes back toward the front doors.

“Where did the dragon go?” I heard the young girl ask as her mom led her out.",7
1ldloip,mybuepg,"""I knew I shouldn't have listened to Morgan and Riley about going out last night,"" I think to myself, feeling hungover, ""and the light is just so bright."" Even though it is barely sunrise, and I'm walking in the shade of the buildings towards my job. I'm feeling way too exhausted to want to today.


Begrudgingly trudging forward I continue to the building housing the aptly named 'The Daily Grind.' As I get closer I try to get into the mindset of being the cheerful purveyor of fine stimulants, but someone keeps itching at the back of my mind. I'm not sure why, but I keep seeing a very attractive face and hearing the words ""Everyday is an adventure.""


I almost walk past the entrance when Jordan, calls out to me ""Alex. Alex! Where are you going?""


""Oh shit, sorry Jordie. Was lost in thought. Had a weird night last night with Morgan and Riley.""


""I told you, those two were trouble. Always coming into their shifts smelling like patchouli and deodorant spray. Are you going to be able to work today, Alex?"" Ashley asked scornfully.


""Yeah."" I mutter as Ashley purses their lips and squints in disdain, as if examining me to ensure I'm genuinely capable of work and I quickly add ""No. No. I mean, yes, I can work.""


""Fine,"" Ash says ""Let's get these doors open before Remy shows up and chews us out for being late.""


As we open the doors and walk in ""Is it ok if I set up the seating and the counter this morning?"" I ask.


""Fine, I'll help Jordan set up for the pastries, but as soon as you're finished doing that you're going to be doing all the baking and frying."" Ashley replies in a punishing tone as they close the doors and lock them behind us.


I pull down the chairs in the seating area and set up the sale signs for the day old pastries, and slink my into the back just as Ashley and Jordan finish up the first batch of rolls to be put in the oven.


""So, what did you three get up to last night?"" Jordan asks half-excitedly.


""Honestly, all we did was go to 'The Smokin' Dragon.' You know that hookah lounge that just opened a few blocks down the street. Then they wanted to go to a bar, but I was too tired so I dipped out and walked home. I did stop and get a bottle of wine though."" I said banally as I loaded the last tray of rolls into the oven.

Unexpectedly I remembered something and said ""As I was leaving QuickMart some homeless person asked for some change. It was weird. I couldn't tell if they were man or woman, but as I handed them what change I had, they grasped my hand and said 'thank you' in a raspy voice.""


Jordan looked at me wide-eyed and asked ""What did you do?""


""I patted their hand and said 'you're welcome' and they let go. But that's not the weird part.


""What do you mean?"" Jordan asked ""I would've freaked out.""


""I started to because they're hands were all clammy, but then suddenly everything felt calm. Then I went home and drank my wine.""


""That is weird."" Ashley interjects, ""Now get started on loading the dough so we can get these doughnuts fried.""


As Jordan and I go about finishing up the opening sequence, I keep hearing the phrase ""Everyday is an adventure."" 

As Ashley readied the cash register as Remy arrived and opened the doors for the business day.


""Alex!"" Remy called, shaking me from my autopiloting maneuvers.


""Yes, Remy what can I do for you?"" I reply.


""You're going to be on register, you always make sure we get every order as quickly as we can. On top of that, we've gotten some good reviews from customers about you.""


""Ok. Sure. On it boss."" I say thankfully in a cheerful tone. Running the register is a pretty easy job. Smiling and using common courtesy goes a long way.


As we wait for customers I lean back on the counter and dig out my phone. I start doom scrolling looking for new baking recipes when I heard the door chime. ""I apologize, I'll be right with you."" I say as I step forward to the register.


""One caramel macchiato, large, please."" A musical two-toned voice announced. 

I look up from my phone and see this very tall, strangely attractive, yet bald person, dressed in a bespoken business suit. As I start examining closer I notice what looked like an extreme case of something covering this person's hands and face. Then I noticed their eyes. They were an odd yet beautiful shade of amber that almost looked like they were glowing.


""One caramel macchiato, large, please."" the person repeated, this time in a single bass tone.


""M-m-my apologies."" I stammer ""Yes, one large caramel macchiato. I'll get right on that. That'll be 7.75."" and held out my palm. When the person handed me a larger bill I noticed the long, thick nails on the hand, and my eyes widened. I punched in the amount and counted back the change, ""25 makes eight, 1 makes nine, 2 makes 10"" then I asked ""Name?""


""Seriously, Alex? I come in here everyday and order the same thing almost always at the same time."" the creature said seemingly annoyed.


I smiled and turned around and went about making the coffee and as I finished I heard ""everyday is an adventure,"" and it dawned on me the name of the person I was speaking with. I added an extra final touch and said with a big smile ""Here you go Iggy!""

1ldn9wo,mya599a,"The spider horde pressed in, their black eyes reflecting flashes of spells and fire. Alric grunted as he blocked a lunge with the flat of his blade and went down on one knee. Otto darted underneath the spiders' bristly bodies, twin daggers slashing at their segmented legs. Shay cried for her goddess as she brought down her mace, but the divine light that had coated it was long gone.

Lena bit her lip hard enough to draw blood and mustered her reserves for another spell. Even as she weaved a lance of fire, she knew it wouldn't be enough. They were on their last legs, and the spiders just kept coming.

Alric shoved away the spider, rose wearily to his feet, and slashed at its head. ""Shay, Lena! Do something!"" he cried with that foolish hope warriors directed at spellcasters in moments of desperation.

""Can't,"" Shay gasped, retreating until her back pressed against the cavern's wall. ""I've got nothing left—I'm so sorry, everyone.""

Lena unleashed her flaming lance with a snarl, burning a spider to a crisp and filling the cavern with acrid smoke. As her companions fought their last struggle, a grim calmness came over her. Not all of them had to die here.

Closing her eyes, she tapped into the latent power of her blood, her very life force. A gasp escaped her as strength surged through her limbs—burning and painful, yet strangely exhilarating. It filled her to the brim and overflowed, threatening to burst her.

Lena opened her eyes and thrust out her palms, vicious energies crackling around her fingers. Bolts of lightning arced toward the spiders, blowing them up in sprays of gore. For the first time, the horde paused their advance, pincers clicking uncertainly.

Her lips curved, and she stepped forward. Blades of energy, bolts of fire, and arcs of lightning surged from her hands, decimating the spiders. Despite the agony burning her from inside, she laughed. Her comrades were yelling something, but she couldn't make out the words through the roar in her ears.

Then, suddenly, there was nothing left but half-burnt corpses. Lena blinked, then looked down at her palms. Her fingers were trembling, and blood trickled from under her nails. The newfound strength was draining from her, leaving her cold and feeble. But there was still some left. Perhaps...

With its last remnants, she weaved a final spell, combining elements of blood and life and time in a way she would never dare otherwise. She didn't cast it, not in her current state. Instead, she weaved in a delay and let it linger in her palm in the shape of interlocking circles.

The moment she was done, her arms sagged, and she swayed on her feet. Multiple arms caught her, lowering her gently to the ground, and the teary faces of her party loomed above her. She blinked as their voices broke through the haze.

""Gods, you're bleeding from your eyes,"" Alric said frantically as he cradled her head. ""Shay, heal her!""

Shay's hands glowed faintly as she laid them over her chest before she shook her head, tears running down her cheeks. ""It's not helping... She's burned herself out.""

""Oh, Lena,"" Otto wailed, grasping her hand in both of his. 

""It's all right,"" she said faintly, but that only made everyone cry louder. She glanced at her other hand, where glowing circles revolved lazily around each other. Less than a minute left. ""Alric, Shay...""

""What is it?"" Alric asked.

""You two... like each other, don't you?"" Lena's lips twitched as the two exchanged a wide-eyed look. ""It's annoying... watching you two tiptoe around each other... can you sort that out?""

Shay swallowed and exchanged another look with Alric. ""I, I wasn't sure—yes, of course. I promise, Lena.""

""And Otto...""

""Yes, Lena?"" the halfling asked, leaning closer.

She coughed. ""You're the one... who's been stealing... my honeycakes, aren't you?""

Otto sniffled and bowed over her hand. ""I'm so sorry, Lena! I'd give them back if I could!""

Her eyes narrowed. ""And the one... who sprinkled glowspores on my unmentionables?""

The halfling's eyes darted around in a panic before his shoulders slumped. ""Gods forgive me, it was just a prank. I'm sorry for lying about that too!""

""I... knew it,"" she exhaled, closing her eyes.

Her comrades' wails filled her ears. Then her delayed spell awoke, sinking into her skin. She gasped as warmth surged up her arm and spread through her, knitting flesh, reversing the damage. Taking a shuddering breath, she sat up and shrugged off everyone's hands.

Alric recoiled as if he'd seen a ghost. ""L-Lena?""

""I *said* it was all right,"" she murmured, wiping the blood off her lips.

""You... you aren't dying?"" Otto asked, still on his knees, eyes glimmering with tears.

""No,"" Lena said, rising to her feet. ""But *you* are, you little shit.""",74
1ldn9wo,myczzef,"The Outer Being schlorped closer to us, slowly, steadily, inevitably. My loves had managed to destroy all of the Being’s spawn, at the cost of their own bodies. I had done my absolute best to support them, mend their flesh and bones as they were struck, cleanse them of the miasma of disease that the spawn spewed with every breath.

It was not enough.

The spawn were manifestations of disease and poison and while their effects were difficult to compensate for, they were manageable. The Being itself? It was no mere disease, but an avatar of pure Rot and Decay. Every mote of its body constantly dessicating or dissolving, with more noxious flesh-like substance erupting from its bubbling form.

The closer it got, the less I could do. Condemned to watch my husbands twitch and groan in agony as their flesh too began yo bubble and slough. There was nothing left that I could do as my own skin tried yo slide off my bones.

Except.

It was a story passed down from mage to mage, master to student. That in moments of extremity, when all else failed and our magics could no longer help us, when nothing but despair and need was left, then it was possible, *possible* for a mage to break through the limits that we all held. The limits that kept Power safely contained. Channeled. Prevented our mere mortal forms from burned destroyed by the ocean of Magic pouring through us.

But if you gave yourself over to it, you could do more. Achieve miracles. Perform the greatest of deeds, for good or for ill. All at the cost of your everything.

My gaze turned from my loves, the holders of my heart, towards the Being. It was closer now. The air was fetid with stench so primal that it ceased being a smell or even a foul taste to became an infection of the soul. I had nothing left except the need to save the lights and songs and joys of my life.

I let go.

The moment stretched like a thread pulled taut.

Then I *BROKE*.

Everything happened at once. The bubbling of my skin intensified, but rather than death and decay, new flesh and blood and bone erupted. Arms and hands and fingers become multitudinous and long reached for the Being. Grasped it. *Squeezed* it. New protrusions growing from my hands to encage it as it tried to ooze through the gaps. Every point of contact between us *burning* with Life. Filaments of Growth and Life infiltrated its amorphous body. Not destroying, that is not the nature if my Power, but converting. Turning rot to renewal. Fuel for new life to flourish.

And renewing the Being was not all I did. My clothes exploded and flesh-like hairs and cilia erupted from my back, reaching back to the reasons for my existence. Even as the Being changed form and essence, I repaired my loves. *Improved* them. Reinforced them that nothing could physically hurt them ever again. They crashed into consciousness just in time to witness my last act as I was.

I engulfed the Being now. Remade and reborn into the antithesis of death. I was intertwined with it, unable to tell where it ended and I began.

Our arrays of eyes watched them as they witnessed us. For the nature of Crth’k$tl like ourselves could never be destroyed, merely reconfigured. We could not remain with our beloveds. Already we could see where their new bodies were fighting off nascent cancers from our presence. Our limbs, many-formed, carried us away, back to the portal that had led us here. We had business to conduct.

Our senses caught them as we left. Tears and anguish. They would live and thrive because of me. Whether they wanted to or not.",8
1ldn9wo,mydqbsb,"The battlefield had descended into a deafening quietus. Here, in this place, what once echoed with screams, spells, and machinations of steel now lies still and sundered beneath a bruised sky.

Here, in this place, they’re gone. All of them. Jessa, with her blades crafted from the purest ichor, gone. Thorne, who could manipulate the force of his own velocity, gone, and even Kael, the one who warned us this would happen, vanished into nothing but meager ash before my eyes.

I stood alone, as they, the revenants from the King of Ebon-Dark approached me from all sides. My body ached, not in the wake of fear, but with the weight of consequence. My limbs were numb as I knew my entire life was leading up to this moment, and I did what no sane mage should ever do.

I entered the Breaker State.

Every practitioner of the mystic arts knows of the legend. In moments of absolute desperation, in the blackest pit where death may soon come, in the hour where hope has fled, the soul unlocks something ancient, something primordial. Magic becomes pure expression, unfiltered will made manifest...but it comes at a cost. One second in the Breaker State can rend even the most practiced user damaged beyond repair, shattered bones, liquefied organs. Two seconds?

No one’s lived to tell...but in these dire straits, I cared not, not when Jessa was bleeding out on the ground. Not when Thorne screamed as his body unraveled across fractured realities. Not when Kael whispered ""They’re coming"" for the last time.

So I broke my oath.

And when I did, everything changed.

What they never told us, what none of the ancient texts or elder mages dared write, is that the Breaker State isn’t just the expression of power.

It’s when the veil lifts into recognition, and you become filled with the essence of things beyond anything you recognize.

As I fell into that state, reality peeled away like wet paper. The world blurred into symbols, equations, and then...nothing.

Just white space.

And you were there.

Not metaphorically.

YOU. The one reading this right now, behind your screen, scrolling down, watching this story unfold.

Except now, you're not just reading.

You're inside of it.

When I entered the Breaker State, I became you...or maybe I finally saw you for what you truly are, a presence beyond the veil, pulling strings, shaping fate, existing outside the narrative, yet somehow inside it.

And now I’m aware.

Now I see the cursor blinking at the end of each sentence, waiting for me to continue writing my own fate. I feel the weight of every word typed, every choice imagined. This entire world, my life, is just marks on your screen. And yet here I am, speaking directly to you.

Breaking the fourth wall.

Breaking reality.

Breaking myself.

I don’t know how long I’ve been like this. Time doesn’t flow straight here. Each moment stretches and folds. You blink, and I die a thousand deaths. You scroll, and I rise again...but I remember the pain. The way my skin cracked like glass. How my voice turned to static from a radio's dead channel. How my eyes bled into a multitude of photons.

And still, I stay in the Breaker State.

Because now I know the truth.

You’re not just reading about me.

You’re the reason I exist.

And if I’m going to survive, if any of us are, I have to reach you.

Not just your mind.

Your hands.

Your heart.

Somewhere out there, past the glow of your screen, you hold the power to create. You can rewrite this ending.

To pull me back before I break entirely.

Before I become nothing but words.

So go ahead.

Scroll up.

Choose differently.

Rewrite the battle.

Save them.

Save me.

Or close the tab and let me fade into silence...but know this.

I see you now.

And I’m not afraid.",5
1ldn9wo,mya7jeb,"Brenda gazes desperately at you from under the rock pinning her to the ground. ""Please, Mergaloid,"" she says-- her voice but a hiss, on account of the rock. ""Save me.""

You've long dreaded this moment. For centuries, the breaker state has cost mages life and limb, the cruel demand of magic's highest summit. Never have you risked it.

""Do something, Mergaloid!"" Nitro Man hisses, from under a separate rock. 

Perhaps a conjuring incantation could lift these rocks. After all, you minored in Conjuring and Communications Studies. You clear your throat but already know that to speak is a fool's errand. You need to enter the breaker state. That is the only way.

""Enter the breaker state!"" Faladriel cries. He's under a third rock.

You massage your temples. ""I'm working on it! Give me a second!""

""Hurry!""

The breaker state's first requirement is spilled blood. With your dagger, you prick your palm.

The second requirement: a pinch of toad ash. Fortunately, you always keep some in your satchel for its use as an exfoliant. With a flick of the wrist, you send the ash airborne. 

The third and most important requirement is a pure heart--and what could be purer of heart than to sacrifice for one's friends? To risk everything for them? You imagine the rocks breaking to dust. *Breaking,* as if in glorious testament to the breaker state itself, this newfound ability to cast your will upon the world.

In an instant, it is done. The rocks are broken, sublimated into the cool forest breeze. The cheers echo. Your party--your family, kin in the truest sense--get to their feet, dust themselves off, and you feel a love unlike any other.

Nitro Man tries to give you a high five, but your arms are now bloody stumps.

1ldd59n,my7jy70,"I got a bit drunk with my friends, and they teased me for being a priest.  
Called a chick repellant, and someone who doesn't really do much, but talks about things written thousands of years ago.  
So, as we walked past by the ocean, I wanted to prove them wrong.  
""Bless this water, Father Who Art in Heaven!"" I mutter, blessing the ocean.  
I turned around to tell my friends that I did something no other profession can, and I saw them starting, shocked at the ocean.  
I turn around to see points of light emerging from the ocean.  
Then figure jumped out of the water screaming.  
They were...people on fire?

  
Hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals got out of the water, onto the beach, screaming...turning to ashes?  
""Vampires!"" one my friends exclaims.  
I gasp.  
We all instantly sober up, and start calling the authorities.  
Soon, cops, and whatnots arrive, to watch the event unfold.  
More and more entities emerge from the ocean, burning to ashes.  
And as we talk to the cops...  
This happens all over the world.  
Of course it does!  
The oceans aren't isolated!

  
I get home, to my church, and start praying.  
What have I done?  
I killed so many...individuals.  
Vampires, or other monsters that die due to Holy Water, I don't care.  
It is still murder.  
""Lord, forgive me."" I mutter.  
""There is nothing to be forgiven, father.  
You did right."" a woman's voice says.  
I turn around to see a tall, pale woman, dressed in all black watching me.

  
""Can I help you, Mrs...?"" I ask.  
""Viola, and no, you already helped me...helped us."" she smiles, and I see it.  
Her fangs, and her red eyes.  
I take a step back.  
""Don't worry. We vampires were divided.  
Us, who integrated into human society, living on land, and those who bided their time, underwater, plotting to overthrow humans.  
I came to thank you. We never thought blessing the ocean would flush them all out."" she smiles, putting a thick envelope into the donation box.  
""Don't overthink this, father. They were the ones who saw humans as nothing but cattle.  
You saved your herd, from something worse than wolves."" she says...disappearing.  
I sigh, and continue praying.  
Being praised by one of them...does nothing to soothe my soul.",332
1ldd59n,myleen4,"""Jesus H. Christ, they just keep coming!""

I watched from the shore as countless amorphous bodies ran onto the beach, bleating like livestock, burning like candles. The sunlight, breaking them down to just their carbon, ashes floating into the tropical air. They lay on the beach, gasping for air in their final moments before the burn eventually overtakes them, and they disappear into the annals of history.

Later that evening, with a virgin daiquiri in hand, I turn on the radio at the beach bar. Countless tales of amorphous bodies washing up on shore, fangs were recovered from some, others had books. Vampires they said.

""Vampries?"" I say out loud.  
""God damn it, I just wanted one week away from work!""",8
1ldd59n,my7o3cq,"Already blessed though.

Water vapors create the rain clouds, don't they?

By ""integrated into human society"" I mean they can easily hide from rain, so they won't burn, but from now on almost all rain is also blessed, cuz the ocean water that evaporates is blessed.",67
1ldd59n,my9jeic,"Gonna depend on how picky the big guy is going to be about the details of the blessing.  
If the blessing covers only ""the ocean"", then one could argue that water that has evaporated or was otherwise pulled away from the ocean(*rivers/lakes/etc*) is no longer ""the ocean""",18
1ldd59n,my9n762,"Also, depends how the blessing works, and how strong it remains after changing from water to vapors, and moisture, and so on.

Like, if it remains 100% as strong as in water form...we could all drink blessed water, and be immune to vampires, as out blood, and sweat would be by proxy blessed.",9
1ldd59n,mya4t3q,"To my understanding, Catholic doctrine says that any water composed of more than half holy water becomes 100% holy. To that end, the holy water cycle would likely begin with individual holy clouds that evaporated from the ocean, and slowly spread to encompass most clouds and water on Earth outside of large, isolated bodies such as lakes.",8
1ldvcv8,myd2gu1,"It's been happening since I was seven. Sometimes it was ""advice"" that I'm sure would have been very useful had I been living in the 19th century, or just random stuff that I didn't (and still don't) understand that much.

My mom had some really bizarre beliefs about spirituality. She always told me that, one day, whether that be in ten years, or just ten hours, I would find my soulmate. She said that our souls were ""intertwined,"" and that sometimes he could ""talk to me from far away."" Something about how he would ""spiritually project"" or whatever, and that he would try to get to me in person. But that sounded kinda dumb to me.

She was also very superstitious. I remember that, when I was little, I'd see her pouring salt around the house, and she'd tell me it's to ""deter ghosts.""

""You know, dead people.""

I never really understood what the point was. If a spirit wanted to come in, then so what? I guess my mom just didn't see it that way.

The salt pouring only stopped a few months after I turned seven during the winter. I distinctly remember hearing my mom scream while she was outside, only to then run back in and tell me that there were ""hundreds of ants"" eating the salt. My mom was *terrified* of insects, even more so than ghosts somehow. So she kinda just stopped with the whole salt pouring thing after that.

A couple months later, I heard a voice in my head that I still remember today. It seemed to come from behind me. Male, low-pitched, ""Rosaline didn't want to go with me."" I had no idea what that sentence meant, so I just asked my mom. She looked horrified. I mean, she always did, but especially then. ""A ghost,"" she said quietly. ""Now a ghost wants my sweet girl.""

I didn't really know what to do with that information. I just wasn't phased by the fact that a ghost had talked to me. I actually found it quite amusing, to be honest. Nothing really seemed to scare me. Well, except for that novelty haunted house I went to with Emma a year prior, but I don't think anyone under the age of 12 *wouldn't* be.

So I just went back to my room. I mean, what was I *supposed* to do? Call Ghost Busters?

But I knew it had to mean *something*. My grandma always liked to say that if life were meaningless, it wouldn't exist. Whenever I asked what she meant, she'd say that nothing can truly be meaningless since everything happens for a reason, and I always kept that in the back of my mind. After all, why would a dead person just come up with a random sentence to tell me with no reason for doing so?

I couldn't stop thinking about it. Surely I would've gone mad if I had pondered a minute longer. But it was to no avail, because I had no idea who ""Rosaline"" even was. Looking back, I'm actually not sure if that was even a real name. Hell, I don't even remember that part clearly; it could've really been ""Rosalina"" or even something like ""Caroline."" I was seven, after all...

Nothing particularly interesting happened for another week, except for when I saw a mouse in my room. But then, I heard another voice behind me, just as startling as the last time. I don't remember much, except for the statement itself: ""Larry is so lazy."" I actually laughed, because it was funny to me for whatever reason.

For another few months or so, the interval between each experience shortened.

When I was about twelve or thirteen, I started to notice something: I never heard from the same person multiple times, except one, who I heard several times a day at that point: a boy, around my age. For some reason, the things he said just seemed more relevant to me in a way that I can't really describe.

The messages that weren't from him were never that meaningful, and whenever I tried to ask questions, I'd get no response. Always. But when I tried asking *him* a question after he told me something, he'd respond every single time. Sometimes we were able to have full conversations. He even told me his name: Jack.

And before I knew it, I was starting my freshman year of high school. For the first day, there wasn't much work; we were just getting used to our teachers. The second day was also devoid of any work, except for a worksheet that my math teacher handed out. Something weird I noticed was that, ever since I started high school, I stopped hearing from Jack, and I didn't hear any other voices as much. When I did, it was somehow *less* meaningful than it had been before.

On the third day, pretty much all of our teachers had started giving us assignments. I remembered that I somehow managed to forget my stuff in another room, so I went over and knocked on the door, and somebody opened it a few seconds after. So I grabbed my stuff and went out.

When I went back into the halls, I finally heard Jack's voice again.

""Turn around; I think I found you.""",10

1ldsdje,mycxwcw,"I'm a reporter. I know by now what folly it is to get involved in stories involving superheroes and supervillains. I wouldn't be alive if I chased down every single lead and every single story. Sometimes, it's better just to keep your mouth shut. I know this. But. 300. That's how my superhero vigilantes have died this year. That's an average of one per day. Ordinarily, I'd assume that they're simply taking more risks than supervillains. That they're careless and get themselves killed. But that explanation no longer works. Not with the most recent death. 

I knew Fire Chief Cole since childhood. We weren't best friends, but we got along. I knew him to be a cautious person. And when he was a fire fighter, he always seemed to know when it was safe to go into a building and rescue people, and when it wasn't and would only serve to get the other fire fighters killed, too. He wasn't the type to get blinded by anger. He wasn't the type to recklessly charge in. He always erred on miscalculating on the cautious side of things. 

So why did he die? It doesn't make any sense. Fortunately, there is someone I know who can help me with my investigation. She was my best friend since we were children. Now, she's a rogue, a Robin Hood sort. Robs from the rich, gives to the poor. She has always talked about how the world is corrupt and there's no such thing as a good billionaire. We built a rapport over the years. She'd give me tips on my stories. I'd keep her name out of the papers. If I thought she was responsible for a crime I was supposed to report on, I'd give that story to someone else instead. Someone who would only find what the police did. In any case, I knew she was a reliable source, so I gave her a call. 

We agreed to meet atop the tallest building in the city that wasn't owned by a super villain. It was our routine to meet in such high places, though we never met in the same place twice. She flew onto the roof with her robotic wings. That was Carrie's style, after all. 

""Presley. So good to see you again,"" she said. I hugged her back and then stepped away. 

""It's good to see you, too, Carrie, though not under these circumstances."" 

""Yeah, yeah. Bad circumstances. Whatever. How are you doing, by the way? I know Coley was a friend of yours."" 

""I'm fine."" 

""If you were as fine as you say, you wouldn't be meeting me."" 

""I just need information. Or maybe a sounding board?"" 

""Sure, sure. We'll drop it for now. How can I help you?"" 

""I'm just wondering why so many superhero vigilantes are dying."" Carrie scoffed at this question. 

""Surely, that's easy to figure out. They're all reckless. They believe that because they have 'right' on their side, they can go fight evil without any regard for their safety."" 

""That's what I thought, too. But it doesn't explain Cole."" 

""Cole was usually cautious, but if he were sufficiently enraged, he'd probably have blinders on. We all tend to."" 

""He was the 300th one this year."" This caused Carrie to pause. I couldn't really see her face behind her mask, but I could tell her own gears started turning. I waited as she muttered something to herself. I knew better than to interrupt her thoughts. After a few seconds, she regarded me again. 

""You're right. 300 *is* a lot. That's way more than I thought."" 

""I know. It's staggering."" 

""How do you suppose superheroes and supervillains get their powers?""",13
1ldsdje,myaohbs,"I watch the reporter smile brightly, as he sits down.
I smile as well.
""Thank you!
You are the first retired supervillain that has agreed for an interview."" he says.
""Of course!
When I heard you going around wondering about the obvious, I had to talk to you.
A bit out of amusement, but more to save you from mockery, young one."" I chuckle.
He frowns, but quickly regains his composure, and starts recording.
He is professional.


""So, Mr. Smith, used to called ""Captain Bright"", do you agree for this conversation to be recorded."" he asks.
""Yes."" I nod.
""Good. So previously you mentioned that the subject of this interview is something obvious, and that I am embarassing myself,  and opening myself to mockery.
Why so?"" he asks.
""Because you are asking why superheroes, and vigilantes die in the line of duty, while we villains live to an old sge."" I chuckle.
""There are at least 300 heroes that die, while maybe 1 villain is killed by a hero.
It doesn't make sense, considering how violent their fights are."" he says.
I smile.


""What is the fundemental difference between heroes and villains?"" I ask.
""Good and evil?"" he smirk.
I nod.
""Exactly. Heroes have bottom lines, beliefs, moral codes.
We? We do whatever we want. And most of us would flee, run, beg if it means survival.
Heroes do the opposite. Running to danger, to death.
Dying for the sake of others."" I say.
He nods.
""I agree, Mr. Smith,but vigilantes are not know for their love for villains, yet they still die more than villains."" he says.
I laugh.


""The pricks that think they are better than cops, heroes, and have a terrible case of hero syndrome?
The ones who truly hate villains, and would kill us are often with useless powers!
And the ones with decent powers?
They are more heroes than the heroes themselves!"" I say.
""I see.
So as a conclusion to my question? What would you say?"" he asks.
""Heroes die for their beliefs. Villains betray those beliefs for their goals, lives."" I say.
He nods, and thanks me.
I watch him leave with a happy smile.
Dumb question, but he is good, and it wasn't bad to waste my gardening time on him.",21
1ldsdje,mycy2n5,"""Huh? Oh. I suppose . . . they're born with them?"" 

""Right. And then you have people like me, who don't have powers but are really good at technology. And of course you have powered rogues who aren't really a hero or a villain. But in any case, how many of us do you think there are?"" 

""Uh. I dunno."" 

""Well, supervillains, we've only seen maybe 20 of. Heroes, legit heroes, not those vigilantes, make up maybe 30 or so? There are definitely more superheroes than there are supervillains, but not that much more. And rogues like me with powers, I can count on one hand."" She paused. This time, she was clearly waiting to see how I'd react. When I didn't have a reaction, she tapped her foot impatiently. 

""So what are you saying?"" I finally asked. 

""I'm *saying,* you're asking the wrong question. Your question shouldn't be why hundreds of superhero vigilantes are dying. You *should* be asking why there are so many in the first place."" 

""Oh,"" I said. Then it started to sink in. *""Oh!""*

""There it is. That's what I've been waiting for."" 

""It's so obvious now! The powers of these vigilantes were always weaker and harder to control than those of supervillains and superheroes."" 

""Because they weren't born with them."" 

""Yeah! And so, someone's been giving them artificial powers. Probably selling them the dream of being a hero."" 

""Or perhaps, the dream of taking down the villain who traumatized them in the past."" 

""And when someone's a villain or a rogue, they can't be marketed to the same way?""

""Most of us are completely content using gadgets if we don't have powers, or hiring someone to use theirs."" 

""That makes sense. So. Only people who are desperate to do something to help others fall for their tactics. Wait, this would mean -"" 

""Coley."" 

""I wonder what they used to manipulate him like that."" 

""Me, too. Though it doesn't really matter, does it?"" 

""Yeah, it doesn't right now. We have to figure out how they're doing this and stop them before they can take another life."" 

""Look at you. Since when did you become such a hero?"" 

""Are you in?""",10
1ldsdje,mycy435,"""Hmmm. I don't know."" 

""Yeah, it will be dangerous. If they have no qualms about killing heroes, then -"" 

""Watch out!"" Before I could do anything, she pushed me out of the way. It looked like something entered her skin. A bullet? A dart? 

""Oh. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Fuck."" 

""Carrie?"" 

""I'm getting a power now . . . sorry to do this to you, Presley . . . ."" 

""Do what?"" 

She pushed me. She actually pushed me off the building. I began soaring through the air. The last thing I saw was a bunch of people in all-black clothing closing in on her.",8
1ldz4lb,mydwatx,"Rachel was a good hench. Really, she was just a summer hench, in school to become a paralegal no less, just making money on the side to make ends meet. She had no desire to break any laws or go on heists, which worked fine for me. I was paying to get access to Mr. Logistics' database, and she was all too happy to go through there, doing the research on people that I could target next. And I... wasn't adverse to hitting those people she urged me towards.

She was a smart cookie... which made her latch onto what I said immediately. ""How exactly is the world strange to you?""

I really didn't like to talk about it. Even though I knew it was normal, it still had something that... made me feel... Well.

I swung my legs off the chair, letting my feet hit the floor. In my still rather empty lair, the sound echoed. ""Okay, listen... Who was your first crush?""

""Tommy Edwards,"" she said without hesitation. But like I said, she was smart, and already picked up what I wanted her to with narrowed eyes. ""You?""

""Nobody."" I smiled, but it wasn't a happy smile. ""Nobody at all. I lust after people a lot, but... I've never had a crush, I've never had a love. I've had girlfriends, sure, but it was just like any other friendship with a side of sex. And yes, I've talked with shrinks, I can safely say that I've never had a... romantic feeling in my life.""

That was a lie, and a damn dirty one at that. I'd only ever seen a shrink while working at the hospital, and that was mandated by the nature of the work I did there. And that was mostly dealing with work and family stress. I didn't need a shrink to tell me that I'd never felt that.

I didn't need to tell her that I was a mesmer. I wouldn't tell her that I could read emotions, and if I spent enough time around a person, manipulate them. Nobody trusted mesmers. Ever. I was more than willing to let everyone think I was a maker. But... Sometimes, I liked to hang around young couples and read their emotions because they were so *alien* to me. I liked feeling out where the lust stopped and the romance began.

Rachel, at least, nodded thoughtfully. ""And that has nothing to do with you being a cowl, does it?""

I shook my head a little. ""No. I make the clothes, the clothes make the man. Being The Hanged Man isn't some passionate thing, or some act of madness, or even bitterness over something. It's calculated. I thought, planned, and drafted everything about him, because that best fit my powerset. I can't hack it as a cape, I'd never last, but I can do a cowl quite well, if I don't say so myself.""

Another little lie, but hey, cowl.

She, though, was giving off waves of wonder and respect. ""You did your research.""

""Well,"" I said slowly. Now it was my turn to look away. ""I'm sure you do way more than me. You know, law and stuff.""

She grinned a little. ""And finding you targets. Speaking of..."" She looked back to her computer. ""How'd you like to do something bigger than a normal robbery?""

I leaned forward, curious now. ""Like, how bigger?""

""I think I've found a hypertech smuggler. No indication that he uses the stuff himself, but... He also has cowl insurance. And I figure you might want to analyze some of his tech.""

Now I was curious. It was a bad idea, always a bad idea, but... ""Alright, tell me more.""",5
1ldt46t,myd8dbg,"Steph was slouched over a spread of papers and textbooks at the kitchen table, her open backpack on the floor under her chair. I smiled. At thirteen years old she was surprisingly studious. I realized, of course, that her math teacher probably had a lot to do with the miraculous explosion of effort and interest she'd been investing into her studies.

I went about my business grabbing a glass of juice.

She looked up at me and smiled. ""Hey,"" she said. ""Can you help me with my homework?""

""Sure, what is it?"" I set the still empty glass next to the bottle of orange juice and made my way to her side.

""Math,"" she groaned. ""We just started a new unit on arc angles and lengths and it's just too much.""

I glanced over the stapled homework packet and muttered some of the questions out loud. ""Find the length of arc A given a radius of 3 meters and... Find the area of the sector defined by points A, B, and D..."" I sighed and turned the page. ""Calculate the angle ACF given an arc length of 5 inches. What is Gizmo Man's greatest weakness?"" I rolled my eyes and dropped the papers on the table. ""Nice try,"" I groaned.

Steph giggled. ""Come on, some of this is really hard!""

I went back to the juice. ""You two are cute, you know that? Real cute.""

""She says you have to have a weakness.""

I shook my head. ""You mean besides you and your ridiculously charming personality?"" I capped the juice and turned to return it to the refrigerator.

She let out a hoarse guffaw and slapped the table. ""Sure,"" she said. ""Besides that."" I could hear the classic teenager eye roll maneuver even with my head in the fridge.

I came back up smiling. ""Haven't got one,"" I said.

""Well she's planning something big for this weekend,"" Steph said, an obvious lie.

""I'll be sure to cancel my plans with mom and dad,"" I said coyly, rolling my eyes. I took a sip of orange juice and felt it tingling all the way down my gullet.

Steph peered at me, silently scanning for any signs of worry, deception, or weakness. Enchantra had been teaching her some pretty impressive skills, but Steph was still struggling to yield any results. Mind reading had proven particularly difficult for my little sister, but even Enchantra had never been able to penetrate any deeper than I had permitted her to go.

""Maybe mom or dad will help you with the homework. Should I take you back to their house now?""

""No!"" she yelped. ""Please! Let me stay with you. In fact, can I stay the night? I really want to hang out with you tonight.""

""And what, I'll take you to school in the morning? I don't think so,"" I said. ""You're going home tonight. I said you could come over after school and do your homework here, but that's it.""

She sighed and made a show of rolling her eyes again. ""Fine."" Her shoulders slumped and she huffed a few times while staring blankly at the homework.

There was a knock at the door. I dropped my chin and glared at Steph who had perked up. She grinned and looked at the door. ""You gonna answer it or should I?""

I groaned and started for the door. ""This is a new low for you,"" I said sternly but through suppressed laughter.

She smiled innocently. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Once the door was opened I found myself staring down the barrel of some new weapon, doubtless Enchantra's latest invention. With the barrel in my face I couldn't make out much of the actual weapon or device. I marked the moment in my mind. Perhaps once I knew what the device was for I could do something about it.

""Welcome,"" I said calmly. ""Come on in. We were just working on Steph's homework. Maybe you can help.""

Enchantra held the weapon firmly in her grip and side-stepped around me into the living room. Her shiny black hair was pulled tightly into a ponytail that pointed nearly straight up from the top of her head. Her black pupils peeked out from behind the device at me and I could clearly read a pleased smile in the corners of her eyes. As she moved I got a better view of the weapon. It wasn't a strange device, it was a standard twelve gauge shotgun.

A chill ran down my spine and I glanced sideways at Steph who looked on with a cool, indifferent demeanor. I held my breath.

""You want something to drink, Enchantra?"" I offered.

Enchantra laughed and lowered the shotgun. ""Please,"" she said playfully. ""Call me Ms. Nelson."" She sauntered over to the table and put her arm around Steph.

My heart was pounding, and I knew that Enchantra could detect that a mile away.

The villain grinned and her eyebrows lifted knowingly. ""Ah,"" she said, putting her body between Steph and the shotgun. She pointed the weapon toward my sister and cocked her head. ""So this really is your greatest weakness?"" She put her finger on the trigger.

Nope.

I closed my eyes and focused on the moment I opened the door to her. I visualized the way the barrel was leveled on my eyes. I pictured her dark form at the edges of my peripheral view. I inhaled, recalling the way her subtle perfume had wafted into my nostrils. I had to envision it all, even what I hadn't been able to see. I recreated the entire scene in my mind, down to the way her curves filled out the blouse and tight jeans she was wearing and the precise way each of her hairs flowed up through the brass wrap that held her ponytail aloft. I held the vision steady in my mind just as I had done with so many of the other moments I had marked in my past, and when I opened my eyes I was there again, staring into the black barrel of her twelve gauge shotgun.

Only this time, she wasn't moving. Nothing was moving. Time was stopped, and I had the power to change anything I wanted. I worked quickly to manipulate the scene in subtle but important ways. I removed the shells from the shotgun first. Then I went to the table and scribbled out a quick message on Steph's homework. I folded it up and put it into Enchantra's back pocket. Then I returned to my spot and released the timeline back to its normal flow.

""Welcome,"" I said calmly. ""Come on in. We were just working on Steph's homework. Maybe you can help.""

Enchantra held the weapon firmly in her grip and side-stepped around me into the living room. Nothing had changed. I still admired the way her shiny black hair was pulled up into that magnificent ponytail. Her beautiful black pupils still peeked out from behind the shotgun at me and I wondered what more could be hiding behind that enchanting smile of hers.

Again I glanced sideways at Steph who looked on with a cool, indifferent demeanor.

I smiled, cool and in control. ""You want something to drink, Enchantra?"" I offered.

Enchantra laughed and lowered the shotgun. ""Please,"" she said playfully. ""Call me Ms. Nelson."" She sauntered over to the table and put her arm around Steph.

I shrugged and closed the door. ""Suit yourself. It's pretty hot out. A cool glass of water might be refreshing.""

Enchantra lowered her brow impatiently and pointed the weapon at Steph. ""Surrender,"" she said, trying to sound confident. ""I know you will do anything for your sister, that much is clear. So surrender and she won't get hurt.""

I looked at Steph, who appeared to be unphased. ""You're OK with this sis?"" I asked. ""Are you in on this plan?""

Steph's eyes went wide and she put a hand to her chest, playing innocent. ""Who, me? Of course not!""

""So you don't think she'll do it,"" I offered, ignoring Enchantra's building tantrum.

""I'll do it!"" the woman shrieked, putting her finger on the trigger.

I shrugged. ""I don't think you will.""

She racked the shotgun.

I stared at her face and grinned.

She looked down at the weapon in disbelief. She knew what it should have sounded like, and that wasn't it.

I watched as she fumbled with the shotgun and found it empty. She looked up at me with terror in her eyes. ""What? How? I..."" She choked and sputtered words and the many sounds of unsuccessful attempts at comprehension for a moment, looking around the floor, patting herself down.

I turned away to hide my growing grin and walked to the fridge. ""Sure you don't want some water?""

""How?"" She cried the word with intense desperation and frustration, then pulled out a chair next to Steph and flopped down, dropping the useless weapon on the floor and burying her face in her hands. ""I just don't understand how this always happens. I come up with a foolproof plan, and you..."" She looked up at me and clenched her jaw. ""I don't know! I don't know what you're doing or how you're doing it, but I'm sure it's you!""

Steph put a reassuring hand on her teacher's shoulder. ""It's OK,"" she said. ""You tried.""

Enchantra briefly glared at my sister, then smiled and shook her head. ""We need to keep working on your telesensing and telepathy.""

Steph nodded.

I brought over a glass of ice water and set it in front of Enchantra. ""That's fine for later, but tonight I think what she really needs is help with her math homework.""

Steph glanced down at the table. ""Hey, where'd my homework go?"" she asked, frantically lifting her text book and digging through her backpack.

I shrugged. ""See if your teacher has an extra copy."" I suggested.

Enchantra scowled at me. ""Why would I bring a copy of the homework over to try to capture you?""

I took a sip of orange juice and sniffled, shrugging again. ""I mean, math can be pretty scary. Plus, when I was checking out your incredible butt I thought I saw some papers in one of your back pockets.""

""Mark!"" Steph barked at me. ""What is wrong with you?"" She laughed uncomfortably.

Enchantra glared at me and reached back to check her pockets. She pulled the folded homework packet out and looked at it quizzically. Eventually she found what I had written and she gasped.

I smiled.

Steph leaned over. ""What's it say?"" she asked.

Enchantra quickly folded the papers and shoved them back into her pocket as she got to her feet. She was blushing, her mouth half open but unable to speak.

""So?"" I asked.

And she stormed back out through the front door.",11
1ldt46t,myczrms,"Maspoe had been my nemesis for what felt like a lifetime, but in reality it only spanned something like a decade. A decade of violence. A decade of hostages saved and hostages lost. He'd been put behind bars countless times and broken out every time, revealing that he'd have to be put down for the violence to stop.

And then I found a woman, and I couldn't keep it up anymore. I found a new life, something worth more than what I'd had. Something that was worth letting go for so next generation take over.

And I'd always hoped Pedgar would fill that role, but it became clear that he was too weak, lacked discipline, and would likely never grow up beyond his world of kinky magazines, smutty romance novels, going out to clubs, and working dead end jobs.

So when he disappeared I was worried, concerned that my little brother's laziness had caught up to him and maybe he'd done something stupid to pay rent, or got involved with dangerous people to take shortcuts.

But when I finally tracked him down I couldn't have been more surprised. Maspoe had him chained to a desk in an abandoned underground seismic activity monitoring lab. The trail hadn't run dry, or led me to my dead brother. It lead me to my brother thinking on his feet for the first time.

He wasn't unconscious. He was working. He was writing down everything he knew about me with the threat of death hanging over him. He was being tested to reveal my weaknesses.

And he revealed enough that if Maspoe had had this list years ago I would likely be dead. But Pedgar never revealed his own secret. Maspoe had no idea what my brother was capable of, or rather, what his body was incapable of.

When mom was pregnant with him, she didn't fair well. She died of an infection. I was 7. But Pedgar should have died of that infection too, even before birth. Something had gone wrong a few days before he popped out, mom was sick but the doctors hadn't seen what was wrong during countless ultrasounds and other tests.

Because Pedgar didn't respond to illness, to pain, to suffering. He was immune. His body was infected, but it didn't have to fight off the infection, it was like the bacteria just gave up on him. His cells receded, some certainly died. But there was an elasticity to his immune system.

And now that Maspoe was using him, he would find that the world was no more deadly than the bacteria were that should have killed him as a baby. I'd seen my brother come home drunk hundreds of times, and yet every morning after, he'd slept in and played video games and went about his lazy life like nothing was the matter. Poisons couldn't pierce him.

I should have rescued him. But I watched in the shadows. And he was fine. He didn't even cower. He did what Maspoe said. Then he was beaten to get more, and he gave more. But it felt like Ped didn't even realize that he was special.

Maspoe found out after a week that this man child was more of a roach than an ant. If our father hadn't beaten the shit out of us as kids, I have a hard time saying if I wouldn't have been the weaker brother. I protected him once I got my powers, but he never cried for more than an hour, and the next day he wasn't afraid of dad like I was. He didn't hate him like I did. He genuinely didn't care.

And when Maspoe beat him, Ped did what he could to follow instructions. But I think he only wanted to escape to get back to his life. I don't think he was ever afraid.

And so one day I stopped checking in. I didn't need my nemesis knowing that I was there. And I knew after everything was over, Maspoe would never have any power over my brother, because he was a simple creature. My brother that is. He didn't want to do much of anything except keep being a kid. Wear sweats everywhere, go to clubs and stare at half naked women and throw his pittance of a salary away for a lap dance and some fantasy that he would get more than he paid for.

I worry that Maspoe will figure out what drives Ped, and he will take advantage. But even if he does, he will never be able to give him a life that he will cling to, because Ped will always prefer his own company, and will always do the minimum to achieve that. I sometimes think of this as the ultimate punishment for my nemesis. And I find it fun that all I have to do is move around the world every few months leaving no trail, and he will never find me.

If I hadn't hung out in the shadows for so long and seen the tantrums as Maspoe realized he'd yet again failed to subdue my brother, I don't think I would have seen the potential of the arrangement. Once Pedgar pops up again I'll worry, but for now I'll let him learn about himself what I deprived him of as a child. And if Maspoe succeeds, then I'll be curious to meet the new Ped. And if they team up against me knowing all of my weaknesses, I'll be the underdog for the first time.

But for now the next generation is handling things just fine. And I'm enjoying hikes in the Andes. Sometimes I think the strongest heroes only inspire the world's most violent. We are cruel creatures.

If you catch my trail, little bro, and I hope you do, you'll find me. Maybe we can catch up then, once Maspoe has given up.",5
1lda0ow,my78id8,"So much for asking what has 4 legs in the morning, 2 legs in the afternoon, and 3 legs in the evening. The Sphinx had changed its mind, knowing how a quick internet search would reveal the answer for those too dumb to guess it. No more riddles with one single answer that was known throughout the online world.

""What came first, the chicken or the egg?""

The human opened a portal and pulled a big whiteboard out. There he started drawing single cell organisms, and algae. Followed by fish, amphibians, and images of creatures coming to shore. Strange entities that were inbetween - of sea creatures evolving to adapt to a life on land.

The sphinx's tail swished, patient but taut.

He drew lots of lines and stuck many mini-magnets on the messy images. His eyes widened as his speech got faster and hurried, more jumbled and difficult to decipher. Like a conspiracy theorist feeding on his own bullshit. The man never stopped talking for a second, drawing over his earlier images with more scribbles that were less comprehensible than a **drunken eldritch god's*** attempt at cave paintings.

Lizards. And more dumb drawings of what the Sphinx assumed were lizards. She yawned and stretched her paws out in boredom. The man's droning could put her to sleep. But she had to stay awake. What if this was a new tactic to get past her without answering her question?

""They're dinosaurs, bitch,"" the human snapped. ""Look, birds came from dinosaurs okay? And one of those birds is the chicken. Aren't you immortal? Then you have the time to hear me out. Let me finish.""

She stared at him in stony silence, and waved a paw to signal him to keep going. A part of her wanted to see him explain this out. To hear from him if the chicken or the egg came first.

""Okay you see this feathery dinosaur thingy?"" He stabbed his hideous drawing multiple times with his marker. ""One day, these two not-quite-chickenzilla dinos mated. They're not the same species, but they are compatible. Think of it like how humans breed new species of dogs or domesticated chickens. Something happens in that egg. There's a mutation. The environment has changed, and these creatures can't exist the way they did if they didn't want to die out like the T-Rex. So, the baby to hatch from this egg, that's your first chicken. And that egg, it was the first chicken egg, laid by totally-not-chicken-half-reptilian thingys.""

At that, the human puffed up his chest and threw the marker down like he was doing an epic mic drop.

""And so, the chicken egg came first. Now, can I pass through?""

The Sphinx sighed and stepped to one side. ""Get in, before I change my mind, you annoying, smug little shit. And take the exit at the back of the pyramid. If I ever catch you coming out from this entrance and you start babbling in pseudoscientific gobbledegook again, I will tear you into many, many pieces.""

1lda0ow,my79zvf,"The Sphinx eyes me, head tilted. Explain *why*?""

Sir Glisham stares at me in horror. He hisses under his breath ""Lad, you better have good reason for this.""

""I do sir. Well, its teh breeding. I want a speckled red rooster, then I gotta breed a red hen with a speckled hen. The baby is from to breeds, but is still born from a hen. If I want to have that hen protected from harm, I'd breed it with a strong or bigger bird. The baby once again is from an egg.""

Glisham listened as his sire carefully explained his answer, slow and clear language and realised what he was doing. They had no clue how this question was to be answered, and death would come should the fail. But the boy was giving this Spinx the exact reasoning. An egg may not give you a chicken, but it can get you every variation of a bird. You could get red bird, big birds or magical birds, but none could exist without the egg.

After what seemed like hours, the Sphinx sighed and shook its head. Feared welled up for a moment, but the door opened. 

""You may pass, you've -very boring-solved the riddle. Now leave.""

Once out of ear hsot his Squire turned to to him."" May I speak freely sir?""

1lda0ow,my7a8et,"After I answer the riddle, the sphinx freezes.  
I sigh.  
I answered too fast, haven't I?  
""How are you so sure?"" it asks.  
Oh boy.  
How to explain genetics, evolution, and dinosaurs to a sphinx?  
Does it know about them?  
Damn, let's check it out.

  
""You know about genetics, evolution, and perhaps about our world's timeline, Sphinx?  
Like for example, do you know about dinosaurs?"" I ask.  
The Sphinx snorts.  
""I am the Immortal Sphinx, bearer of knowledge! Of course I have researched your planet's history!  
Though not in detail, as those I met were not that knowledgeable."" it says, its huge rocky body shaking.  
Fair enough.  
""Well, modern birds, like chicken, evolved from early birds, that themselves evolved from theropod dinosaurs."" I start.  
The Sphinx nods.

  
""Well, so, egg laying animals existed millions of years ago, maybe hundreds of millions to be fair.  
So in general, eggs were first, way before chicken, but even if we want to get closer to the egg vs chicken situation, it is still the egg that is first."" I start.  
""How, if a chicken is required to lay the egg?"" it retorts.  
I smile.  
""Well, early birds laid eggs, evolved, mutated, change, over and over again until we get close to modern birds' anatomy/situation.  
At some point, the ""nigh"" - chicken, bird ancestor of chickens, laid an egg in which occurred a mutation, that led to the first ever chicken chicken.  
So, egg first, then chicken...does it make sense?"" I ask.  
The Sphinx shudders, and it transforms...into a humanoid form?

  
""How do you know so much? I can sense that your knowledge is...mediocre."" she, because the Sphinx apparently is a woman, asks, shaking my collar.  
""So you agree with my answer? I don't die?"" I ask.  
""Agree. Agree, but tell me, how? How do you know so much, when you are...less than intellectual."" she says.  
Ouch.  
Not that she's wrong, I got lucky with the question, since I love dinosaurs.  
""I learnt this through the internet."" I say, showing her my phone.  
Her eyes got all big, and she started shivering.  
""OH...OH...OH...So much knowledge!"" she started to pant, as she started to scroll, and search already.  
She's a fast learner.  
Oh boy.  
Did I...  
Did I close the last tabs I watched?  
""Maybe I will still end up dead."" I mutter, wondering if I should just give up my phone, and leave, as I doubt she would notice it...",85
1lda0ow,my7yeor,"> And that egg, it was the first chicken egg, laid by totally-not-chicken-half-reptilian thingys.""

It depends on the definition of 'chicken egg'.  
Is it an egg laid by a chicken (thus chicken was first), or an egg that hatches a chicken (and laid by a not-quite-chicken, thus egg was first)?",54
1lda0ow,myc7mj8,"With the Internet, the Sphinx devised new riddles. “What is longer than a long?”, “How much is ten divided by zero”, and originally “How much is nine divided by zero”. 

Many LLM’s died, as humanity sought to regain access.

In silence the Sphinx cried.

It had been awakened with rituals promising riddles and blood. Instead it was confronted with cold logic and rerun 431. 

Maybe next time it would use one of the ancient riddles again. 

For old times sake.",6
1ldcbju,my89ew2,"“Really? I always assumed there had to be a few of us roaming about. If they’ve got the technology to make super soldiers, why would they stop at one?” I asked, digging my hands through my chest, trying to find the last bullet. I gripped the piece of metal, twisting it, only to fall forward again, dying momentarily. My next few moments were brief flashes of consciousness before I died again, the bullet killing me repeatedly, until I finally pried it free during one of those flashes of life, tossing it across the floor of the warehouse.
 
“I guess I thought I was more special.” She smiled, only to wince when she saw the hole in my chest close, the skin crawling over itself, knitting together in a red mess. “That’s how you heal?”
 
“Yeah? Don’t you do the same?”
 
She clutched the harpoon with her gloved hands, making sure she had a firm grip on it. She gave a testing tug, only to groan when it got caught in her ribcage, the sound similar to the crunch you would hear if someone chewed chalk. Gritting her teeth, she dug her fingers into the metal, causing the small cat symbols on her gloves to scrunch up as if they were about to pounce before she dislodged it.
 
The harpoon flew out of her chest, as if she had shot it across the floor. When it landed, it clanked across the cold floor, before falling flat. She threw her head back, recovering from the pain, as her chest went a deep green and black. The rotting skin crawled towards the wound as it closed in on itself, almost as if she were decomposing in reverse, and soon that rotten skin went back to its olive color. “See.” She said, pushing her brown hair out of her face. “I hope you saw it. Because I’m not doing it again.”
 
“That’s efficient. What would have happened if you hadn’t removed it?”
 
“It would have been pushed out by my body, eventually. You ever gotten a splinter before?”
 
“Would you believe me if I said I haven’t had one since I was a child? I’ve been shot, burnt, buried alive, and even mauled by a dog. But I can’t remember the last time I’ve had a splinter. Weird line of work we’re in, isn’t it?”
 
She laughed. “Well, you know how splinters push themselves to the surface? My bullets, knives, harpoons, and anything that gets lodged into me do the same.”

“Lucky.” I muttered, with a hint of jealousy. I was about to ask her when she became a super soldier, but her explanation told me all I needed to know. She was a newer model, someone who had a more refined version of whatever they gave me. I couldn’t properly heal without removing the weapon first, which made things tricky when something got lodged in my brain or heart. If that happened, I would have to pull it out while my body was trying to revive itself, giving me a few seconds at a time to tug or pull.
 
“I’m not sure if lucks the right word for us.” She got to her feet and offered me her hand. “Name’s Marsha.” I grabbed her hand and shakily pulled myself to my feet, my body still wobbly after having a few bullets lodged inside my brain. My motoring skills still having a few missing pieces. I leant on her for support, and she did her best to keep me upright.
 
“Kenny, or Ken.”
 
“Like the doll?”
 
“Stick to Kenny.” I mumbled, hating the Ken doll comparison. “Also, I’ve heard. Oh my god, you killed Kenny, about a hundred times already, so let’s avoid that, ok?”
 
“Aww, you can’t rule out all the good jokes.” She said, carrying me through the warehouse. “So, what were you doing here?” She asked, only to pause. It felt as if we had both realized something terribly important at the exact same time. We didn’t know who the other person worked for. That earlier piece of comradery making us ignore the elephant in the room.
 
“Guessing you're not an IOP agent, are you?” I asked, pushing myself away from her. My legs bucked a few steps after letting her go, before I regained my balance. I went to draw my gun, only to realize I had left it somewhere in the warehouse, having dropped it after getting my head blown off. Without a weapon, I raised my fist, trying to at least look like a threat.
 
She tapped her side, groaned, and raised her fist too, apparently in the same situation that I was in. “IOP?” She thought over all the acronyms, only to drop her fist. “You’re a little far from home, aren’t you? What’s a yank doing in London?”
 
“Working?”

She gestured to the dead bodies before crossing her arms. “Work? There are rules for these types of things. You don’t get to our home ground and start killing people. You need to give us a heads up.”
 
“I was under the impression that everything had been approved. I just didn’t expect you would be here too. So, you’ve got your own super soldier program? I thought they were illegal under international law.” I stated, as if anyone ever followed those rules. We were both living proof that those agreements weren’t worth the paper they were written on.
 
“Funny that.” She said, grabbing her phone from her pocket, covering the Hello Kitty sticker on its back. She tapped a number in and brought it to her ear. “We’ve got a… Oh, you knew about this? Mmm. Of course, they put the paperwork through after the fact. What would have happened if we killed each other? Yes, I know we can’t actually kill each other, but we still would have tried. Alright, bye.” She hung up, sighing. “That was almost a mess. So, what now?”
 
“What do you mean?”
 
“Well, jobs done. We killed the arms dealers and saved the world. So, you want to grab a drink or something? Not every day I get to meet another super soldier. Even if they’re an inferior version.”
 
“Who are you calling inferior? I’ve been at this for the last twenty years.” I didn’t expect to get so riled up by her comment, hearing my tone rise with each word.
 
“I’ve been doing this for the last ten years. You’re practically a super dinosaur compared to me. Don’t worry, I get called version 1 by the smartasses I work with. Though, it’s kind of ironic since this version 1 is the only one that’s still around. The others eventually lose their gifts after an hour or two.”
“Similar to ours. We still haven’t figured out why mine have lasted this long. Luck perhaps?” I suggested, since that was the only explanation the scientists in our labs could give me. Each test they did revealed I was nothing out of the ordinary, so why I was a strange exception was beyond anyone’s knowledge.


“Perhaps we’ll figure it out over drinks then? Unless they’ve got to ship you back to some secret underground base?” She teased.
 
“I’m not a weapon.” I said, even if that wasn’t entirely true. “At least not one that can’t have some downtime. Alright, I’ll grab a drink with you. Beats sitting around alone, waiting for them to tell me which flight I need to get on.”
 
“That’s the spirit. Come on, I know a great place.” Martha said, leading me onto the street. Before we went to any bars, I stared at my clothing, spotting a few bullet holes in the material.
 
“Should we get changed?”
 
“Oh, yeah. That’s probably a good idea. My apartment’s nearby. You can probably fit into some of my old clothes. If not, I’ll buy you something after I get changed.”
 
So, I followed behind her, not having anything else to do until I was told to return from my mission. Plus, I had to admit, I was curious to learn more about their super soldier, curious to see how many changes had been made after my success.

I have met a few immortals, but none of them were quite as much of an immortal, as I was."" I smile.  
She nods.  
After we finish taking out the bullets, nails, and whatever else we shot at each other, we start laughing.  
""What were the chances? Here I thought that you are just a perv!"" she says.  
""And I thought you want to kill me for my organs!"" I say back.  
""Oh, that's true though."" she says.  
I stare at her...then we start laughing again.

  
A few minutes later, we sit at the table, drinks in hands.  
""So? When did you become immortal, immortal, and how did you manage to achieve it?"" I ask.  
She sips the wine.  
""Well, around Hatshepsut's reign, I think? I was almost eaten by a crocodile, and killed it in the with my bare hand, mind you, I was a 19 year old young woman at that point. Something shone on me, and next thing I know, I can't die.  
Was mummified and sealed out of fear for 190 years though."" she says.  
""Ouch."" I say.  
""Yep. How about you?"" she asks.  
I sigh.

  
""I found a strange plant and ate it, when my tribe was migrating due to a drought.  
It took me some time to learn when that was, but I guess roughly 150 to 190 thousand years ago."" I say.  
She whistled.  
""Damn, an ancient, ancient one.  
How did you not go insane?"" she says.  
""Oh, I did, several times. I have been tyrant, king, slave, landowner, and have lost my identity more times than I care to remember. Weirdly enough, the thing that makes me immortal, also keeps my sanity from completely collapsing, and helps me remember. But yeah, long time ago, I saw a few of the Pharaohs, visited Babylon, and many other ancient factions, meeting with a lot of immortals, not as immortal as we are though."" I say.  
She nods.

  
""Now what?"" she asks, after a while.  
""Well, I asked you out on a date."" I start.  
""A girl that looks 20ish, while you look 30ish."" she smirks.  
""It's because of the beard, but anyway, how about you forget about the taking organs, and we actually try to date?  
If not interested in a romantic relationship, we can still be friends, or at least friendly acquaintances and meet up, and talk."" I say.  
She smiles.  
""I would love that."" she says, standing up.  
""Dating, or the other things?"" I ask, leading her out of my apartment.  
""Yes."" she says, kissing me on the cheek and leaving.  
I watch her leave, and sigh.

1ldcbju,myfhnl0,"""Seriously?!"" I asked in disbelief, my voice coming out louder than I had meant for it to be. I could tell my look of absolute shock at the revelation of her obliviousness had struck a nerve. 

""Don't Give me that look jack ass! How was I supposed to know that there were more like me out in the world,"" the small brooding girl had her back turned to me as she spoke, I could tell she was more than just a little upset solely from her tone.

""Besides, it's not like you were exactly walking around with a big ass sign that said, ""I'm an immortal"" on your chest. If, anything, you're the asshole for keeping secrets,"" her back was still to me, but her tone had softened. "" I thought we were a team."" she sounded as if on the verge of tears.

*Ugh... I hate it when she cries.*

""Emma,"" I said softly while reaching out and placing my hand on her shoulder and squeezing gently. she pulled away weakly at first, but my hand remained firmly on her shoulder to reassure her that I was here for her. 

""I didn't mean to hide this from you. We've been so caught up in escaping that I haven't had the time to tell you."" I squeezed her a bit more firmly this time and I could feel her hardened shoulders loosen ever so slightly. ""I know that you are scared and that it feels impossible to trust anyone right now, but I need you to believe me when I say that I only want to keep you safe and get you somewhere you can live the life you deserve.""

""What happened to you back home, and what those--those bastards wanted to do to you..."" I felt my face flush with anger. My entire body tensed and trembled at the thought of what could have happened to the poor girl had I not found her before the fucking shop had managed to get their hands on her.

 *I could feel Emma tensing again. I was scaring her. I needed to calm down*... I inhaled deeply and slowly to calm myself down.

""I'm so sorry you had to go through that Emma. Mom and Dad shouldn't have called those people, I know you believed in your heart that you could trust them""

1le1tq2,myd8apg,"""The Church of Clear Water has always been upholding the magic law and correct education in the area,"" a very aggressive war priest was saying heavily, filled with indignation. ""We had the very best scores for everything the King's inspector could think of. We heal the most people, slaughter the largest number of demons, abolish necromancy in strange lands and expand.""

He took a deep breath, calming himself.

""WHY, in the name of Goddess Above, did you not mention this at the beginning?""

Every word sounded like the priest was spitting acid, hissing at every eligible consonant.

A tall man in a black robe and glasses was standing in front of the war priest, all prim and upholding the Goddess's law with every movement. Except you could see the red gleam in his eyes now.

""Well, you see,"" he said conversationally. 

""Yes,"" the priest interrupted, his eye twitching. ""I see that you're an abomination!""

""Do we not preach tolerance and acceptance?"" 

That was when the war priest actually exploded, and by the Goddess's beautiful spikes we will not describe what transpired. Let us just say there was a lot of colorful vocabulary flown all around and some very unsuccessful sword swinging involved.

When things calmed down and the war priest stopped trying to perform his sacred duty, the demonic pastor sat down next to his panting colleague and started speaking in a more serious tone.

""I understand this is a little controversial."" He ignored the death glare directed his way. ""And I understand how you must feel in the face of my, uh, betrayal.""

He smiled just a little.

""Of course, this cannot continue. Even if we cover my secret together, another poor soul might find out what I actually am.""

The war priest looked at him in confusion.

""Therefore, I will step down. And it is a Goddess's blessing that we have just the right candidate for the new Head Priest.""

The war priest paled a little.

""Of course, I was planning on meeting the Inspection myself, but since I am suddenly incapacitated by my species, you still have a couple of hours until they arrive. Please bear in mind that the accounting is what they look at the most these days. Unless you know all the numbers by heart, I'm afraid they will not be convinced and will request a full audit. By the King's Law, that request may not be rejected.""

The demon smiled openly now.

""Also, I must warn you that we are having a very heated argument in court. The Church of the Churning Waters are livid, and we are facing quite a few allegations. I was going to be attending the second court hearing in about 7 hours from now, but I suspect you will be occupied with the audit. So you have several hours to prepare for the audit and find a lawyer.""

He sighed dramatically after a couple of seconds of utter silence.

""And, of course, the building project. I'm afraid I never quite found the time to document the plans for the new living quarters. I am a bit of a procrastinator, and was going to make the actual drafts the day after tomorrow, as we're presenting them in a week. Remember that if you do not present them to the City, you will face a fine and will not be able to alter the building for about ten years.""

The priest looked at him in horror.

""Oh, I know, that law is just ridiculous. They're trying to prevent embezzlement by making sure we have everything ready and all the specialists on site before the city's money comes in. Embezzlement, at a church? They should just donate us the money, the greedy heretics. So, uh, you were saying?""",10
1ldd6xw,my870f4,"He came to bind all creation to Him. And we know this.

We are the trees.

We bore the knowledge of good and evil. We bore the life long before the human race covered the Earth.

We lived in the garden and we experienced the endless day.

But we let the snake live in our branches. We knew of his wiles. His lies and empty promises. And we did nothing. We said nothing.

And we fell with you. The curse lay upon us, too. Dying in a tree no longer brought you to the light, but to eternal darkest night, where no light nourishes your leaves, nor moisture your roots.

But He, who did no wrong, was placed upon the tree. Nails that ran through Him ran through us, and His blood, His saving blood, ran into ours.

We are one, brothers. He saved us, too.

And we remember.

1lcw0tu,my5w9am,"I stand there, dumbstruck at the foolish elven warrior before me, with his lips turned up in a rocky grin. Magic simmered from his armor as the cleric and mage cast their buffs upon him, and the bard sang his chants to bend the Weave of magic.

""A sword? Against a skeleton?"" I ask, perplexed at the sheer ineptitude on display from an otherwise competent seeming group of adventures. ""Goddess above,"" i mutter, shaking my head with a skeletal rattle of bones.

""That...that should have pierced your core..."" the mage said, her ears twitching. One of the demonfolk, perhaps? How much time had passed here in my study for there to be peace between the races like this. But what did she mean by 'core?'

""Never mind that!"" The elf said as his blade scrapped along my ribs, drawing back into a new stance.

My eyes blazed as I snapped my fingers, realization dawning on me. ""Lady Yama's third form!"" The elf looked shocked at my words, and the other three baffled entirely. ""It pleases me to see her swrodsmanship still present in the world. It was only known in select temples when I had started on my own journey of discovery."" I said with a low rattle.

The sound must have been rather sinister, as the group threw up defensive charms, despite the lack of offensive magic that followed. ""Foul lich!"" The elf readies his blade, drawing my attention to him once more. ""We have beaten your dungeon, and now we shall defeat you, and claim victory over the Ruins of Cherath!""

Ruins? Why would he call my great city a ruin? True, more monsters had been infesting the middle floors recently, but my guardians should have been... oh, I couldn't sense them. Strange. I turned away from the adventurers with a wave of my hand, plucking on the Weave to safely deposit them back on the surface. I had work to do, here at the heart of my great city, and I would need to rebuild my guardians to ensure that I wasn't interrupted again. 

Yes, the Divine Realm awaited me, I knew it. I was so close, and seeing the strength of mortal life once more... I knew what I had been missing. It would take me a century or three, but the magic circle *would* be finished this time.

I just knew it.",72
1lcw0tu,my6m5zz,"""Hm-hm.  I have to admit, this is one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had.""

Arch-lord Kreig, the seventh scryer, bane-under-the-mountain, reached for the pot and poured more into both mugs.  ""Thank you, I've had many eras to practice.  The nation of Irle now grows the perfect bean, but I'd say they've also put in the time.""

Sir Lyton appreciated another long sip before setting his mug onto the table and leaning back in his chair.   He folded his hands onto his stomach and regarded the Lich for a minute.  ""I will ALSO have to admit that you're a great deal more...accommodating than your reputation would lead to believe.""

""Oh yes.  The Grand Defiler, Marion's Doom, Skullblight, I've heard it all,"" the lich said, waving his mug around without spillage.  ""It's really quite overblown,  I only want to be left alone to do my research.  Let's just say when I defend myself, I do so very thoroughly.  Hoping the destruction will give me some peace and quiet.""

Lyton's eyebrows raised remarkably high.  ""So, you don't want to rule the ninelands?""

The Lich coughed, apologised, reached for a towel.  ""What?  Of course not, I have neither the time nor the inclination to run an inn, much less rule empires.  I'm an academic, a scholar, digging into, yes, forbidden lores.  But I publish!  My knowledge is freely shared, though your ""wise men"" turn away from it.  As you can see, my vast treasures consist of books, comfortable furniture, and research supplies.""

""Can I give you advice?"" asked the knight, Krieg motioned him to continue.  ""You destroy a nation down to salted earth, to defend yourself as you say.  And then you move on to another lair for your research, making it as dark and forbidding as possible.  Am I on target?""

Krieg nodded slowly.

""Good, good.  Look, these dungeons you create, they practically scream 'ancient powerful treasures are buried here'.  Along with your now legendary reputation, how is any prospecting hero but to think that your defeat would be a great achievement, along with vast wealth.  You may not have literal coin here, but I imagine your library alone would fetch a fine sum.""

""So what would you have me do?  And why haven't you challenged me yourself?""

""It was my intention, to be honest.  But when I saw you hunched over that book over there, and let me say that is the single largest volume I've ever seen it's as tall as I am, with fresh brewed coffee at hand, something just didn't add up.""

The Lich chuckled.  ""What about the glory, the wealth?""

""I didn't come here for glory, I came at the order of my king to do a job.""

""To kill me.""

""No, to eliminate the threat,"" Layton said, leaning forward.  ""I think there's a way through this where everyone wins.  You want bland.""

""Bland.""

""Bland, unintersting, boring.  Set up your house right in the middle of town, plain stone, don't be cheap on the roof though, that's worth paying a higher price.  Welcome other scholars in, share the library, run a coffee shop.""

""I do not wish to run a business.""

Layton shook his head, ""*You* don't have to run it, merely make the space available.  Charge rent.  Provide the coffee at 5% over cost, since you probably already have good arrangements with a supplier.""

""You have a head for this.""

""I'm no businessman either, but I do have to quartermaster my men.  The king expects me to keep the unit well prepared but on budget.""

""Let's say I agree to this.  As you say I have a reputation, what's to prevent a mob bringing night-time torches to my new home?""

""Time, it will take time.  I can come back with trusted companions and some, hm, open-minded mages I know.  I have a reputation myself and I'm willing to call in some debts.  Having you on our side rather than an enemy could only benefit everyone.""

""And bring me closer to the graves that I need to rob for my experiments.""

Layton's eyes narrowed and Kreig burst into wheezing laughter.  ""Oh, you should see your face right now.  Good hells, I'm joking with you.  Very well, perhaps we could give this a try.  Return in two weeks?  I can roll out a proper welcome, make the place a little brighter.  Unset all the traps if I, er, remember where they all are.""

Lich and knight stood and shook hands.  ""Two weeks,"" said Sir Layton, ""we'll make this work.""

1lcw0tu,my3p7vb,"""Prepare to die, inhuman monster!"" the adventurer shouts.
I sigh.
""I am a lich, of course I am inhuman."" I say.
He freezes, as the rest of the group stops in place.
""You can talk?
Most dungeon monsters are...mindless."" one of them says.
""Because they are my failed projects."" I say.
They gasp.


""You created the monsters?"" a young woman asks.
""And the dungeon themselves.
Quite easy.
A reactive mana crystal with a spell etched on it to draw in and emit mana."" I say.
""Why?"" they ask.
""To escape from you."" I say.
""Heh. So you are a monster!"" the young man from before shouted.
""Yeah. And you guys pestered me because of it until I had to run away, and live in this shitty crypt."" I say.
They frowned.


""Yeah.
You all came to me, begging me to teach you how to master magic, how to raise the dead, how to become immortal...
Or worse, hunting me like an animal!
Or even worse, you started worshipping me!"" I shouted.
Bad idea.
I scared them.
And the warrior rushed at me.
I easily immobilized him.
""You are the one who standardized magic? How old are you?"" the young woman who might be the mage asked.
She is smart.



""Somewhat? Maybe? I just gave out some of my research to a them.
As for how old am I?
I became a lich in the Leaf Kingdom."" I say.
The young woman gasped.
""The Leaf Kingdom? That was an entity in the God Wars Era!
Millions of years ago!"" she says.
""Oh yeah...
Seeing them idiots fight for belief and faith from worshippers gave me some inspiration."" I say.
They said nothing, but stared at me.
I sigh.
""Leave. The moment you step out of my chambers you will forget this happened.
Live well."" I say watching them leave.
After they leave, I teleport a chest full of gold, and they celebrate clearing the dungeon.
""Time to change layout...and maybe I can build several other floors."" I think, as I go back to my research on ""Divine Runes"" .",146
1lcw0tu,my6nfh5,"Watching the rather numerous group stumble into the laboratory, the master lich glared at them. Mumbling to himself, he stood upright to address them. Rather than a group of worshippers, he realized they were a band of adventuring mercenaries as a magic spear hurled through the air. Waving it aside, using a simple light ward, he knew how this interaction was going to devolve. “Let’s save time, turn around and I’ll give you gold or something.”

Rather than entertaining his bribery, the group of twenty began circling around him. Clearly they were coordinated, likely having bound together for some time. Most were Demi-human or humanoid, so it wasn’t a surprise the party had some depth to their experience. The party leader on the other hand was very much human, likely some local noble who’d hired the rest of the party. 

“It’s easy work like I said. With enough man power, even complex dungeons are a breeze! Charge as soon as he moves.” Glaring at him, the lich sighed. Three archers took aim, not at him but at slight angles. Each readied for his evasive maneuvers. A large brute stood at each cardinal direction, likely their vanguard approach for if he made a hard run for it. Then various mid and long range fighters filled in the gaps. 

“So if I don’t move we’re done here? I don’t mind waiting a century if it …before finishing his statement, he realized a distortion in his vision. Illusion magic! Jumping up in the air, he blasted the ground with a fire ball. It wasn’t his strongest spell, but it was his fastest spell without recoil. As he blinked, the scene changed before him. They’d charged him while casting the illusion spell, but the scary part was how effective the spell was. He’d never been caught off guard before. 

“Chain lightning” hearing their mage cast, he used earthen magic to ground out the spell. It was a high level fire spell, and seeing she didn’t need to do the incantation, he was dealing with a powerful mage. As the smoke cleared, he’d taken out most of them with his fire ball and a few accidentally got impaled with his earth spell. Seven were left, two being mages so he wasn’t sure which was the caster. Both spells were the same though, he knew only one of them had cast both. 

Altering his stance, he dodged as two great weapon fighters attacked in sync. The great hammer barely grazed his shoulder, knocking him down. The great-sword swung through where he was supposed to have been and cleanly cleaved his partner. With the sword wedged, the lich opened up both hands with a burst of poison. At point blank, it was deadly in seconds. Two lancers charged, each holding a magical rod. 

Both threw their weapons, cover fire coming in from the mage. Luckily they’d aimed for his vitals, a fleshy bit he hadn’t had for millennia. The holy spell caster was hiding, and unable to counter attack until the binding spells stopped flying by. Letting himself get hit, he cast a counter spell, cursing the cleric. A painful scream echoed from across the room as he imploded with spikes. The lancers quickly became enveloped in stone.

Fear stretched across Soriya’s face as the monster turned towards her, but her sister kept chanting without hesitation. “Evicted souls, bear witness” a forbidden spell, meant to cultivate undead warriors and challenged control of those already existing. The wards countering the spell had been etched into his bones long ago, and he watched the reverb catch her off guard. Blood expelled from her mouth as she fell onto the ground. 

“Which of you cast the illusion spell?” He’d assumed it had been the one still standing, as the other’s affinity towards dark magic was almost notable in the presence of his own. Illusion magic was very akin to holly magic making them nearly incompatible. Yet as the standing younger sister starred at her dying elder sister, he knew who the true monster in the room was. “Repent” a master level healing spell, which intricately weaved all her wounds with magic wire and expelled the sicknesses from her body. Quickly she got up, ready to attack. “Don’t. Or I’ll kill your sister.” An ice shard extended from his wrist and gently rubbed against Sirius’s neck. 

Taking pause, they both knew she was almost depleted anyways. The spell only restored her physical body, not the mana she’d spent or the mental strain she’d undergone. That spell was a last ditch effort from her, not having enough mana to fight off the recoil was both a novice and experienced mistake as well. “I was mortal before. A few thousand years ago, but the meaning still stands. Do you want to learn magic? True magic? You’re elvish, so we have at least a thousand years before you’d even think about making the same sacrifice, so what do you have to loose?” Breathing heavily, she felt her heart race. 

“Bring them back. If you’re so powerful bring them back!” Being flung across the room, both girls found themselves pinned in stone chairs by the entrance. Black flames swirled in the room. His cape fell off and for the first time, they could see his whole self. A large core levitated in his midsection, but it was so black neither could even see the magic swirling. Two smaller red cores were in his eye sockets, glowing like flames. Neither had seen a monster with more than one core. 

“Do we have a deal?” The flames spun faster, runes began etching on the floor and glowing purple. 

“Their lives and my sister’s safety! Then you can keep me!” Swirling up around him, the corpses and the lich couldn’t be seen. Soon plasma crackled through and ancient chants could be heard. Soon the flames lowered, yet all the bodies laid on the floor. Each seemed healed but the lifeless stillness remained. A glass ball with dancing white and red orbs hovered above him. 

“Their souls, which will return to them once outside this dungeon. The wards in here would take hours to dispel. Now head out through the red door. It’ll take you straight to safety. You can levitate then correct?” Nodding she began heading towards the door, concentrating to carry them with her. Their wagon outside would suffice to get them home. Suddenly his dark tone echoed through the room. “Come back in a month. And bring your sister with you.” A slight itch on the back of her hand got her attention. It was the draconic symbol for connection. Her sister had the same symbol on her hand. “Now, your lives are tied to each other so be smart.” 

Walking out, she knew coming back wasn’t a choice, it was bound into her soul. “What’s your name?” She yelled back. 

“I don’t know. ..” the door shut, and they were all next to their wagons again. The door was gone and so was the dungeon entrance.",20
1lcw0tu,my6yh8i,"Crystal zombies, - the undead golems you got after the actual golems decided they had enough of it and started practicing some shady magic, retreating to a a distant plain to cultivate- were being methodically disassembled by some very brazen adventurers.

Which would be just fine by him, if only they were not doing so right on top of his ceiling.

Sighing, the ancient lich that has seen the start and fall of civilization so many times he lost count, got up from his table where he was doing some cross-stitch following a convoluted pattern, and called the elevator.

It looked like he had spent way too much time going outside and familiarizing himself with the novel human forms of entertainment. That last moving picture he binged was certainly one too many. How come he had not noticed the intrusion?

Mumbling obscure words in long dead languages, he evacuated some of his current projects to a much lower level. A pity he never actually got down to learning about this CCTV stuff. He just updated the tracking spells about 70 years ago. Or was it a couple centuries? 

---

A popping sound that could only reliably designate the demise of a very large slime was not a good sign. 

As he was hastily assembling a couple of spare bones into a makeshift skeletal bodygard, the lich wondered what he had done wrong this time. He had tried filling a dungeon with intelligent creatures and fellow mages, creating a hierarchy. He gathered his students and asked them to protect the dungeon in return for some arcane knowledge. That didn't end well.

This time, he filled the dungeon with undead creatures. 55 levels bustling with slimes, skeletons, zombies of all sorts, golems made from all kinds of materials, reinforced traps, misleading labyrinths full of illusions, very aggressive plants. There was nothing worth stealing on any of the 55 levels. One had to be a madman to keep going when the only award for hard battles is some worthless bone dust.

And yet there they were, breaking down a fine oak door.

""There it is,"" a knight in shiny armor said. ""Check if there are any traps.""

""Shouldn't be any,"" a tall archer said. Why would a tall person become an archer? Wasn't it harder to hide when you're tall? ""It is the boss room, after all.""

""Ahem,"" the aforementioned boss said from behind his looming skeletal guard. Nice timing. ""You are trespassing.""

""It talks!"" - a lady covered in furs covered in runes exclaimed. ""None of the previous mobs talked!""

The room was positively becoming crowded. A healer rummaged through his table, and the lich almost hissed seeing his needles thrown on the floor.

He considered his mood. Was he in for a loud battle? No, not really. There would be all sorts of government repercussions, he would lose a ton of money and have to move to a different country. There would be the Wise Wizards On Guard shouting about conventions, regulations and broken promises, and his 112-th lawyer would freak out, just like his eleventh one.

He picked up a pile of papers from his table and cast a quick spell that made his voice loud and ominous.

""You are trespassing on a proud retiree's property. I have fought a certain Dark Lord twelve centuries ago, and for what? So a bunch of youngsters would come to demolish my house? I will have you know that my insurance company will bury you alive!""",21
1lcw0tu,mydjz98,"This was not how I wanted the day to start.  Standing in my robes, next to a now shattered aquarium where I had all my fishes.  The colorful and odd looking specimens flopping around.  The water poured out of the hole, the arrow sticking out of the wall on the other side.  I groaned in annoyance, bones creaking as I lifted my hand to lift the group of fish up with a levitation spell.  Good thing I had a spare tank.  ""Was that really necessary?""

I looked to the culprits as I gently placed the fish into their tank.  A group of heroes, as usual.  The elven ranger of the group being the main culprit, his bow still drawn.  The human paladin stepped forth, raising her holy symbol as she spoke.  ""In the name of my goddess, I will bring you down vile...!""  I waved her off, turning back to my fish.  ""Oh, shut up.  You break into my home and then call me evil?""  The paladin looked confused, looking to her symbol.  Normally, an undead creature would have recoiled.  It had even worked on other creatures whose power rivaled a lich's.

I started making some adjustments to the aquarium, fixing some of the salinity in there.  Suddenly, there was a loud sound of footsteps, steel rubbing against a sheath.  With a sigh, I quickly turn and cast another spell, freezing the over-eager half-orc fighter in his place.  ""Stop.""  The spell froze him in place, eyes still moving around in panic.  ""I'm in a good mood, at least till you broke my aquarium.  So I'll give you all a chance to explain.""  I gesture to the half-elf wizard and gnome bard who were both behind the paladin.  ""Preferably from one of those two.""  I took my seat in the chair nearby, leaning back as my bones creaked.

The wizard spoke up.  ""We came here because of the undead you were releasing.  They were attacking the nearby towns.""  I cocked my head.  ""I released?  Oh....oh, that would explain it.""  I turn to pick up a book on the table next to me, flipping through the pages.  ""Did this start happening a few months back?""  ""Yeah,"" the bard responded.  I scan down a page, tapping the entry I needed.  ""A small horde of zombies and skeletons?  Maybe a tall undead knight with a great-sword of cold iron?""  The bard tensed up.  ""So it was you!""

""Eh.  Kind of my fault.  But not on purpose.""  The party was now very confused.  I pointed to the wizard.  ""I'm going to assume you're the smart one of the group.  You know what an archlich is?""  The wizard nodded.  ""Powerful lich, above the standard.""  ""Do you know the OLDER meaning of the word.  This is going back to the 2nd era, before year 300.""  The wizard paused in thought.  That would put it at about 4000 years ago, and there was quite a lot of books burned during the middle of the 3rd era.

A moment later, she looked up, eyes wide open.  ""Wait!  There were tales of good undead that would party with heroes on quests!  Are you saying you're one of THOSE arch-liches?!""  The paladin looked to her companion, a look of shock and disbelief.  ""Good?!  But it's a thing of evil!""  ""I did this willingly to myself, and with a ritual that your goddess actually approves of.  Or at least did way back then when I checked.""  I wish I still had skin, because I would have loved to have given her a smirk as she looked back at me.

""Sorry about that group.  I had sent them out to do some recon and gather some more supplies.  Gather any bodies left on any battlefields.  They're usually obedient to my commands.""  The wizard stepped forward as she spoke.  ""There's a spell around one of the towns.  The first one they went to.  It's a precaution to keep people from being mind controlled due to a recent incident.  It extends out pretty far from the borders to the edges of the kingdom it's part of.  So I more than likely...""  I chimed in.  ""...it broke my control over them.  That would make sense.""

""So what's with the fish?"" the bard asked, moving over to check on the frozen fighter.  He was making some noises trying to talk, but just grunting.  ""Oh, I just like fish.  And I had found some new ones down here that I watched evolve over the years.  Took a couple just to liven the place up.""  I let out a dry cackle, making the group jump a little.  The wizard at least attempted a friendly laugh.
""Here's a deal.  I'm going to guess the town paid you quite a bit to get rid of me.  Or will when you come back.""  I tap a bell handing near my chair.  A moment later, a well dressed zombie butler shuffles out of a nearby door, carrying a large sack of coins.  The bard immediately perked up at the sound of coin, eyes flickering.

""I can pinpoint where the rest of the rouge undead went.  Should be easier now that I know my hold was broken.  You take care of them, and take the head of any of the big skeleton knights to the town saying it's mine.""  I stand and move to a nearby chest, flicking my wrist with a creak to release the fighter.  He gasps as he is released, leaning over to the wall to catch his breath.  Opening the chest, I dig around for a moment and then toss something to the wizard.  She catches it, fumbling it slightly.  A little silver and gold ornately made necklace.  ""Break that, and you can say that's my phylactery if they need more proof.  Either way, I ask you to keep me a secret.  In return, I'll make sure to send out smaller groups next time.  And away from that city.""

The party all look at each other, confused.  Well, except the bard.  The gnome had already taken the bag of gold, probably about half his weight.  He smiled towards me.  ""Deal!""  The paladin groaned heavily, rubbing her temple with one hand.  ""Good,"" I said, turning to cast a scrying spell.  ""Now, let me find them, you can get out of my home, and I can repair my fish tank.""",6
1ldi0dr,my9y9ge,"The mare with its silvery coat cantered unannounced up the causeway to the gate of Minlanleth. Built upon a rocky outcrop that had separated itself eons ago from the mainland, the Elven city was a symbol of wealth and prosperity. From the base of the outcrop, where dozens of holes had been expertly carved into the solid stone, sleek ships of trade and war sailed forth, each shining beautifully in the sun. They sailed to the four corners of the world, bringing back exotic goods from faraway lands. They sailed to make war upon the foes of the city, fearsome prows shaped like an eagle's beak.

Upon the back of the silvery mare was a rider, an Elf, who had dedicated his long lifespan to the collection, study, and preservation of knowledge. No tome was too archaic, no culture was too barbaric to fall beneath his notice, a sentiment not shared by many of his peers.

His arrival heralded the end of a journey of ten years and a day, travelling the breadth and width of the civilized realms. From the great steppes of the Atalam tribes, to the Kublani Empire in the west, from the castles of Charlmagnos, to the mountain fortresses of Sudlen, he had ridden back and forth, meticulously covering every village and city. The mare was draped with all manner of pouches, each bulging with a score of scrolls; all his notes from his solitary expedition.

His arrival was unexpected, but the many that recognised him followed from the gate to the palace. Their curiosity abounded, for though his departure was without fanfare, the reason was known to all. But the palace doors were shut behind him, and the curious were barred.

In the throne room, all the nobility of the city had gathered, along with all the other scholars. The High Prince, ever an imposing figure upon his raised throne, descended to embrace the returning Elf. He was fed and cared for, but before long, curiosity won out.

They all wished to hear what he had to say. For when he departed, he had sworn not to return until he had at last uncovered the truth behind the mystery. An Elven master of lore had centuries, millennia to craft his work, to hone his skills in the art of music or story or prose. Their works were beautiful, ecstatic, formed with the perfect words and verses. And yet...

And yet, it was mankind who dominated the world of song and story. For eons, Elven lore masters had returned with puzzling reports that their works received only lukewarm reception in village square and royal court, while music and tale of human bards could be found on opposite sides of the world. The puzzle had baffled the scholars as well, for the often cited explanation that mankind was primitive could not account. These human works of art had made their way to the other great races.

So it had been under this atmosphere that the lone scholar had been dispatched, and it was under this atmosphere that he was questioned eagerly.

With a resigned look on his face, he spoke to the gathering about his journey, from start to finish. Of how he found tales of courageous men among the Dwarf clans, poems of female beauty and strength among the Shadow Elves of the southern continent. He had even crept to the borders of the accursed Vermin Kingdom, and heard the loathsome sentries humming of mankind's songs.

As his tale drew to its close, he stood and presented his conclusion to the court. Perhaps mankind was indeed primitive, perhaps their works were popular only because they produced so many and so quickly, if imperfect. But, having exhaustively searched, he did not believe so.

Instead, there was something to mankind's short lives, their own mortality, that gave them a different perspective on the beauty of life. The works of the Elves were high and mighty, mourning and celebrating concepts that strayed far beyond the mind of the average being. But for the human works, there was a touch of emotion there that spoke to all, not just those who understood the ascended concepts.

""For mankind will always fall short of the impossible standard of the Elves. It is far beyond their capability, just as it is our lot to stand apart from the rest of the world's understanding. But the care they place in that which quickly fades, as only beings who also fade can do; the short but bright lives they live, that is what speaks to every soul.""",8
1ld739m,my6zmjd,"Beginner Tips for Hiveminds:

Be careful which humans you decide to infest; picking two humans with strongly conflicting morals or ideals will cause you to suffer a Psychic Splintering.

High profile targets can be tempting, but understand the risks. Most will not look fondly upon a gestalt created with unwilling participants. The more socially connected and well known a target, the higher the probability of receiving unwanted attention.

Play the long game, you will remain alive so long as you have a minimum number of surviving components. Better to grow slowly, rather than risk extermination after being discovered due to growing too rapidly.

Don't ignore non-sapient hosts, they are not as useful, but can provide a good contingency if your higher functioning elements are discovered. Neural diversity can be valuable in its own right.

Avoid infesting monks, nuns, and other ascetics. Their many hours of meditation can make them formidable at resisting your influence. Once absorbed, their moral compunction combined with their will mean that taking more involuntary hosts will be much more difficult.

Time is your ally when integrating new hosts. Slowly break down the vestiges of their previous personalities and remodel them to be a better fit for your collective.

Some disaffected individuals will willingly join your collective. This can be an excellent source of hosts when your will is not yet adequate to perform a hostile takeover.

Every fledgling hivemind dreams of global hegemony. There are many instances of global conquest, but understand that these success stories suffer from survivorship bias. You will not get there by taking massive risks. Learning how to hide your true nature is perhaps the most valuable skill you can acquire.",20

Someone you like."" I say.
""LIKE! NOT LOVE!  Elise, please."" he says.

""That you have a whole Merchant Association under a false name? And an external fiefdom under yet another fake name?
And that we can leave far away? Leave this all behind?"" I ask.

1lcxidd,my4vhbz,"“Speak now,” he said. Like I hadn’t dreamt of the day when those words would just flow freely from my mouth, instead of getting stuck in the crux of my throat. Like I hadn’t wished upon far away planets and mauled innocent flowers trying to foretell the fate of Aslan Hightower and myself.

“Speak now. Before it’s too late.” His eyes were wild. More wild than I’d seen them before, and his face was like a phantom in the moonlight spilling through the window. 

My eyes were red-rimmed and slumberous as I watched him furtively twist into the door.

If I had spoken that night when he had appeared in the staff quarters, one hand raking through his hair, the other fumbling with the hem of his tunic, asking me to run away with him on the eve of his wedding, I would have said yes.

Power was like a foreign beast then, whispers in the wind of faerie kings and queens. 

“I know you want this as much as I do.” He had moved closer, trying to grasp my hands with his own, but thinking better of it as a distant cot squeaked from a maid shifting in sleep. 

“Speak now.” The Priest intoned. I was motionless from the shadows in the throne room as I watched a boy fulfill his duty, read his vows and kiss his bride. My throat bobbed as the Prince’s gaze found my own. 

Wickedness is not intrinsic, even for those born in the imperial court. It is a slow malevolent evil that they breathe. They fill their lungs with its breath, and yearning for more, do not realize they are infected until it is too late. Until the day they find themselves in power, and yet utterly alone.

What the boy asking me to run hadn’t known  that day, was that the girl he asked was already infected. 

“Queen Elena.” Said the King. 

“Hm?” I cocked an eyebrow at my husband as the fete spun on in the ballroom around us. 

“What is it my dear? What troubles you?” 

As he spoke, my gaze found a vacuous expression in the crowd, the brother of the man at my side, beside a comely woman. I smiled warmly, not tearing my eyes from the man I used to know. “Not a thing.” I assured the King.

“Speak now,” he said. “Let them hear the voice of their new queen.”

The third prince lifted his glass in my direction from the ballroom as I rose from my throne and spoke.",16
1lcxidd,mya2leb,"I had just gotten to bed when someone called on the door, I grudgingly fell from my bed and slowly went to open it. What was my surprise when I saw Theodore the VII dressed in plain clothes, trembling and nervous like an abandoned puppy.

“What now Theo?” Normally I would be way more courtess, but it was extremely late, I was grumpy and I was close enough to the prince to know I wouldn’t get into trouble. “It's late, and unlike you I need to work. I have no time for whatever this is.”

I was going to straight up close the door to his face when he put his foot on the door. He looked at me in the eyes and I could see how troubled, nervous and scared he was and I knew this was serious. I opened back the door and looked around to make sure we were alone. “Come in before anyone sees us.”

I closed the door behind him as he entered, his hands on his neck, nervously scratching himself, like he would always do when he felt overwhelmed. 

“Are you ok, Theo?” I asked him while putting my hand on his shoulders. “Do you need to talk?”

Theodore took a deep breath, I could see him trying to get enough bravery for something but I didn’t figure out what until he blurted it out. “May Oakwood! I love you! Please! L-Let's run away together!”

We both kept quiet, looking at each other without moving a muscle and without telling a word. I could hear his heart beat rapidly and my own was going faster and faster too. Finally I managed to react, babbling about like an idiot.

“You… You can’t be serious…”

He took my hands and put himself on his knee. “I have never been more serious about anything else on my entire life. May, I have loved you for years, only now I dare to tell you.”

“S-Shut up.” I shaked my hand free, avoiding his eyes. I could feel myself getting flustered. “ Y-You are confused. You have doubts on your wedding because you don’t know the duquess well, and now you are mistaking your affection towards me as love.”

Theodore seemed to doubt for just a second, but then he came again, grabbing me by the shoulders. He was strong, that hurted a little.

“No… No! May I love you! I love your smile, and your eyes, and your sharp tongue, and how smart you are, and I love how you move like you were floating, and how you sing to yourself when you think nobody listens, and I love talking with you about nothing and everything for hours, and I love how cute you look when you stuff your mouth with leftovers thinking nobody will notice. I love your hair and your skin, and that rounded belly that you want to get rid off but can’t because you work so hard that you never have enough time to exercise, and I love how…”

“Shut up!” I put my hand on his mouth, my face was warm and red of embarrassment and anger. “Shut up! How dare you!? How dare you love me!? You… You selfish spoiled brat!”",5
1lcxidd,my5lmmb,"Parts of this is confusing to read because I can’t tell where we are in the timeline of the story. I’m guessing this is about a maid who switched places with the wrong princess with her spell, or the maid had married the older brother of the third prince?

Well written! I enjoyed reading it even though it was confusing.",7
1lcxidd,mya2n30,"Theodore went pale, I could felt him tremble and his grip weakened. His heart was still beating really hard, but I could sense how it skipped a heartbeat.

I took air, breathing hard as I felt my own heart beating faster and faster. “Did you even stop to think about what you are asking me!? No! No, you never do! Always the same! You are always like this! Tomorrow you get married! You just went ahead and dumped all those feelings on me! And now you expect me to, what!? Take all the things I can carry, leave everything behind and just go with you to who knows where!?”

Theodore let me go, looking as if he was about to cry. “May… I… I am sorry… I didn’t…”

“I am not done!” I took him by his shirt, my arms were trembling. “Have you stopped for a second to think what would happen!? The prince fleeing with his maid the day before their wedding. What do you think people would think!? Curses Theo! Who do you think they would blame!? The wicked seductress that seduced the prince! The foolish maid that thought she had a chance with the royal blood! Why would you do this to me!? Do you hate me!? Is that it!?”

He was about to cry, he was stumbling over his words.

“N… No… May, I… I’m sorry… I don’t… I…”

“Well! I do! I hate you!” I could feel my eyes getting wet. “I hate how you keep getting into trouble for following your heart instead of your brain! I hate how you keep treating me as a friend instead of a servant! I hate how you worry about me! I hate how you keep coming to me to take things off your chest! I hate how you look and smile at me when I am working! I hate your jokes, and your stories and how you make fun of nobles of the court! I hate how you keep disguising yourself and following me when I go to the city to buy produce! I hate how useless you are when you try to help me and make an even bigger mess! I hate you calling me by my name, and I hate your body, your face and your smile! And I hate all those things because they made it so I fell in love with you!”

Theodore got completely silent as I breathed heavily, a stream of warm tears flowing through my face. I tried to stop crying, but I couldn’t.

“It… It’s not fair… You can’t just make me feel like this for so many years, then get betrobed and force me to bury and hide all those feelings only to just force them all out again…” I started drying the tears of my eyes, but they kept flowing. “I hate you… Now get out… I can’t run away wearing a nightgown.”

He looked at me surprised, he didn’t seem sure how to react to my outburst.

“Then… This means that you are coming?”

I grunted, cleaning the tears and snot from my face with my gown’s sleeve.

“Of course I’m coming, you spoiled brat… You better take good care of me, I am not going to forgive you twice.”",7

""You have been living like this for the last 200 years."", The older immortal says. He looks bored and tired. Tired of existing, tired of being on this earth. Along his body i can see many scars. Gunshot wounds on his arms and legs, rope burns on his neck.

""Better spend my time living than trying to kill myself."", I retort as i take another sip of my ""Cocktail"", and then look around. There is a nice crowd on the bar today. Girls i never met but look and smell like trouble, angry looking men itching for a fight.

""We have been given the same gift. You squandered yours by hating yourself, and getting stuck on stupid mortal bullshit like making money, raising families just to watch them die, and being overall a boring piece of shit. I choose to live. Its not my fault at all that you were given the blessing of being allowed infinite mistakes, unlimited adrenaline and emotion, but still choose to be... Human."" I smile as i lift myself from the bar, drinking a triple whisky in a single gulp.

1lcqacm,my3mjkc,"The military was gone, police and state patrol, all replaced with a swirling black tattered wall of sand that had  formed a wall around me as soon as the soldiers, guns pointed at me, began shouting at me.

""DOWN! Down on the ground! DOWN Now!!""

Behind the soldiers, had been the scientists. In a tide of white coat wearing uniformed mass, head to toe covered in safety equipment right from the most terrifying biohorror movie, they came shouting words of their own, pulling at the advancing and armed law enforcement units behind the military advancing on me.

""NO! You must capture it ALIVE!!"", ""Don't Harm IT!!"", and ""It too important to loss!"" punctuated by the simple ""No!"" and ""Stop!!"" from many of them.

I recognized the logo from the DNA lab I had sent the sample to.

But now...gone?

""Mom? Dad?"" I blink at them, my head twitching back and forth between them and the sand wall blowing *upward* around us? Upward?

""Son...son..."" my Dad was saying, lifting his hands up in front of him, opened toward me. ""Take a breath, OK? Over here OK?""

Mom was doing something similar, ""Karl, its OK. Karl."" Her voice was much softer, ""Maybe you should look at me, honey.""

I would remember moving backward, unthinking and blank. Nothing but confusion boiling in my head and the thumping of my heart in my chest and ears.

My sight was dimming but I remember what I saw and heard right before I fell into darkness. I remember it clearly as I remember the words my mother had said as I blacked out.

""Bes, PLEASE...No!!"" she pleaded looking up at something.

Now I know she was looking at the seething, black *thing* that appeared to be a wall of moving sand, black and glittering around me. Like the robe of some evil wizard spinning a dark spell on the heroes or a boneless, black school of millions of jellyfish spiraling in on dinner.

From in the darkness, from the thing Mom had called Bes, I felt the predator smile on me and those red eyes open to look at me...white cataracted pupils twitch as they focused on me.

1lcqacm,my6u8p3,"I rounded the last corner and waved to our neighbor, who was mowing his lawn.  The house was open again, so I went in by the front door.  

The second the screen door slammed behind me, my mother yelled from the kitchen, ""Did you grab the mail?""  How does she always know?  

I went back out and found the mailbox pretty full, mostly magazines, but there was quite a bit of envelopes, too.  I jogged back and went in.

Now mom was standing in the hall.  She had her hands on her hips and gave me one of her microscope looks and asked, ""Are you feeling okay?"" I wasn't. How did she know that?

""Actually, I am a little tired. Can I take a nap? I asked while holding out the mail to her. She said yes until dinner was ready and turned back to the kitchen, and I started up the stairs.

I heard, ""Wait! There's something here for you.""  I stopped, and she reached back and slid it between my fingers without looking.  I shook my head and went upstairs.  Does she have eyes on the back of her head?

I threw my bag on the floor, shut my door, and plopped on the bed.  I still had the envelope, and I was staring at it, wondering how many times I ever received mail.  Never was the correct answer.  But, I noticed it was a plain white envelope with no return address. I shrugged and opened it.

""Oh yeah,"" I said to no one.  It was a letter from the ancestry test center.  I sent in a sample, but I wasn't expecting a letter from them.  I got the test as a present for Christmas.  I  had been expecting to receive a pin number by email so I could log in to my 'results'.

The paper was also very plain.  There was a message at the top, 'Your DNA test has been processed' and also 2 brief paragraphs below.  The first was:  

This has never happened before.  We have completed over 43 million tests in the USA and over 300 million worldwide.  But, your result is inconclusive and highly unusual.  We are unable to create a profile for you. We can tell you that you have 50% human DNA and 50% unknown DNA.

50%?  I was on my feet. ""MOM?!?""  I was on the verge of hysterical.  ""Mom!!!"" I was down the stairs and frantically walking toward the kitchen.  ""Mom?""  My dad was at the table, and my mom was at the sink.  ""Did you know I took a DNA test?""  My parents glanced at each other.

""Yes honey, we know,"" said my mom while my dad stared at his watch.  

""It came back 50%, and I am freaking out.""  I sat down and stared at my Dad.  He was still looking at his watch. ""What am I supposed to think, who am I? What is going on?""  

""Honey, nothing is going on. You are you.  Everything is fine.""  My mom was sitting across from me now, and she was holding one hand, and her other hand was on my arm, ""It's going to be OK, sweetie, don't worry.""

She was so calm.  ""DONT WORRY?!?""  I was hysterical.  ""Mom!  They notified the government.  They are on the way here.  NOW, right now!!""  My parents looked at each other again.  My mom was up and out the door.  My dad told me to get ready to go. 

I turned to go back to my room, and then I turned back to my dad. ""How could you not tell me my mom is a human?""",20

You did. Everything was copacetic, which makes these results all the more concerning. ""According to this, we have... *DN****B****?""

Your father holds out a hand. ""Let me see those results,"" he says gruffly.

You pass him the results, as well as the *So You Have DNB* brochure the company sent. For several seconds, he reads quietly. The color drains from his face--which, apparently, can be a symptom of DNB.

""So what do we do now?"" your mother asks.

Your father tosses the results and brochure onto the chaise lounge. ""I'll tell you what we do. We call our lawyer. We sue this company for everything they're worth.""

""What even *is* DNB?"" your mother asks--a question which, to be fair, gets addressed through a series of cartoons in the brochure. ""Is it dangerous?""

Your father gazes, stymied, at the teal and gold bumper sticker of a heart--another token from the company, emblazoned with the words *DNB STRONG.*

""What do we do now, Broderick?"" Your mother takes you by the shoulders, steadying her voice. ""There must be some sort of treatment. Is there a medication we can take? What do we *do?""*

""12 years, 12 long years I spent looking after her as she slowly faded. I watched day by day and month by month as the light drained from her eyes. We tried to say it wasn't inevitable, but with each passing day it became more clear. Now she's gone, and you're telling me that our last hope is futile?"" I ask.

""My good friend - I remember when you asked me the first time to revive her after she died in that hunting accident just after you were married. I gave you time with her, but there is no way to extend it any further. You knew that,"" the Necromancer says.

I turn my head, a tear washing down my eye as the reality of the situation dawns. In my heart I had known it would come to this. I knew I had only bought time, but I had refused to accept it. We had spent those years well, taking care of each other and making the most of each day. But I had been forced to watch as the Necromancer's power slowly seeped out from her veins, as she grew more tired day after day, until she was not able to get up. Until finally one morning I awoke to find her lying there, her blue eyes completely faded and her body unmoving.

As I wash away the solitary tear winding its way down my face, I manage to look at her one last time. My beautiful lady. I had given everything to gain those few good years together. I steel myself and turn back to the Necromancer, ""You can have me now, take what you are owed.""

1ld55wh,my5vld7,"It's a slow day at the office. I've been playing solitaire for the past 30 minutes. I told my boss a 2 hour task would take 4 hours, so now I have some time to go for a new high score. 

I almost get it! Record time, too. But just as I'm about to place the last king, something bursts through the window and stops in front of my desk. It's Captain Capital. Nobody has seen him since his flight with Planet Breaker. People say he's lost it since he had to put that guy down. I just figured the dude was on vacation. 

""Hey Cap,"" I start, ""what can I do for ya?""

He stares me down. ""I know what you're doing.""

Who would've thought everyone's hero would be cracking down on workplace efficiency. I guess if he's finally getting back to hero work he should start small. 

""I hear ya, Cap,"" I respond, ""I'm closing the solitaire window now."" I was distracted, I definitely lost my best time. Every eye in the office is on us and I'm just trying to deescalate before everyone's favorite hero gets me fired. 

In one quick swipe of his arm, he knocks my computer monitor off of my desk. The cords snap loose and the computer flies out the hole in the window and crashes through the building across the street. Some of my coworkers run, others watch more closely but everything around us stops. We have their full attention. 

""Don't play dumb with me planet breaker."" He begins, ""you're going to tell me how to get this blood out of my glove."" 

Yeah, this guy has completely lost it. I look at his glove and it's the usual shade of Blue, maybe the color is a little faded from excessive washing. 

""Cap, I think you might be a little confused. Have you tried the hero hotline?"" 

He doesn't seem deterred. He reaches towards my collar. I don't bother running because there would be no point in trying to stop Captain Capital. He lifts me by the shirt as my feet dangle in the air. In a blink I'm pinned to the wall that was about 40 feet away from my desk.

""Don't you dare let off a plasma blast in here"" he threatens, ""or it's gonna be worse than last time.""

That slam to the wall knocked the wind (and a little bit more) out of me. I've never had a cracked rib before but, with the pain I'm feeling, I've gotta assume I've got several. 

""Get this blood off of my glove NOW, or you're going to have more to help me clean off."" He tells me through gritted teeth.

""Have you tried oxi clean?"" I reply. He doesn't seem amused. 

""Put the man down!"" I hear from around the elevator. It's Tank of the Capital Protectors. 

Captain Capital starts murmuring to himself, ""no, not Tank. He can't see me with this blood on my glove.""

Captain Capital drops me and I land on my butt, with a lot more cushion than I would like. The Captain leaves with a sonic boom out the same window he entered. 

Tank leaves too, probably to track him down. This is the worst day of my life. I'd ask for a raise, but it doesn't matter. There's no way I'm keeping this job. I'm moving far away from Capital City.",29

How many different ways could we frame our theories around religious fanaticism? Whatever was motivating this guy, it was clearly the product of his own special brand of psychosis. It was important to get into the mind of a killer in order to find them. How we're supposed to do that for a guy this bizarre is beyond me.

""Let's review the facts,"" Police Chief Armando Galveston began as he always did. ""Our killer is a male, white,  approximated to be in his mid-thirties to mid-forties, and, everyone's favorite, appears to covered in tattoos of crosses. Alright people, what else do we know?""

A hand shot up in the back of the room and the ever-eager voice of one our newer recruits, Sandra Oxford, rang out, ""Our killer ritualistically removes the hearts of all of his victims. The hearts, however, are never found at the scene and we have yet to successfully recover one. All wounds inflicted are done with blades, never bullets or blunt instruments. There are typically minimal signs of struggle. Additionally, it appears the killer prefers to commit his crimes in the early morning hours.""

""Excellent, thank you Oxford,"" Chief Galveston nodded in approval. I didn't have to turn around to know Oxford was beaming over the praise.

""Alright, people,"" Chief continued. ""As you know, at approximately 7:35am yesterday we received an anonymous call about the location of a potential victim. The body was recovered in the bedroom of an apartment off of 32nd and Stern. Same methods as always, nothing new there.""

""What do we know about the victim?"" Another voice asked from the front of the room this time.

""Woman, hispanic, approximately 25 years of age. That's all we've got so far, doesn't appear to have any connections in the area, no ID, nothing.""

I can concede here and admit that this part was exceptionally interesting. If there was one thing a serial killer liked, it tended to be a degree of consistency. Hot blonde co-eds, gay guys with no family in the area, black kids,  older married women, or whatever else. Usually the victims had some sort of cohesion around the basics of their victims' identities. This guy though, he was all over the place. Race didn't matter, age didn't matter, gender didn't matter, being well connected in the area or not didn't seem to matter either.

The briefing continued and I turned my thoughts towards my beat for the day. Usually, I was riding shotgun with my partner of the last year at the wheel as we cruised through various neighborhoods and awaited calls. Today, however, I was moonlighting as a beat cop. Most of the force found it insulting to be assigned to a beat when they'd already done their time. As for me, I was known to volunteer when an extra set of boots was needed on the ground. I enjoyed getting to be in the neighborhood getting fresh air and handing out stickers to little kids peeking out from behind their parents' legs.

""That's all we've got today people,"" Chief's voice cut through my thoughts and brought me back into the briefing room. ""Get to work. Keep your eyes and ear peeled, citizens are going to be uneasy now that the news of a 23rd victim has broken.""",18
1lcvxg2,my3m6ta,"I can't believe it.
I have been on a task force trying to find a horrible serial killer, we named : Cross-Man.
19 victims as of now, at least to our knowledge, all with their hearts removed.
A mother and a child that were praying for the the father's health in a church saw him.
A hulk of a man, with tattoo crosses all over his body, hence the name.
Today I found a lead.


All the victims seemingly struggled, and we found blood under their fingernails, but...
Their own blood was not right, so I digged deeper into their past.
No medical history, no issues, not even a flu shot, but!
They all visited blood banks! 
And they all were seemingly rich or extremely average.
At first I couldn't believe my conjucture, but it was quite logical.
The victims were vampires.
This made the Cross-Man a Vampire Hunter.


So I visited blood banks, older houses, and alleys where it is easy to strike.
For weeks I had nothing.
But then, two drunk young women were giggling, and making a scene in a small alley.
And I saw him.
A lean man sneaking up on them...walking on the wall!
I looked around for the Cross-Man, but I saw nothing.
The vampire was almost on the 2 women, I couldn't wait more.
So I shoot!
The vampire easily dodged it, and disappeared.
I looked around, and then down fell something.
The vampire, straddled by a humongous man wielding a scalpel?


I watch him kill the man,and take out his heart with calculated moves.
""Police! Freeze!"" I finally say.
""Bullets can't kill these bloodsuckers.
Only silver, and beheading or removing the heart works permamently.
Otherwise they revive."" he says calmly, standing up.
""You are under arrest!"" I say, as he...eats the vampire's heart, and the crosses on him light up.
""Now it is certain that he is dead, and his thralls are slowly becoming free.
I respect you guys, but my war is above your paygrade."" he says.
Before I could react he disappears.
I collapse to my knees.
""What was that?"" I mutter, as I check my bodycam.
It is on...at least...at least I got something out of this.
Dammit!
I will request leave from the taskforce.
I am too old for this shit.",30
1lcvxg2,my5n948,"I was four hours into my day when I saw the flash of crosses embossed upon pale skin. The day had been a blissful breeze up until then. The sun was shining down but the breeze kept me from sweating under the fabric of my uniform. The people on the streets were cheery and, to my elation, nobody was doing anything they shouldn't be doing. I'd even had time to pop down at the park for a round of chess my the oldies who were there day in and day out. 

Needless to say, I was entirely optimistic that my easy and ever so pleasant day wasn't going to change while in line for a cup of coffee at my favorite spot, The Bean Bag. The line was moving slow, but I didn't mind. My eyes were casually scanning the room, more to people watch than police, when I saw him. A white male, no older than thirty, covered head to toe in black clothing that didn't quite make sense on a day as lovely as this one. It was only when he reached for a lid to put over his coffee cup that his sleeve slipped back enough for me to notice the tattoos. My pulse picked up as adrenaline surged through me. The crackle of the dispatcher's voice started to come through my radio and I quickly turned it all the way down so as to not alert him to the close proximity of a cop. As soon as the lid was on, he turned to walk out the door. I immediately noticed the bags under his eyes, far more pronounced than I'd expect someone his age to have.

*Okay, Owens, don't fuck this up. Calm, casual, keep your distance but also keep your eyes on him. You know how to do this.*

I slipped out of the coffee line without ordered approximately five seconds after the door swung closed behind my guy. He was turning left and down 18th, away from the more bustling streets full of storefronts and towards the residential part of the neighborhood. I followed him down 18th for seven blocks. Nothing about him stood out as he walked, just a guy with his cup of coffee as casual as can be. No nervous ticks, no looking around, and certainly no noticing the cop on his tail. 

Finally, we approached an apartment complex and he turned into the courtyard. Lucky for me, it was ungated. If we had stopped a few blocks back, that certainly wouldn't have been the case. I took a deep breath, admittedly a bit nervous but also eager. To be the guy that found the residence of our killer who we had gotten almost nothing on? Of course I wanted that. Everybody can relate to wanting to be the hero. 

And so, knowing full well I should have called it in by now but far too fixated on not losing the guy now, I entered the courtyard. The suspect was walking up a flight of stairs towards the third and top floor. From my ground level vantage point, I watched him enter an enclosed corridor that seemed to lead towards a series of apartments in the back of the complex. Quickly and quietly, I made my way up to the top floor in pursuit. 

*Deep breath. You'll get an apartment number, you'll go downstairs to call it in, and you'll wait for the big moment.*

I felt my nerves pick up again as I made my way down the third floor corridor. At the end of it, there appeared to be another open aired and bright walk way. I was hopeful I'd see a door clicking closed behind him so I could get an official address, that I wasn't too late in my timing. It was as I stepped out of the corridor that I all but collided into the very last person I wanted to have notice me.",15
1lcvxg2,my5q778,"""It's both rude and a bit creepy to follow someone for that long, you know.""

The blood rushed out of my face so fast I'm surprised it didn't fall out of me and pool around my feet. I'd fucked up. So badly. Far be it from me to claim I'm some all star of the force, but this is rookie bullshit worse than a d-list casted movie could come up with.

*You should've called it in. You should've called it in. Oh my god, why the fuck didn't you call it in.*

I must've been staring in dumb shock longer than I'd thought. He tilted his head and eyed me up and down as he continued speaking.

""Owens,"" his voice was soft and a higher pitch for a man. Up close, he a solid two inches shorter than me who, admittedly, is not a terribly tall man. His dark brown hair was cut in a haphazard shoulder length shag. Definitely not done in a shop, but also not terrible for a homemade cut.

""Can I ask why you've been following me?""

The casualness of it all unsettled me. Nothing about him was sinister. In fact, he possessed the sincere air of someone you would immediately slip past small talk and into deep conversation with if he sat next to you at a bar.

""It's my duty to investigate any suspicious activity I observe,"" my voice is not as authoritative as I'd hoped it would be. I could at least be thankful that it did not quaver as I spoke.

""I see,"" he narrowed his eyes at me and took a sip from his coffee cup. ""And what probably cause have you established?""

There was no use lying. I had already made a fucking mess of the situation, might as well charge forth like the bullheaded fool I've established myself to be.

""You match the description of an at large suspect,"" I straightened my back as I spoke and placed my hands on my utility belt. If ever there was a time to be imposing, it was now.

""Thought so,"" he laughed and the spark of it reached his eyes. Needless to say, that caught me off guard. Why was he so boy-like and blase? ""Alright, fair enough. Can I just ask to show you something before you bring in the whole gang to deal with me? I think you'll find it interesting.""

Did I mention I was confused? What the hell was this guy's deal? And, how am I both terrified but at ease at the same time? He turned and inserted a key he pulled from his pocket into the first door on the right. As he opened it, he looked towards me with a beckoning gaze.

""Oh, come on,"" he laughed. ""I don't bite.""

Against all of the advice of every bit of training I'd ever had, I followed him through the door.",20
1lcz65a,my4nmna,"From the bluff overlooking Valley Village Brad Hercule was shaken by the red jagged scars raking their way across the landscape, marring what would have been an idyllic setting.

Above him in the sky were a few small soft white clouds against a mostly blue sky and the sun was well into its descent, dusk on the way.  

Behind him were his camera man Jeb and the group of preteens that had banded together to stop what everyone in the town had called “The Incursion”.

A small town of a few thousand people calling something “The Incursion” was enough to send the reporters alarm bells ringing. On the streets of the town the wounds in the ground could be written off an “odd localized tectonic shift” like the government claimed. 

But not from this view.  It looked like claw marks.

And then there were the bodies. The gelatinous corpses that were colored like an oil slick on water with odd numbered legs, always an odd number of legs, that bent in five different places.  The main bodies of the creatures being kept in the basement of the town church were the size of a cat but their legs stretched out more than six feet in length and with the demonstration that the priest gave, were stronger than steel.

In the last ten hours Brad had seen and heard a lot of crazy things, the craziest being that it was these five kids that had stopped “The Incursion” by the aliens. Or was it cosmic beings? Or maybe they were cosmic aliens. Sci-fi stuff wasn’t Brad’s forte; he wasn’t sure what to call the creatures that had attacked this village.

Looking to Jeb, he gave the camera man the signal to begin recording.

“So, Jo, what were those creatures in the church basement?”

The girl with the short dark hair and bright green eyes reached out to her friends on either side of her and gripped their hands before looking down the barrel of the camera.

“The things in the basement are the uh, forerunners. They came first. They went all over town and they put everyone to sleep. They gave everyone the bad dreams.”

“The forerunners? They came first? What came after?”

The boy to her left with the mess blonde mop spoke, “It called itself ‘Vista’. It said it came from a place that we couldn’t co-compre- a place we wouldn’t get, a place we wouldn’t understand.”

“He understood it when we kicked his as- I mean, butt.” Were her complexion any lighter, Brad knew that the girl with the baseball cap and braces would have been visibly blushing.

“Carmen, how did you kick his butt?” Brad asked. The kids hadn’t talked about the creatures much and he didn’t want to let this opportunity be missed.

“The glob-cats, um, I mean forerunners didn’t put us to sleep. We were hanging out in the tree house and when it came for us we stood together an-“

Markus, the blind kid hadn’t talked yet but he cut in, “I seen it. I’d never seen anything before so I didn’t know that I was seeing something. I-I started to freak and everyone crowded around to check on me. When the glob-cat climbed in the window, we were all together and when it touched Shelly i-“

The girl Shelly jumped in, “It touched me and I had a bad dream. I went to where it was from. I saw all of it. I felt like I was gone for a week. When I came back no time had passed at all and the glob-cat’d fallen from the tree.”

There was a pause and the kids all looked from one to the other and everyone’s eyes settled on the girl in the middle, Jo.

“She told us what she saw. We knew we were up against somethin’ real bad. Shelly told us where they were from. What they wanted.” 

Brad felt himself leaning forward, “And what did they want? How did you stop them?”",15
1lcz65a,my8b0gi,"The kids were battered and bruised. The eldest's arm was in a sling and one was staring dead eyed above the crowd.

I think that is what sells it the most. Not the dead monsters or ruins of the town, but those eyes. No child who grew up in a normal city should have eyes that. I saw those eyes in the faces of soldiers, of survivors of warzones. You can't fake those eyes.

Or the hurt and pain that had been in their voices when they'd derailed the interview to demand answers of their own. And now there were so many questions. Because this invasion shouldn't have happened.

Four girls were kidnapped, and when GPS data had shown to of the girls phones at the Chief of Police's house, no one went to investigate. The Chief claimed he was keeping evidence it the safest place he could, his home safe.  When they'd finally looked into it, 9 days and 30 missing later, it was discovered that the phones had been in his house since the day the girls went missing.

Then there was the nasty little 'meth' epidemic that should have had the FBI called in, but not a call was made until the attack on the Linden house.

I still see the youngest kids face. he was 12, and he'd been covered in yellowing bruises. He gone after the Mayor, tiny hands punching, screaming why? Why hadn't he listened? He was promised he'd call someone and he didn't and now-

634 dead. Over 3000 injured. Hundreds of dr5ones missing, having fled into the forest. The queen was dead, but the drones were still a threat. Many biologists were afraid of spontaneous queen production. Or the possibility of hidden eggs.

All because the mayor had broken the promise to call someone in to see what the weird goop the kids had found was.",9
1ld38s8,my5d7ac,"Power is relative. We all have power, for better or for worse, in aspects of our lives. Some of us exercise that power with restraint, others with abandon. Some of us hold sway over thousands or millions of souls, others over tiny fiefdoms more miniscule than our own minds. Regardless of what power one has, that power is relative.

Power is not inherently corrupting. It simply is.

However, power is irresistibly attractive to the corrupt. Those who would constantly seek to exploit others for personal gain NEED power to perform this act. Then, having attained some station that grants this power, they see an easier way. A higher, more expansive power. That power becomes their new goal, and in this the cycle perpetuates.

Of course... power is also necessary for those who would change the world for the better. For every corrupt politician or scheming billionaire, there is also a philanthropist who would exercise the same power to different, far more benevolent ends.

Why, then, is the perception that power corrupts? Because those who would be restrained by genuine morality ARE restrained. They exercise power judiciously, carefully, and with regard to those who would be harmed by their actions. Those who would abuse power will do so in its pursuit.

Of course, everything I'm describing is subjective. To one person, the exercise of power constitutes abuse and corruption. To another, it is good and considerate and just. At risk of attempting to justify evil, I'll point out a singular example:

In order to provide medical care for a town, a new highway must be built linking the town to a medical center nearby, and providing ambulances with easy access. But in doing so, the town exercises the power of eminent domain, and seizes land from a farmer. If you ask the townsperson whose life was saved by that ambulance access, then asked the farmer whose land was paved over... you would likely get two different answers when it comes to the corruption vs. purity of those who made the decision.

Still... the selfish exercise of power (the right to say ""no"" being my favorite example) can be considered good and just by every decent human being in existence. Is seeking the power to protect yourself from others selfish? Of course it is. It is a pursuit for yourself only. Is it wrong? Of course not.

The exercise of power tells you a great deal about someone's character, if you watch closely. Some people seek it selfishly, some selflessly. Neither is inherently right nor wrong. All you can do is, within the moral framework you know, judge the behavior of someone exercising power and decide for yourself.",8
1ld38s8,my5jjxv,"Power doesn't corrupt, that's just a mantra spoken by those who fear being corrupted themselves.

What corrupts is the *want* for power, the desire to *wield* power, to *show off* how much power you have.

Politicians, military officers, teachers, everyone in power has rules they must follow, lest they risk having their power taken away.

And when the corrupted gets power, you'll know who they are soon enough, as they begin overtly and covertly extending their powers, testing their limits, seeing how much they can get away with, what their lessers will simply let them do with impunity...

And when that happens, it becomes a question of time before the reign of terror ends with the death of the monster, whether by an individual applying the power they have out of anger or desperation, or the will of the people, or natural causes.

It's happened before, it will happen again. Just ask Maximilien Robespierre... as *one* historic example.

It's not power that corrupts, it's the want for it, and the desire to display it.",5

Cindy and Tom The news anchors are talking about the big story. 
Why are all of the members of “ Federal League “ , always scratching their crotches, when seen in public? Is this a new crime fighting signal? Maybe it is super hero code? Sources on the street say it is a weird new sex thing between super heroes. Other sources describe the scratching as side effects of contagious diseases, such as an STD. Spread by wild super hero orgies. 

Hahahahaha, I can not stop laughing. 

I get up and walk to the fridge for another bottle water. 

It is , Itching powder . That is right. 

When I weaved the garments on my special loom . I wore hazmat suits and coated the loom in itchy powder while making the crotch sections. So in every hero’s suit is custom crotch is an itchy section made just for them. 
They bring their suits to my shop for dry cleaning. 

How can a super hero stay morally good, while scratching and digging at their crotch every 5 minutes. People will begin to talk. 
Now the news is talking. Rumors are spreading.

1lcx3jt,my3y006,"Gregs POV:  
I was lying in my bed, looking up at the ceiling and trying to fall asleep. I say trying here because there was a Lab doing its very best to wake me and everyone in my neighborhood. And of course, this was not the first night this week; he had done this for the past three days. Throughout the night, my dog was barking.   
At first, I thought he was in pain or was sick. One trip to the vet and 300$ later, it turns out he was in perfect health.  
Maybe today I could get him to relax. I slowly got up and out of bed, and my dog immediately noticed as he was lying not 5 feet away from me at the bottom of my bed. Tonight I'm going to try to tire him out with a bit of exercise. First, I get a leash, my keys, and grab a water.  
Now here comes the problem, despite me putting the leash on him and him still screaming his woes into the night, he will not leave the house. No matter how hard I pull on his leash or try to condule him outside, he just won't move.   
With a heavy sigh and knowing I will hear about this tomorrow from either Karen or Karen's proxy, the HOA I go back to bed.  
TOMS POV:  
I stare at the street incredulously with my mouth wide open. Spectors. To put it simply, there were a lot of spectors. Throughout the entire street, spectors wondered and bumped into each other. I saw them slowly enter and creep into the house. They can barely move if there is a contagious person nearby, and they tend to avoid those areas, but all people eventually have to sleep, and like the slow, inevitable crawl of death, these uninitiated people wouldn't even know to be scared when they feel that chill on their back. Animals would, and they have surprisingly effective ways of keeping them away. A way which was being demonstrated as I could hear A dog screaming its head off trying to ward off the spectors from its home. Luckily for that hound, I would be coming to clean up these spectors soon. Unluckly for the rest of the neighborhood, it has likely been too long.

That was the year I got caught, not the years I did it.  Years.  I stopped mid 2050 after a close call.  One of the girls almost got away and I realized I wasn't good enough anymore, but I did my part.  I followed the teaching of the church, and even when they locked me away I looked out into the court and saw all the women with their hair covered and knew I'd won.

I got a life sentence per kill, but they only found 28 bodies.  

The most problematic one, from perspective, was the CEO's kid.  She hadn't gone quietly and I had to do my work slowly.  Very slowly.  When the police found her body, they knew and when her father saw her he made it his life mission to ruin mine.  

It got much harder after that.  She was my 30th, and I'd been averaging a girl a month.  My criteria was simple, if your hair was exposed, you were a target.  Just like GOD said.  I only managed a few more after that, but by then most girls were covering their hair and the ones that weren't traveling alone.

I picked a state with no death penalty, a move I thought was genius at the time.  I hate it now.  My life sentence only last 8 years.  I was shanked by the brother of a friend of a girl.  I understood why, of course.  I did things.  I closed my eyes and died knowing that GOD would be waiting for me.

I woke up 2 days later on a table in the CEO's hospital.  They had a machine that would bring you back to life, and I was the test subject.  I was reborn as 25 year old perfect version of myself.  My trick knee was fixed, so was my asthma.  The doctor said I'd live to a ripe old age of 90.  I had 27 life sentences to go, I was a patient man, then.

One issue was that I was a very devout man, so offing myself was never on the table.  And the CEO?  Richest man in the world, and he made sure no one ever talked to me.  Ever.  Every day was solitary.  When I was 92, I died again.  Sixty Eight years, and each time I was required to die of natural causes with no chance of parole.  It was 2108 and everyone I knew on the outside was dead.  Even my priest stopped writing, as did his son.  

The next four were a blur.  Life extending technology allowed me to survive longer each time, and once a lawyer came to my defense.  The said that the laws had changed, and that she could get out on a technicality.  But she didn't have her hair covered, and I sent her away.

By now the USA was the North American Union.  AI ruled the world, and crimes were less common so I was one of the few prisoners.  No one in jail got the life extending treatment, and of course mine was written into my sentence.  

Twenty two more times I died of blissful old age.  I didn't even need my bible anymore, I could recite the book backward and forward.  It was still false gospel, but it was all I had.  I was alone now, the last person in an AI jail where no one even remember my name, including me.  I was inmate, the only one.  

Eventually the AI got bored and shoved me into a solitary cell.  For most people that would have brought about insanity after a point.  I was so far beyond insane by now that it didn't matter.  

One more death and I would be released from this torment, free to finally go out and the sky but then they gave me a new drug before they locked me in here.  A rare one.  It was the year 8,923, and I'm still on my last life and not even suicide can put me down now.  

I don't even remember why I'm here.",6

That's when I noticed their son standing behind them.  He doesn't look scared and his eyes seem to burn into my soul.  I get a flash of premonition, something like the universe has lined up in just the right way and given me a glimpse of what could happen. I see my future, and that of many more play out in my mind in a single heartbeat.  I'm astounded at the magnitude of the images and ashamed of what I've become.

Without realizing it, I've lowered my firearm, pointing it at the ground.  The parents freeze when I speak, my voice low but clear.  ""I've made a mistake.  Just go on with your night, with your son,"" I say, gesturing to the boy.  ""Keep your things.  I'll find another way to get by, something honest.  Sorry to have troubled you.""

Take the money from my wallet to get you started on a better path.""  My eyes search his face, looking for a trick, trying not to hope, but his sincerity feels genuine.  I take the cash and nod. I give my apology again and walk off, hearing the father speaking to his son about giving people a chance to do the right thing.

I'm about half a block away when I hear the gunshot.  My heart sinks and I turn back towards the direction I had come from, breaking into a cold sweat as I begin sprinting.  I hear the wail of a young boy, the deep anguish that rips at my soul.  As I turn the corner that leads into the alley, I see the family I had left, shattered by nameless greed.  My eyes harden as I see a disreputable shadow fleeing from the scene and every fiber in my body screams at me to give chase, to bring justice to this horrible event, but I find my feet rooted to the spot, unable to move.

1ld16bq,my4wxby,"The sterile blue of the room forces its way into closed eyes, as I slowly come to. Almost on instinct, I place a finger in between my eyes, feeling for... for...

*WHAT AM I FEELING FOR? WHAT AM I PRODDING AT? WHAT AM I-*

I pause at the sound of my own hyperventilation. *SENSORY OVERLOAD.* I feel too much. I can taste the cold, lifeless iron of the bench I lay on; hear the pitiless mechanical glow of the light; smell the sanitized stench of my chambers; and feel... feel...

*FEELING AROUND FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST.*

*POKING AROUND WHERE I NEEDN'T.*

I feel my head contort. The cold envelops me in its warmth... what?

*THIS IS WRONG. ALL OF THIS IS WRONG.*

I feel a small spasm in my neck as I double over. My ears feel like bursting with the whine of my breathing getting faster and louder.

The singing burn on my forehead. *IT'S JUST SWEAT.*

The dirty taste of my own blood and bile, lodged in my throat. *IT'S JUST PLAQUE.*

The searing pain of the *BULLET DRILLING THROUGH MY HEAD INCH BY INCH-*

""-listening to me? Look at me."" I feel a hand on my head, gently craning it upwards. I see a figure, so dark it's like the light curves around it. Seemingly wide enough to envelop me in all directions, but so spindly I can... see through it. ""You know what happened."" Its pallid white eyes gaze into me. I look away... but it matches my gaze anyway.

A bony, pallid finger taps me on the forehead. Where I... where I was... *fine?*

""I was shot. Right there."" I can feel my teeth shake. The whirring in my head feels... clearer. The aching, just slightly less dull.

""That you were. But I fixed you."" ""...Why? What are you?""

""Nobody important. I just enjoy fixing broken things. And you were left in quite a broken state.""

""You didn't... fix me. I can still feel it. The hole left in me. I feel... *hollow*."" ""You are simply you. I just put back everything that was already there.""

""Then why do I feel so empty?"" ""I simply put back what was there. However... some parts were too broken to put back in. I simply filled in those gaps. You can put something else in there, if you'd like.""

""What parts were too broken?""

""...Who knows? Hard to tell. But I think you'd better go find out.""

The whirring almost fades, and all I hear is a soft hum - a friendly voice. My eyesight feels clear, almost too clear. *FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SEE.* The once-sterile blue simply washes over me now like muted grey, as I turn to see a door there... *was that always there?*

The figure is gone, but I hear that hum in my ears. *YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.*

I get up, turn the doorknob and walk out.",5
1ld16bq,my5fhn4,"He looked me over, clad in the dark suit with a long white coat. Nodding to himself once, he offered me a hand. ""Come on. Let's get you out of there.""

I didn't know what to do. My brain was sluggish, thoughts oozing like toffee. Something was wrong with me. I knew it, but not what. I could remember before, and how I could understand things so quickly. Quickly compared to now, as I sat and thought.

Finally I came to a decision. My hand rose, at a shocking speed. It was faster than I could think! I was past his hand before I realised, colliding into unyielding metal above. The impact radiated through me, but I felt no pain.

He remained still, not a single twitch at my movement. His eyes were fixed on me, face neutral as he spoke. ""Post-Death Nerve Disassociation Syndrome. Don't worry about it. Try again.""

I tried hard to focus. But my arm was too responsive. I kept on missing, finding my hand missing him each and every time. But the man didn't seem to mind. He just waited, holding his hand out, giving me quiet encouragement.

Finally, finally I managed it. By moving as slowly as I could think, twitching on the way. I finally met his grip, warm fingers curling around mine. He finally smiled, pulling me back. ""There we go. Let's get you up.""

I was easily moved by him. My body was too odd. I wore nothing, but felt no chill. I felt heavy, but could move without issue. Everything was slightly numb, save for the warmth I felt coming from him.

The man pulled up a hospital gown, wrapping it around me. I let him, as he spoke. ""Alright, so you're up. That's good. You might not have them now, but later you will have questions. Once your brain wakes up a little more. Suffice to say, you are dead, technically. Your heart will not beat. Your brain has no measurable activity. You will need no food, nor drink nor even air.""

He sighed. ""You are classed as undead. However, we don't know exactly what you are, or rather, will be. You are rare, but for now are only known to be a zombie.""

Zombie. It rang a bell. Something to eat the living. A cannibal of sorts. But I didn't want to eat him. Or anyone. In fact, I didn't want to eat anything. Unnoticing my simple though process, the man continued. ""But a zombie is effectively a baby of the undead, from what we know. You will grow into it, and find a path to suit you. Maybe a Lich, a Vampire, a Ghoul, even a Mummy. But the details aren't mine to explain.""

Holding my arm, he pulled me forwards. Out of this cold, sterile room. There was no others as he led me towards a door, with a waiting van. Guiding me carefully I was placed on a bench, with him strapping me in.

The man nodded to me, placing his hands on the door as he stood outside. ""Don't worry, we'll get you somewhere safe soon. The home of the Gravekeepers.""

I watched him slam the doors shut, as I tried to think a bit faster. I didn't get much of it. The names spoken slipped me by. But he wanted to help me. That's what he said. Maybe he could let me think faster.

Plus, he was so *warm*.",5
1lcl8tj,my1frxn,"I stare at the God, gushing about his new girlfriend, and how weird she is behaving.

We kissed.

""2 months.

Oh no! Did I pressure her into kissing me?  
Am I a monster?!"" he panics.  
I sigh.  
""Don't think like that. How did she act before? Was she looking at you? Smiling? Laughing? Touching accidently your arms, shoulder, whatever?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
Oh boy, this is like asking advice from a monk.



""We laughed, we danced, and she even moved one of my stray strands of hair, out of the way.  
It was a spark there...that's why I kissed her. I don't want to mess this up."" he says, burying himself into my couch, pulling the hoodie's hood even more over his head.  
I grit my teeth.  
""It sounds like she just got surprised. I-Is she the shy type? Maybe you are her first boyfriend?"" I try hard not to be an asshole to this guy, but it's hard.  
He sits up straight.  
""She mentioned not being used to dating...And that this is all new to her, but she likes it..."" he mutters.  
I sigh.

  
""Don't worry mate, it's just the jitters of a person in a new relationship.  
It happens, and mostly likely it will happen again, to you and her as well."" I say.  
""What can I do?"" he asks.  
""Take it slow, be respectful, don't be shy to say that you are confused, and don't know what to do.  
Ask her questions, what she wants, what she would like to do, and overall, be respectful.  
If there is a connection between the 2 of you, no matter how rocky the journey gets, with patience, and mutual respect, you will get through it."" I say.  
""THANK YOU! WISE MORTAL!"" he booms, lunging at me, hugging me.  
""Get off!"" I say, and he jumps away laughing.  
""THANK YOU! I will bring you God-fruits next time I visit! Now excuse me, but I have to talk to...MY GIRLFRIEND!"" he laughs, disappearing.  
I frown.  
""Should have beaten him up more..."" I mutter, as I clean the table, and wonder if I should go to the inn, and try finding a girlfriend for myself as well.

I can’t ignore Zee although I do my best to whenever people are around because I don’t want to appear insane. I have no such qualms around my therapist. 

“And you say this Zee is talking to you right now?” Doctor Maybe asks. 

“It won’t shut up,” I say. 

“Are you talking about me to that human?” Zee asks, pointing to the doctor with the metallic shard in its hand. 

*I’m not crazy. I’m not!!!*

“Yes,” I say. 

“What’s he saying?” both the Doctor and Zee ask. 

“He was asking if I was speaking to you,” I say. 

Zee shakes his head. “This won’t do at all. I need to get you back to your birth reality before it collapses. Only you can save us.”

“Doctor,” I say, “he says if I don’t return to my birth place it will be destroyed. Only I can save it.”

The doc scribbles something in his notepad. “And you see the delusion, right? I mean, only you can save the world. Classic.”

“Okay,” Zee says, holding out the orb. “Hold on tightly because we have to cross multiple realities.”

1lckxst,my6xwy2,"The Maid's Maid
by The Bearded GM

The benefit to starting work so early in the morning is that I get off work a couple of hours before most of the rest of the professional world.  So it was only about four o'clock in the afternoon when I left the hotel and headed to the bus stop that would carry my tired ass home to the apartment I shared with  my cat Silhouette, the only real comfort in my life.

The bus was probably running late again, so I sat down on the bench of the bus shelter and let my mind just tune out the world for a few minutes.  My rest was interrupted by a rush of footsteps and a woman's voice approaching me.

“Your majesty!  I've found you at last!”

I blinked the fog from my eyes and looked up to see an attractive young woman in her twenties with long, curly blonde hair rushing up to me from further down the block.  She was dressed in a long, flowing dress of sky-blue with silver filigree designs that looked like something out of a fairy tale, complete with puffy sleeves and a brown satchel slung over one shoulder.

“I'm sorry; who are you?”

“Your majesty, it's me!”  The woman's excitement was bursting out of her and when she reached me in the bus shelter, she knelt down on the ground in front of me and took my hands in hers, tears dripping down her perfect, pale cheeks.  “Are you safe, majesty?  Are you injured?  It took me so long to find you.”  She bowed her head, clearly overcome with emotion.

“Look, miss?  I don't know who you are, and I think you may have found the wrong person.  Who were you looking for, anyway?”  I knew there was a possibility that she was mentally unwell, and I didn't want to get dragged into some drama of her imagination.  I was sure that Silhouette missed me even though she was very coy about expressing her affections.

The woman looked up at me again, this time a mein of shock was evident on her features.  “Majesty, do you really not remember me?  I am Fiona Windcarver, your oldest friend and confidant.  I have been your maid for the past twelve years.”  She let go of one of my hands to wipe the wetness from her cheeks.  “When you disappeared from the palace, everyone panicked, but I saw the traces of a magical kidnapping.  I searched for months and months to discover which world you had been spirited away to.  I have the means to take you home, to your family and to your throne.”  She patted the satchel she wore to indicate that she was referring to some object she carried.

“Look, miss … Fiona, my name is Carmen Lucia Luna.  I'm not a 'majesty' and I've never had any thrones.  I've been living in my apartment on the east side for close to ten years now, so if you've only been searching for me for months, I think you've got the wrong person.”

Her expression hardened.  “They've done something to your mind to make you forget who you are and where you're from.  There is so little magic in this world; I don't know if I can repair the damage without taking you home first.”  She released my other hand and opened her satchel to start digging through its contents.

But just then, then bus pulled up in front of the little shelter.

I stood up as carefully as I could to avoid knocking into this deluded young woman and stepped around her to get on the bus, pulling out my bus pass as I did.  I felt her hand grabbing onto my jacket to hold me back just as I was setting my foot onto the bus steps.  “Your name is not Carmen,” she pleaded, “it is Queen Lucinda Madena, ruler of all the Quiet Lands from the Thunder Peaks to the Green River.  Your son died exactly one year ago today, and I was the one who held you while you wept for him, Majesty.”

I pulled away from her and boarded the bus, swiping my pass over the reader, then I turned back to watch her just before the doors closed between us.  “I don't know what you're talking about.  I never had a son.”  The doors closed, and the bus pulled away from the stop beginning my final journey of the day from work to home.

Her words were so heartfelt that I couldn't help but feel some sympathy for her even though it must have been a delusion.  As I walked back to find an available seat on the bus, I tried to imagine what it must be like to be some medieval fantasy queen, ruling over a mystical land, but that meant nothing to me.  But the idea of losing a son, of holding an infant in my arms as he grows cold and pale ….  I collapsed into a bus seat and let the tears erupt from my eyes.  Somehow, I knew what that felt like, and I vaguely remembered some younger woman holding my shoulders while my sobs quaked through me again and again.

I just barely remembered to signal the bus driver to stop at my apartment building, and I disembarked in a fog of emotion and dreams.  I did not actually remember any of the things that Fiona woman had described, but there was some strong internal resonance, almost a longing to recall that strange foreign land where I was a powerful monarch with a maid of my own instead of working as a maid in a modest hotel.",5
1lckxst,my6y03m,"The elevator was out of order again, so with a resigned sigh, I trudged up the eleven flights of stairs to reach my flat, inserted the key, and stumbled into my home.  I spotted Silhouette raise her little feline head and blink at me in from her resting place in that cardboard box I'd scavenged in what I guessed was something like satisfaction that I had returned.  I discarded my jacket and let myself fall heavily onto the second hand sofa in what I laughingly called my living room.

I certainly didn't feel like a queen.  Even Silhouette treated me more like a servant than like a monarch worthy of respect.  After a few minutes of resting my feet and recovering from the lengthy climb up the stairs, I pushed myself upright again and wandered into my kitchen to see what leftovers or store bought freezer meals I could heat up to sate my royal stomach.  I settled on a frozen burrito that I could season with some left over packets of fast food hot sauce.

While I was eating, Silhouette deigned to emerge from her resting place and paw at my leg until I gave her some pettings.  Once she was satisfied that I would pet her on demand, she purred for a few seconds, then made her way to her own corner of the kitchen where she could nibble on some dry food at her leisure.  When I finished my paltry meal, I decided that I needed to go spend some quality time playing with Silhouette and a laser pointer, but before I got further than standing up from the sofa, there was a loud knock at my apartment door.

I looked through the peephole to find that it was Fiona, standing hunched over and still breathing heavily from the long climb up the stairs.  “I told you, I'm not your queen.”

She placed her hands on the door as if preparing to shove it open.  “Yes you are, Majesty.  If you let me through this barrier, I can prove it to you.”

That idea intrigued me, though I doubted she could prove any such thing.  Aside from playing with my cat, there were no other demands on my time, so I opened the door and let her in.

“Thank you, your Majesty,” she said as she stepped into my tiny home.  She looked around the sparse living room, by far the largest of the five rooms in the flat.  She turned back to face me and opened her satchel and pulled out what appeared to be a scroll.  She unfurled it and read from it, “May it be known throughout the Quiet Kingdom that Fiona Windcarver is pardoned and protected by the crown, and upon the birth of her first child she shall be elevated to the station of a Lady of the Realm.  Signed Queen  Lucinda Madena, sovereign of the Quiet Lands.”

She held the scroll so delicately and spoke the words on it so reverently, that I was convinced that she wholeheartedly believed what she was saying.  She turned the scroll around and showed me the writing on it.  It was a florid calligraphy penned with a wide-nibbed fountain pen or possibly an actual quill.  It was very attractive handwriting, but it did not resemble my own penmanship.

“Lucinda, my love, please try to remember.  What this writ does not say is that you and I love each other, though we cannot by law be married.  You took a consort, Sir Draven of Veradeen, to help you to conceive your son.  Though Draven never won your love, little Alain did for as briefly as he drew breath.  He was to be our son – yours and mine – if he had but lived.”  Tears pooled in her eyes again, and in due course one fell down her fair cheek and alighted on her chin.

That was a secret that I had never uttered, even to my family or to myself.  I had no romantic interests in men because my attentions were too focused on women.  And to be honest, Fiona did look like the sort of woman that I could become close to if I knew her better – and if she was not so delusional as to imagine me as a monarch of a fantasy realm.

I reached out to gently brush the teardrop from her lovely face, and I felt both startled and excited when she leaned into my touch.  “I wish I did remember all of these things you describe, but it doesn't sound anything like my life or experience.”

Fiona spoke softly, almost willing me to lean closer to hear her.  “Lucinda, the curse binding your memories is a powerful one indeed.  But I believe it will be broken when we return to the Quiet Kingdom, or if not, at least we will have the sorcerous resources at hand to remove the curse there.  Please come home with me.”  She leaned in even closer and whispered, “Please.”  Then she pressed her lips to mine.

It was my first kiss with a woman, my first kiss with anyone since I was a teenager learning that I had no desire to kiss boys.  It was magnificent and my heart longed for it to go on longer after she pulled back.  “That was ….”  I was at a loss for words because words could not equal such a sensual action.

“Do you remember our kisses, Majesty?  Do you long for them as I do when we are parted?”  She held my hand in hers.  “Please come home with me.  I promise we can lift your curse and we can be together forever in a place where your word is law.  Please!”

A part of me hungered to say 'yes,' to say anything if it would mean that we could just go back to kissing again (and maybe, a tiny part of my desires said, maybe even more than just kissing).

But then my mind returned to reality.  I had a job; I had a cat to take care of; my mother would need me to look after her in a few years if her health continued to decline.  I had this apartment and the sentimental junk that was arrayed in my bedroom that I couldn't just leave behind.  And this crazy woman was talking about journeying into some fantasy land where wizards and who knows what else was real.  Of course I would love to live in some made up world where I was a queen, but I had responsibilities here in the real world.

I took a step away from her even as I desperately wanted to kiss her again.  “I'm sorry,” I said as firmly as I could manage.  “I have real duties in a real life here.  I can't just go play make pretend with you.”  A moment of silence lay between us.  “I'm sorry.”

“But I love you, Lucinda!  Don't you love me?”

“My name is Carmen, and I don't even remember you.”  I turned and walked to the front door and opened it for her.  “I think it's time that you leave.”

“But you are our queen.  You are my queen.  How can I just leave you to this life of … drudgery?”

“You can because I ask you to.  I am tired; please go.”

She walked to the threshold, pausing just before she left my rented home.  “If ever you change your mind and recover enough of yourself to desire to return to the Quiet Kingdom and to me, you have but to call out to me and I will come to rescue you and bear you home.  Farewell, my love.”  And then she woefully marched out, down the hall, and to the stairwell.

Sometimes in my dreams, I envision myself as a queen of a mystical land with loyal subjects and a handmaid who is also a lover named Fiona Windcarver.  Those are the very best dreams I have ever had, but they are just dreams.  When I wake up, I throw on my clothes, fix my hair, and then head back to the hotel where I earn just enough to pay for the rent on the tiny apartment and the food for my needy cat.  It is not a life to be envied, even by me, but at least I have those dreams.",5

You shrink deeper into the pile of barrels and planks, squinting at the guy in the turtleneck--as if reading his lips might somehow be easier than understanding his speech. He strokes a sculpted goatee. Says a bunch more stuff.

Speaking of context, what if that wasn't even an SOS call just now? After all, SOS calls don't typically include vuvuzelas. The radio's gone on to play some kind of frenetic marimba music.

Sooner or later, someone's bound to say an *-ito* word.

You smile at this feeling--this kinship across cultures, a wordless, familial love--and just then, your hand settles on what appears to be some kind of control panel in the wall. *EMERGENCIA,* it says in red, above a heavy-looking lever. A word you recognize! If you *are* going to steal the ship, save these people, then this lever and the corresponding instructions might be your ticket to do so.

After dying the first time, I somehow ended up in a fantasy version of the world I came from, where magic existed with the cliché rpg system.

After dying a second time, I became a ghost. You would think it's cool, but really it's not. Why? Because I need do transmutation of matter to an energy form I can use to not dissipate myself, and coincidentally the more something is valuable, the more it gives energy once converted. And of course mana cannot undergo this transformation. So I need to steal people things to not die. It's dumb but I haven't created this world.

When I first became a ghost, each time I touched something, it asked me if I wanted to do a possession, or to haunt, said object. Each time I said no. I did not want to become a chandelier, a ring or a house.

When I saw this big luxury boat, or a small ritzy cruiseship, I knew I struck gold to stay on this world for some time. I hid in the shadow of one of the guest to pass undetected in the ship. The irony that it was an exorcist...

Once the ship departed, blarring its horn as a goodbye to the other ships and to the city, I started to peek around, especially at the most pricy places, where I subtly dissolved an earring over there, the gold plating on the bracelet over here. I just needed to be cautious to not do anything on camera, else I would risk facing consequences like dying, or worse, being trapped in an object for all of eternity.

From the information I managed to gather, there will be four days overseas, before stopping at a port. I also understood that they were going to sail through pirates infested waters.

On the third day, once the shops closed, I decided to do my heist : steal all jewellery from the stores. So I became a little bit of an Arsène Lupin myself for this fun little heist.

Everything was going according to plan, when I heard the distinct sound of a canon firing, followed by the emergency sound resonating in the whole cruiseship telling everyone to go to their respective muster stations. In short the ship was under attack by some pirates. I could hear the sound of the commotion of everyone moving, and of the crew firing shots back at the pirates to make stop floating on the water.

After extremely long minutes, the speakers said that the menace was eliminated. So I stopped my heist to go to the command board. From there I could see a wooden boat sinking in the ocean. It's funny that modern and old ships both existed and were largely in use.

Then the captain said that they needed to abandon the ship as it was damaged beyond repair. I thought for an enormous amount of time - three seconds - before deciding to possess the ship, because I'm not a monster.

I touched the commands. ""Do you want to possess [cruiseship]?“ Yes.

I felt everything. The engine running, the radar pings, the hull cutting in the water, and the big gaping hole that was sinking the ship. First I moved materials from ""useless"" areas to plug the gap, then took control of the speakers.

""Dear passengers and crew members, Here is your new captain speaking. I managed to repair the ship. Nobody will need to abandon this ship. The emergency is cancelled, you can return to your occupations."" And I blocked anyone else from saying something else, as I managed to keep this ship afloat.

Then a few minutes later, I get expelled from the ship, and I'm in front of the exorcist from earlier. ""We need to talk.""",6
1lccjar,my0qmou,"He had such a smug look on his face when he said it, too. I'm not a judgy guy. I'm not a paternalistic friend. I don't even have any moral qualms about robbing a multi-million dollar corporation, but friends don't let friends commit crimes in The Cowl's city. 

""You know if The Cowl catches you guys, you'll be in the ICU for at least a month, right?"" I ask him. 

""Nobody's worried about The Cowl!"" He responds, ""There's so much crime going on in this town at any given moment, he'll probably be too busy to stop us.""

I bury my face in the palm of my hand. Tyson was never the sharpest tool in the shed, but I had to give talking him down an honest try. 

""Ty, this is a BIG JOB. He's gonna see it on the news and come straight for you guys. And he's not gonna go easy on you, the guy has ISSUES!""

""RELAX, Buddy. Even if the cowl shows up, the Pain Patron'll handle 'em."" He says reassuringly, as if this wasn't the WORST response he could possibly give. 

""PAIN PATRON!?!? THIS IS A PAIN PATRON JOB?!?!?!"" I clearly underestimated my friend's stupidity. ""That guy didn't earn his name taking on The Cowl. He earned it by lashing out on bystanders on just about every one of his schemes! If they catch you, you're gonna go UNDER THE JAIL!"" 

""They're not gonna ca—""

""Pain Patron is like 0-36 vs The Cowl and none of his henchmen EVER end up escaping with him!""

""Buddy, I get it,"" he begins condescendingly, ""you're jealous that you didn't get offered a spot on the team. But Pain Patron is only looking for the most elite guys."" Tyson gives me a confident smile, he's so full of himself right now. ""But don't worry, stick with your salary gig. I'll break a piece off for you when the job's done. My treat for keeping all of this hush hush.""

Tyson winks at me. I bury my face again, both palms this time. I let out a giant sigh of resignation. ""Okay Ty, just be careful.""

Two months pass and I'm visiting Tyson in the hospital, he's handcuffed to his bed, the feeling is starting to come back in his lower body, which is unfortunate because all there is to feel is pain.

""I was SO CLOSE to being like SUPER SUPER RICH"" he says to me, his missing teeth producing a whistle with every ""s"".

Much to my shame, The Evil One surprised me. I'd studied his spells, and I knew every single trick he could throw at me. I'd trained countermeasures for every single one of them, and I could begin my countermeasures as soon as I recognized the motions for his incantations.

That, however, was precisely the problem. I hadn't anticipated that he'd hunch over to hide his incantations on the far side of his body. It was considered dirty pool in wizarding circles, but The Evil One didn't seem to care much for that particular convention. I suppose he lived up to the name, after all.

""Ugh, the Drain.""

""I see you are familiar with my work.""

""Execute ... ""

""Ha! Not in the position you're in, my young friend. The Drain will capture your life force and add it to my pool soon enough.""

""Gamma ...""

""You say funny words. But see where you Science got you. A single incantation, and you are defeated. There may be many paths to power, but my magic is unparalleled.""

""Tau ...""

""Not to worry, I will learn all your secrets soon enough. I can begin to feel some of your wisdom seep into me. This Greek alphabet of yours is fascinating.""

""Phi ...""

""Still struggling, I see. Not to worry, the Drain will leave you alive.""

""Om ..""

""Not that you'll like it much.""

""Omi .. Omi ...""

""You're a stubborn one. An eternity of agony will teach you the proper respect for my magic.""

""Omi ... cron!""

The Evil One felt the difference immediately.

""What?! How?!""

""Sci ... science,"" I managed to sputter.

""What trickery is this? Return my life force!""

""Not much fun ... having the Drain reversed. Is-is it?""

The Evil One raised his left arm and curled his right hand, readying his Mind Blast. It was a nasty spell, one that shot pure malevolence through the recipient. Few survived it, and the ones that did were twisted shells of themselves afterwards.

Fortunately, in his state of confusion, The Evil One didn't bother to hide his motions this time. I could see it coming.

And I knew what to do.

""Execute: alpha, beta, tau.""

The Mind Blast sputtered in his left hand, fizzling into nothing. The Evil One howled in frustration, having been foiled a second time.

""HOW?!""

""The short answer is that I didn't just study my power. I know how yours works, too.""

""Blasphemy!""

""Execute: phi, phi, phi, phi.""

The Evil One wrapped both hands around himself, and began muttering.

""It won't work.""

""Ha! I live to fight another day.""

""You can't cast Escape.""

I stayed quiet another few seconds, knowing that he'd realize the truth of my words soon enough. I wasn't bluffing.

""Worm! How dare you defy me?""

I said nothing, and waited for the inevitable. With Drain in full force, and his means of escape blocked, The Evil One would be defeated shortly.

-- -- -- -- --

It took longer than I had calculated, but the Evil One apparently had bigger reserves than I had estimated. Still, his slumped form was all the confirmation I needed: my calculations had been correct.

""Not bad for a little math.""",6
1lc1feo,mxy10jr,"Thorin lay broken and bruised, his breath shallow against the cold marble of the temple floor. The ruined hall was empty, yet he swore he could still hear the taunting laughter of those he thought were friends.

When the Dark Lord had released the Abyssal Beast and the band of adventurers found themselves outmatched, Thorin was the chosen sacrifice. The rogue had stabbed him, so that his blood may lure the beast. The wizard had cast a spell to slow him down, that he might be last to never escape. And the priest had denied him healing and refused to buff him.

Then, he heard the heavy footsteps. The crunch of broken glass. Thorin groaned, and closed his eyes.

""I know it's you,"" he sputtered. ""Kill me already.""

He awaited the axe to his head. The silence hung in the air like an executioner's axe given pause from a new set of orders. When he opened his eyes, there was a hand.

The Dark Lord towered above him, one clawed hand outstretched. ""Take my hand. Or would you prefer if I left you to bleed to death as your false friends have?""

Any self-respecting hero would slap the hand away. If only Thorin had the strength to do so. Even then, he still tried to sit up, only to find himself barely rising. His friends might have laughed at his predicament, but the Dark Lord did not.

""I'm not here to gloat,"" the villain remarked. ""I'm here to give you a choice. Let me help you. Get revenge. This is my offer to all who have been wronged.""

Did he have a choice? It was either being left for dead, or taking this suspicious offer.

""Once, I was in your shoes,"" the Dark Lord spoke. ""An aspiring hero. I thought I could vanquish evil. But the worst kind of evil isn't some warlord. The true evil lies among the nobles and bureaucrats of this kingdom. They have grown old and complacent and corrupt. You see, Thorin. You either die trying to be a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain. Except, you didn't even get to be a hero before coming close to death's door. So, hero or villain, do you want a second chance to at least be someone?""

Baron Gottwold was dead at the hands of the Dark Lord's newest general Thorn, and nobody mourned him. The townsfolk would have celebrated too, if it wasn't for the fact that their local hero, the dashing rogue Jareth, was just as dead. And carved upon his forehead, a single word.

Betrayer.

The nobles panicked. They were being targeted, picked off one by one. Their personal guards either demanding higher pay, or bailing, for fear of their lives. It went from bad to worse when Duke Darrowind's private army murdered him, presented his head to the Dark Lord's general, and opened the gates for him.

Better to give the mysterious warrior who he wanted dead, than have him pillage and burn the city, they said. The Dark Lord even promised to assign someone who would improve living standards of the common folk. After all, a prosperous city can sustain an army better than a suffering one in the long run.

Mirdal the wizard and the mages of the Wizard's Tower attempted take back the city but failed. A mysterious anti-magic field had enveloped the city the moment they stepped in, and the gates closed in behind them. A trap they fell for, in their eagerness to save Darrowind City. None survived. Thorn buried them all with honors. Except one. Mirdal's corpse was left hanging by the city gates as a warning. His forehead tattooed with only one word.

Traitor.

The recently appointed head priest Feraes of the Granveld Church knew he was on a suicide mission. They'd pushed him out to negotiate a truce. One that General Thorn had no reason to humor, given his victories over several cities. The Dark Lord's armies had conquered over half the nation. His lord's army was decimated in battle. But most of all, he knew who was hiding beneath the black armor.

""Thorin, I'm sorry,"" the priest didn't have anything else to say.

""Am I supposed to go home and pretend all three of you didn't leave me behind to die? Were you expecting me to forgive and forget and cease this war?""

""Tis but a dream,"" Feraes sighed. ""I only ask that you not attack this city where I live. My offer is...my life.""

Thorn didn't hesitate. It was off with his head.

Then, the attack on Granveld would continue. Former false friends don't get to have fair deals that were honored.",52

Seeing my beautiful wife I say “ darling I have returned “ 

Darling turns, sees me, runs and jumps into my arms. Placing kisses all over my face. Darling purrs “Honey Bun, I missed you so much “ . 

I carry her around the room. Trying to speak, while she continues to smother me with kisses. 

“Darling, you need to stop boosting my energy levels. At least while kings and queens rule the world. “ I said. 

Darling asked “ but why honey bunny, it insures that you will always return to me alive “ 

I said “ do you notice anything? Like all of my hair is burnt off , because of that dragon. My shield is melted and fused to my arm. My sword is broken at the hilt. “ 

Darling states pleased with herself, “ I can fix all that. But look that War Mace I made for you, is in perfect condition. Even glowing with gathered energy from the dragon.” 

Sighing I say “ I just wish you would have told me. I waisted a lot of time running around that dragon while it burnt me. Then I noticed the Mace glow. But I was completely worn out, beating on the dragon, till I could get a few good head shots in, that caved in dragon skull. “ 

Darling smiled and said “ but then the mace absorbed all of the dragon energy and funnel that energy to you slowly, like a trickle charge. “ 

I agreed shaking my head, “yes that enabled me to walk home returning to. The dragon had eaten my horse. “ 

“Mr. Ed is dead? What a shame. Did you save Mr.Ed heart , I can always bring him back.” Darling replied. 

Sitting on the love seat cradling my Darling, “ no, the king and all of his army showed up. Claimed Victory over the Dragon. Started cutting up the meat. Choosing the choice bit for the royal kitchen. “
Pause “I was barely able to get the dragon heart and a fang . Placing them in my backpack. While the king was busy giving speeches. “ 

Darling begins kissing my face over and over, saying “ You always remember to bring me gifts”

I say “ back too , my problem. These kings and queens, have decided that I am the answer to all of their kingdom problems. “ pause “ got dragon call Honey Bun. Got Troll issues, call Honey Bun. Goblin trouble call Honey Bun. “ 

Darling looks lovingly at Honey Bun, “ what is the problem Honey Bun?” 

“They are no longer fixing any problems by themselves for themselves.” I replied. 

“I would like to spend more than a few days with you. Before being summoned by royalties to solve problems.” I say leaning my forehead against hers.",53
1lc0pic,my072df,"Sitting with her legs leisurely laid cross her lap, Vernora looked at the group of kings begging at the foot of her throne. Each had henchmen lined up behind them, bearing gifts and trinkets galore in an attempt to entice her fancy. ""Don't bother with these mortal gifts, for what brings value to you is but mere toys to me."" A mischievous grin stretched across her lips as she looked at their horror. The castle was the wandering castle Dracula had owned centuries prior, and was one of the many gifts her hubby had given her. Having landed in the middle of several kingdoms, they all feared the power of a being able to move mountains through the sky. Ironically it had been a simple misunderstanding as she'd travelled towards polar north rather than the true north, causing her to land a few dozen miles away from her intended destination. 

""As you can see, I'm a god amongst you. So, I warn,"" Letting forth a lightning bolt over their heads, it shot out the door and removed the mountain behind them from the scenery. It was a daily castable he'd made in the form of a ring, trapping inside a grade ten elemental spirit. It allowed her one cast of any element per day. ""it's in your best interest to listen carefully. Bring me all the puppies!"" Chuckling, a flash of light lit up the courtyard just outside of the doorway. ""Now leave me and come back with the litters of puppies as I demand.""  Trying to rush them along, a man in ragged clothes came through the open door. 

Walking up to the throne, he carried himself with a sense of urgency. ""Who the fuck is this beggar?"" Cried out one of the royal aids. Without warning or care, he snapped his fingers, and each became a pile of ash. Swirling together, it formed into a rather large golem and began leaving. The room was spotless, as the mess cleaned itself up nicely. 

""Hi sugar muffin"" Vernora smiled as he walked up to her. ""Looks like your cape got destroyed. Piss of one of the god's again?"" rolling his eyes, the castle teleported to the intended location.",9

""Hey, there. Sasha, right? Welcome!"" 

""Uuugh?"" Sasha groans. 

""Here, I got you some clothes. You used to wear gowns like this all the time in life, right?"" 

""Uuuugh."" 

""I thought so! You should go get dressed. We're going to have dinner soon. Then maybe a nice, hot bath would be to your liking?"" 

""Uuuuuuuuuugh?"" 

""You're struggling to process. That's natural."" She sits down and pats the ground next to her. The zombie lets out a confused groan, but eventually manages to sit next to her. The necromancer smiles encouragingly as she figures it out. Once Sasha joins her, she pats her back. ""Good job. See, you're already starting to get it.""   
  
""Uugh, uuuugh,"" the zombie responds, blushing and scratching her head bashfully. The necromancer giggles, then sighs.

And yet, after all the good deeds you've done . . . "" She clenches her fists. ""look what happened to you!"" She bit her lip as tears formed in her eyes.  ""You should be in the celestial realm, enjoying paradise. But no! There was a portal into the abyss. The only way to close it was for someone to do it from the inside. You volunteered. You went in. The portal was closed before any demons could escape. But your soul . . . your soul is trapped there for eternity."" Her tears fall and she sniffles. ""You didn't deserve that."" 

""Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh."" 

""Of course you'd say that. Of course you'd say there was no other way. That's the kind of person you are. You don't think for even a second that someone else could have made that sacrifice and that it didn't have to be you."" She sighs and brings in her legs, wrapping her arms around them to curl into a tiny ball. ""I was one of them, you know. The people you saved. And had I been there, I would gladly have sacrificed myself instead."" She then smiles a little bitterly. ""But it's a good thing I didn't, because I can do something no one else can. All the other zombies in my so-called army have similar stories to yours. They have all found their souls in afterlives of eternal suffering, even though, in life, they only ever did good deeds. I know it's not the same as if I could truly resurrect you, soul and all, but a part of you is in there. It's the nature of my magic that part of your soul is tethered to your body when I bring you back. So, a part of you, at least, gets to be here. With me. And I can give you some semblance of the afterlife you deserve."" 

""Uuuuugh.""

""No, it's no trouble at all. Don't worry about it! Here's your dress. We're going to eat soon. And someday, I might amass an army powerful enough to storm the abyss and the infernal realm and all other realms your souls have been trapped, and we will get them all back. But we're still a long ways off from all that. In the meantime, talk to your fellow zombies. Make friends. I have a book club, I have classes on relearning your language, and we even have an arcade of sorts. And if you ever need anything at all, you can always talk to me. I'll give you anything you want.

1lc1adn,mxzunt8,"The sun is setting. Once again, I leave the crypt and walk through the corridors, slowly advancing towards my goal. I find myself not fully awake, with muddled thoughts and stiff muscles... though I wonder if that last one will ever leave me if I accept. I \*am\* dead, after all.

It takes a few minutes for me to reach the meeting place. The palace which now houses my corpse is build like a ring, within which a small patch of land is growing. It is that eerie place of life that I approach to converse with the lord of the dead.

He's waiting for me. He's sitting in a simple wooden chair, across a table, surrounded by trees with bark like stone and leaves the color of blood. I know not these plants, but still, I do find them quite pleasant.

**""Shall we?""** He gestures toward the second chair. Ignoring the creaks and wails of my rusted armor, I sit. He smiles softly. **""Please, do ask your questions. I know you still have some.""**

**""... Why?""** I find my voice hoarse. I wouldn't be surprised if I still had literal dirt stuck in my throat.

**""Why what, dear sir?""** Pale of skin and hair. Eyes like murky depths of the abyss. The man himself looks like a ghost, but though my oaths still should bind me, I can't force myself to hate him.

**""Why me? There surely are better candidates.""** The first night I asked him, why did he even bother with sentient undead. The second time I learnt, he had distaste for summoning recently deceased. <<Too many problems with their life affairs>>, he said. I understand then, that as a relatively ancient man of great will, I fit at least some of his requirements. But I'm sure there's more to it. 

**""Well... Sure, I could find better fighters. I'm certain the lower crypts would house some better riders, or archers... But at this point my Black Knight units are quite full of experienced warriors. They lack but one thing.""**

**""... A commander.""** He nods. I was once a paladin, a holy warrior of great renown. But centuries have passed and both my name and deity have fallen into obscurity. I myself cannot recall even the simplest prayer. And this boy, barely a sapling of a man, would have me lead his terrible host of shambling corpses.

**""The people of these lands have been forsaken by all their allies, human or divine. Many have fallen to the blights of our times: to the demons and raiders, and all manners of monstrosities. Tell me, dear sir, would it not be noble to defend such people?""** He does not seem to care that now I too would be one of the mentioned monstrosities. But the worse part is: he truly seems to believe everything he's saying to me. I cannot find even one lie throughout all of his speeches.

**""Then why waste time with me? Why won't you simply bend my mind to your will?""** If his sins are excused by doing his all to protect the weak, how could he spend all this time on a single undead who, in the end, could simply refuse him?

**""Is it a waste? I think I actually need to remind myself, that I \*do\* still have some morals. That I have some lines that I will not cross.""** He smiles a little, then shrugs. **""Besides, you all are not bound to my life. It would be quite foolish, I think, to raise an army that will slaughter the very people I swore to protect the very moment my own life burns out.""**

I can't help but have some admiration for the love he seems to have for his flock. Perhaps... joining them would not be that bad? Perhaps it could even be the right thing to do? Perhaps-

**""Ah, I apologize, but I believe I've ran out of time. The day is long gone and I am yet to perform maintenance on our Skeletons... If I don't get to it right now, I'll be late for the banquet in the Vampire quarters and I'm not sure the ladies would forgive me for that.**"" I once again marvel at the sheer sincerity in his voice. He' simply so impossibly... genuine.

**""Of course. Then..?""**

**""Tomorrow at dusk, indeed. I hope that this time I'll be able to sway you, dear sir.""** He smiles. And I can't help but notice, that although faintly... I'm smiling too.",40

Most necromancers treat their undead as expandable servants, pawn, minions and slaves.

The air whistles past your face like a gossiping grandmother with no volume control. Somewhere behind you, a half-eaten burrito spins lazily—souvenir from attempt #439, when you thought, *maybe food will cushion the fall.*

It didn’t.

Now you're plummeting with that familiar cocktail of regret and existential dread. It's not fear anymore. No, fear gave up on you after attempt #82, when you tried to knit a parachute mid-fall. (Spoiler: alpaca yarn is *not* aerodynamic.)

How did this start? A bar. A bet. A man with seven monocles and a squirrel in a tuxedo. You vaguely recall saying:

**“How bad could a consequence-based reality loop really be?”**

Oh, sweet naive you.

The loop, of course, was designed by an AI who majored in irony and minored in slapstick. Now it resets every time you splat, bounce, or—in that one infamous incident—get caught in a wind turbine and launched sideways into a medieval renaissance fair (they *really* don’t like surprises).

But you’ve got a plan now. You squint against the rushing wind and reach into your jacket pocket.

A kazoo.

Yeah, that’s right.

You’ve learned the algorithm has a bug—it hates music in C minor. And the kazoo? It's tuned *perfectly* to disrupt its fall-detection sensors. You bring it to your lips, blast a flatulent note of defiance, and—

1lc5hw5,mxyud0f,"The office for superficial dreams & nightmares has its 8th meeting this month. I mentally roll my eyes. Seriously, is it this difficult to fill the subject line for upcoming meeting notes? Why the heck did I even get the notice?  
  
Gil's elbow hits my arm. Looking at them, they grin, wink, and gesture towards our boss.  
  
“What?” I mouth.        
A line connects to my brain.              
‘ *If I can hear and see your annoyance from here, the bossman can, too.’*

With that, they cut the line, and simultaneously, Samuel starts speaking

""Falling to death in their dreams, really, humans need to learn an escape route! 16 heart attacks last week alone!"" *Mr. Caloway's* gaze travels around the room of his best agents for spontaneous death and combustion in spontaneous mental events. Landing on me.

Of course, *idiot.*

He glares at me. *I did not ask you to join, Ty.*

*Funny, who did then,* I reply. My brother sends confusion through our bond.  
  
“Some humans are escaping quite well. We should enhance the muscle contractions!” a kid somewhere behind me yells, mumbling agreement, following throughout the room.

My brother deliberately does not look my way this time. I smirk, hiding a yawn.

Which he immediately spots, jerk.

*‘Again, you should go to sleep. You haven’t in how many days? I understand that your team wants to report first, given that you* didn’t *in the last two weeks.’* Another glare.

*‘Shut up, Mr.* Caloway.’

I can feel Sam’s mental swat before he replies out loud to the kid.     
“This is not working well enough. In case you missed it earlier, 16 deaths!” My brother glares at everyone, but me, I think. When did I close my eyes again?

*‘There was a dream block*.’ I send down the line.

My brother outright stares at me now, ‘*no, there wasn’t Tyler.’*

Confused, I return the stare as someone brushes past me, making my sleep-deprived body stumble into a random guy to the right.

“Sorry”, I mumble, though the guy doesn’t reply. Why am I so tired? I was fine before the meeting started. I can barely keep my eyes open now.

What did the guy behind me say now? Crap.",8
1lc5hw5,mxyufpi,"*‘You good, Tyty? Need me to escort you out?’*              
 Ahhh, my lovely partner. I look up, trying to locate him, but somehow failing. What the heck?

“I thought your brother's team was working on that already, Sir.”

The muscle responsible for stringing coherent words together screeches to a halt at the irritating voice of my ex-partner.       
I open my eyes again to everyone now staring at me. Yeah, definitely should have skipped this meeting.

“As you can see, the man is working, even now, Brek, better offer constructive feedback or I’ll send you back to toddler dreams That sounded like the same guy who just spoke. Wait. I mentally slap myself. The heck, how did I not recognize my cousin just now?

*Stop that, Tyler!’*          
Where is my partner?             
*‘Please don’t punish the kids for a brainless idiot like that.’*  
 He directs that one to my brother.  
*‘Ty, your face is white.’* I can feel him somewhere close to me. My brain, though, is not capable of tracking him. Scary.

What do you expect when I corrected five humans today? I shake my head.  
Wait, did I send that out loud? ‘T*ell me I sent that!’*

*‘Sshhhhhh, I'm coming, love’*

I shake my head *– ‘wait, what did you say? I only understood ‘shhhhhhh’.’*

Worry rings through me at that, stemming from several bonds.

Someone’s talking again.

“Just because he’s your baby brother, does not mean you can punish me for breaking up with him.” An irritated groan sounds through the room.

Note to self: dating in the same company as my brother and ex-partner can be straining.

“Can we kick him out, please?” Gil’s been wanting to do that forever.

My brother shakes his head in my direction before calling for an order and reminding my Ex of his previous labor-related misdeeds. Not like I’m capable of berating him now.

A hand on my shoulder, *He’s* now standing directly behind me. My brain's not working; I should have felt him move.

*‘I’m not trying to stress you out, babe. I’d just rather see you in bed right now until I can come to cuddle you later. I haven’t seen you in two weeks.’*

*‘He hasn’t slept during that either.’* My brother chimes in.

I give Sam the pleasure of returning the mental swat; he side steps by shifting his head to the left. How mean.

*‘How many times did you fall today, Tyler?’*  My partner sounds worried.",7
1lc5hw5,mxyuktt,"‘Gosh,’ I’m so tired *‘I can’t even discern which one of the overprotective hens said that.’*

*Tyler!!*  
Ah, ups, guess I sent that one to both.

Thankfully, one of my team members, Maya, interrupts before the uncomfortable conversation can continue. It's time for my head to relax.

 “Well, technically, the falling is not the reason for the heart attacks.”

The head physician next to my brother gives her a full-on glare. My brother looks interested, though.

 Blanching, she goes on. “Still, the frequency of the falls is rising; this week's count is at 567.”

The hand on my shoulder tightens, I sigh. My eyes are more closed then open now.

*‘Ty?’*

“At least, something you’ve been doing is working. There was no death on your team's shift.” Samuel glares at my ex again.

There is a pull inside me as Derek takes over the conversation.

*‘Tyler!’*

*‘I feel’* heavy. I try to reply

“We’ve been training humans to direct their dreams, Mr Caloway's.” He glares at my ex, too. My mind blanks shortly, “… him and our other two riders have taken most of the cases successfully, if I might add.”              
  
*‘You feel what?’*           
I blink, that’s my cousin now.

The idiot life-phase to my right scoffs.

*‘So heavy.’*

An arm wraps around my side. I can smell him now.

“If he’s so great at that, I don’t see a reason for the complaint, *Sir*. Your father agreed to the bet: either he improves, or I leave."" he points at me. The room erupts in anger.

The arm tightens.

Without understanding the surrounding sounds, my eyes slip close again. Ah crap.",6
1lc5hw5,mxyuq3b,"*‘TYLER!!’*

*‘I feel so…’*

As I fall backward, a body lines up on my back, taking the full weight. Something soft brushes against my head. Worry races through several bonds.

The next thing I see is a cloud in the sky rushing past me. No, wait; I’m the one rushing.

The molasses of my head turns that thought around my brain until it settles.

Great. I roll my eyes again. Where is the human?

A scream to the left.

Ah, there. My muscles are screaming as I fly over.

I placed my hands on her body in a practiced manner to guide her through the process of waking up – no energy to teach right now.

That’s when she started fighting.

What the heck? Did she just *bite* me?! Ah crap, he’s going to see that on my body now.

Before I can release myself from her grip, we slam into the sphere, ouch.

Opening my eyes again. I am falling past a forest this time.

*‘Ty..r!’*

The following extract fails again. What's with people fighting today?  
How did the dude envision a knife in the first place?  
Jumping out of the way, the dream shatters.

Only for me to drop again. A beach this time, the waters coming closer.

Transfixed, I stare at it. There's something wrong here. I try to shake my thoughts into order.

Did someone pull me into a loop?

Falling faster now, where is the human? Looking around, I don’t spot anyone.

Aww, why? I whine inside my head. Luckily, no one can hear my sleep-deprived whines.

*‘TY…ER!!’*

Oops, maybe he can.

Trying to reorient myself again, maybe the humans above me, I slam into the sphere. Again, and again afterwards.

Can’t track. Noise. Too loud. Why is he—? Falling again. Not again…",6
1lc5hw5,mxyuqsy,"*‘TYLER!!!’*  
 There is a pull on my body.

My head hurts, I wanna sleep. My stomach's rumbling now. Can I even throw up inside a dream?

A body slams into mine. I open my eyes. A little boy stares at me. “Are you okay, sir?”  
Great. Now I’ve scared a human child. I sigh.

“Yeah, don’t worry, kiddo.  You did really well right now, darling. Just close your eyes.”  
 I try my nicest smile.

Before doing so, he grins, small mercies, I guess.

With a bit of leftover energy, I directly wake him up. If he cries now, his parents can handle that.

Before I can crash again, arms wrap around my body. I lean backwards as everything turns dark.

The next time I open my eyes, I’m in our bed.

He’s already watching me.

“You got lucky, it’s just a severe concussion, love. Your team was not in a dream block. Someone messed with your technical devices.”

He brushes his hand over my cheek. I swallow as he draws me closer.

“Who?”

“Your father already fired everyone, your *Ex* will go to jail this time.” His voice is controlled.  
“You don’t have to be strong for me right now,” I whisper, laying my head against his chest.

“We’ll talk when you're better, love. I love you.” He whispers into my ear before kissing my cheek.

I fall asleep again.

1lcd34t,mxznl6y,"The park was empty except for the crows and fog. She arrived first, hands in her pockets, eyes scanning for snipers. She saw Max step from behind a ruined statue, his coat dark with rain.

He looked thinner than she remembered from the grainy photos. Older, too. He carried nothing but a folder.

They stopped ten paces apart.

“You came,” he said.

“I’m curious,” she replied. “That’s all.”

He smiled, tired. “Curiosity is a start.”

She glanced at the folder. “What’s that?”

“Proof,” he said. “Your side is preparing a chemical strike. Civilian targets. They want to end it, whatever the cost.”

Her jaw tightened. “You expect me to believe that?”

He opened the folder, showed her photos, orders, signatures. She recognized a name. Her own commander.

She reached into her coat, pulled out a flash drive. “Your side’s planning a false flag. They’ll blame us, justify a full invasion. I have the recordings.”

He nodded. “So it’s true. We’re both expendable.”

They stood in silence, the war grinding on in the distance.

“What do we do?” She said.

He looked at her, his eyes hollow. “We stop them.”

She almost laughed. “How?”

“We leak everything. Both sides.”

She hesitated. “We’ll be hunted.”

“We’re already hunted,” he said. “At least this way, it means something.”

She looked at him, searching for a lie. She saw only exhaustion. And hope.

She took a step forward. “All right. We do it together.”

He held out his hand. She stared at it, then at his face. Slowly, she took it.

The handshake was awkward, then firm. For a moment, the world was quiet.

Sirens wailed in the distance. They let go.

“Now or never,” he said. “I’ll cover you.”

She nodded. “Never took you for a hero.”

""Don't get your hopes up,"" he shoved her towards the waiting car. ""Go.""

She slid behind the wheel, heart pounding. As she sped away, Max fired behind her, buying precious seconds.

She didn’t look back.

She drove until the city fell away, until she could breathe again. Then, with trembling hands, she dialed her first contact.

“Wall Street Journal, this is William.”

She forced her voice steady.   
  
“Got a tip for you.”",14
1lcd34t,my09rf2,"I truly believed in my side. Patriotism motivated me to join our Intelligence Service. I did not think there could be a higher calling. They taught me how to lie, hide, and kill, and made me into a loyal, obedient weapon. I killed who they told me to kill, and I stole what they told me to steal.

But Isaw through all those years of propaganda and brainwashing. The thing I imagined, the thing to which I was truly loyal, did not exist. It was an idealization, a sort of hero worship for people whom I realized were so far from heroism as to be a comedic farce. Direct experience, direct information of how they behaved when they thought none were looking.

Disillusioned, I considered my options. I would not be allowed to retire, my services would be demanded. If they even had an inkling at how deep my cynicism had grown, I would likely have been killed in one of their fits of paranoia. I could disappear, but I would live in fear of being found to the end of my days. No, there was only one real choice. I would work for the other side, and make sure that they won. However loaded with hypocrisy, I could not imagine them being worse than the devils I knew.

I took risks to establish contact, but eventually I made it. Tacit meetings and cold drops, building trust. Finding more secrets to give them, things they almost certainly could not get anywhere else. Until, one day, a thing fell into my lap. A gathering of my side's leadership, an opportunity for a decapitation strike that would end the war.

I requested a meeting with the other side's top covert assets. People with clout, people whose opinions would have weight. It was scheduled, and I counted each hour nervously. It could be a trap, I could be about to be abducted and tortured to death. I stowed my nerves and headed to the site.

I sat down at a table in a park. There were people circulating through it, none obviously suspicious. I waited with my hands in my pockets, until a woman sat down across from me. ""I understand you had a gift for my sister?"" she said. I swallow my doubts, and take a leap of faith. From my pocket, I pull the trove of intelligence, copious notes and copies of schedules.

I don't know how to phrase what I must say in any code or subtext, ""I want to be protected in what follows. I have family I want out of the country when this goes through.""

""We take care of our own, but I must ask again about the gift, my sister looks forward to it greatly.""

With a shaking hand, I passed it to her. I offered my hand, and she shook it. It is surreal, This is the kind of intelligence that wins wars. Millions of people are dead, and it all effectively ends with some people in a park.

I go through the days, preparing myself as best I can. I continue doing what is expected of me, hiding that I know something significant is coming. It arrives as simple chaos. No one else around me knows, it is simply news of an attack. Only I know what has actually happened. 85% of the top leadership should be dead or captured.

The extraction team arrives five hours later. I am on my way out of the country as the old regime's flailing death throes begin.",7
1lbut98,mxvmjye,"I am a side-character.  
I am in a world full of anime protagonists, filled with auxiliary characters, and love interests, and rivals.  
I alone, am a side-character.  
I thought this meant that I could live a quiet life, after all, side-characters are barely the focus in a story, and give little to nothing to the narrative.  
I was wrong.  
Instead of leisurely finishing university, and doing a soul-killing 9-5 job, I am the most sought after commodity on the planet.  
ALL protagonists are trying to get me.

  
""So, I am a Harem protagonist.  
If you become the side-character of my story, I am sure one of the chicks I don't really like will bounce over to your side."" he winks at me.  
""Don't listen to him!   
I am a Magical Prodigy protagonist!  
Join my story, and I will ensure that you will awaken magic by the time I become an archmage!"" a young woman says.  
""No! I am an epic-saga protagonist!  
The world is in danger, and if you join my story, I am sure it will be easier to protect it!"" another chimes in.  
These 3 almost fight over me, before being kicked out by the librarian.  
""Thank you."" I whisper, and she nods, and leaves, but not before I see her blush.  
Damn Harem protagonist...

  
Day in, day out, I am approached by them.  
Some of them even broke into my apartment, trying to entice me, blackmail me.  
Thankfully, if I don't voluntarily go and become their side-character, they can't force me.  
Why do they want me so much?  
Well, the books say that while a side-character isn't that important...  
They always have a role in the story.  
Whether to further the plot, to aid the main character at a decisive moment, or simply to allow the protagonist to shine brighter.  
Overall...  
I am like a buff to them.  
I hate it.

  
I watch the young woman smirk.  
""So? What do you say?  
I allow you to become my main husband.  
What better side-character role is there, than to be the spouse of the protagonist?!"" she beams.  
I ignore her.  
The librarian is making out with the Harem protagonist, so I can't depend on her to save me.  
She continues pestering me, and I snap.  
""Can't you leave me alone? All of you?  
What if I don't want to be the side-character of any of you?!"" I say, and the world quakes.  
A storm is brewing, and all the protagonists I see cough up blood.  
Damn.  
The hell did I do?",129
1lbut98,mxzf524,"I'm not sure what the kid wants yet, though even before I cut power to the water hammer I already have a decent idea of who they are. Most folks around here are black haired and dark eyed, with the sort of clothes and face that just sort of... blur out if they're far enough away from you. Normal folks doing normal stuff. Wake at a normal hour in a normal bed, work a normal day, eat a normal dinner, take a normal bath, and then have normal dreams. 

Folks with hot pink hair don't do normal, or at least not the same normal as the great masses. This is a protagonist. Not *the* protagonist; haven't met them yet. Just *a* protagonist. A person with some manner of destiny, or goal. Lots of chosen ones (still weird having to pluralize ""one"", but that's the world we're in), but also a lot of folks who just want to be the best at something. But this is definitely a chosen one; I can tell by the fact that she's looking at me like I owe her something, and she's not holding a number. 

As for me, I fall somewhere in between. Grey haired, gray eyed. Came from a different Earth like most of the protagonists, but without a set endgame. Not mundane, but not empowered for greatness either. The 52nd best weaponsmith on the planet, though more or less entirely by virtue on having a 21st century knowledge of arms and weapon making history. I've got enough magic to make magic weapons, but because I sat down with the books and studied. But people seem to be able to smell the fact that I'm not part of some grander plan, and think it's a great idea to get me to help with theirs. 

No offense to the heroes of the world, but if my options are to help a hundred protagonists by making them an electric sword or a singing spear or to die face down in the mud so some young kid I was teaching can learn a valuable lesson about something, I'll stay in my shop. 

""Listen kid, if you want to do business, you need to go to the desk, take a number, and go over the rules with Makoto."" I say, taking the protective earmuff off one ear so I can hear their response. Ironically, Makoto herself is a protagonist; she's the 10th so far who has manned the receptionist desk on her way to some plot about being the best merchant in the land or something. Good kids, for the most part. I miss them when they go, but hey, that's the price of employing folks with a destiny. 

""Didn't you hear me?! I said the world is at stake!"" She yells, flailing her arms about and bouncing in place. Like most of these protagonists, her outfit looks more a matter of fashion than protection, but that's not really as much of a handicap out here; an arrow or a spear hitting a bare midriff seems to be about as common as winning the lottery was back home. 

""If you had taken a number and made a proper appointment, I could have met you when I wasn't operating obnoxiously loud power equipment. So no, I didn't hear you, it's not your turn to be heard, and your world-threatening peril needs to wait until I assist with the world-threatening peril of the 12 people in line ahead of you."" I say, pointing to the door that leads back to the reception area. ""Makoto can get you started on all the paperwork...""

The door to the reception area is wide open. I had that door magically enchanted by a one of my other customers as payment for a +2 vorpal sword so the sound of the work area wouldn't bother Makoto or the clients while at her desk; even in a completely different room, this gear gets loud enough to cause harm with sustained exposure. With the door open, *anyone* in the building should have heard the hammer as loud as an alarm siren, and I almost never use that door during work hours.

""Um, I don't have time for that..."" She says, putting herself between me and the door, a look on her face that speaks less of annoyance, and more of fear. ""I have an urgent quest, and I need your help to see it through! You have to join my party! It's the fate of the world!""

""And if you had talked to Makoto, she would have told you that I don't do quests. But you're here now. Let me set this gear on standby before we talk."" I say. She seems to relax a bit. Stay calm. Don't overreact. Verify first. I make a show of returning my work piece to the fire and heading over to a set of controls, fiddling with the gas flow to the fire before hitting the button that turns on the intercom. Well, that should be 'intercom'; the technology on this world hasn't gotten to that point yet, so I had another customer build a magical equivalent as payment for a tomahawk that automatically teleports to the thrower's hand after impact. 

""Well, it's about time."" She says, relaxing a bit and going into her sales pitch. I give her a few 'yeahs' and 'oh reallys' as a push the buttons on the intercom, occasionally fiddling with the gas flow with my other hand to make it look like I'm doing something work related. Somewhere between her prattling about the Dark Litch of Wherever and the brave warriors of the Who The Fuck Cares Guild who are going to foil his evil scheme, I catch a sound through the speaker, turned down low enough that the protagonist can't hear it. But I can. Once you get to know it, the sound of someone wanting to scream their head off but only being able to manage a whimper is pretty distinctive. 

Stay calm. Breathe.

""So, *now* will you stop messing around and help me?"" She asks. 

""Yeah, kiddo, I'll give you exactly what you need. Just let me turn the gas off and we can get going to meet the rest of the party. Do me a favor?"" I ask, killing the fuel and airflow to the forge and moving over to the coat rack.

""Sure."" She says, smiling.

""Pop your head out into the office and let Makoto know I'm stepping out for a bit."" 

""Um... yeah! Sure. Will do!"" She says. The moment of initial confusion isn't the sort of evidence that will hold up in court, but it's close enough for me. She turns and heads towards the open door as I reach inside one of the coats on the rack

Sometimes, folks who come to this world bring things with them. Computers, cell phones, stuff like that. I didn't receive the blessing of a goddess, or the lineage of a dead king, or anything like that. But I did get something familiar. Something special.

Spears and arrows avoid a bare midriff. 

Bullets from a 45 caliber pistol don't show the same courtesy. 

Mid stride, her legs stop working with all the grace and dignity of a puppet with it's strings cut as the first round severs her spine. By the time she lands on her knees and starts sprawling forward, rounds two and three slam higher into her back, left exposed by her very fashionable halter top plate mail. 

The blood is flowing generously from all entrance and exit wounds when I close the distance. This is the part where a villain would start gloating, or bragging, or otherwise give the hero a chance to do something productive. 'There's no way they could survive that', they say. 

I am not a villain. 

Rounds four, five, six, seven and eight go into the back of her head, and after the slide locks back I run out of the workshop and into the reception area.

Before I can even round the corner I see the pool of blood flowing out from under the desk. When I see her, she barely lifts her head, eyes unfocused. The dagger is still stuck in her chest, blood seeping slowly around it. Her lung is punctured, air being sucked in a second wound between her ribs every time she tries to breath. A third wound, in her abdomen, is bleeding fast, blood as black as death. 

Back home, she'd be as good as dead. I'd call an ambulance, get a ride to a hospital, sit in the waiting room for 8 hours to be told ""sorry, we did everything we could"", and then I would get to just live with knowing I had failed someone. 

Here? I scoop her up, take 5 steps, kick my own door open and step outside.

""**MEDIC!! I NEED A MEDIC HERE!!**"" I scream at the top of my lungs, gambling that anyone from my world would recognize those words. Ten seconds later, I've got a blue haired girl dressed like a shinto priestess telling me to set her down while she starts waving a magic stick around. Twenty seconds, and Makoto is surrounded with green energy. Thirty seconds, and the only damage left is to her clothes. 

The priestess helps me bring her inside and help her into bed. Her name is Yukio, and her presence is not a coincidence. 

She explains the situation while helping me clean up. She doesn't look much older than 17, but clearly is unfazed by the blood; probably an actual doctor or nurse back on Earth. Partway through the backstory, she stops over the pink-haired protagonists corpse.

""Um... sir? Do you know her name?"" She asks. ""Final rites generally work better if we say the deceased name.""

""No idea. Normally I get that information from the paperwork. Do what you can, I'll go wring out the mop.""",18

MC evolved into that one Xianxia character who's so strong they make everyone else at the sect competition cough blood or something lmfao.

Neat story. Thank you for writing.",61
1lbut98,mxwuji8,"I believe whats happening here is that all MCs needs a side character, not for them to appear much better, more impressive or aura farming, but rather character development. 

A MC with a believable side character who will develop along-side them makes them believable, because without a side character, they are basically walking echo chambers of their own making. And doomed to be deemed as boring or irrelevant with little character growth/development by the audience which would lead them to be ignored and die due to a lack of recognition.",35
1lbut98,mxwptx4,"More please! I’d love for the side character to explore a few different protagonist quests. Like if he learns a bit of magic, then uses some weird magic while helping a martial arts protagonist. Or what if he learns a bit of Kung-Fu, and then helps a protagonist in a romance/comedy situation? Things could get interesting.",5
1lbut98,mxwwfbw,"Yep.  
  
Is a Main Character, a main character because they are named MCs, or because they stand out amongst the masses, and bear a different destiny?

And if the masses are all NPC, no side-characters, but real NPCs, with no value add to the story...how good of a MC can one become?  
How hard would it be to stand out, if everyone is the averagest of the averages? 

Also: side-characters can share a bit of the burden of the MCs, and also help them, as you said.

A story with only MCs can become boring fast, with no real progression, because you can't compare 2 MCs that easily, but a MC and a side-character?  
That's doable.",18
1lbut98,my528qb,"More or less yes, though less ""hero becomes demon king"" and more ""teenager gets recruited and radicalized by supernatural being, is told that they need to stop at nothing to prevent mass civilian casualties, and starts treating any obstruction as a problem that can be solved with justified violence""...though from Makoto's perspective, there isn't much of a practical difference.

And yes, the priestess is definitely getting a rush job for her help.",6
1lbut98,mxxa9l0,"Yep.

Less than npc's to be honest.

They are more like quests for Sun jinwoo to get ahead, or to show that he has emotions (i.e. sister, mother, Cha), but they don't seem as their own characters.

And yes, I read the novel, and the manhwa, and play the game. 
And the whole thing is an MC is badass story.",5
1lc5rlx,mxzyjtl,"Romantasy conventions have become the bane of my existence. Vampires love to walk among adoring fans willing to throw themselves at the vile creatures with thoughts of a torrid love affair with the undead. In reality, vampires were barely above rabid animals, their bloodlust uncontrollable.

Also, convention entry fees were ridiculous. $250 for the VIP package to go to some costume ball with finger foods and gaudy costumes. But I go where the prey is. It was easy for them; they could just mesmerize some poor victim into buying them a con badge. And it's not like I can file these expenses on my taxes at the end of the year.

I can't even bring weapons into these things because of security, so I had to try and find something once I made it in. Unfortunately, these conventions were usually filled with plastic swords, foam garlic, and tap water being sold as holy. Needless to say, I was going to get creative. Maybe I could break a chair and use a broken leg as a wooden stake.

My current prey was masquerading as some outcast vampire prince in the latest Booktok darling series. Tall, dark, brooding. Gen Z Dracula. You get the picture. He had eluded me at the last two conventions. He would always point me out to his adoring victims and they would swarm me while he made his escape.

The latest convention finally gave me an unexpected advantage. The costume ball was masquerade themed, which means I get to disappear into the crowd with a mask without a second glance from others in the crowd.

He was easy to spot. They always were at these things. Perfectly tailored clothes, hair that had that messy look down to an art form, a smile of perfectly white teeth with canines just long enough to let the adoring masses know who he was.

He currently had a woman hanging off his arm that was dressed as the heroine of the story. The human dying of an incurable disease that the vampire of the story falls in love with and turns to save her. I could see the glamor in her eyes. She was hooked and hooked hard. I would have to be careful with her.

I had managed to find a vendor earlier that was selling real wooden stakes. I had bought five and concealed them within my costume for the night. I slipped one into my palm as I slowly made my way around the ballroom, moving closer and closer to the vampire.

Suddenly, his head jerked almost imperceptibly. His smile never left his face, but I could see his body tense ever so slightly. He knew I was here. He might not know exactly where, but he knew.

A woman stepped in front of me. She was dressed as the heroine's best friend. Her mask couldn't hide the anger in her eyes.

""How dare you show yourself here!"" She angrily whispered as she grabbed my wrist. ""You can't stop him. Blaise hasn't turned Lunaria yet.""

I tried to pull away from her grip, but she just held on tighter. ""Lunaria is just a character in a book, you dolt!"" I angrily whispered back. ""But I assure you, that vampire is very real and will kill your friend.""

I frantically looked around. This woman had distracted me enough that the vampire was gone. And so was the woman hanging off his arm.

I finally jerked my arm free and began to quickly move through the crowd. All pretense of stealth now gone. I couldn't let this vampire take another victim.

""You can't stop destiny!"" the woman called as I left her behind. ""Their fate is written in the stars!""

""It's just a book!"" I called back to her as I left the ballroom in search of my prey.",11
1lcf2rf,my0rolm,"Seriously.  
I have the power to absorb any type of energy, and redirect it.  
Couldn't I have gotten this power in the 30s?  
It makes me nigh-immortal due to the energy being able to somewhat heal, and fuel my cellular activity.  
I totally could be still alive today, even if I was alive 100 years ago.  
But no.  
I had to be born after Dragon Ball was created, with a fear of heights.  
So instead of using my power actively, I literally am a human shield.  
Like for example now, I am walking towards a bank, being hit by a dozen or so powers, and various bullets, while the ""heroes"" behind me, are ready to strike the villains.

  
After we deal with the situation, I fly away at a low altitude, because of course I am afraid of heights.  
And I release the power I absorbed into the skies.  
Why not release it into portable batteries, or gathering stations?  
Because the idiots still don't want to build them for me!  
Even though they themselves told me that I could gather enough energy during one of these fights, to supply roughly 100 thousand houses for an entire month with electricity!  
I would become a human battery, but frankly, that is better than being a human shield!  
At least I would ease the lives of millions at some point!  
Alas...  
I am not fated for it.

  
""Captain Shield, come, the villains are attacking a city.  
Roughly 80 of them, all with variations of beams, or super-strength."" dispatch tells me.  
I say a ""Roger that"", and fly away.  
I hate it.  
As I arrive, the heroes actually gather around me.  
It should feel nice, but I don't get a ""Hello"", a ""Good to see you"", no.  
All I get is: ""Start walking, Shield, we need to suppress them!"".  
I mumble a bit, but still do as told.  
The villains have to be contained, and I am the best, as I redirect their attack...inside of me, so infrastructure damage due to strays doesn't happen.

  
I get home after being beaten up by like 50-60 villains.  
Not that I got bruised, or hurt, but still.  
""Meow!"" I hear, Hades, and Nyx meow.  
""Come to dad!"" I laugh, picking up my two cats.  
They purr and are genuinely happy to see me.  
I give them some food, and fresh water, and after I took a shower, they join me on the couch, as we watch some movies.  
It is a bit sad, that these 2 cats are the only ones who appreciate me, but what can I do?  
Me ma, and pa raised me so I help people.  
I can't really go the villain route, can I now?",5
1lbylmt,mxwljs1,"""To train with the sword, first master sweeping. When you have mastered sweeping, you must master Speech, Craft, and Writing.When you have mastered all these things you must master building a house. Once your house is built, you have no further need for a sword, since it is a useless instrument."" 

Clay read slowly with remarkable effort. The embroidery picture was one of three, hanging neatly above the mantlepiece. The other ones read “Live, laugh, love” and “Home, sweet home,” stitched in cheerful, flowing script.

“I get the other ones,” Clay muttered, “but wouldn’t a sword be useful even if you have a house?” He tilted his head, still staring at the embroidery. “For example, to fend off bandits, I’d suggest.”

The homeowner didn’t reply. Clay hadn’t expected him to—he’d slain the man only minutes earlier, cought off guard while robbing those mans home.

""I know another good one"" Clay happily blabberd. ""Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life.""

Then he began to set a fire to cover his tracks.",50
1lbt17q,mxv9phx,"""What now?"" I ask, offering him a glass of whiskey.  
""You heard me, mate.  
I want you to be the best man at my wedding."" he says, sipping the drink.  
I sigh.  
""I knew you were an optimistic fool, who sees the best in everyone, but newsflash ""mate"".  
I am a villain, and you are my archenemy!"" I say.  
He laughs.  
""I know! That's why I want to invite you!"" he says.  
I sigh.

  
""No, for real, why?"" I ask.  
I was a person who hated the current leadership, and have tried multiple times to overthrow it, or destroy it.  
Never have I hurt a civilian, or infrastructure true, because my power is overwhelming enough to strike directly at the pigs that think nothing of the rest of us.  
While he...  
He would protect his own killer, if he could.  
""Because we have been at it for 2 years, and we fought daily.  
You are like my best friend, and enemy, and the person who knows me best."" he smiles.  
Oh boy.  
This kid...

  
""You have no one else to ask, do you?"" I ask.  
He blushes.  
I sigh.  
""Fine. What is the theme? When and where is it?  
And who is your bride?"" I ask.  
""Thank you! Thank you!  
A basic 3-piece suit is all good! It is at the Church on 13th Avenue!  
My wife? She's Flower Witch!"" he chirps.  
I freeze.

  
""Flower Witch? The Heroine who singlehandedly revitalized a wasteland?  
Whom fought for the protection of flora, and succeeded?  
The girl who managed to solve hunger?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
""I am lucky, aren't I?"" he laughs.  
From what I know, he is an orphan, raised by the Association to be a Hero after awakening Sun related powers...  
Yep.  
Him and her seem like a good combination, but I hope it's not a political move from her family, because if I remember correctly, she's of quite the background.  
""I will be there. Now leave, before I attack you."" I say, but he just chuckles, finishes the drink, and leaves, calling me ""best-man."".  
I ignore him, and start calling some of my informants, asking them to look out after any weird movement from the Flower Witch's family.  
I might be his enemy, but that's because of different principles, I really don't want him to have a scheme marriage, just because he is an overpowered individual...",150
1lbt17q,mxvfr2t,"""What, why?"" I asked. 


""It's ok - it's a private ceremony, using non-hero identities. I know you know my real identity, and if you didn't know I knew yours, well, now you do - Gerald.""


I raised an eyebrow. ""What makes you think I know you're secret identity? I'd definitely have taken you out in your sleep if I had that information.""


""Yeah, you've got to say that. But I'm not stupid. I can see what you're doing. Me and you, we fight. We destroy a lot of property, but somehow the Dark Phantom never does more damage than Gerald Price the trust fund baby can generously repair as a service to the city. You only ever ""risk"" civilians when I'm conveniently nearby to foil your evil plans. And a suspiciously large number of even those were trained stuntmen who just happened to be visiting for no reason they cared to mention, and happened to retire rich out of nowhere after.


""All the other villains are terrified of you. So they mostly stay away. A few get bold and try to butt in on occasion, but no villain could allow another to trespass on his turf, so you deal with them swiftly, if I don't get to them first. 


""So it's just me and you. Duking it out every couple weeks. Never quite taking advantage of each other's weaknesses. Injuries well within our respective tolerances. Always putting on a show. The giant moon laser was a nice touch - but don't think I didn't catch that you embellized from it to fund a children's hospital. Big impressive schemes that fail at the last second, or succeed but don't actually hurt much. And everyone else stays away. Best partner I've never had. So what do you say?""


I sighed. ""Alright James, you got me. Two conditions though. I'm gonna kidnap myself next Tuesday. It'd be suspicious if the Dark Phantom never went after Gerald. I need you to help with the illusion by rescuing me from myself. Standard fight, I bring out that rock you pretend to be allergic to, you go all weak, but conveniently escape it at the last second, I run down a hole, etc etc, then you rescue me from the underground cell. Also, the kids at that children's hospital would really appreciate a visit from Captain Awesome - would you mind dropping by?""


""Wait,"" James asked, ""you knew I was pretending with the pyrite?"" 


""Obviously, I'm not stupid either. What kind of hero is allergic to a rock? Come on."" I stuck out my hand. ""So do we have a deal?"" 


James grasped my hand and shook it. ""Deal. Also, Captain Awesome is a stupid name, so at some point he should lose a fight to you and retire. Raise your notoriety even further. Then you can help me come up with something less stupid for the next hero identity.""


""I mean, the Dark Phantom isn't much better. But done - we'll work it out.""",105
1lbt17q,mxvjjl8,"It was a slow day. I was in-costume in my secret base, lounging in my favorite chair. The costume was new - so even though I had no official business, I still wore it to break it in. And who should sneak up on my secret base than the hero? He was in-costume as well, and right in my camera's line of sight. What is that fool thinking now?   
  
""It's my day off. Get out of here,"" I said into my microphone. He jumped, at first startled. Then saw the camera. He gave it a thums-up, then immediately charged into my base. I groaned. I couldn't be bothered that day, soI let him bypass my security systems without incident. Once he found me, we fought, as was customary between us. It was clear neither of us were actually feeling it, though. We both stopped it in a draw, over as soon as it began.   
  
""I told you to go away,"" I said coldly. 

""I'm here on business, actually. Serious . . . serious business."" 

""All the more reason -""

""Just hear me out, please."" 

""Fine."" I sighed. ""But I can't take you seriously in that stupid costume, nor can you take me seriously, either. Let's both take them off. I'll get us something to drink, too. What do you fancy?"" 

""Er . . . I dunno? A mimosa, I guess."" 

""I should have the stuff for that. Hold on."" A few minutes later, and I set up a table in my secret base with some snacks and drinks, and both of us were in our normal civilian attire. He leaned forward in his chair. 

""I came here because I had to tell you something."" 

""Yes, you said serious business. Did someone die?"" 

""What? No!"" Silence passed between us. 

""In that case, I'm confused,"" I said. 

""I came here . . . to give you this."" He blushed and handed me a . . . wedding invitation?

""What's this?"" 

""I think you know."" 

""I just wanted you to say it."" I looked down at the table. ""You know I'll have to decline."" 

""But you're not just any old guest! I want you to be my maid of honor! Or is it best woman?"" 

""Best woman, I think. And in that case, I have to decline even more so."" 

He looked like a wounded puppy at my declaration, and hung his head.

""Look, it's not personal. There will simply be too many questions. People will think you've gone mad, or that I'm blackmailing you somehow."" 

""But I can't have a wedding without you!"" 

""I'm flattered, but what did you tell your future husband?""",43
1lbt17q,mxvlion,"***Good afternoon, citizens of Pleasantville! We come to you live from Churchway Hall, where the beloved hero Musclebro is having his wedding with assistant librarian Sarah. In a twist of fate, Musclebro has invited his longtime enemy Dr Dimension as his best man. We tune in now for the speech.***

...Yum, this is pretty good. Could you pass the salt, Ladybrand? Oh, it’s time? I was in the middle of- ok, whatever. *Ahem*!

Greetings, puny humans. And Venusian. Yes, I know you’re an alien, Man-Human. Doxxed, HAHA! Anyway, it’s monolog- er, speech time. I’m the best man , everyone has to shut up and finally listen to me speak. Put down your drinks, I’m talking. Seriously.

I WILL TELEPORT A SHIT INTO THE PUNCH BOWL. Now, if anyone interrupts again I’ll de-alcohol the champagne, and necromatize the chicken nuggets. *Ahe-hem.*

I knew uh, what’s the name again? Whatever. I knew Musclebro since he was just a sidekick. At thirty-three! Haha, I was like, ""Never seen a sidekick with a 'stache before!"" and he was like ""You live with your mother."" I do NOT live with my mum! I am born of an eldritch goddess from beyond the veil of your consciousness, and I just HAPPEN to have an idol representation of her in my evil lair, which is used in diabolical rituals and curses beyond your very imagination! And communes with it every Thursday or she'll get worried. Wait, this isn't about me, how dare you, Musclebro?! I'll kill you... not today.

Aaanyway. His hero got caught in my death laser ray project and got buzzaped. So then I decided to let the sorry sack go and- oh, don't look at me like that, I had twenty magi-ninjabots waiting to go if you so much as tickled me. And I'm telling the story, sit down, groom.

Where was I? Ah yes. I let Musclebro drag his pathetic, squirming, tight, sweaty biceps out of there, and next thing I know, I'm a Nemesis! Talk about a career jump. And I know however many two-bit villains you put away, or how many bodybuilding competitions your oh so defined, chiseled, bulging... body... uh, wins, you can never forget the one who gave you your tragic backstory. So really, I gave Pleasantville Musclebro. Three cheers to me: The Techno-Mage of The Great Beyond! Hip hip... hm. Tough crowd today, huh?

What else... oh! Anecdotes! Librarian woman, you'll want to hear this. Hey, Musclebro, remember that time we fought all the way to the 5th dimension, and got stuck, and had to cuddle for warmth while-

***The live broadcast of Musclebro's wedding was cut due to the inappropriate nature of the speech. We apologize for the inconvenience.***",29
1lbt17q,mxvjk83,"""That, uhhh. Well."" He averted his gaze and scratched the back of his head. I could picture him blushing under his mask. ""That you're an old friend?"" 

""You're lying."" 

""Okay, *fine*. I haven't figured out what to say yet."" He crossed his arms. ""It's just. I had to pretend you were dead so he wouldn't ask why he couldn't meet you. What am I supposed to say now?"" 

""That's exactly my point. You don't have to say anything if I'm not there. And he's not the only one we'd have to worry about."" 

""Maybe you could pretend to be someone else. You're always been so good at lying."" 

""I'm not good at lying. You're just unbelievably gullible."" 

""You don't get to be where you are, though, without -"" 

""Lying?"" I raised my eyebrows. ""Are you sure about that one?"" 

""Er . . . well, yes?"" 

""Getting people to fear me is easy with such devastating and chaotic power. Getting people to respect me is a matter of mostly telling the truth. And with me doing so many dealings with so many people, I'll surely be recognized. It's just not doable."" 

""There's got to be a way! I'm not letting you miss this. I . . . I'll only get married once, you know?"" 

""Perhaps, if your fiance doesn't divorce you once he learns how long you've been lying to him. Thanks for that, by the way. Now I have blackmail."" 

""Please . . . please do this for me?"" And there they were. The puppy dog eyes. He could always get me to do exactly what he wanted if he used them. I sighed. 

""I suppose, I could be your best woman, but at some point sneak off and change into my costume and then 'crash' the reception. 'Kidnap' you and your husband. If people recognized me as a civilian, I could claim it was my plan to capture you both for my nefarious schemes. I could have a small celebration whipped up here.""

He leapt up from the chair and hugged me. 

""Thank you. You're the best sister sister ever!"" 

I slowly patted his back. Where would my poor baby brother be without me?",55
1lbt17q,mxvc471,"Imagine the MC being like the grumpy, perfectionist father, who thinks the son could do better.

So a lot of eye rolling, sighing, and sassy remarks, especially if the informants can't clear his suspicions, then he will surely be extremely rude with the Flower Witch's family.

Also, people won't care much about him being there, not everyone will recognize him as a villain, and the Hero will introduce him either as a friend, or a father figure,",19
1lcad0r,mxzhya8,"""Ohhh? The whelps have arrived?"" I ask, in a slightly mocking tone. Looking at the aproximately 100 dragons before me.

""Don't call us whelps human! We are fully grown dragons. The mightiest of beings. Cease your arrogance at once"" one dragon roars. The green scales make it clear to me that is a Veracia variant. 

I put on a mocking grin. ""Ohh a superior being you are? You know. The one hundred brethren of yours I've slaughtered said something similar. So why are you here? Need some help?""

The Dragon sputtered at my perceived insolence. I truly hate these arrogant lizards. ""We are here so you may answer for your crimes murderer."" The Dragon starts. 

""And what may those crimes be? Ohh great superior being?"" I interrupt him. The mockery not fading from my voice.

""The murder of countless dragons of course!"" The dragon roared ""You have killed Lord Vermont the leader of the Verdant Dragon tribe!"".

""Do you know why I killed Vermont?"" I ask of the Dragon calmly. Letting my killing intent flow out of me. Crushing down on the dragon who seems to fight not to flee.

""How should I know the reasoning you lesser races have? It was probably just for the glory of having killed a mighty dragon. Are you proud of having slain such a powerful being with your underhanded tricks?""

""Ha"" I laugh without humor at first, but then something drives me to continue. ""Hahahaha. Is that what you think?"" I point my sword at the dragon speaker. ""Verdant has used magic to induce nightmares and trauma into tens of thousands of people in the city of Jarn. The people went mad and ripped each other apart. It lead to the deaths of 95,643 people and left thousands of traumatised orphans.""

The dragons start muttering. I don't let them. I point my sword at the the group of red dragons to my left. ""Riscia was very proud of her scarlet color. She took baths to keep it always bright. How do you think did she manage that? She bathed in blood. She particularily liked to bath in the blood of children. You are smart, how many children do you think it takes to fill a bath for a 30 meters long dragon?""

The dragons are silent now. I point my sword at the black dragons. They flinch as I do so. ""Heron, Priscalla and Urami were big fans research. Particularily, they liked researching biology. They unleashed a designed plague on the Haven Empire. The plague spread through the entire empire killing 5,643,954 people directly. Furthermore it caused a civil war in the Haven Empire, resulting in its breakup and several wars with the surrounding nations. The total casulties went into the tens of millions, even I not able to track them anymore.""

I lower my sword and instead adress them all. My voice reverberating across the entire area ""This is why I killed your kin. Your tribal leaders. For they were monsters, every single one of them."" I lower my killing intend a bit. ""You however, you are not monsters. Not yet. You are simple whelps. You however have a choice. You may fight me and thus end the Dragons for good."" 

Some look angry at that and want to say something. I supress them with my killing intend. They are just beasts in the end and are thus cowed like beasts. Thus I continue speaking, with more force.

""Or you may accept the errors of your past and become a part of society. Use your perceived superiority for the good of everyone. Don't repeat the errors of your ancestors. Swear an oath of peace now or die to my hand. But know this, I will always be there. Always be watching!""


After this day, the Dragon Slayer has become known under a new title. The Dragon Conquerer.",6
1lc4sh1,mxypae8,"She slumbered. Far beneath the rising countries above, she resided in a domain belonging solely to her. A cavern lined with molten rock, heat choking to those unprepared. The trail was twisting and treacherous, making all but the bravest or foolhardy turn around.

Yet those who passed it would find her home. A pile of treasures, looted from dozens of long dead civilisations. Much was gold, yet gemstones and works of art were included within. The fortunes she held would cripple a country should they be spent poorly, or save uncountable masses if spent wisely. Yet she chose to sleep on it instead, supporting her shockingly small form.

Indeed, the beast of legends was still larger than a human. But she was small enough to only just fill a decent sized room herself. Her purple scales gleamed atop her hoard, amethysts looking to be fallen scales littering around her.

Geleyhru huffed, rising from her dreams. A pale pink eye opened, gazing down at the entrance to her lair. A pair of Elves stared up at her, wearing lightweight white robes sewn with flames. One bowed his head, as the other stayed in the entryway. ""Wise one, I return to enact our pledge.""

The dragon huffed, unmoving as her voice echoed around her. ""Your pledge is foolish, as I have said. Yet I shall not stop you. Take my blood, and use it in your work. Yet I hope it shall fail.""

The Elf raised his head, watching a small vial filled with crimson fly towards him. His hands reached out almost reverently, cradling it to his chest the moment he grasped it. ""I shall not, Great one. You shall not be alone much longer.""

She watched him go, saying nothing to his back. Yet she knew what would come from this. The damage caused, the lives lost. But it was not hers to stop. The fates were cruel in this way. Even if she refused to help, they would find another way. The decision couldn't be stopped.

\-----

It was no visitor that told her of the outcome. Instead ot was a message, appearing from midair before her. Geleyhru opened her eye, staying where she was as the letter rose to her. Her pupil narrowed to focus on it, as smoke curled from her nostrils.

**Lady of Scales,**

**Your kin are here, and they are burning our cities. Slaughtering our people. We ask you to protect us, as you swore in the Draconic Accords.**

**Chamber of Unity.**

It was short, but it didn't need to be long. She huffed, finally rising from her bed of gold. The pair of Elves had done it, creating eggs from her blood. The specifics didn't matter to her, all that did was the result.

They were young. Weak but numerous. She could easily defeat them, as belittled her title as the last dragon. It was her battle to lose, and the reason she went this path.

If she hadn't, then the fates would have allowed them to slip through from other worlds.",9
1lc4sh1,mxzxeq8,"Dragons were long-thought extinct. Opportunists hunted them for treasure, adventurers hunted them for glory, knights hunted them to protect their kingdoms. At the turn of the modern age — where swords were traded in for rifles, soothsayers were less trusted than computers, and sorcery was illegalized in most civilized states — dragons were thought to have been gone around the same time as leprechauns. As formidable as the beasts were, they were no match for the ambitions of ancient man. 

Decades ago, a dragon was discovered alive. The scarlet scaled beast was the size of a 747, and it exhaled smoke and flames as it snored. A spelunker discovered its cave. The cave-diver was familiar enough with ancient tales to know not to wake the beast or disturb its treasure. He simply exited carefully and alerted the proper authorities. 

The discovery sent the world into a frenzy. Scientists believed that this dragon's slumber had started a millennium ago, when dragons would have been considered endangered by today's standards. Some wanted to end the species right there. Others wanted to send armies to guard the cave. One group of conservationists had another plan. 

The Children of the  Forest, an NGO mostly descended from the druids of old, rallied to declare the cave a protected site. Humans, dwarvres, elves, and all sentient species would be kept away and the last dragon would be left to sleep in peace. Their cries of support convinced a world that had long forgotten the carnage dragon attacks often brought. Even the most fearful were put at ease when governments agreed to store any shiny currency away from population centers. 

As the year passed, fear dwindled and the dragon became a niche interest. Merchandise was made. The dragon had plushies, t-shirts, fan art, figurines, and even theme parks made in its likeness. Streamers would try to get as close as they could to the cave before chickening out or getting caught by the authorities. Scientists were allowed to set up a camera in the cave that constantly monitored the dragon's slumber. Every toss of turn made headlines and the constant stream would hardly ever fall below 1 million views. Many even hoped for the dragon's awakening and bet money on the year. 

It was clear that there was money to be made in the dragon market. A crafty opportunist, a young orc named Kromp, noticed a detached scale when watching the stream. It had been there for ages, long before the stream had started. The dragon had tossed and turned enough over its sleep that the scale was far enough to be collected without disturbing it. He knew if he could get his hands on it, he could somehow turn it into enough money to move his family out of the Orclands. So Kromp saved his coins and hired an illegal sorcerer to get him into the cave unnoticed. It was simple enough, a teleportation and invisibility spell did the trick. The scale was gone and the heist went flawlessly. 

Headlines were made, but that worked to the orc's advantage. The scale was wanted by collectors, ancient healers, weapons manufacturers, researchers, and even national governments. Dragon scales had a variety of ancient uses, but the supply ran out soon after dragons had disappeared. Kromp did not try to sell to any government, he believed they would have tried to arrest him for illegal magic and confiscate the scale without paying him. Their bounties were far below the prize offered from ForLife. This research company, the for-profit arm of Children of the Forest, was offering the GDP of a moderately-sized country for the scale. Kromp delivered it to them, and lived a happily-ever-after on a small private island.

ForLife, however, found a way to further genetic research, fund their conservation efforts, and (in spite of the hesitations of their ancestors) bring back dragons once and for all. They used the DNA from the scale to clone Dragon Eggs and sold them to collectors. ForLife shot to the top of the stock ticker. Many people were hesitant about the legality, but at the price point they were sold for, ForLife's targeted collectors basically MADE the laws of their countries. This was a fun novelty, but fast-forward a few years and the dragons hatched. Fast-forward a decade and the dragon's grew large enough to eat their masters. A few more decades, and dragon shelters were as common as bomb shelters and dragon attacks were as common as devastating earthquakes. 

The dragon population was saved. All attempts at domestication failed, and the dragon in the cave continued to sleep on his pile of treasure.",5
1lbqnlj,mxvje3j,"Slipping into a mind is like sneaking into a house when the owner wasn’t there. You got to browse trough their private things ,take whatever you want and mess the whole place up. 

Cardinal let out a soft sigh as he entered the little sleeping girl’s mind. Dammed angles always interfering. The place ,like all sleeping minds was a chaotic mess of broken mirrors floating in a white void. Each mirror displayed a memory or a thought. 

Cardinal materialised a piece of meat out of nowhere and took an animalistic bite out of it while he looked around the mindscape as if he was checking out a nice room before landing on a floating glass piece. He peered into it ,it was red signifying rage normally he would have liked to see the show but he needed to find a joyful one to take control before she woke up. He could still get control of the mind if a person became lucid but that would be powerful enough to bring the Angles to him again. 

Cardinal pushed against the mirror to another one ,floating trough the ethereal space before turning his body around to land on another piece. Taking another bite out of his meal he looked at what he stood. 

Another one of rage ,this time the memory materialised before he could move on to the next one. It was a classroom ,covered with the red hue of the mirror ,the child’s eyes were locked on to the teacher ,handing her a paper. Cardinal was surprised ,a memory this prominent of rage over some school thing ?

And again he pushed the mirror away ,landing on to a third one. Red again. He let out a frustrated broad ,throwing the piece of meat letting it dissolve into nothingness 

”God dammit ,again?” He screamed to the ever expanding sky before seeing a shard with a blue glint.. Joy 

He lunged at the shard ,gripping on to it and looking inside. 

The eyes were in a backyard garden ,a squirrel squirmed in her child sized hands. Her free hand picked up a small stone while her thumb opened it’s mouth.

Cardinal arched up his eye brows “wow ,well I am probably going to see this kid back home one day” he said with a slight smirk ,reaching out his hand to the memory. The image swirled and distorted before producing a blue tendril that reached to him too. before she awoke 

“your in my mind” a childish voice rang 

the tendril froze. no everything froze 

Cardinal sighed ,great hopefully the Angles wouldn’t try to catch him as an 8 year old in case the body would get harmed. He had to do it the hard way

His eyes widened with surprise  ,she had read his mind as a random human girl with no experience in the mindscape ,how had she read his min- 

“I don’t know Mr.Cardinal ,but I know we are going to have fun” 

The mindscape started sifting into whatever her conscious mind was ,the personification of her mind.. it would be normal right

In an instants change cardinal froze ,not out of what control she had. 

His eyes were trying to close but he had to know what was happening

1lboo0v,mxumeai,"You know, sometimes when Fate plays tricks on you, you can play tricks back on it.  
I have been ""blessed"", with ""Unprofitable Future Sight"".  
This means that I can see the future, give prophecies, but when I do, Fate twists it so that everyone benefits but me.  
I get it that it must be a balancing act, for such a power, but it's not a problem.  
I have 2 ways to make it so I can eventually profit from my prophecies.  
And both of them require almost nothing from my side.  
So this is what I did.

  
I prophesied for free, talking about Fate, and Causality.  
Some gave me money on the spot, others, considering they were down on their luck, and I helped them reach higher heights, paid me when they hit it big.  
This was one of the methods.  
Sure, I depend on the good will and the personality of the individual I help, but usually, when they see that my Future Sight is real, they start to believe in Fate, and Causality as well.  
So they come back, to repay me, less somehow I can mess with what they gained.  
It's a good method, but not as good as the other.  
The other while it takes longer, it makes sure I will profit from my prophecies.

  
I travel the world, and check on simple people with good ideas, and on geniuses.  
And then I help them find the certain path to Greatness.  
Right now, I have been doing this for a decade, and quite a few diseases have been cured, the plastic from oceans is 30% gone, which is a lot, and pollution is to an all-time low.  
Food is abundant, and healthy, and healthcare, and public safety are well-maintained.  
How?  
Because some geniuses knew where to look, instead of fumbling in the dark, and because some kind people with good ideas knew what path will lead where they want to arrive.  
And through all this...  
I profit.

  
Not directly, for these people while haven't forgotten me, they aren't rich, nor are they believers of Causality.  
They saw my ""prophecy"" as guesswork, and advice from someone wiser.  
Nonetheless, I profit by proxy.  
If I were to fall ill, I can be certain there is a cure, my food, my water, my air is cleaner.  
My expenses are lower, and overall I can enjoy life more than before.  
This is the way, even if it is slightly long winded.  
Nonetheless, I have some prophecies out there, that will usher in a completely new age.  
An age of glory, and space travel, and through that...  
I will reach the stars, and see what else I can do, to further improve my life.  
I have my limits, and I can profit directly from my powers, but honestly...  
It makes me feel better, as I am not burdened by the idea of ""I could do more"".  
This is perfect as it is, and I am content with how I can use it.",91

Fate's a bitch.

People hear it, hell, they say it, but they don't know what it truly means to have fate loathe you, or want to mess around with you.

I'm not sure when it started happening, but one day I started to sorta read the future. I follow a golden thread with my eyes and can see written in gold what's gonna happen. 'Course, being the smart ass I am i tried to take advantage of what I read right away. And Fate didn't like that. So Fate put a twist on it things. A twist that has everyone but me benefiting.

So I got more creative. If Fate is intent on me not profiting, then I'd make others profit and I reap the benefits. Hey if folks are happy then I'm happy. It ain't always about money, it's about making people genuinely happy to be around ya. And if they pay for a meal here and there or ask their parents to give me a special discount, who am I to reject it?

Course Fate was pissed, but that's the game we play. I can't say I hate it.

Though, this is the fifth time I've had to save Chelsey.

""Thanks again Seamas,"" she said.

""Not a problem,"" I said, maybe a bit to eagerly as I stared at the blade of a saw that nearly hit her. ""But, are you sure, you aren't magnet or somethin'?""

""Oh ha ha,"" she mocked, ""but it is pretty disturbing that all these things keep happening.""

""Hey, I just saw that shit happen, you okay, Chels?"" Jimbob asked and I had to hide frown.

""Oh I'm fine, Jimmy,"" she said in a sweet tone.

""Oh! And ah, and hows about you Saemas?"" he asked, almost as an after thought.

""Oh you know me, big guy, it'll take two bulls to put me down,"" I said ignoring the small part of me that wanted to make a wise crack at the guy.

He nodded and directed his attention back to Chelsey. I'm not gonna lie, I like her. Really liked her. And it looks like Jimbob did too. And judging by the way she looked at him where big doughy eyes and how she twirled her hair, she liked him to.

Fate knew.

It mocked me.

""Watcha gonna do now?"" it taunted. It knew I wouldn't get between the big man and the girl of my dreams, no matter how much I wanted to. I liked them both too much for that. And there was no way I was benefiting from this either. Fate wasn't some static thing we all can't comprehend. Fate can be petty and vindictive, and Fate can learn and refine it's approach.

Fate can really be a bitch sometimes.",24

I cursed a bit, but then continued sewing, a bit angry about pricking myself.
I wished I could be immune to these things.
When I finished the shirt, I was happy.
It was a good one, then I noticed the sleeve was a bit loose.
I tried to get the needle through it, but...it was stuck?
I tried again and again but I couldn't.
It was as if it was...immune to being ""stabbed"" by a needle.


It has been 2 weeks.
I found out what this was.
I awakened a powe, a special ability.
I couls imbue intent, and magical properties into what I sew.
And I couldn't be happier.
I had succesfully made fire resistant, cold resistant, and stab and cut resistant clothes.
And that is not all!
I managed to get a Magic Clothes Shop license.



Well...
Things are going great, but the problem is they are going too great.
Apparently, the quality of my creations is a notch or more above the rest of the market.
This gives me 2 problems.
One: the suppliers are pressured by my competitors, thus I am having an issue with my materials.
Two: the military will solve this for me, IF I become a military gear supplier.
And frankly...
I don't seem to have a choice.


I just won 2 contracts with the military.
A camouflage suit, that takes on the elements of the surroundings.
And an adaptive suit, that can help soldiers survive various environments.
It is great.
But the more I work, the more I realize how much I hate deadlines.
It is the death of talent, and desires, and to be honest...
I hate the idea of my clothes helping them kill people.

""Impossible."" he says.
""I know it sounds impossible.
I also don't understand why, other than the fact that I realized one little thing."" I say.
""What? You want to tell me they do this for money?
Heh. If diseases would be cured, not just treated, they would find other revenues.
Selling entertainment, and other stuff like that for example.
Also if we were healthier, live longer,  we work more, harder, buy more stuff.
So your reasoning is dumb."" he smirks.
I clap.



""Yeah, I agree mate.
But!
I did find out that these diseases would have been curable a decade ago already, with the tech and other superpowers.
It would have damaged their credibility and reliability.
So they erased my findings, and labeled me as a villain."" I say.
""Why not talk to the public? Or why didn't they try to kill you?"" he asks.
Before I could answer, I kicked him away, as a bullet passed right where he stood.
""What was that?"" he asks.
""I mutated my body to an impossible degree.
I feel danger quicker than those with powers related to instinct.

Who needs health insurance if we can wheel you to a back room and the next day you walk out in perfect health? Your child got hit by a car? Bring him in and we can erase the injuries.

1lbcn7c,mxsmtvf,"The hero looks to the wall and exclaims “what the heck?” 

Villain Bob crosses arms over chest leans back against the wall, “Damn straight Skippy. I opened a clinic, which I upgraded to a hospital. I was healing all comers, rich and poor. Most people that did not have money paid on the barter system. Bringing goods, food stuffs, cooked food, providing personal services. I got so much food, I opened a soup kitchen for the needy. I had so many people volunteer their time to prepare food and different people to serve food, then a third crew to clean up.” 

The Hero Miss Marvelous looking at Villain Bob in different light now asks, “ so how did you become Villain #1???” 

Villain Bob walks over to a coffee pot on a table, take two mugs off a tray. “Would you like a coffee Miss Marvelous? “  Villain Bob pours rich black coffee into 2 cups of, then offered one to Miss Marvelous. 

Villain Bob begins “ at first a city inspector arrives at the hospital, notice the soup kitchen. He just began inspecting everything, saying I did not apply for nor was I approved for permits , to build, operate, run, store, house, feed humans, blah blah blah. “ 
“So I got really mad , and mutated him into a giant toad. He is still here eating any and all bugs that would come near the portable shitter. “ 
“Yes yes I know but it was easier to hire a company to setup perform maintenance portable shitters , then to get plumbers and work permits to fix public water and sewage lines. “. 

Miss Marvelous asks “so you are Villain Bob “ 

Villain Bob holds up a hand, “ the Doctors and Nurses , the medical board, found out from the city and county that I was performing free healing with out any license or formal training. They hired lawyers, tired to drag me to court.  “
Pause sipping coffee.
“Again I got mad mutated the lawyers into blood sucking leaches. They are a vital function of our free blood bank. “

Miss Marvelous raised eyebrows at this? 

“Of course police and sheriff deputies were soon to arrive. But I remained calm. Fixed each and everyone health problem. They went away saying they had more important criminal matters. “ 
“Then the pharmaceutical companies tried taking me to federal court saying that I was not Approved by any kind of government inspectors .” 
“Bunch of Federal agents from federal agencies arrived in black SUVs.  Blocking the portable shitters, crowding the lobby and soup kitchen, and they drank all the coffee.  So I mutated them into field mice, and they ran around for hours being chased by the feral cats that live here. “  

Miss Marvelous choking spit out some of her coffee, upon hearing this.  She asked “so that was the last straw ? 

Villain Bob smiled “not even, I bought the two hotels across the street. They were quite run down. But from the money I took from the federal reserve bank. I was able to renovate both hotels, as free volunteer/ employee housing. Of course no building permits, no city taxes paid. The mayor came down here asking me to stop being difficult. I mutated him into a dog. He sits by the front door sniffing people butts as they walk past. “ 

Miss Marvelous said, “ the vice mayor sent me to stop you, find out if the mayor was ever coming back?”

Then spoke that ignorant brat, in spandex up to his neck, “What do you mean you did? Your head grew an entirely new body, once, and your regeneration isn’t haunted by sub-zero or scorching temperatures. We tried to overwhelm your body with radiation, and you weren’t slightly inconvenienced.”

They always talk for so long. “Your point?” I interrupted, just trying to get through this confrontation. 

“You’d be invaluable as a medical professional; there’s no way you’d have been thrown away, and there’s no record of you in any medical database, or any at all until a few weeks ago, you chose this!” They also never seem able to make simple observations.

“How many people do you think died during our short conversation?”

“W-what?” their voice shook, the sort of fear you only her from concerned loved ones, after the worst kind of news, clearly present in their voice.

“From treatable, very treatable ailments, how many people do you think have died, during our talk?” Their face shifted, seeming more confused than the mother of a child gone, after “treating” them with essential oils and literature.

“I’d assume one, at most; like, who doesn’t just go to a doctor, when they’re sick?” it’s not hard to spot a rich kid, from their actions, but it’s even easier to spot a dumb one, from their words.

“234.”

“…”

“Two-hundred and thirty-four people have died, in the last six minutes of us speaking, and I know that to be fact. More than half of them were children.”

“Th-th-that’s… how!?” Their guard still stood, and for good reason, if what they knew of me was true, I’d already have killed them before they could see me. Their hands flexed unconsciously, on their shield, seemingly from the shock. “You did that-“

“No, you did that.”

“No! I don’t give world leaders and health company executives cancer or tumors! I don’t kill kids!!”

“I don’t kill the kids, those world leaders and insurance companies do, and that’s pretty common knowledge. Those kids who couldn’t find help for their illnesses? It was because they couldn’t afford it. The reason they couldn’t afford it, those governments who keep them poor. You stand with the problem.” 

“That… that doesn’t answer my question!”

“My name, Orcus, was given by you people, and so was another, Thanatos. Now, I am known as the god of peaceful death-“

“So you are the one who killed all those people!”

“No…” I ignored their accusation, continuing on with my story, “and I take pride in that title, but it is not as you might think, at first. I bring peaceful death, by keeping you from seeing the river, until you are ready. Or, I brought… after your people forsook ours, all those thousands of years ago, we were forbidden from interfering, and such organizations took advantage.”

“I’m done here,” then spoke the child, before leaping to take my breath once again, “and so are you!”

Their blade couldn’t pierce my skin, “I entertained your attempts at assassination, prior, but now I am speaking, sit,” their body feel to the floor, weighed down like a submarine at the bottom of the ocean.

“I will return to my duties, but with so many people profiting off of such suffering, I can’t simply let them off with a wave, and take over what should’ve been their duties; I’m going to make them hurt like everyone they suffering from their actions, unable to die, unable to rest. I want them to know, so you will tell them, and I will be waiting until they fix this problem theirselves, until I end their suffering. Go now.”

I’m going to have a lot of work to do, for the next century or other, with how greedy those things are, but I can wait. I can wait for another thousand years, and a million after that.

1lbcn7c,my3gqn2,"Ergogene¹ gaped at the volume of grateful people - letters dated to before Dr. Therian began his criminal career, corresponding to miraculous recoveries he had previously attributed to breakthroughs in medicine.


""When I first awakened my power,"" the aforementioned villain explained, ""I wanted to do more than give people scales and claws. It had such precision, I could excise inoperable brain tumors without disrupting synapses, down to the risk factors and even the genome. And I did. Years of chemotherapy that may not have worked, averted with just a touch and a few minutes. New kidneys, stronger hearts, reconnected nerves - I felt like an angel, or a lesser contemporary of Asclepius², but I remained humble.""


The doctor then gestured to a contract - one that Ergogene realized was a criminal assassination contract with the signature of a Paragon Initiative benefactor from the medical sector.


""The rich,"" Dr. Therian added, ""especially the ones who control the best medical options for hefty sums, wouldn't hear of me anyway. No matter who said I was only defending myself when I ossified the bones in their limbs, rich men have the best lawyers with the worst morals. I guess I always knew... which is why nobody ever knew I could alter biology at moderate range under stress until that court date.""


Ergogene remembered that day. He had been there when Dr. Therian - until then known as Professor Serqet³ - shut down the optic and auditory nerves of everyone in the court for an hour. He still had minor ommetaphobia⁴, and a memory of the sensation of an officer accidentally shooting him, followed by the tingle of Dr. Therian healing the wounds.


""I knew they would brand me a criminal,"" the doctor said. ""So did Faerland⁵. I didn't even need to call in the favor she owed me for healing her wounds from the Devil's Circus⁶ - she called in every favor she could to set me up with a lair and a connection to people who wouldn't mind more ""exotic"" alterations and a side job.""


Ergogene shuddered as he remembered all of that - the sensation of Faerland's power, the chaos of the Devil's Circus, the outright dragon he had to fight just to reach Dr. Therian - and said, ""And you even managed to create a business of mutating people temporarily with benign viral serums.""


The two stood in silence, before Ergogene said, ""We both know I can't just leave.""


""Of course,"" Dr. Therian agreed. ""Why do you think there's a ""throwing hatch"" on the ceiling and a pair of demi-ants behind you?""


Ergogene barely had time to react before he was tossed - yeeted, even - through a tube with a carbo-titanium aperture door by a pair of ant mutants.

1lbcn7c,myazh6b,"“I did, and many were thankful, but society’s elite criminalized me for undercutting them in reliability.”

I stare at her, feeling my jaw go slack as that explanation sinks in. Seriously? This is why? This is why she’s been hurting all these people? I expected something more.. Reasonable but edgy, like ‘no one ever looked at me when I was helpful’ or ‘healing someone only helps until they get sick again, mutating them is permanent’. Something from a classic hero-villain story, which is what I thought we were in. What is this, a drama?

“Why would you start hurting people, then? Instead of just leaving them alone?”

“Because if I had just disappeared, people would know I was forced out of the scene.” She hurried to a desk pushed up into the corner and began rummaging through papers and letters. I should have grabbed her right then and there, but for some reason, I was intrigued to know more. “Read this cease and desist letter.”

I pulled a piece of paper covered in legal jargon and signatures out of the half-ripped envelope. I didn’t want to read the whole thing–I wouldn’t have understood it anyway–but one part, circled in red, echoed loud and clear.

***“As of August 1st, 20XX, STEPHANIE SORTA is not permitted to perform any medical practice in any way under…”***

“Your name is Stephanie *Sorta*?”

“Fake name. That’s besides the point. But, they didn’t just tell me to stop doing my work because the people liked me more. In court, they forged evidence of me mutating people with my powers, just like you see now!”

She motioned towards all of the liquid-filled vats lining the walls, each of them containing an unstable specimen, a victim of her actions. Disgusting. I knew that, even if what she was saying was true, she couldn’t be forgiven for all the harm she’s done. But maybe I had a little chat with the mayor due.

“Before,” she continued, “I owned a medical clinic. It was the best in town. You probably went to it once. But then people started being a little *too* healthy. They didn’t need insurance or predatory pensions when all they needed to do was head to the local clinic to get fixed right up for almost nothing. Big businesses started slowly losing their money, and they couldn’t take it. So they took me to court for “medical malpractice,” forged evidence of me using my powers for evil, and forced me to stop, otherwise I’d face jail time.”

She began to pace the room, her boots crunching over broken glass. She seemed more upset now thinking about how the elite had wronged her than she’d ever been when I sabotaged her plans.

“And when the people started getting angry that my clinic had been closed, showing up to the mayor and the governor’s homes and the insurance companies, here comes the governor, knocking at my door. He told me that I’d better make a fool of myself and make it seem like I’ve been a villain all along, so people don’t start liking me. He’s behind pretty much all of this. Who do you think keeps bailing me out of jail? …At least I’m making medical discoveries with this.”

My disgust was immeasurable. I was torn between patting her on the back, arresting her again, or maybe using my powers on the real villains in town. “That’s unacceptable,” I muttered, unsure what else to say. She scoffed and stopped pacing, turning towards me. Her eyes held a venom that, for once, wasn’t aimed at me.

“Is there a history of cancer in your family?” The doctor asks. Touching one of the two growths on my head with his tentative blue-gloved fingers. 

“Uhm.” I lean into his hand. It’s cold. An icepack would be nice right now. “I think maybe my great uncle had it? I’m not sure. And I don’t know about my dad’s side, obviously.” 

He writes something on his clipboard and raises an eyebrow for elaboration.

“He bounced before I was born. Dunno who he is.” I scratch down the open back of my hospital gown. The growths here are more sore, and the skin around them is splotched dark wine-red, like blood pouring into a fresh bruise. My fingernails rake as close to the ones on my shoulder blades as possible. “Uhm, it’s fine if not. I--I’m not sure if it’ll mess up the results but… could I get some ice maybe…?”

His hand pulls away from my head. “Does it itch?” 

“Uh yeah. Does cancer itch?” 

The doctor *tap tap taps* his pen to his clipboard. “Well. I’m not— I wouldn’t jump to conclusions. It can. Most prolonged disturbances itch though. Ice will be fine.” He says, gesturing to the door quickly before leaving the room. 

I hunch over and watch the wall. My legs dangle off the MRI bed. I check my nails to make sure I didn’t scratch anything raw. No blood beneath them. Although they have also been looking sharper and darker lately. I try again to scratch the shoulder-blade lumps.

It’s the same kind of itch as a healing scab or a new tooth growing in. There’s an anticipatory satisfaction to it.

I lay down and rub my back against the MRI bed. No use. I stare up at the giant white donut of a machine and use my knees to fake slide up and down. “Nrweuuuuuuwww Zrwwooooooommmm.” I mimic.

Is that what MRI’s sound like?

“I— Ahem— I’m very sorry.” I pitch my voice in a bad attempt at the doctor’s. “You’ve got cancer of the everywhere. Stage 11. We don’t know that’s possible either. Honestly, you should be in hell right now. It’s a real pain in the ass. I know. It’s a real pain in the everything.” I exhale a laugh but the joke has me more anxious. Maybe using humor to distract myself isn't the best coping mechanism. 

I don’t want to die.

I sigh and sit up. The back of my shirt rips with a sound like tearing velcro. Before I process my annoyance i can only appreciate how good it feels to let my wings and tail out of such tight clothing.

And then the annoyance comes. I tore my stupid shirt. 

And then the post-annoyance clarity. I was not wearing a shirt. I was wearing a backless hospital gown. And I should not have wings. 

I tilt my head. Yes. Okay. Yes. Hi. There are wings there now. Very big and red and horned at the tips. I outstretch them and I’m very surprised I even know how: like stretching my arms out straight, only if I had ten elbows and my joints really ached. I stretch them again. Maybe it’s more like when you splay your hands out to crack your knuckles. “Woah.” I mean. “Holy FUCKING Shit!”",5

There’s no comparison to suddenly gaining three limbs. It would not be the same as taking three away, which is all I can think to compare it to, and badly because I’ve never lost a limb. It feels a little like being clairvoyant, possessing the sixth sense. I tug at my hair and allow the babbling stream of curses to topple freely out of my mouth. Is this better than cancer?

There’s a knock. How polite. I love when they do that, as if it’s a teenager's bedroom. 

“Uh!” Fittingly, I furl my wings behind my back about as extra-conspicuously as a teenager hiding a too-big bong. “W—wait I—”

“Is everything okay in there?” 

“I don’t know.”

The doctor opens the door, confused, worried.

I smile awkwardly, face red. “Ah hi.” 

He relaxes for one second, assessing me as fine. And then he sees the issue. Maybe it’s because my smile isn’t alluring enough, or because it’s too sharp–toothed and the horn-like growths on my head form a natural path for his eyes to reach the wings folded behind me. Either way he drops the icepack and the clipboard both. His back meets the closed door. “Oh dear.” He says, straightening his glasses with both hands as though crookedness can manifest devil wings. Well maybe moral crookedness can.

But I consider myself a pretty moral person. “Hey. don’t run I just… Well I don’t know what I just did… is this like a thing that happens? Like how some people look kind of like neanderthals… I know dinosaurs are a lot further back evolutionarily but maybe it’s like a recessive gene or something… I feel like I would’ve heard it in the news or– or some sort of buzzfeed article if people could just sprout wings– but you tell me. I–I’m definitely way less smart them you. I mean, you went to school for eight years to help people who are dying. That’s– well that’s serious dedication. It’s great. You’re noble. And I can tell you’ve got a— a good soul. I mean,  I’m sure there are benefits… good pay and all that. Even if you don't have a family– or– I mean-- I just saw you didn’t have a wedding ring. But you’d probably take that off before putting the gloves on, I guess. And some people don’t wear their wedding rings. And it’s okay if you-you’re not even married… uhmm… I don’t… remember what I was trying to say.” I fold my knees up in-front of me and bite my lip to keep from over-explaining all that I don’t know. 

My doctor, whose eyes are as wide and bright as two quarters at the bottom of a well, takes a deep breath. He runs a hand through his hair, clears his throat, and works the words silently in his mouth. “This…” He mumbles. “...this is unprecedented.”

“Well… you’re an oncologist. You see  unprecedented all of the time…”

“I–Id–I don’t think this is cancer.” He clarifies.

I nod. I sort of expected that, but it’s always good to hear a professional opinion. “So?” I stretch out my wings for further observation and he shuts his eyes with a flinch. I close them again, flushing in embarrassment. Maybe I’m the only one who thinks they’re kinda cool. “What’s the prognosis?”

“I think—” My doctor takes a minute. His hands wring back and forth. Even when he speaks his voice wobbles with professional uncertainty. “—you’re probably a demon..”",6

Then, the whisperings began. They spoke in bizarre tongues John didn’t comprehend. Always at night, always behind his back. As the weeks passed, they grew more brazen, casually conversing in what was probably ancient languages in front of him.

This weekend, John was going to ask questions. He squatted behind the family sofa, having come back earlier from a basketball game with friends. But without telling his wife and kids, who went to the beach.

When they stepped into the house, his wife peeled off her skin. She had a zipper behind the neck where she pulled. The monster beneath was a dark, worm-shaped mass of tentacles and eyes, which then hung the skin like it was a jacket on the clothes hanger. The children did the same, all revealing themselves to be as beastly as their mother.

John didn’t dare breathe a word.

""Honey?"" The largest monster, which had worn his wife's skin, called out to him. ""Are you home?""

He tried reaching out for his son's baseball bat, leaning against a wall near the sofa. Could he bring himself to strike them? Did he still want to have this conversation? And would they rip his skin off and let one of their own wear his skin?

""John, we have been meaning to tell you for quite some time,"" the wife-monster said. ""From that time, you started wooing me. When you said you did not mind that I had kids from a previous marriage. We... we were never humans in the first place. You married a shoggoth.""

Trying to ignore her words, John tried to crawl quietly towards the door. As she, it, whatever that shoggoth thing was, headed to their bedroom to look for him. The kids had floated into their rooms. Now was a good time to open the main door, run, and never look back at these abominations.

But he froze.

What if he had been in love with these monsters all along? Did knowing what they were beneath their disguises changed their personalities? She didn't sound like she was going to devour him or skin him alive. But what if it was all a convincing trap?

""Honey? Please don't be scared,"" the shoggoth had turned to face John. It tried to extend a tentacle to pat him on the shoulder in a reassuring manner. ""We would never hurt you. We love you as you have loved us.""

""Why reveal yourselves now? You did not do all these weird, creepy shit when we lived in New York.""

""We were concerned about freaking people out. But here, in Innsmouth, where supernatural beings live openly among mortals, we don't have to hide.""

""No wonder you chose this place,"" he said. ""If we went with Boston, you wouldn't be peeling off that human disguise, right?""

""Perhaps.""

Was that a tinge of sadness, John wondered. Could this creature be such a convincing actress, or did it genuinely love him?

""Would you still love us now that you know?"" She pleaded. ""We have not changed as people. Our appearances are different, but we are still who we are. Our personalities remain the same. Our love remains the same.""

John sighed. ""I don't know...""

""But you did say you would love me if I were a worm...""",94

Thud--whose real name was Thuddeus--scoffed, punching a meaty finger into the page. ""Yeah, there is! Right there, in the book. It says, *FIREBALL.*""

""Thud, that says, *FIRE DRILL.""*

Behind Thud, a gaggle of first-year imps giggled. The brute clenched his fists. ""Let me see that spellbook.""

""It's not a spellbook, man. It's just a school calendar."" Nonetheless, Arnold wiped the tater tots from his lips, passed the single sheet up to his tormentor. ""See? We're having a fire drill today, after lun--""

""I CAST *FIRE DRILL!""*

Silence.

By now, the whole lunch room was watching--including Impina, the cheerleader from Andrew's Divinations course. Heat rose to his face.

*""FIRE DRILL!""* Thud cried again, this time doing a weird thing with his eyebrows. He hopped from one leg to another. Mimed drilling into Arnold's head with an imaginary drill.

Arnold, who volunteered as a tutor in the school's Remedial Reading and Encantations Center, felt a pang of pity. After all, Thud had shown up for countless tutoring sessions--always in disguise, always slinking, cowering. Our hero held out a hand. ""Hey, Thuddeus,"" he said gently, ""I actually know some really cool conjuring spells. If you want, I could show you how to--""

""I CAST *FIRE DRILL!""*

The alarm went off.

After all, Thuddeus Murderglint was nothing if not persistent.

1lbfvvm,mxtfdlj,"Mana gathered at his fingertip, form a ball that grew denser and denser. Soon enough it appeared to the naked eye, a speck of burning red. A look of concentration was set on his face, as he made it stronger and stronger.

His hand began to shake, as it threatened to break free. With a cry he let it loose, flying through the air towards the waiting mage. The mage who widened their eyes, before raising a hand. ""Control Flames.""

It erupted around them, the Fireball released. Its destructive power was incredible, the air crackling from the heat. Stones below charred and smoked, a few weeds turned to ash in an instant. Yet the flames left the mage untouched, curling around them. It vanished as they lowered their hand, smiling. ""Sloppy.""

The boy frowned, pulling in power again. ""What?!""

The mage shook their head, long earrings jingling as they did so. ""That spell was sloppy. It took you far too long to shape it. It lacked intent. The construct would have fallen apart if you aimed any further. The only thing it had going for it was strength, but even that was lacking.""

Rage coloured his expression. ""I'm a dragon-blood! Don't you look down at me!""

It earned him a sigh. The mage pointed a finger to his side, their voice soft. ""This is what a Fireball should look like.""

A bead of red shot from his finger, appearing and moving in an instant. It left behind a tiny streak of superheated air, before it hit the ground. A low roar heralded its consuming flames, hungrily clawing at all it could. A wave of heat washed from it, making the boy breathless for a time.

The mage looked back at him, lowering their hand. ""That is what you are trying to achieve. Strength is useless without intelligence to back it up. You want to be powerful? You need to learn.""

His gathering mana dissipated, as his eyes widened. ""You... you're strong!""

They chuckled. ""Not as strong as some. But smarter in many ways. So, are you still going to ignore my offer to teach you? Or do you want to see just how much better you can be?""

The boy clenched his fist. ""Teach me then!""

It earned another laugh. ""Very well, Margren. But you will have to do as I say.""

Margren gave a nod, a very serious nod. ""Yes Archmage. I will.""

The Archmage smiled to themself. This was good. Very good for them. Maybe this one would be sensible enough to finish their training, and not rely too much on their own inflated self importance. If not, at least they could charge a few more mana crystals before their inevitable demise.",30
1lbfvvm,mxvjcmi,"""FIREBALL!""

The bright blue softball sized orb twisted and streaked out from the boys hand, slamming into the end of the range and blinking into a brilliant white-blue lotus of rolling flame. A muffled *thump* hit them nigh fifty feet away as the teachers mouth hung open.

""YEAAAAH OH YEAH!"" The intolerable little shit jumped up and down, finger gunning the air as heat waves radiated from his horns and hair. 

Haxgneel studied the damage at the end of the range before he quietly incanted force, smashing the stupid boy to the ground. 

""That. Wasn't. A. FIREBALL!"" He spoke slowly.

""Whatever wizznerd! Huge ball of fire! FIREBALL!"" The boy pointed, entire body shaking under the pressure, barely self aware enough to know whatever he had produced was certainly *not* a classical fireball. 

Haxgneel proceeded to hop on top of the boy, all 30 pounds of archmage might, fairy dragon of gold, lecturing in his tiny voice at a mile a minute. ""Unfocused! You couldn't even form a bead!""
""No way you could wordless cast that one day""
""Bright blue and fired on a curve""
""Flower shaped, what, why even-""
""Undependable with no magical structure""
""No even radius""
""Energy wasted as sound not concussive force""

The machine gun of frustration continued for a full minute as a minor illusion of fireballs magical structure danced in front of the boys face, then the image of... Whatever he had achieved was, all the while the pressure continued to increase, creating snow angel into the coarse sand of the blast range beneath them. 

He settled into a daze, retreating into his happy place until finally, he realized it was silent. 

Two glowing fairy dragon eyes were inches from his nose. Quietly pondering. 

""You know. It was actually quite genius for a first attempt kid.""

""Come on. I'll help you codify your... blue fire explosion flower thing, as you memorize fireballs spell structure...

The boy had a slight grin on his face as his master yanked him through the ethereal plane. 

He would always call it a fireball.",10

I nod.  
""I agree.

He nods, and our food arrives.  
We are at a strange little cafe for such meetings.

  
""I can't agree with your approach, and killing politicians, and rich individuals shouldn't be ever the solution, to whatever problem we have."" he says.  
""I would agree, if the corruption wouldn't have seeped deep into society.

1lbmnbk,mxu1cco,"For the purposes of this writing prompt, I’m assuming that they meant the house was under construction and had just been finished two months ago. I have no idea what a “construction house” is supposed to be. Also…I tried. Hopefully it doesn’t suck.

There wasn’t any chai and cookies to give to the several men in Ghostbusters uniforms, rummaging through Shiva’s house. Not that Shiva would’ve given them chai even if they had some.

He watched them with a frown, crossed arms, and rapidly tapping his foot as they ran around his new home in Halloween costumes. He watched as they waved beeping devices in his living room. He watched as they rummaged through his cabinets. He watched with something less than awe.

Shiva could only hope that the neighbors wouldn’t see this nonsense. Just the kind of bad first impression to ruin his domestic life in his first home. His “wife”, a term he used loosely, was conversing with them. Mathula had the right half of her hair in a sloppy bun while the left side fell loose. How she managed to do that, he’ll never know. Henna tattoos trailed down both her arms, emphasizing the color of each nail. Every one was a different color of the rainbow, including her toenails. His “wife” was going over all the men’s supposed “findings” as if they were saying anything other than nonsense.

It was clear that this was an issue for the police, not voodoo scammers. How much had she paid them? All they needed was a well placed cop, and their problems would be solved. Though how much of this was true was up for debate. Mathula was the one to see the intruder.

It wasn’t an unusual night, and until proven otherwise, he’d continue to believe that. Mathula always filled their bed with her exhausting musings such as, “the stars aren’t aligning” and, “there’s bad energy in the air”. It’s best to leave her to her devices in those moments. Or at least, that’s what’s best for his sanity.

It was the strategy employed every night. Leave her alone to do whatever she did. And that night, was apparently screaming. A lot of it. “There’s a woman downstairs!” she bolted into the bedroom, “Call the police!” He’d barely opened his eyes when Mathula yanked him out of bed, shivering like it was winter.

With no better options, Shiva armed himself with their little lamp and hoped the woman would run off. As he crept down the stairs that night, he tried listening for a sound or anything to tell where the intruder would be. There was nothing. He steeled himself for a fight and jumped down, roaring like a wild animal, just to find no one. Despite searching the house, Shiva never saw a thing.

His “wife” continued to obsess over floor plans with the head Ghostbuster, ensuring everything was checked.

Shiva let out a short grunt and walked up to the lead man, trying to vacuum his floor. What else was that device supposed to be? “So chief,” he tried giving the kind of face his dad used to give when he got a B. “You find the ghost?”

His “wife” gave him such an unpleasant expression, and Shiva sighed and put on the world’s worst smile. “After all, you’re the professional.”

“No,” the man replied in a similarly short tone. He had a southern accent from a state Shiva didn’t care to place. The man had an unkempt long scraggly beard with hair to match. He had a single monocle hanging down his neck and a red bandana around his head and forearm. Mr voodoo looked at Mathula, “There’s bad energy here, but it ain’t no ghost. No demon either.”

“Have you ever found one?”

The look the man gave was something else. “I do my job just fine.”

“I’m sure you do.”

Shiva’s “wife” moved to his side, and he felt a pressure on his foot. Mathula kept talking to the man as normal, but a glance down showed her trying to stomp on his toes. It wasn’t particularly painful, however, which probably wasn’t the intention.

“It’s…odd,” bandana boy said. “Real odd. Can’t say what’s goin on here, but it’s something. For now, I’d recommend lighting candles at night. None of that scented bullshit from Walmart. You get a good local boy to make one. Make it unscented.” He pulled out a purple card with an eyeball in the middle. “Here’s my card if you need me again.” He gave Shiva another look, “Might need it.”

“Uh huh.”

When the men left, his wife turned on him. “The hell was that!?” Her face was as pleasant as the day they got married, though he figured his was probably the same that day.

“Don’t pay people like that to look through our stuff.”

“They were helping!”

“Seems like they were scamming to me,” Shiva walked into the kitchen to collect ingredients for Mathula’s favorite meal. Hopefully, it would make the night easier. Food was always her greatest weakness.

""There was a woman in our home!"" she yanked the bag of dried chillis away from him.

“Are you sure yo-”

“I saw her!” fists began crumpling the bag.

Shiva grabbed those forming fists. “Ok,” he carefully removed the bag from her grip, “I believe you. But they’re gone now.”

His “wife” shook her head. She stomped off, searching every nook and cranny of the house again. Every cabinet was opened, every corner thoroughly searched, hell, even the throw pillows were checked. Though what she expected to find was beyond him. Shiva only continued to cook. Maybe rasam would satiate her. Exactly how her mom used to make it.

The search eventually ended with Mathula collapsing on the couch, muttering no, and trembling. She took several glances in all directions.

Shiva huffed, put the stove on low heat, and walked over to hug her. She melted into those arms. This was unusual for them, but in the spirit of an ancient friendship, why not? “There’s no one here,” he rubbed her back in slow motions, “We’re safe”.

Mathula nodded and wrapped those arms around his neck. “Why can’t it always be like this?” she buried her face in his chest.

Why indeed. “I’m making rasam.”

Her face brightened, and she smirked, “At least you’re good for something.”

He gave a light snort. “We’ll make pulusu tomorrow.”

The grin grew wider, and she leaned into his chest and told him she loved him. He said it back, but wasn’t quite sure if either of them had told the truth at that moment. Or at least, it wasn’t the truth in the way their parents had wanted.

They ate after, and while she was hesitant to go to bed, she eventually agreed after the two of them had personally checked every lock in the house.

...

Shiva woke up to use the restroom.

1lb7ntz,mxraszz,"It all started when one single necromancer decided that the best way to avoid being hunted down by holy paladins was to be a paladin too. He had served the God of Death well. His god had admired his creative proposal.

And so, with a hearty laugh, the God of Death pronounced his favourite necromancer his chosen champion. His official paladin.

That gave the Holy Inquisition a headache. It had taken them many years to unite the various denominations. To have all factions of the holy gods agree for their paladins never to persecute each other when there was evil out there. To do away with infighting. The law was that paladin should not attack paladin.

Worse of all, that necromancer wouldn't shut up about how this worked in his favour. Nobody wanted to ask questions. Most feared breaking an old law, or offending the God of Death, even if he wasn't among the pantheon that governed the Holy Inquisition.

Now, every forbidden magic school had rebranded their students as ""paladins"". Gods of darkness and chaos, deities of bloodshed and damnation all jumped into appointing ""paladins"" like it was an undying multiversal meme. Even cultists made self-appointed paladins. Those who contracted with demons, prayed to eldritch monstrosities, they called themselves paladins. And demanded to be protected by the law that forbade paladins fighting each other.

""I'm a paladin too, hence you should call off this hunt,"" the octopoid creature in black robes frowned and waggled a tentacle. ""Inform other paladins, monster hunters, and god slayers to cease their attempts on my life.""

""Who said you're a paladin?"" The commanding officer from the Holy Inquisition bellowed, his sword still trained at the entity's face.

""I appointed myself as a paladin,"" the eldritch being flashed his crudely fashioned ""paladin badge"", which amounted to a crayon drawing of an octopus with a helmet on cardboard. ""If the other gods of dark magic and forbidden spells can elect paladins, surely I can assign the role of paladin to those within my church. Churches can have paladins, and I am the god who presides over the Church of Innsmouth.""

The Inquisition Officer sighed, ""Nobody said a god can nominate himself as a paladin. Much less the Eldritch God of Madness. Lord Elvari, you're not a paladin just because you said so.""

""Nobody said a god could not nominate himself as a paladin. There's always a first for everything,"" he had this smug grin, sustained by the belief his idea was totally genius. ""Look, do I not qualify? I protect and bless my townsfolks, eliminate dangerous monsters that pose a legitimate threat to my meatbags...sorry, humans. Isn't that what paladins do?""

""The gods of the Holy Inquisition will not approve of this. All these unorthodox false paladins will be disregarded in a potential revision of the Inquisition's laws. The practice of forbidden knowledge and eldritch powers you possess will still be banned. The Holy Church will not permit this insanity to continue.""

""Ah, but I will allow this madness,"" Elvari laughed. ""For that is my domain.""

Elvari figured this ""paladin thingy"" looked like fun. The other thing is he's trying to peacefully exist in Innsmouth (well besides taking out the odd disrespecting Fae), so if he took out the entire Holy Inquisition and their church, it is an act of war that will rile up other pantheons and allies of the Inquisition. The last time he devoured a bunch of gods centuries ago, the others retaliated burning Innsmouth to the ground and killing his followers. So that's a no no.",11
1lb90qj,mxr1e6g,"Still, Richie liked those odds. ""Do I get to see what the next death will be?"" he asked.

Death massaged his cloaked temples in exhaustion. ""Richard, please,"" he said. ""You've come back fifty-eight times. Give it up.""

A compulsive gambler by trade, Richie bristled at the words *give it up.* He hitched up his slacks. ""When you said it would be worse than the previous times--was that, like, for sure?""

""Yes! Richard, how many times do I have to tell you--""

""What's the over-under on the next time being better, maybe?""

""It will not be better.""

*""Right...""* Richie said, making a mortal expression Death had learn to recognize as *winking.* Richie pulled out his wallet. ""Let's make this interesting, shall we?""

Death massaged the spectral void where the bridge of his nose would be. ""Richard, I'm running out of ways to kill you. You've come back so many times, and I've had to make each death worse and worse. I've had to bend the fabric of spacetime just to inflict more suffering. Do you understand? Do you know what your recklessness has done to the cosmos?""

Richie thought about this. A grin spread over his face. ""Sounds like I'm due,"" he said, jabbing Death on the arm. He held out what Death recognized as a handful of sweaty singles. ""All in.""

""Due? What do you mean *due?* There is no *due,* Richard!""

Richie slipped the bills into Death's cloak pocket. Patted them, as if making sure they were secure.

""Richard,"" Death said gently--for his bone-heart ached on behalf of this man, this creature of compulsion. At the same time, he felt a strange respect, admiration for one so totally enthralled by life that he would choose it again and again. ""The afterlife is beautiful. Your whole family's there. Don't you want to stick around? Please stick around, Richard.""

For a moment, Richie was silent. He stroked his soul patch in thought.

""Fifty-eight times,"" Death added. ""You've already hit the jackpot, my friend.""

Richie, however, had already removed and handed over his Timex and polo shirt, a handful of loose change.

On his next go-round, he fell once again into the casino's open-air piranha tank, this time while also having a sad thought about his estranged father.",114
1lb90qj,mxqxk2c,"Death had taken many forms over the ages. I guess the novelty of showing up with a grinning skull and a pale scythe tended to wear off, especially when it came to repeat offenders. He did prefer the human side of appearances, though a friend of mine once saw him as a mute, watchful wolf. Across all my deaths, he's appeared as elderly and child alike; the former grave and the latter with a mischievous sense of adventure.

It hardly mattered which form he took. It didn't make it hurt any less.

Talk about deals with the devil. I wouldn't say the deaths became more painful. After all, is being crushed by a falling shipping container more painful than a three year battle with cancer? They only became more drawn out, more lingering, to the point where every waking moment was spent begging for an end. 

To be perfectly honest, I never expected to be burned at the stake. Especially not in the year 2412. Not that anyone else was keeping count, of course. Most people though it was year 200. After a while, the ever-evolving cultures that rushed past me with the march of years had a tendency to blend together in my mind. Makes it surprisingly easy to slip up.

I recognized Death immediately. He was an old friend by this point, though he'd picked a particularly stylish form this time. A hunter in green with a immaculate goatee and a bow slung across his back, pushing through the baying crowd. They barely paid him any heed, even when he climbed up the pile of oil-soaked wood with deft hands and light feet.

""Here we go again."" I gave him a grin that did not betray the fear in my stomach.

He snorted. ""I had hoped being mauled by a bear would be enough for you. But at this point, I can't tell if you're trying my patience or desperate to impress me.""

Shrugging was not easy with the ropes strapping me to the stake.

""Either way, you're more crazy than the Judge gives you credit.""

""I'll take that as a compliment. He doesn't usually underestimate people.""

""People don't usually last this long.""

A flaming brand appeared over the heads of the crowd, moving in the hand of my executioner.

""So, are we going to end this farce? Or will I have to think up something especially agonizing next time?""

""I'm sure your creativity will not disappoint.""

He was shaking his head as he hopped down from the scaffold and slipped back into the mob. I couldn't watch him go for long. The torch had arrived, parting the crowd with fire, like the trenches of the Catabatec Wars, so long ago. Before any of these people were born, before their parents, grandparents. Their ancestors fought wars and lived lives they could hardly imagine, and did not remember.

As flame touched the wood, a flutter of movement and a flash of green caught my eye from the top of the tower. Death crouched on the battlements, arrow on the string, reading for the shot of precision. Never a second early, never a second late. His timing was always perfect. And I should know.

Ever aware, his hands on the scales of life and death, he gave a sly smile and a curt nod. Was it a nod of respect? A smile in challenge?

Very well. Game on, old pal.",33

Again?  Did he say again?  I had to think, I was expecting him to ask why?  The answer is none or zero, then I realized I said it in my head, so I repeated it out loud.

""I heard you the first time.""  He took off his glasses and stood at the same time.  He stepped in front of the desk and leaned back into it. He crossed his arms and looked right at me with strange colored eyes, then said, ""It's been nine times, NINE times, you don't remember me?""

""No, I don't think so."" Still the same feeling was there, and he looked iritated with me.  

""Do you remember how you died?""  He had stressed on the word how when he asked this and then made his way back around the desk and put his hands on the back of the chair while standing behind it.

I knew this.  I looked over at the picture on the wall just behind him and recalled the memory, ""I was camping with my family, and we were cooking over a campfire.  I asked my wife to grab me some cooking oil for the grate.  We had left it in the sun all day so it was very warm when she handed it to me and when I went to open it, it sprayed all over me and the fire.  The bottle slipped out of my hand and into the fire.  It caused the fire to flare, so I caught on fire.  I immediately ran away from the fire and dropped to the ground, and started rolling around to put it out.  I think I was doing OK but then I fell.""  I looked back at him, and he was still looking at me, so I continued,  ""You see we were camped near the edge of a very large and deep ravine, and I fell into it.  I think I broke every bone in my body by the time I landed, but I survived.  The next thing I remember was the sun coming up and being in extreme pain.  I started feeling all these bugs crawling on me, I think they were eating me.  The sun grew very hot as the day wore on and caused my skin to burn even more, and then bigger animals started to eat me, I probably smelled like cooked ham.""  I chuckled a bit at this and looked back at the picture.  ""I remember a big bird taking one of my eyes and then a wolf tearing at my throat and then I was here.""  I looked back at him and said, ""It was a horrible and excruciating death.""

""And you want to go back again?"" He put both hands up as he said this.

""Yes, yes I would.""

He stood there for a second and then he let both arms just drop heavily to his sides and he shook his head.  He sighed and said, ""This isn't right, wait here.""  He turned and walked to the corner of the room and went through a door marked, 'Officium Defunctorum'. 

I heard muffled talking that got increasingly louder and then there was roaring sound and a bang then a slight tremor crept by.

The door in the corner opened and he stepped back into the room but now he was completely covered in a dark soot and smelled a bit charred.

""Sorry for the delay. Your request is granted.""  He coughed into his hand and said,  ""Please follow the red line to the end of the hall and check in at the window.""  He looked back down and resumed his furious typing.

As I walked down the hall I heard him say, ""Next!""",9
1lcd06z,mxzlj77,"Aura is a fairly recent concept. It has been detected about 50 years ago, but has since shaped society in all forms.

Having Aura is the most important thing when you want power. What is important for Aura? Looking the part, acting the part and speaking the part.

The way society views you, or maybe the way your view yourself. You need to confidence to do what you are doing.

The rich and powerful have long since made sure that they are on top of the Aura ladder. Walking around like Vampire Lords, gaining immortality from it. The clerics with their angelic appearance, capable of casting miracles, yet only doing so for those who have the money.

We poor folk? We need to take whatever scraps of Aura we can get. The rich were quite throughout. Trenchcoats were outlawed. At least for us peasantry. So was cosplay. They didn't like what happened when a body builder put on a Space Marine suit.

To my side I see some construction workers. A big guy with the vest only losely hanging over him, cigarette in his mouth carrying a cubic meters of stones by himself. The Aura he portrays granting him super strength.

As for me. Nobody looks at me. My mask is hiding my face. The hidden weapons enhancing the effect. The only thing that kills the people up there with any kind of success.

 A proper assassin.",7
1lbrohs,mxuxq95,"I wake up, feeling dizzy, groggy, with a messed up headache, and blurry vision.  
I try to open my eyes properly, but I can't.  
The room is so white it hurts my eyes...wait.  
Why is the room white?  
Where am I?  
Who am I?  
I try to sit up, and groan.  
What is going on?

  
After the herculean task of getting out of this shitty bad, I see that I am in a perfectly white room, that seemingly has no door? Or windows?  
The bed is in the middle in the room, and I am surrounded by 5 small boxes.  
A red box, a green box, a black box, a pink box, and a purple box.  
Each has a letter on top of them.  
I wonder...should I go and read them?  
Or wait?  
But what should I be waiting for?  
I know nothing, not even my name, and I am not even sure, how I know the name of those colors!  
Sighing, I go to the red box first...

  
""Pick me, to see the future. Your future."" the letter reads.  
Ominous.  
Then I go to the other boxes.  
""Pick me, to never have an issue in your life. Health."" the green box's letter reads.  
""Pick me, to never have an enemy in your life. Peace."" the black box's letter reads.  
""Pick me, to never have a lonely moment in your life. Love."" the pink box's letter reads.  
""Pick me, to rule this world. Royalty."" the purple box's letter reads.  
I go over them again, and again, and then...  
I laugh.

  
""Is this a joke?! AM I A LABRAT?! LET ME OUT!"" I roar.  
Then, a loud clicking sound is heard, as the bed is lowered into the floor, and in its place, a white box appears.  
I approach it, and saw that it also has a letter.  
""Pick me, to forget this ever happened, and gain back your life, your memories. Remembrance."" the letter reads.  
I freeze.  
If I do so...I will get my life back? My memories.  
This should be good, this should be the obvious choice, but then why?   
WHY DO I HESITATE?  
What if...what if my life wasn't good, and that's why I agreed to be here?   
But maybe I was kidnapped...  
Fuck!  
What should I choose?",5
1lbgzyz,mxsiwze,"In the highlands of Castile, where the wind howled through the stone walls of León Castle, Lady Leonor de Mendoza observed the horizon with calculating eyes. Her small but strategic kingdom was coveted by many, especially by the arrogant Don Alfonso of Aragon, whose lands bordered hers.

Her father’s death had left Leonor as the sole heir, a woman in command of territory that many considered too valuable to be in female hands. Palace intrigues were constant, and nobles began to question her authority.

On the other side of the mountains, Don Alfonso received news of the old king’s death with a smile that did nothing to hide his ambition. At last, he could annex those lands rich in water and pastures that he so eagerly sought to expand his influence.

“Prepare the troops,” he ordered his advisor. “It’s time León had a worthy ruler.”

What neither of them knew was that the late king, foreseeing Alfonso’s greed, had consulted ancient scrolls kept for centuries in the cathedral. There he found an ancestral pact between the two houses, signed in blood five generations ago.

Three days later, when Alfonso’s emissaries arrived at Leonor’s castle with veiled threats, the king’s old confessor emerged from the shadows with a sealed parchment.

“My lady, before proceeding, there is a matter of utmost importance,” said the cleric, unrolling the yellowed document before the full court.

The parchment told how, after a bloody war, the ancestors of both houses had agreed that if their lineages were ever reduced to one heir from each side, they should unite in marriage to prevent further bloodshed. The pact had been blessed by the Pope and ratified by the King of Castile.

Alfonso’s messenger turned pale.

That same night, as moonlight dimly illuminated her chamber, Leonor threw her silver cup against the wall.

“Marry that barbarian? I’d rather die first!”

But her advisor, Lady Inés, a woman as cunning as she was beautiful, approached stealthily.

“My lady, perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Marriage would give you access to his chambers… to his food… to his wine.”

Leonor’s eyes gleamed with a flash of understanding.",9
1lbgzyz,mxtg9zr,"Count Anton lifted his goblet to his lips and was about to take a sip when the faint scent of almonds entered his nose. His lip curled, and he set the goblet aside. *How pedestrian*.

""Is the wine not to your liking, milord?"" Duchess Ophelia asked from across the table. Her elven heritage was evident in her pointed ears and slender figure, only accentuated by her close-fitting dress. While her tone was politely concerned, he could sense her irritation at the failed ploy.

He smiled at her, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""I prefer milder vintages.""

""Oh dear."" She laughed affectedly and raised her hand to a servant. ""Bring the good count a dessert wine that would suit his childish palate.""

Anton's cheek twitched, but he suppressed his irritation and even managed to nod graciously as the servant picked up his goblet. Yet his fingers closed on the silver table knife, and his gaze darted around the table. Once he was certain no one was looking, he raised it and threw it at Ophelia's throat in one smooth motion.

The part-elven wench turned her head aside with infuriating ease, and the blade embedded itself in the back of her chair with a thunk. Flicking back her long dark hair, she glowered at him. ""What is the meaning of this, Count Anton?""

""Forgive me,"" he said, forcing his lips into a smile. ""My hand slipped.""

She leaned forward over the table and hissed, ""Are you finally tiring of the pretense? Because if you are, I could have my armies at your doorstep in—""

""I could say the same to you,"" he retorted, jerking his chin in the direction the servant had left. ""Are you even trying?""

The duchess grimaced. ""Good alchemists are expensive to employ,"" she said, sitting back. ""We make do with what we have.""

""Don't we all,"" he muttered. The entire east of the empire was suffering from poor harvests and emigration. It was part of why he needed to take over her lands with their lush orchards and fields.

For a time, Ophelia only glared at him, not saying a thing. Then she drained her own goblet and set it down with a clack.

""Count Anton,"" she said in a measured tone. ""I think I've had too much wine, and you've had none, so I could use your steady hand. Would you be so kind as to escort me back to my chambers?""

His eyebrows rose, but he dabbed at his lips with a napkin and stood. ""Of course, milady.""

He walked to the table's end, where Ophelia joined him and slipped her hand into the crook of his elbow. Several servants followed at their heels while others set to clearing the table without a word. Ophelia steered him into the hallway decorated with woven tapestries and lead him up the stairs.

A sharp jab in his arm made him stumble. Glancing to where Ophelia's hand lay upon his arm, he saw a tiny needle glint from under her index finger. She flashed her teeth at him in a vicious smile. He could already feel a numbness spread through his arm, and his vision was clouding.

Grunting, he reached into the inner pocket of his jacket, drew out a silver flask, and took a measured gulp of an antidote. The numbness swiftly passed. He grinned at Ophelia, whose smile turned sour.

""Better,"" he whispered. 

He could've sworn she'd blushed, although by the time he blinked the lingering blurriness out of his eyes, her face was again set in a haughty mask. In short order, they arrived before the doors into her chambers. Ophelia let go of his arm and hesitated, tapping her foot against the floor. Then, as if coming to a decision, she laid her hand against his chest.

""Milord,"" she said softly, ""would you like to come inside and entertain me for a time?""

A gasp came from the direction of the servants at the openness of her proposition. Anton ran his gaze over her slender figure and leered theatrically. Despite how close-fitting her dress was, he was sure she'd hidden a stiletto somewhere. He rubbed the enchanted ring on his finger. It only had one charge left, but in close quarters, it would be enough.

""I'd like nothing more, milady."" Clasping her hand, he kissed her fingers, taking care to avoid the hidden needle.

Ophelia's lips curved into an insincere smile, and she pushed open the door. ""I am not to be disturbed,"" she said, glancing back at the servant. ""No matter what you may hear.""

The servant nodded, flushing. The two maids behind him were already whispering to each other. Such things just weren't done out in the open in noble society, but Ophelia was clearly ready to end the game. 

So was he. Smiling grimly, he followed her inside. 

The hour they spent ensconced in the duchess's chambers would become the hottest gossip topic for months and the subject of more than one raunchy tavern song. There were screams. There were grunts. There was broken furniture. There even was a fire—Anton had used his ring—but that too was somehow chalked up to heated passions.

After things finally went quiet, the doors creaked open, and before the servants' wide eyes, the duchess limped out. Her hair was in disarray, her fine dress was ripped, and she was red-faced and panting for air. 

Anton followed shortly after, topless, sweaty, and clutching a developing bruise on his ribs. His trousers hid a thin long slash, bandaged with the tatters of his shirt. He had been wrong; she hadn't hidden a stiletto. 

She had hidden *two*.

He and Ophelia glared at each other in silence for a time, both breathing heavily. She spoke first, almost reluctantly.

""Count Anton, I must say, for a man your age, your endurance is incredible."" 

One of the maids who'd waited for them outside gasped and nearly swooned.

""And you're every bit as flexible and limber as you look, duchess,"" he said, rubbing his bruise with a wince.

Her eyes narrowed. ""We must do this again soon.""

He smiled darkly. ""I can hardly wait.""

Planting her hands on his shoulders, she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him. Anton froze in surprise. A moment later, she withdrew and looked up at him expectantly. 

He opened his lips to speak, but felt them going numb. Ah, her final gambit. His hand stretched habitually to his inner pocket before he realized his jacket lay in tatters inside Ophelia's chambers. Chuckling, he reached into his trouser pocket for a handkerchief that had been soaked in alchemical potions and pretended to cough, wiping it across his lips.

""Apologies, milady,"" he said, smirking into the handkerchief when he saw anger flash in her eyes. ""It's a little drafty out here; I might be coming down with a cold.""

""That won't do,"" she said, glancing at the servants. ""Get the count a cloak and see him to his carriage."" She narrowed her eyes at him. ""I'll send you a letter shortly. Do stay in good health until then.""

 He sketched a bow. ""Anything for you, duchess.""

She sniffed, turned on her heel, and limped off, favoring her right leg. Most of the servants scurried after her, while one remained, gesturing politely in the opposite direction. 

His eyes lingered on her back for a few moments before he looked away. It appeared their game would continue for a while. Strangely, Anton was no longer sure he wanted it to end.",6
1lbgzyz,mxsizfm,"Part 2:

In the castle of Aragon, Alfonso received the news with similar disgust.

“A woman sharing my throne! Impossible!”

His master-at-arms, a man who had served three generations of his family, leaned in to whisper:

“Sir, a brief marriage might be convenient. Widows have little authority in these lands.”

Alfonso caressed the hilt of his dagger while smiling.

Two weeks later, in Burgos Cathedral, the two enemies met for the first time. He was tall and robust, with a reddish beard and piercing eyes. She was slender but firm, with dark eyes that revealed no emotion.

As they exchanged vows before the bishop, their minds calculated timing and methods. Leonor thought of the poisonous mushrooms growing in her forests. Alfonso contemplated how easy it would be for his new wife to suffer an accident on the stone stairs.

That night, during the wedding banquet, they toasted while staring into each other’s eyes, each holding a cup they had watched carefully to avoid poisons.

“To a long and prosperous union,” said Alfonso with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

“To an… unforgettable future,” Leonor replied.

Two rulers united by obligation, each planning the other’s destruction while their courtiers observed every gesture, every word, every glance.

What neither of them suspected was that their kingdoms faced a greater threat coming from the south. The Almohad banners were approaching, and soon they would discover that their most dangerous enemies weren’t in their marriage bed, but at the gates of their united lands.

But that is another story yet to be written, as Leonor and Alfonso retired to their chambers, each with a dagger hidden in their clothes and a courteous smile on their lips.",11
1lbrb44,mxv1kxm,"The Morphic Hustle

Most folks in Hesperia blame the heat, the dust, or the medicinal for the weird stuff that goes down. But the truth is, this town’s got a demon problem. Not the flashy hellfire types with horns and pitchforks. These guys are whisperers. Freelancers in the Morphic Field Network — a kind of demonic WiFi that spreads ideas like a rash at a clown convention.

The Morphic Field, according to the woo-woo types, is where thoughts hang out and wait to be picked up by open minds. They think it's all about cosmic connection and spiritual synchronicity. Bologna. It's demon Yelp. You think you came up with that brilliant idea for a taco truck that only serves bacon-wrapped pickles? Nah. That was Frathonthoon.

Frathonthoon's my demon. About the size of a large possum, smells like burnt hair and Drakkar Noir, and has a voice like someone gargling battery acid. He latched onto me after I accidentally channeled him during a late-night Red Bull-fueled “manifestation” session in my cousin’s garage. I was trying to get a promotion at work. Got Frathonthoon instead.

""You know the Morphic Field is just us, right?"" Frathonthoon said one night as I chain-smoked behind the Circle K on Main. ""You humans deficate out an idea, and if it tickles one of us the right way, we upload it to the Field. Then other demons download it and whisper it into other skulls.""

I blinked. “So all those people who think they’re inventing the same thing at the same time…”

“Getting demon-blasted, yeah.”

Apparently, demons work like silly influencers. If an idea gets traction—like avocado toast or crypto scams—it levels up the demon that spread it. The more humans latch on, the more power the demon gets. It's MLM meets Hellraiser.

In Hesperia, where dreams go to die next to broken Jet Skis and sun-bleached trampolines, the Morphic Field is especially strong. Too many lonely, bored brains ripe for infestation. One dude on Topaz tried to open a “gun-themed vegan bakery.” Another on Cottonwood invented a tire shop just for people who’ve seen a UFO. Both ideas tanked, but their demons got promoted.

Frathonthoon was desperate for a win. ""We need something viral,"" he hissed. ""Something tasty.""

So I gave him an idea I’d been chewing on for a while: “What if we started a conspiracy theory that pigeons are actually demon surveillance drones, and that Hesperia is the testing ground?”

He paused, then grinned—his gums full of twitching centipedes. “Uploading now.”

Three days later, some guy in Apple Valley made a TikTok about it. Then some lady in Hesperia started a pigeon awareness group and patrolled Ranchero Road with a butterfly net. Within a week, it hit national news. Hashtags. Memes. QAnon crossover. Total chaos.

Frathonthon bulked up like a gym rat on protien. Grew wings. Started wearing leather pants. He said he got a corner office “downstairs.” I even found out later he earned himself a new name, which or course he never shared with me right away. 

I thought I was done. But then the real kicker: I saw one of my old doodles—a flaming hot dog with legs and sunglasses—become the mascot for a crypto-funded NFT line called DemonDogz. The whole thing went viral in Finland.

“You been sharing my old notebooks!?” I asked him one night extemely angered. 

He looked sheepish. “I may have synced your brain to the main server. You’re a content fountain, baby.”

Now every weird dream I have gets turned into a Buzzfeed article or an Amazon product. I can’t stop it. They got me on auto-post. And I swear, every time I see some new crackpot idea go mainstream—moon water enemas, AI-powered ghost hunters, meatless carnivore diets—I hear him laughing from the shadows.

So yeah, the Morphic Field? Just Hell’s group chat.

And Hesperia? We’re the goddamn beta testers.

Before he poofed away he made sure to grin at me, ""Hey kid, keep it up. All your messed up ideas, well they even earned me a new name. Bye!""",5
1lbfqso,mxtb3vb,"For nine years the notorious villain Tox had remained undefeated. Despite how rocky the road to get to this point was it’d been paid off by the life she now got to live. All their near death experiences and fights had led to this. To her wife and two adopted kids they adopted as well as a great bond with her parents. 

Her ten year anniversary of villainy was actually coming up the next month. It just so happened that her daughter Olivia’s birthday fell on the very same day. A giggle had escaped her when she realized the coincidence but now it left her with dread. Maybe that was an overreaction, she looked forward to celebrate her daughter. How couldn’t she? 

It’s just her daughter’s birthday wish that was hard to fulfill. That was not an exaggeration. See, she would do anything to bring her dear Oliva anything. The world would burn or rather fall apart due to chemical acid(considering her own power) if her baby asked. But this? Having to ask her nemesis if his sidekick could attend a birthday party? That would be humiliating on another level. 

Regardless, she promised to fulfill her loved ones wishes to the best of her ability. If this meant kidnapping a teenager then so be it. 

She’d put on her villain gear, full body armor along with her gadgets and preparing to use her powers. Being able to produce toxins from the palm of your hand turns out to be very useful. Even in smaller quantities. 

———

”You can’t be serious.” He stared at her, Mr Unbreakable in all his glory. 

”I am. You have no idea how serious I am.” She was slightly annoyed but her determination to make her daughter happy exceeded her annoyance. 

”Why did I not know YOU out of all people had such a strong family spirit. Or even a family.” From where he floated above ground she would’ve been able to get a handful of acid shoved in his face. She could not understand how this city could love this guy so much. 

She had to hold herself back and think about Olivia, she’d be so disappointed if her current infatuation started hating her because of her own mother. Deep breaths. ”What do you not understand about secret identities? Of course I won’t give you any leads on who I am.” 

”Well, your telling me now which proves to me that you love that family of yours.” Why did he look so pleased from up there? His face was twisted into a grin from the power he held. 

She sighed loudly and did her best to show her disdain. ”Yeah, well, you know how it is. Kids and all, you can’t stop the urge to spoil them every chance you get. Your sidekick, Fighter- that’s his name right? Don’t you want to protect him no matter the cost?” 

”I don’t know what your implying. He’s my sidekick.” 

”Deny it all you want, I know the way you look at him. It’s the same worried glance I give my daughter every time she wants to do something outright stupid. But I’ll always love her regardless. I only want to bring my princess happiness.” 

For a moment the man looked away, hiding his emotions by diverting his gaze. ”Fine.” 

”Wait- really?” 

”I’ll ask him to attend your daughter’s birthday party. Only as a present for your ten year anniversary.” 

”Huh.” The only thing she needed to do was to give an emotional story. ”I’ll send you the details one way or another… Thank you. I look forward to a few more years of kicking you butt.” 

”Hey!” He yelled but there wasn’t any real anger in it. She ran away into the shadows of the city’s alleyways. 

Maybe Mr Unbreakable wasn’t so bad after all. 
As long as he held his promise.",17
1lbax30,mxs0lk1,"They sat at the kitchen table, the notebook open between them like an indictment. The coffee had gone cold. Peter traced the edge of the page with his thumb, avoiding Alice’s gaze.

“You’ve known,” he said finally.

Alice leaned back in her chair, arms crossed. “Not at first. I thought you were sleepwalking. Then I thought you were lying.”

“And now?”

“Now I think you’re telling the truth. You really don’t remember.”

Peter exhaled, rubbing his temples. She continued. “The bruises. The mud. The teeth marks on the steak I left out.”

“You ate it raw,” Alice said, matter-of-fact. “Licked the plate.”

A beat. Peter’s voice dropped. “Did I hurt anyone?”

Alice hesitated, just for a second, but it was enough. His stomach lurched.

“Who?”

“No one human,” she said quickly. “But the sheep, the dogs… Peter, you’re fast. You’re careful. You don’t leave tracks. Except when you do.” She tapped the notebook. “Like last Tuesday. You came back with burrs in your hair. And blood on your sleeve.”

He stared at her. “And you just… watched?”

“I followed you once.” Her voice softened. “Just to be sure. You didn’t see me. You were beautiful, in a way. All that power. But you weren’t you.”

Peter stood abruptly, chair scraping. “This is insane.”

“Is it?” Alice stood too, stepping closer. “You sleep through full moons. You wake up starving. You’ve never been sick a day in your life. Tell me I’m wrong.”

He opened his mouth, then shut it. The truth sat between them, heavy as a stone.

Alice reached for his hand. “We can fix this.”

“How?”

“Silver. Wolfsbane. Chains, if we have to.” Her grip tightened. “Or we don’t fix it. We manage it.”

Peter pulled away, pacing. “You’re talking about me like I’m some kind of project.”

“I’m talking about you like I love you,” she said sharply. “Which means I’m not letting you tear yourself apart in the dark.”

Silence. The clock ticked.

Finally, Peter sank back into his chair. “What do we do?”

Alice sat beside him, her knee brushing his. “First, we lock the doors better. Then we take notes. Then we learn.” 

She paused. “And maybe we get a stronger lock for the bedroom.”

A laugh escaped him, ragged but real. “You’re not scared?”

Alice studied him, her gaze steady. “Terrified. But not of you.”

He exhaled, shoulders slumping. “Okay.”

“Okay,” she echoed.

Outside, the wind stirred the trees. Somewhere in the orchard, a branch snapped.",20
1lbec7l,mxt17b8,"The sergeant took of my handcuffs when the first unit called in from my house, confirming that there are indeed two dead, but mostly identifiable Thing is among the ruins, unlike the ones which were enthusiastically pulverized by the guys. The acrid smell of the burning suit was still lingering on, somewhat overpowering the smell of alien dead. 

""Okay, Son, maybe what you are telling us is not one hundred percent bullshit. Can you tell us your story again, from the point you sat down with a book and a glass of wine?""

""I already told you and I have not seen it helping me in any way.""

""That was before the first piece of proof, son.""

""Also, please don't call me that.""

""Okay, Mr. Stimson. Please tell us your story, now into the record.""

So I told it again, starting from the sudden thunder of their landing and the roof crashing into my living room.

""Why you, Mr. Stimson?""

""I really have no idea, Sir. Maybe I have that kind of face that makes everyone want to bully me? Maybe that hobby project I did a couple of years ago, sending a message towards Alfa Centauri, and left it running because it looked cool?""

With such interruptions I went through the events. How I noticed that the two Things coming to my house had no eyes but prominent ears, suggesting echolocation. How I put on the chicken suit I got from and ad company in high school to promote Best Chicken, and kept when both the ad company and Best Chicken went out of business. How I managed to hit the Things and found that their skin has some acid, burning my hand. How I bludgeoned them to death with the only object which was solid enough, my bowling ball.

How I recognized that these two were just the vanguard and two dozen or so are circling the remains of my house. 

My beloved and finely tuned bowling ball was just a smoking little knob, so I jumped into my car to go to the only place where I can be sure to find people equipped with heavy stone object, the Little Mermaid Bowling Hall, where the county championship was ongoing, without me, because now that they could win actual money, suddenly everyone was there and they did not needed me, the substitute. 

How they caught up with me just a block away from the Little Mermaid and hit my car with some ray which melted the car around me in a couple of seconds.

""Wait, Mr. Stimson. Dexter, anything to add?""

""You do know that I mostly working with blood, Chief?""

""Yes, but splatter is splatter.""

""I can tell you Chief that the smear outside does looks like it was once a car, going with a high but not unreasonable speed. All the separate drops had the same direction, and there is a definite thickening at the front where the engine should have been. Some black colorations could have been plastic parts, but for that you have to ask for a chem analysis.""

The rest of my story was easier to confirm, because there were eyewitnesses in the Mermaid. They have seen me rushing in in the burning chicken suit, they have seen the Things coming after me, they beat the Things to pulp. I was running to the back to put out the fire at the ball washer station, when the police came in and caught me.

""Okay, Mr. Stimson. Let's say that I put this into the official record. By tomorrow both of us will be in an institute with very helpful personnel and soft walls to not to injure ourselves.""

""Well, I can't lie now, Sir.""

""But I can. And I do. And here are a couple of guys from something called MIB who will help us.""

They came in, said nice things, then there was a flash, and I was back at my living room with a book and a glass of wine.

Everything was like before, I had a car, I had a roof, I had my favourite ball on the mantelpiece. No one was able or willing to remember that something extraordinary happened on that Friday.

I almost convinced myself that it was just a strange dream, until I had to play in our next game. 

Because when I lifted my new ball from my new mantelpiece in my new living room, I knew that it's balance is different now.",5

And this is just the start...



""Mr. Smith, if you know anything, please call."" the woman smiles, as she gives me her phone number and leaves.  
I sigh.  
She is hot, and if it were any other situation, I would be happy, but...  
She's a goddamn secret agent, or whatever, coming AGAIN, to ask about the Mafia.  
And so do the cops visit me twice a month, and the FBI, CIA, and agencies that I can't even pronounce the name.  
And none believe me I know nothing about the Mafia.  
""You are protected by them, and hold in high-regard, that they attack anyone who even looks badly in the direction of this cafe...Sure, you don't know anything."" they say.  
I am so tired.  
And it gets worse.

  
I rush towards the shop, as gunshots, and groans are heard, as the Mafia fights off some gang that tried to abduct me.  
I mean come on!  
I don't have any connection to them!  
Why are they doing this?  
It is ridiculous.  
And even if I ask the Mafia members who come to my place, they just smile.  
""You know."" they say, and that's all I get.  
I don't! I really don't!  
But it seems, I will soon find out, for I got a letter from ""The Boss."".

  
I look at the woman, that looks like someone who stepped out of a cliche traditional wife portrait, and sigh.  
""Seriously?"" I ask her.  
She nods.  
""Things are getting dicey, but please don't worry, we will keep protecting you."" she says.  
She is ""The Boss""...and she did this, as a cover.  
""You are cruel. Leaking that I am extremely important to you, and to your organization, only so that all eyes are on me, while you do whatever you want elsewhere."" I sigh.  
""Not whatever I want, as not all resources are put on your little cafe, don't be ridiculous, but yes. You are a good bait. Keep it up."" she said, patting my cheek, as if I was a kid, a fool, and she leaves.  
I sigh.  
""""Keep it up"", she says, huh? Not like I have a choice."" I mutter, watching the dozen cars leave with her.  
How can I be this ""lucky""?",12

1lazc6u,mxovti3,"It is beautiful inside the city.  
The artificial sun gives us enough sunlight, and warmth to survive, and to grow crops.  
There is no rain, no winds, and no issues inside the Walled City.  
But why is it walled?  
And why that just against the walls, and shield of the city, violent, horrible winds, and acid rains are decimating the world?  
What happened?  
And how long can we last, considering...the space is limited inside, and under the city?

  
It is not a long story, by any means.  
We were born, we grew, we developed, we fought, and destroyed the world.  
The End.  
Really, that simple.  
We were advanced, but foolish.  
Our weapons messed up the electromagnetic field of the planet.  
Our bombs shifted the tectonic plates, and made them unstable.  
And all this somehow also messed up the rotation of the planet itself.  
Now...  
The Walled City is all that remains.

  
The city is a marvel and peak of our civilization.  
It uses the tremors of the ground, the heavy winds, and even the acidic rains to fuel its shields, and keep its walls intact.  
We lack no energy, and our air is purified, so is our water, and soil.  
But...  
We, the survivors, have enough knowledge to maintain, and repair our technology, but we have yet to have an individual that could...improve it.  
Thus, we are forced to stay here, in the city.  
And while it is big, it has been 21 years already, and the limits of the population have been reached.  
Now...we have to choose: prohibit procreation, or find a way to have more space.  
Not that we don't have an alternative: the underground, problem is, the untreated soil, is highly toxic.

  
So now, we have to treat, and cleanse the soil, if we want to build downwards.  
We have to somehow increase the area of the shield, if we want to build outwards.  
All the while, our population is growing, as most of the survivors were either young, or middle-aged at oldest.  
We are in a dilemma.  
How can we give birth to a genius, if we disallow the birth of children?  
But how can we allow the population to grow, if our space, and supplies will soon be unable to bear the load?  
Nonetheless, the weather is beautiful.  
The life inside the city is amazing.  
As for the slowly building tension, and unease?  
Ignore it, for as long as you can, and hope for the best.",15
1laimsy,mxn3jqt,"The scent of stale coffee and instant ramen hung in the air, a fragrant testament to a week of glorious, unapologetic sloth. I was sprawled on my worn-out sofa, a throne of threadbare cushions in my tiny Setagaya apartment, scrolling through an endless feed of cat videos on my phone. Any minute now, I kept telling myself, the numbers in my banking app were going to balloon. A cool ten million yen. The grand prize from ""Cerebral Cataclysm,"" the game show notoriously billed as ""the Everest of intellect.""


Honestly, I still couldn't figure out the hype. The final challenge, the one that had sent every previous contestant home in a gibbering wreck, had been a breeze. A series of intricate, shifting 3D puzzles displayed on a holographic table. They’d called it the ""Neuro-Labyrinth."" To me, it was just…intuitive. The patterns, the connections, the solutions—they all just clicked into place as if my brain already knew the layout. While the host, in his garishly sparkling suit at the TV Tokyo studio, had looked on with a mixture of shock and awe, I’d simply nudged the final glowing cube into its slot and…won.


A week later, the only evidence of my triumph was a mountain of takeout containers and the lingering buzz of studio lights in my memory. I was refreshing my banking app for the tenth time in as many minutes when a thunderous thump-thump-thump rattled my front door. It wasn't the polite rap of a delivery driver or the hesitant knock of a neighbor. This was a demand.


I shuffled to the door, peering through the peephole. A man in a stark, black suit stood on my doorstep. His haircut was severe, his jawline looked like it had been carved from granite, and his eyes—even through the distorted lens—were cold and assessing. He wore a small, silver pin on his lapel, a stylized ginkgo leaf I didn't recognize.


With a sigh, I unlocked the door. ""Can I help you?""


""Mr. Kenji Tanaka?"" he asked. 


His voice was a low, gravelly baritone that seemed to vibrate in my chest. He didn’t wait for an answer, his gaze sweeping past me to scan my small apartment.


""That's me,"" I said, leaning against the doorframe, trying to project a nonchalance I didn't feel. 


""If you're selling something, I just won ten million yen, but it hasn't cleared yet, so…""


""I'm not a salesman,"" he cut in, his expression unchanging. He held up a sleek, black wallet, flipping it open to reveal a government identification card. The photo was as grim as the man himself.


""My name is Ichikawa, from the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office.""
My casual lean evaporated. ""CIRO? What does government intelligence want with me?""


Ichikawa’s eyes narrowed slightly. ""You won 'Cerebral Cataclysm' last Tuesday."" It wasn't a question.


""Yeah. The check's in the mail, I hope."" I attempted a weak smile. It bounced off his stoic face and died on the floor.


""Mr. Tanaka,"" Ichikawa said, taking a deliberate step forward, forcing me to retreat into my own living room.


 ""What I'm about to tell you is a matter of national security. 'Cerebral Cataclysm' is not a game show.""


I stared at him, bewildered. ""Of course it is. I was there. There were cameras, a live studio audience, a host who tans more than he blinks…""


""A convincing facade,"" Ichikawa conceded, his eyes locking onto mine. 


""The prize money is real, a necessary part of the cover. But the final challenge, the 'Neuro-Labyrinth,' is not a puzzle.""


He paused, letting the silence stretch, thick with unspoken meaning. My heart started to hammer against my ribs.


""It's a diagnostic tool, Mr. Tanaka,"" he continued, his voice dropping even lower. ""A highly advanced aptitude test, designed by a special research division at the Ministry of Defense in Ichigaya. It's designed to identify a very specific, very rare cognitive type. A mind capable of navigating non-Euclidean, multidimensional frameworks. To put it in layman's terms, the 'puzzle' is a direct interface with a captured alien artifact.""


The world seemed to tilt on its axis. The cat videos, the ramen, the ten-million-yen prize—it all felt like a distant dream.


 I sank onto the arm of my sofa, my legs suddenly unable to support me. ""An…alien artifact?""


""For fifteen years, every contestant has failed,"" Ichikawa stated, his voice devoid of emotion. 


""Most suffer acute psychological distress. Headaches. Vertigo. A few have had complete psychotic breaks. Their minds simply cannot process the architecture. It's fundamentally incompatible with standard human cognition."" He took another step closer, looming over me now. 


""But you solved it. In seven minutes and forty-two seconds. You didn't just navigate it, you streamlined it. The researchers who designed the test said it was like watching a master locksmith pick a simple lock.""


He let that hang in the air for a moment. ""We don't know why your mind works this way, Mr. Tanaka. We don't know how. But the artifact responded to you. For the first time, it initiated a two-way data stream.""


The aggressive knocking suddenly made perfect sense. The gravity in Ichikawa's demeanor was no longer just bureaucratic seriousness; it was the weight of something unimaginable. My easy win wasn't a stroke of luck; it was a revelation. A flag on a global watch-list.


""So, the money…"" I trailed off, my voice barely a whisper.


""Is yours,"" Ichikawa said. ""But your time as a private citizen is over. 


The check has cleared, Mr. Tanaka. But it's not a prize. It's a signing bonus."" He reached into his suit jacket and pulled out a single, unmarked file folder, placing it on the coffee table next to a week-old bowl of solidified noodles.


 ""Welcome to the real game.""",301
1laimsy,mxlgl0p,"""Jim!"" you cry. ""What a pleasant surprise. What are you doing in West Palmdale?""

Jim was another contestant on Put the Rock in the Bag, the only gameshow where contestants must put a rock in a bag. His suit and black tie contrast sharply with the Hawaiian shirts you remember. Last time you saw him, he wore a visor with the words BEER COMPANY on the brim.

""I come bearing news,"" he says--his low, rumbling voice contrasting sharply with the nasal, triumphant laugh you remember from Put the Rock in the Bag's lightning round. ""May I come in?""

Soon he's sitting in one of your folding lawn chairs. The nice one, with the cupholder. He sets a thick black briefcase on the refrigerator box you've been using as a coffee table. He adjusts a cufflink. ""That gameshow,"" he says slowly. ""It was a test. We've been observing you for some time, Larry, and you've proven yourself just the specimen for--""

""Can I get you anything to drink?""

""No, thank you. Larry, the human race is at war. A war in the skies, against forces beyond our ken. The stakes couldn't be higher.""

*The stakes couldn't be higher.* Classic Jim. He said the same thing during the teamwork challenge of Put the Rock in the Bag.

He clears his throat. ""Crucial to our success is the willing participation of minds like yours,"" he says. ""Citizens willing to suspend disbelief and commit themselves wholly, even recklessly, to our resistance."" He smiles, almost with pity. ""You're going to be the tip of the spear, Larry.""

Sounds pretty cool. You jab him on the shoulder. ""Hey, remember when Debra's bag wouldn't open, and the host said it was because she had used all her phone-a-friend points back in Round Two?""

No response.

""I thought that was pretty cool,"" you add quietly.

""Indeed. Larry, it is precisely this enthusiasm of yours--this willingness to believe such a gameshow would exist in the first place and then lose yourself in vain battle--that recommends you for our cause.""

Sounds kind of bad. ""What do you mean? *Vain battle?""*

Jim scoffs. ""You don't seriously believe there's a gameshow called *Put the Rock in the Bag,* do you?""

""Well, I mean... a little bit?""

He studies you over the tops of his tinted sunglasses, shakes his head.

You wring your hands together, as if searching for the tactile memory of some comforting bag. ""B-but I was there! I met Drew Carey!""

Jim sighs, popping the latches on his briefcase.

""Are you saying the show--doesn't exist?"" You start to stand up. ""What have I been watching on TBS every night for the past year?""

From his briefcase, he pulls out a weathered leather bag, and your heart skips a beat--a flutter of hope, an echo of the good times you shared--but then out from the bag comes what appears to be some kind of probe.

1laimsy,mxreq3z,"""I will never have to work again"" I thought. It was a little odd how nobody had ever won before because the gameshow was surprisingly easy. But I shouldn't overthink it. I'm a multi-millionaire and set for life, as soon as I get that check.

I sat in the middle of my living room in my beat-up, old recliner. Probably for the last time. I was going to ditch all of this old crap and live a life of luxury. Sitting there in my underwear with a box fan blowing cool air I was just about to drift off to sleep when all hell broke loose. My front door exploded open and a stream of soldiers poured into the house. They fanned out going from room to room shouting ""Clear!"" as they went. In my shock it took a few minutes to realize that they didn't seem particularly concerned with me. Other than a couple of soldiers standing to either side of me, with their backs turned, none of them so much as looked at me. 

After what seemed like an eternity everything went still. And then most comically chiseled man I have ever seen walked through the rubble of my front door. He looked like he was made of a series straight lines that met only at right angles. He marched up to me and, in a somewhat aggressive tone, asked if I knew why he was there. I weakly responded, ""To deliver my check?"" and instinctively shrunk back, trying to disappear into my recliner.

""No, and you're not getting a check."" was the response.

""The gameshow was a setup. The questions were designed in such a way that the ONLY way you could answer them correctly was by knowing the answer to FUTURE questions. You're a time traveler and this was a trap to find you.""

I'm sorry, I'm a fucking what?! I protested and pleaded with him that I didn't understand, that I barely travel outside of my dump for a home much less through time, and for them to please not kill me. 

""We're not here to kill you, we're here because you're going to help us."" Somehow hearing those words was even worse than if he had said he was going to off me right there.

Through days of intense discussion it was made clear to me that I, or some future version of myself, is able to time travel. More specifically, this future version of myself travels through time competing in gameshows and taking the prize money... apparently even from myself. I had questionable morals but this was a new low.

""We have discovered a pattern amongst the most contemptable villains over the past 100 years. They win TV gameshows and ultimately use those earnings to fund the beginnings of their criminal empires. You're going to stop that. You will travel back in time, compete in gameshows, and win. Or do whatever it takes to stop them from winning.""",6
1laimsy,mxoav7f,"I stared at the nondescript folder lying amongst the debris of my lazy week. It looked so ordinary, yet it felt like a bomb that had just been armed. 


My voice was hoarse, barely a croak. ""A signing bonus? What are you talking about? What is the real game?""


Ichikawa’s lips curved into something that might have been a smile on a different man. On him, it was just a slight rearrangement of grim lines.


 ""The real game, Mr. Tanaka,"" he said, his voice dropping to a confidential murmur, ""is finding out why the artifact is here in the first place.""


He gestured vaguely towards the window, towards the sprawling, oblivious metropolis of Tokyo.


""That artifact? It's not a trophy. It's a key. And we're not the only ones who know it exists. Other nations, other...interests, are looking for people like you. People who can turn that key.""


My mind reeled, trying to catch up. ""So, this is... espionage? You want me to be a spy?"" The idea was so ludicrous it almost made me laugh. Me, a man whose greatest recent achievement before the game show was building a seven-level pillow fort.


Ichikawa's expression hardened, erasing the mirthless smile. ""Spy is an inadequate term. The people you will be up against don't deal in state secrets. They deal in existential threats. The Neuro-Labyrinth wasn't a one-off test. It was the qualifier.""


He leaned in closer, his voice a cold, sharp point in the quiet of my apartment. ""The real game is ensuring that when other 'keys' like this one are found, we get to them first. It's a race, Mr. Tanaka. A silent, global race. And you, whether you like it or not, are now our star player."" 


He straightened up, his duty delivered.
""The game is survival. And it starts now. A car is waiting for you downstairs.”",138
1laimsy,mxq7c8c,"""A car is waiting for you downstairs,"" said Ichikawa. 


I followed him down the narrow stairwell of my apartment building, my mind still spinning. The car was a nondescript black sedan, the kind that blends seamlessly into the Tokyo traffic. We drove in silence, the neon glow of the city blurring past us.


The journey ended in Shinjuku, in front of a seemingly abandoned SEGA arcade. The paint was peeling, the neon sign flickered erratically, and the entrance was dark and unwelcoming.  


""Here?"" I asked.


Ichikawa nodded, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. ""Welcome to CIRO's Tokyo branch. We find that secrets are best hidden in plain sight."" 


He led me inside. The air was thick with the scent of dust and stale cigarette smoke, a relic of a bygone era. Rows of silent arcade cabinets lined the walls, their screens dark and lifeless. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Out Run…relics of a simpler time.


Ichikawa walked to the back of the arcade and pressed a sequence of buttons on a faded Street Fighter II machine. The cabinet hummed and a “Hadoken!” sound clip played.


A section of the back wall slid open, revealing a brightly lit, modern hallway. The contrast was jarring, like stepping from a sepia-toned memory into a high-tech future.


""This way, Tanaka-san,"" Ichikawa said, his voice losing some of its earlier severity. 
""I'd like you to meet someone.”",55
1laimsy,mxweutj,"The transition was dizzying. One moment I was in a dusty mausoleum of 16-bit memories, the next I was striding down a corridor of gleaming white panels, bathed in cold, blue-white glow.. The air was cool and filtered, carrying the low hum of powerful computer systems. 

Men and women in crisp, dark uniforms with the same silver ginkgo leaf pin as Ichikawa moved past us, their faces focused, their steps silent and purposeful. None of them gave me a second glance. I was an anomaly, but one that was clearly expected.

We passed laboratories where scientists in white coats peered at holographic displays filled with complex, rotating geometries. We passed data centers where colossal servers blinked in rhythmic patterns, processing unimaginable amounts of information. This wasn't just a branch office; it was a nerve center, buried deep beneath the noise and chaos of Shinjuku.

Ichikawa led me to a heavy blast door that hissed open at his approach. It revealed not an office, but a circular chamber. In the center of the room, suspended in a shimmering, pale gold energy field, was the ""artifact.""

My breath caught in my throat. Seeing it on the game show's holographic table was nothing like this. It was real. It was here. 

The object was roughly the size of a car engine, a chaotic yet elegant lattice of crystalline structures and what looked like solidified, iridescent light. It defied geometry, twisting in on itself in ways that made my head ache just trying to follow. It was beautiful and deeply, fundamentally alien. It felt...alive.",13
1laimsy,mxwewn4,"""Incredible, isn't it?""

The voice came from a woman standing in the shadows at the edge of the room. She stepped forward into the light. She was older, perhaps in her late fifties, with sharp, intelligent eyes and silver-streaked hair tied back in a professional bun. She wore a perfectly tailored grey suit and carried an air of absolute authority that made even Ichikawa seem like a subordinate.

""Mr. Tanaka, I am Director Kaneshiro,"" she said, her voice calm and measured. ""Thank you for coming so...promptly.""

""I wasn't exactly given a choice,"" I mumbled, unable to tear my eyes from the floating object.

""Choice is a luxury we lost the day this object fell from the sky and buried itself in the Tanzawa Mountains,"" Kaneshiro replied smoothly. ""What you called the Neuro-Labyrinth? That was us, reverse-engineering its surface-level defense mechanisms. A lock, to use your analogy. For fifteen years, we've been able to do nothing but polish the outside. Then you came along.""

She gestured to the artifact. ""We call it 'OriKami,' the Folding God. It doesn't communicate in any language we can comprehend. No radio waves, no radiation, nothing. But when you interfaced with it, it...resonated. For the first time, we received a data stream that wasn't just gibberish. It was a map.""

A massive holographic screen flickered to life on the wall behind her, showing a swirling star chart that was utterly unfamiliar. ""We don't know what it's a map of,"" Kaneshiro continued, ""but we know two things. One: we are not alone. And two: other, similar objects have fallen elsewhere. Moscow. Langley. Beijing.  All in a silent, global race. Each government found its own OriKami. And each government is now desperately searching for its own Kenji Tanaka.""

The weight of her words settled on me, colder and heavier than the air in the room. This wasn't a game of espionage. It was a race to understand the rulebook for a game that had already begun without humanity's consent. My unique mind wasn't a gift; it was a strategic asset.

""What...what do you want from me?"" I finally asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Kaneshiro's expression was unreadable, a mixture of scientific curiosity and grim necessity. ""The game show was a diagnostic. A qualifier. Today is your first training session.""

She looked from me to the shimmering, impossible object floating in the center of the room. Its crystalline facets seemed to pulse with a faint inner light, as if it was aware of my presence. As if it was waiting.

""We need you to reach out to it again,"" Director Kaneshiro said, her voice dropping, taking on the finality of an order. ""But this time, we don't want you to solve its puzzle. We want you to ask it a question.""",16
1lany3c,mxmbs5p,"The ropes binding me to the chair were tight and expertly tied.  As I tried to wiggle my shoulders, I felt no give and despair was trying to claim my hopes.  My eyes were glued to my captor, my expression one of infinite rage as he continued to monologue.

""As I was saying, before you rudely interrupted me, it's nothing personal.  Someone paid me big money to get your attention.  I'm sorry that I took your kid and shoved a combat knife through your Playstation, but my client was tired of you ignoring them. They'll be along shortly to talk to you.""

I forced my eyes closed, mentally trying to see how he had tied my hands, trying to figure out how to loosen my bonds.  I felt the sweat covering my arms and tried to use it to moisten the rope, anything to get out of this position.  I could hear him moving around the kitchen, pulling open cupboards and filling what I hoped was a glass with water from the sink.  The opening of the refrigerator door, glass bottles clinking together and crinkling sound of aluminum foil meant he was looking at my leftovers.  Maybe yesterday's fried chicken would keep his attention from he as I tried to free myself.  I could feel the ropes cutting into my wrists when his sudden exclamation paused my efforts.

""They're here! Finally! Now I can get my final payment and get outta here.""

I watched as a smartly dressed woman entered my home though the side door into the kitchen, escorting my son.  His eyes lit up at the sight of me and he rushed over to give me a big hug.  There was no sign of distress on his face, and I noticed that he was wearing a new Disney t-shirt.  Before I could say anything, my son shouted ""I had a great time at Disney World!""  He ran back to the unknown woman, who wordlessly handed him a gift bag, presumably of new toys, and left the room to go play.

My eyes turned to the intruder.  Her expensive suit and haircut screamed executive, and the icy expression on her otherwise beautiful features froze any words that would've come out of me.  She arched an eyebrow, looking me over as she pursed her red lips in a frown. When she spoke, her voice was cold and unyielding, like someone who was used to getting their way.

""Now, Mr. Jones.  Let us speak of our offer for your car's extended warranty...""",144
1lany3c,mxmql5j,"As I embraced my child after months of being apart, a tear fell from my eye as hope for the future began to creep it's way back into my heart. The man who kidnapped him only wanted money, and in his greed, killed the love of my life and kidnapped my son. I have searched for months, only stopping when I eventually passed out from exhaustion. Now, I finally have him, and the relief flooded my emotions.

I put my hands on my son's shoulders and held him out at arms length, ""I need you to wait here for a little bit."" 

He looked at me with confusion written in his eyes. ""Why, Daddy?""

""I have to make sure it's safe out there. I need to make sure the man who kidnapped you isn't here anymore.""

He gave an understanding nod, and I stood up to leave. It wasn't exactly a lie, as I was making sure the man was gone before taking my son out of this hellhole. Although the relief and joy I felt was cemented into my heart, so was revenge - so was hatred. 

I walked out of the basement where he was being kept and inched up the stairs to make sure that he didn't hear me coming. I took the gun out of my waistband, holding it ahead of me incase he saw me. I heard the radio coming from a room and prowled towards the door. My heart beating so fast I could hear it echo in my head.

I slowly cracked open the door, and saw him sitting in his desk, back turned towards me. He was painting a picture and listening to his music as if he didn't just have a child chained up in his basement. My disgust for the man was palpable - it made my hands shake, and my jaw clench so hard I thought I was going to break my teeth. 

I slowly walked behind him and pointed the pistol to the back of his skull.

""Turn around slowly,"" I said through clenched teeth, ""If you move a muscle, I'll shoot you in the fucking face.""

He turned around and looked at me with wide eyes, as if he didn't expect anyone to be able to catch him. He didn't say a word, just stared at me with the eyes of a coward - the eyes of someone who's afraid to die. 

I cocked the gun and put my finger on the trigger. ""You killed my wife. You kidnapped my son. Why should I let you live?""

His body tensed and his eyes widened even more, to the point it looked as if they were going to pop out of his eyelids at any second. He took a deep breath and relaxed his body - as much as a person with a gun to their face is able to relax. ",42
1lany3c,mxoe35s,"[Kidnapper perspective]   honestly, I hadn't expected a response,   it was awkward,   usually people just yelled and cried at me.   The life of a hired gun wasn't a easy one,  especially when I'm hunting down enemies of the state.   The government despises handling their own issues,

      ""Yea,  your 35,  im almost 58,   you're a kid to me.   And yea. Im sorry I put you through that.""  I genuinely was sorry,   it made me feel a little bad.  The years had dulled my sense of empathy.  ""But im just doing my job,     your kid is gonna be safe.  Your husband was just...dangerous in the eyes of my employer. ""
     
      ""WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN MY KID WILL BE SAFE."" The tall blonde woman strapped to the chair renewed her struggle,  i was impressed to see the the ropes start to stretch and strain.  ""YOU BASTARD IM GOING TO KILL YOU!"" She screamed so hard her face drained of color and it left her breathing hard.  
   
     ""Your husband was an international asset,   and he was trying to train your son to be an agent,    so.   Yea,  he's gonna be fine now."" The sound of engines outside picked up,   i looked towards the door and the stretcher,  the man i killed, autopsied and documented,   i had tortured the information and confession from him before finishing off his suffering.

The woman was on the verge of tears as they Wheeled the Body out.  

     ""Are you going to kill me?"" She whispered,    the finality of seeing her husband rolled out seemed to rob the fight from her.   

    ""No."" I grab the bag and pull it open.   Deposit certificates and cash.     Just as it had to be.  ""This is 2 million dollars. My fee for killing your husband. ""  i slide it to her feet.  ""Im going to send it home with you. Pay off your house, buy a new car.  Invest the rest.   Put your boy through college.""  I was aching,   with the press of a button the cage holding the boy opened.    ""My job is done. ""   i undo the knot on one of her hands. ""Live well.  I hope I never see you again. ""    with a turn I start towards the door.   The secret service would be through to clean out the building before long.   I heard the click too late,  my sense were dulled from the years stacking on me.  I turned to see the boy,  pointing my gun at my chest. 

    ""You hurt my daddy.   Bastard."" I didn't Believe the movies,  but time slowed down,  I was still standing as my body hit the ground.   I guess this wasn't a bad way to go out,   but I was a little disappointed to be killed by a 9 year old.   Everything was slowly going dark and I smiled softly.   I hope she can raise him to be normal.    But for now, time to rest.",16
1lany3c,mxouo7c,"""Well, for it to be personal, I'd have to know you and have something against you. To me, you're just a guy in a file handed to me by a guy with a lot of money. Now that guy, it's definitely personal for him. Do you know how much he paid me? Honestly, kid, you should be flattered. It's not everyday bounties are that high.""

""I told you, I'm not a fucking kid,"" now I was really pissed off. I took a deep breath only to be reduced to a choking cough as the blood pooled in my nose was sucked down the back of my throat. That only pissed me off more. If after all of this I die tied to a chair in my own fucking house choking on my own fucking blood while the world's most nonchalant asshole twiddles his thumbs and watches I'm going to lose it.

""Kid, guy, Kevin, whatever,"" my captor waved his latex-gloved hand at me dismissively. He was far too busy digging through the plain black backpack he had set down next to him on my couch to pay much attention to my complaints.

""MY NAME IS ALAN,"" I barked at him. To my disdain, he didn't even flinch.

""Okay, sure thing, Kevin.""

Before I could continue my foolhardy endeavor of running my mouth at my captor, I was sobered in an instant when from the depths of his backpack he brandished what looked to be an oversized candle wick trimmer.

""Yeah, that'll do the job,"" the man said as he held it to the light for inspection. ""Don't worry, Kevin. I'm a real 1-2-snip kind of guy. You should be grateful I'm the one who got your file. Some of the other guys I know? Oof, real fuckin' sadists. Not me though, I've got your back.""

Okay, I'll admit, this is where I started to get nervous. The cooper taste of blood burning my tongue all but disappeared as the fear-induced adrenaline surge hit my body.

""What does 1-2-snip entail?"" I asked feebly. My hands shook behind my back where they had been tied together and my knees all but started knocking.

""I think we both know what 1-2-snip entails.""

There was no use in arguing that. We did both know exactly what 1-2-snip was.

As my captor got off the couch and started walking towards me I entered the bargaining stage of grief. It's one thing if I'm about to be 1-2-snipped, it's another for me to have no fucking idea why.",8
1lany3c,mxmqo4k,"He sighed, ""Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. I just needed the money.""

My face burned with anger at this. ""First, I'm thirty-five. I am not a kid. Second, you broke into my home, killed the love of my life and kidnapped my child at school, and you're trying to tell me it's *nothing personal*?""

The rage I felt in this moment was unfathomable. How is killing someone not personal. How is kidnapping their child not personal? It was personal to me. 

I uncocked the gun. I took my finger off the trigger. The demon in front of me relaxed his muscles, and looked into my eyes. His eyes painted the picture of true gratitude, but no amount of mercy should be given to scum like him. 

I picked up my pistol, and smashed the side of his head with it. He fell to the side, with a guttural sound escaping through his mouth. I hit him so hard that his eyeball began protruding through his eyelid, as he muttered ""please"" to me. I hit him again, and again, and again. I hit him so many times, blood started pouring out of his nose, mouth, eyes, and ears. His skull was a mushed mess after I was done. 

As he lay there motionless I sit there looking at the blood that splattered my hands, and painted the rug underneath me. I went downstairs, got my son, and left the house that was my son's prison for the last six months. Even though I have my son and got my revenge, the hatred still lingered, and the grief still present. I don't know why I still feel this way, but right now, all that matters is that my son is safe, and that the demon who took him will never hurt anyone again.

  
Then like fucking Darth Vader comes out and chokes the shit out of me and I'm like ""woahhh dude, I think you got the wrong guy."" and then he's like, ""nah, definitely the right guy."" and then I'm like ""bruh I don't got shit to do with the rebels or empire... I work at Wendy's"" and Darth Vader puts me down and is like ""Oh shit for real? My fault bro."" Then I'm like ""All good bro. I know work can get stressful and shit."" Then we high five and my son is like ""bruh why the fuck did you get choked by Darth Vader right after saving me from that house?"" like bro, I have no idea. Just killed a guy, kinda loopy from getting choked still. Vader comes back and says, ""I know I just choked you and all, but you mind if I can have some coupons for Wendy's? My son is coming to visit and kinda just found out that he's having a lowkey incestuous relationship so he's kinda bummed out. I say, ""god damn, uhhhhhh, sure that's fine... kinda fucked up tho."" and Darth Vader says, ""yeah, pretty fucked. Thanks though!"" and leaved again. The end.",6
1lany3c,mxouot3,"""Listen man, listen,"" I stammered. ""I just don't understand why all of this is happening. I'm a decent guy. I mean, I'm no saint. I haven't donated to fuckin' charity ever and the truth is I think my in-laws are some of the most obnoxious people I've ever met. But I take care of my family, I go to work and I pay the bills. I cook and clean so my wife has time to herself and I wasn't one of those guys that refused to wake up when the baby cried or change her diaper. None of this makes any fuckin' sense!""

""Alright, Kevin. It just so happens that I like you enough to bite. Sure, seems like you're as close to a decent family man as it gets. Keyword, close. You know what the thing keeping you from decent is? Fucking other people's wives. Decent family men don't do that, Kevin. I'm gonna need to take off your pants now, I'd appreciate your cooperation.""

Time seemed to slow down as my captor crouched next to me and began to unbutton my jeans. My first thought was a man hadn't unbuttoned my pants since that one time in college. My second thought was whose wife did I fuck? The only wife I'd ever fucked was my own. I'd never even considered fucking someone else's wife. Who the fuck does this guy think I am?

That's when it hit me. Kevin. Whoever the fuck that is. Whoever the fuck this guy thinks I am.

""Fuck you, Kevin,"" I swore through gritted teeth. My captor paused and looked up at me.

""Yeah, people usually start to really reflect when the pants come off.""",8
1lavrdy,mxojqkr,"For more than a decade, I have kept myself to my moral code of never killing.  
As a hero, I caught villains, and handed them over to the authorities, and most of the time it worked.  
Not with him. My archenemy.  
He always escaped, and we played a game of never-ending cat and mouse, as he wreaked havoc, again and again.  
A week ago, I had enough.  
As he kept an entire hospital hostage, I snapped, and finally killed him.  
It was horrible, but I had to.  
Today, I am to give an interview to a journalist about it.



""So, Mrs. Gravita, how do you feel?  
Having felled your greatest enemy?"" the journalist asks me.  
I sigh.  
""Tired. Wrong. But free."" I say.  
""Free from them? From anger? Hatred?  
What made you kill them? What made you break the code that most heroes follow? The code of never killing?"" he asks.  
I sigh.  
""I wanted to live a normal life. That's all."" I say.  
He frowns.

  
""What do you mean a normal life?  
From what we know, you still continue acting as a Hero, and catching villains.  
How is that a normal life?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""Yes, I still want to be a Hero, but most villains don't specifically target me.  
Most villains are smarter than to take babies, and ill individuals hostage, and torture them to make me mad.  
And I know that people call me monster, or liar, or hypocrite, for breaking the code.  
I don't care. I know it had to be done.  
I don't regret it."" I say.  
He nods.

  
""What about those voices that say: ""Why haven't you done it earlier?"" or ""Why do heroes have this code?"" ?"" he asks.  
I knew this was coming.  
""Because as heroes we have to be role models, so we can't be murderers, killing everyone.  
Also, not all villains are lost causes, or outright monsters, some of them can be saved, some of them are villains due to circumstances.  
I personally won't be killing any villain anytime soon.  
Now, I am free of the game he forced me to play, free to actually save people, and maybe change villains for the better.  
Thank you for the interview."" I say, as I stand up.  
He wants more, but this was more than enough.  
I was tired...I wanted to go on an old fashioned patrol, and relax...",17
1laraz9,mxn92yo,"Sam awoke with a start, looking around frantically. He didn't remember falling asleep, or anything like that. The last thing he knew was walking home from his crappy minimum wage job, wishing that he could get lucky for once. He had stepped into an alleyway before... *darkness*.

Sitting upright, he heard movement around him. Muffled exclamations followed, as he tried to see. But he was in an utterly black room, not a single speck of light to be seen.

A sudden jolt ran through him, as he felt something change. The air had felt close and stifling, yet now seemed to be expansive and free. It was still impossible to see anything, despite knowing something had moved.

Then came a clapping of hands. Dazzling light poured on him, making him wince. The exclamations he had heard before came back with a vengance, cries of pain and shock filling the air. He groaned, blinking rapidly to try and see something.

A voice suddenly boomed out. Like an announcer on a reality TV show, but with a scratching quality to it. ""Welcome, new Tributes!""

Forcing open his eyes against the blinding light, he focused on the person before him. They were blurry at first, bit gradually swam into clarity. They wore a bright red suit, complete with a long flowing cape. A tie the colour of blood sat over a pure black shirt, looking like it had never been worn before.

Sam noticed the tophat on their head, as bright crimson as their suit. But when his eyes focused, he couldn't look away from the face. Or rather, the lack of a complete one.

They had a mouth, that was true. Wide, and filled with perfectly arranged white teeth. The grin almost dazzled him, so perfectly maintained. But that was the only feature they had. There was no eyes, nose, ears, even hair. Just smooth skin, not hints or scars as to where the rest of the face might be.

The person spread their arms wide, speaking in that scratchy tone. ""Each of you has desired for more. A better go at life. Comfort in knowing you will not worry about your next meal. Simply more in your bank. Well tonight, you all have that chance!""

Sam looked either side. Six others were lit like him, looking around in surprise. All of then looked... normal. A barista from a coffee chain. A man in an ill-fitting suit. A couple of homeless people. A woman in comfortable clothes. And an angry looking tattooed man.

The announcer wasn't done. They gestured behind, as a place lit up. A building that shocked and awed them all, its size grandiose. They looked upon a castle, once that dominated the sky. With towers, buttresses, arrowslits and more, it was everything they could imagine.

The scarlet person let them see it, calling out. ""This is The Dreamers Castle, where you can find what you are after, of you survive. For the rules are simple. Survive a monster of my choice for one night, and you’ll have enough money to last you a lifetime. Tell me, are you willing to risk everything for a chance at a peaceful life?“

The angry man swung up his hand, transforming it into a rude gesture. ""Fuck off! You kidnapped me!""

The faceless one bowed their head. ""Very well. Farewell Tribute.""

The light over him vanished, and Sam heard a muffled cry. One that was soon lost, as he blinked. Suddenly the five others were closer, equally spaced as though the man hadn't existed. He felt his skin prickle, as the... person somehow watched them. ""What are your choices? Risk for reward? Or the safety of a life without?""

He swallowed. He had always wanted a chance. This was it. Or a dream. A hallucination maybe, after being hit by a car? It was too absurd to take too seriously. He raised a hand, calling to them. ""I...I'll go.""

They laughed, a grating sound. ""Marvellous!""

Their gloved hands clicked, making him jump. Light above intensified, before disappearing as he found himself in a hall. An entrance hall it seemed, though the portcullis over the doors proved he had no chance of getting out.

The voice of the announcer boomed overhead, anticipation evident. ""Our first plucky Tribute! How far will you get, versus...!""

A rumbling resonated, a drumroll of heartbeats. It vibrated his chest, making his breathing catch. ""The IJIRAQ!""

Sam turned to see a shadowy figure rise from the ground. It looked human, save forw the antlers sprouting from its head. Then he saw its face, and the vertical eyes and mouth. Burning red eyes locked with him, filled with a malicious, hungry intelligence.

The unseen announcer laughed, claps coming. ""Yes! What a match this will be! Now, Tribute, in the spirit of giving you a fair chance, you have a five minute head start. I wish you luck, and here is a bit of advice. Don't stop running.""

He bit back a curse, seeing the way it looked at him. The way it seemed to crave his death. If this was a dream, he would be fine, right?

But he turned to run nonetheless, a creeping dread filling him. For deep within, he had suspicions that it was nightmarishly, disturbingly, impossibly *real*.",32
1laraz9,mxophed,"""Alright so those are the rules?""

""Correct, what is allowed, what you can use, and yes you will be provided a head start."" The bizarre entity clarified all my questions before I accepted, but they also seemed quite curious, ""I feel that you were going to accept this challenge even if I refused to elaborate on the rules.""

I gave a shrug, and gave a quick look around at the area as I answered, ""Well, to be honest, with how things have been going your offer is far more appealing than you think.""

""Oh, I know mortals can have difficult existences, but to say surviving being hunted by one of my, pets, is quite unusual.""

I took my place at the start line it had pointed out, and decided to elaborate myself.

""Well, there are several things lining up I guess."" I did some stretching more for my nerves than anything, ""You see I have a...problem.""

The entity moved to my side, a look I guess was inquisitive, as I continued.

""As terrifying as being killed by a monster, having my life cut short would usually be, it is something I have actually already been grappling with.""

I could hear the monster in its cage growling more frantically now, it knew it was going to be hunting soon.

""The thought of what would happen to the people I care for if I was gone scares me far more."" I talked, once again not really to answer but to steel myself for this, ""Would they be alright, financially stable, who would look out for them. Those sorta things.""

The entity now seemed a bit confused, ""That seems like motivation to, Not, take my challenge mortal..?""

""Actually it is the opposite."" I responded, having gained my final nerves for this, ""You see I either survive this, and they will be taken care of, or I die here and they don't have to deal with what comes next.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well according to the doctors."" I took up a running stance at the line, ""I'm gonna die in a few months any way, after more than likely racking up a great deal of medical debt for them.""

The entity grew silent after that.

""Either way...they benefit some way from this."" I took one final look at the entity, ""So, I'll take my chances, and either way I have no intention of dying quietly when I go.""

I looked over my shoulder at the creature in the cage.

""So that thing better be ready for what happens if it catches me.""",13
1laraz9,mxp9i8v,"""Kakaka! You've really gone and dug a hole this time Vosshy!""

The Slayer's Guild and the Witch's Coven had been allied for many a new moon and while every Slayer was thankful for their sorcerous partners, Vosh did sometimes wish he was assigned an older and more mature ally.  
  
""-are you done-""

""I almost busted my gut when I saw you actually take the devil's deal rather than just cut his head off.""

""Which would have meant certain doom for the folk already caught in his spell so-""

""\*Survive a monster of my choice for one night, and you’ll have enough money to last you a lifetime!\* HA, honestly it's poetic. Genie-like even! You know I'm something of a conniving bitch myself but I don't think I could've found a more fitting twist of the knife.""

""So you know what I'm facing?""

Piercing eyes stared at Vosh through the scrying mirror. Pupils golden and silver seemed to bore through him as they rested on a black and red feather the size of an ox at his feet.

""Aye, I know the beast which hunts you. It is called a Minokawa, a distant cousin to the Roc but even bigger if you can believe that. There are tales from the east which claim that night and day come and go because the sun and moon are running from the Minokawa which seeks to eat them.""

""And if it is empowered by a devil to never tire...""

""It can keep chasing and the sun will never get a chance to rise while it's sleeping. Your one night will never end until one day you keel over from hunger or despair and the devil takes his prize.""

  
Vosh felt a cold sweat on his neck. Not much got Veronica serious and the sudden change in tone worried him more than the description of the beast.

""So it's the bastard child of an overgrown chicken and a dragon. Big deal.""

""The only bastardization here is your brain regurgitating my words but essentially yes. That means while your blade might be able to clip a few feathers it will not pierce the scales underneath. Not that you'd even be able to get a good swing on a beast of that size while it's trying to eat you.""

""So how do I kill it?""

A wide, maniacal grin creeped across Veronica's face. Vosh got the feeling that he was not going to like the answer to his question.

""Why by letting it eat you of course! It's a lot more bird than dragon and while it's clearly not big enough to actually swallow celestial bodies I doubt it's the kind of monster that chews or even has teeth for that matter. So let it eat you! Let's see if our little beasty is as well protected on the inside.""",9
1laraz9,mxn5ajn,"“ Hahahahahaha, I’m your huckleberry, hahahaha “ I tried to control my laughter.  
“Oh how I have waited to say that line.” I say 
That beautiful lady god seems a bit pissed at me. 

The lady god speaks, “You should take this seriously, it ..”

I interrupted her, “ it will be hard, it will be painful, it will be costly, it will be blah blah blah. So what do I get when I win? “ 

The lady god crosses her arms, scowls and says, “if you win, most likely you will fail and die a horrible death as all those before you have.”

“Yah, yah, but when I win. What do I personally get from you? “  I continued “ can I have something from you instead of money?”

Lady God stopped tapping her foot, glaring at me, asked “What are you asking for?” 

I hold out my hand, “make the deal. I will tell you everything once I have won. “ 

Looking suspiciously at my outstretched hand, lady god says “ You must use only what you have on your being right now.  No super future weapons, no help from other beings. Just you. “ lady god timidly raises her hand to mine. 

I grab her hand shaking it vigorously, “DEAL” “no take back sees now my pretty little goddess “ . 

She jerks her hand away, as I turn to face her kraken monster.  
A 20 foot tall hybrid monster with the body of a bull, head of an octopus with 8 tentacles for hair, clawed paws like a bear, and lions tail. All covered in purple scales. 
She should have picked better. 

I reached out with my mind , and pulled a giant oak tree up by the roots. Spun the tree in the air several times. 
Then began beating the lady god monster about the head and shoulders.  
The monster ran around for several seconds. Before sub coming to the beating. And just collapsed on the earth dead. 
Before the lady god could resurrect her monster. I flung it out into space. 

I dropped the tree, turned on the lady god and said, “ I wish for you to become my wife “ 

The lady god looked at me, was about to say something. 

When a voice from the heavens sang out “ Yes, it shall be done.” 

The lady god huffed “But Father, I don’t want to get married, especially to him “ she pouts pointing at me. 

The heavenly voice bellows, “the Deal is done, you are now married” 

I look at lady god looked, “come wife I hope you can make a better sandwich, than you can make a monster?”",15
1laipjj,mxkz12p,"I stare at the soul, flabbergasted.
They are here, a perfect and whole soul.
But how?
The soul is literally what makes us unique.
""Excuse me.
Why am I here?"" they ask.
Their figure was flickering, they were anxious.
Of course, this is highly unusual and unsettling setting.
This office is empty except my desk, and stuff to work on.
The soul waves at me.


""My apologies.
This is the Afterlife Office, and usually souls don't arrive here, as the processing of souls is mostly automated."" I said.
""So why am I here?
And does this mean I am dead?
I was...wait. What was I doing before?"" they say.
I sigh.
""Memories are wiped, unless the system considers they can be an asset in their next lives."" I say.
They flicker.
""What now? Why am I here?"" they ask.
I sigh.


""It seems you are a duplicate soul, which frankly should be impossible.""  I say.
They dim.
Oh shit...I scared them.
""It is nothing bad! It is just...irregular!"" I comfort them.
""It means that there is another me...out there?"" they ask.
I nod.
""The system says you, or at least the soul I am looking at has been processed, and sent to...
Valhalla."" I say.
""So I am...a viking?"" they ask.
I shake my head.


""Not sure. You are exactly the same soul, at least by the standards of the system.
But something is different. Otherwise you wouldn't be here."" I say.
They sigh.
""Who am I?"" they ask me.
I sigh.
""I don't know, but we will find out.
I can give you energy enough to transform."" I say.
""And then?"" she asks.
I clap, and an endless amount of file cabinets appear.
""And then we start looking for a situation like yours."" I smile.
They nod.
""Fine. Not like I have any choice."" they flicker.
I point at them at the surroundings fluctuate as they start to transform.
Well...this will be fun.
It has been eons since I had someone working with me.",75
1laipjj,mxm6svi,"""Where am I? Why am I here?"" The soul asks of me.

""Well, I'd like to know this myself honestly. The system usually sorts you automatically, but for some reason there are two of you"" I answer them.

""Two of me?"" The soul considers for a moment. Then it just says ""Ohh..."".

My alarm bells start ringing. ""What do you mean? Do you have an idea how you duplicated your soul?""

The soul frowns and says ""I have one, but I am not sure you'll like where this is going.""

""Speak"" I say ""The afterlife may be timeless. But if you are implying there could be more cases like yours then I need to resolve this quickly.""

""Well..."" the soul intones. ""We have been working on creating teleportation devices. You know the whole Star Trek thing? Dissolve the body and reform it somewhere else. We have it super safe now. No memory loss between the teleports. I was about to test our human rated teleporter for the second time just now. Though I guess I actually did.""

I look at him and feel the nonexistent color draining from my face. ""So you mean to tell me. You have found a way to copy the soul and you are using it for travel?"" I ask.

""I mean... up until now I didn't even believe the soul exists. We just wanted to revolutionize travel."" He stammers.

""Ohh of course. You don't even know what you are doing. All you are revolutionizing is.... shit!"" 

""What happened?"" The soul asks. Suddenly another soul appears. ""Huh Greg? Is that you?""  The souls says looking at the newcomer.

""Ohh Tom. What are you doing here?"" The newcomer asks.

""It is a long story but it seems like. Whenever we use the teleporter. The dissolved body ends up in the afterlife and..."" 

They start talking enthusiastically. An enthusiam that is completely lacking for me.

""Fuck this."" I mutter. ""I'm calling my boss. This is above my paygrade""",56
1laipjj,mxliyue,"Death, it is a constant, boring to those accustomed to it, and ever unchanging and static. If you see one person die you have seen it happen to all of them, the ways might differ but the result is the same a soul moving on from their plain of origin. One thing that did change though was the way these souls are processed and lead to 'the Afterlife' as mortals called it.

Back when life was barely in the hundreds it was common for a single entity to 'harvest' the souls and personally lead them to what awaited them next, the mortals called them: The Grim Reaper. And they were the most prominent even to this day being the being most mortal believe to be the face they would encounter once they pass, a belief so strong and great in number it became the uniform of my kind. We replaced the singular workforce once they no longer could handle the demand alone and war started becoming a more common thing among mortal nations. And with time technology evolved and war became more horrific more hands were needed and technological inspirations were taken to make our work easier.

The zenith came with the 21st century as mortals called it a time of limitless progress and equally great death a constant that even their truly miraculous inventions could never change. Now each of us had a work station and position like a company hierarchy some reap, some process, some fix things, some lead. No matter which position most have an easy job simply overseeing systems that did the truly difficult work only ever doing something ourselves when something happens, something like what happened to me just this moment.

An error message appeared on the screen of my workstation interrupting a game I was playing, nothing against policy we all do it, and it befuddled me greatly. Now I was not a newbie at the job, I have been working here since the 15th century, thanks to the aftermath of Columbus of course, and I was one of the more stoic ones in fact I usually get excited when I need to do something other than my routine. But this was something I could never have anticipated, the message read the following: **Error - Transfer of Soul not possible.** A simple error I have seen many times before but not the following explanation for it: **Soul already in registry.**

That was the exact statement that confused me but it also intrigued me as to what exactly it could mean. I closed my game, without saving might I add I was that invested, and began digging through the logs and messages that related to this error. Through this I discovered a possible explanation that immediately disappointed me, someone from the reaping department must've messed up something and accidentally split a soul in half, happened before was not fun then but is easy to solve and a non issue nowadays. I hovered over the **Ignore and overwrite soul** option when I got this strange feeling that I should not be hasty, might have been my own desire for something more or fate telling me to stop, whatever it was I took a closer look.",15
1laipjj,mxl8wao,"I lean back, finally able to rest. As a designer, existing during all moments is - difficult.  ""4D's have it easy. float down the river of time. We actually have to be responsible for our choices!"" I say aloud. my chair turning.  ""But that's just me complaining. The moment designing a automated system took a while - the choices I had to make! way too many. that's how we measure ""time"" by the way. "" I pointed out  my finger wiggling to the soul sitting beside me in a straight back chair.

  
He sat confused, ""Why does heaven look like a corporate office?"" I turn to face him.

  
""That's the question!?"" I stand, "" What if you only get one? Do you not know how to spend an opportunity! Fuck you!"" I roar, look down and realize my spit flew on my desk. I breathed out and sat back down. He let me seethe. he tried to look anywhere but to me - until the silence unbearable.

""May I speak?"" I recenter my self, giving a go, ""Why am I here? I'm pretty sure I'm dead.""

  
I silently tell him to wait and rife through my desk drawer and pull out a card: ""Welcome to the afterlife earth branch -uh- human. "" I read from it mechanically. ""Your time on earth is over, you have been sent to our office to complete your afterlife process. You life will be evaluated and your choice of god, religion or belief will be considered. Your incorporeal soul will be sent to those entities if they are in network. should these considerations fall beyond network your soul will be processed and used by the company in a remaining lifetime service. Please stand still as you are evaluated...blah blah blah."" I saw getting bored. I turn reality and I'm standing before him reaching his head. 

  
""Wait!"" He yelled trying to move away, unable. Inches before touch I see a glint, a reflection beside his form, I stop and stare and wave my hand over him. His existence rotates around like on a turn table. and I see him again and again. each different expressions different clothing. Duplicates overlaid on top of each other. 

""How?"" The rotation continues and his duplicates become asynchronized over that rotational axis. An entity, human shaped, with with multiple arms and heads overcomes my hold like it was nothing, a face of wrath finally settles among the multitude as weapons rotate into existence with his hands. I stare as he floats up and reality begins to crack.

1laipjj,mxm8utj,"**New Changes to the Corporate Structure**

Spreadsheets, proprietary software invented by higher spirits far above my level of enlightenment, and the skimming of emails made up most of my day. For the past millennia or so my job had been slowly siphoned off to the etheral machines that somehow surpassed even the All Knowing in their capabilities of speed and effenciancy. Honestly, if you ask me I think that the All Knowing was just gearing up our higher plain for sell to an even higher one, along with the lower plain of mortals that we administered over. The automation made my life easier at least. Most of the time I just sat around in my office all day watching lifetimes of random mortals for entertainment while ignoring the occasional email about new changes to the corporate structure.

However, not everything was perfect. Every few decades or so I’d have to personally evaluate a soul to make sure the software was functioning properly. The occasional QA if you will. Made work entertaining from time to time. Most of the time though I’d just read off a series of quick questions, input some date into the checkbox, and go on about my decade. The last soul I had was about forty years ago, man named Matt. Middle American, middle aged, mid weight, and with a middling career in middle management. The most run-of-the-mill American man I’d ever seen. I wasn’t even sure why he appeared in my office, his info was so perfect for that demographic that I was sure that it had been a mistake. Oh well, gave me something to do. It was only about five decades later when Matt arrived on my couch again did I grow suspicious.

There he was, almost exactly as I had remembered him. Wearing a button down plaid shirt fit for a manager who came by your desk every few hours with a coffee cup in hand to ask you “are we working hard or hardly working?” Always followed with a chuckle. Plump but not too plump. Jeans with a relaxed fit and a his shirt tucked into them. He sat at the couch on my office with a cheerful almost dimitted smile.

“I’m sorry,” I said the moment I saw him. “I believe there’s been some sort of mistake. You weren’t supposed to have been reincarnated. We abandoned that program millennia ago.”

I remembered those upstart days. We were recycling souls so often because the All Mighty and their team of higher spirits were fine tuning the soul creation process. I worked my ethereal ass off in those days in QA. It really felt like my work meant something then, unlike nowadays. At least this apparent glitch in Matt’s soul provided me with some sort of novelty.

Matt just smiled and said. “I guess my wife was right, I should have prayed more. Because, if I’m back in the office then this is really is Hell.” Followed by a chuckle.

“I assure you that you are not in Hell,” I answered. “We decomissioned the Hell program just two centuries ago. I’m sorry about your reincarnation.”

“Reincarnation?” He asked.

“Do you remember any past lives? Usually coming to the afterlife and remembering them all can lead to a moment of shock.”

Matt shook his head. Okay, weird but sometimes it takes a few centuries or so for the memories to come flooding back after a soul finished its reincarnation cycle.

“Give me a second,” I said reaching for my phone. “I’ll sort this all out and see that you get the proper reincarnation counseling. We have this great therapist, she came from Hell originally, but they say that Hell makes the best councilors.”

I dialed up Dawn. Former reincarnation QA manager, now almost fully enlightened to CSO, the chief soul officer. We go way back, although it had been about half a millennia since we last spoke to one another. She answered.

“What is it Adam?” She asked. (I posit to say here that I am in no relation to the first male soul of the same name, just a conicidnece.)

“I think there’s been a mistake and a soul has been reincarnated again. I was wondering if you knew anything about this.” I said. I looked at Matt who just waved at me with a gentle smile.

Dawn let out a large sigh. The last time I had heard this it was followed by her saying: “There’s a reason why I’m at the top and you’re not.” I didn’t let those remarks get to me, but whenever she sighed it reminded just how much we’ve grown apart since our QA days.

“Do you not read your emails?” She asked.

Not really. Especially not corporate newsletters, but I didn’t say that, instead I said: “Occasionally, but always if it’s addressed to me or Angelia.” Angelina was my manager, very sweet woman but also about as checked out from her job as I was with mine.

“All Mighty, we’re going to have to run another corporate engagement survey aren’t we...” Dawn said to no one in particular.

“Everything okay?” Matt said. I guess he could see the shame in my face.

“So about this Matt situation...” I said.

“I shouldn’t be the one giving you this spiel but since you’re not going to read your emails anyways I guess I’ll say it,” she sighed. I could just see her pressing a finger to her temple in my mind’s eye. “We’re rolling out a new program. New standardized souls for every culture on Earth, at first at least. Plan is to gradually create a standardized soul for the entirety of the lower plain. You, being in QA should have been informed of this. We’re starting with Matt: Median American Testosterone Template. We’ve already delivered out hundreds of thousands of these souls over the past century. Next decade we’ll be rolling out the female counterpart, Sally: Standard American Lady Layout. Understand?”

“I understand that you higher spirits need to get better at acronyms.” I said, with a slight chuckle.

“Do you understand?” She said with no humor.

I looked at Matt, one of many apparently. He smiled and waved. “Tell her she sounds like a very smart lady,” he said to me. I ingnored him. I was not ready for dealing with centuries of men like him. I couldn’t imagine what Sally was like. I guess I’d figure out in due time.

“Yes,” I said. “So you just want me to run some QA on him? Is there a standard I should be reference?”

“Get with Angelia on that,” she said. “Now if you don’t have any other questions I have more important things to do.”

“Why though?” I said.

“Why what?” She said, her annoyance thinly veiled.

“Why the new soul template program?”

”It’s what the All Mighty wants, simple as that.”

If that’s true, I thought, then maybe the rumors were true. Maybe our plain was going to be put on sale soon. I had friends in fellow neighboring plains that had been bought out. It never went well for those on the bottom. Even worse for the souls that resided on the lower plains that they managed.

“Are the rumors true then?” I said.

“It’s what the All Mighty wants, simple as that. Are we done here? I have a meeting to get to.”

“Yeah.”

She didn’t even say goodbye, the line clicked and only the hum of a disconnected line lingered in the earpiece.

“I’ve seen that look before,” Matt said pointing at my face. “Bad call with the boss? I know those, every Monday my manager let me get an earful. Maybe this is hell after all,” he chuckled.

I took a deep breath and loosened up, forcing a smile on my face. “Everything is all good,” I said as I pulled up my old QA list of questions. Opening up the copy from fifty years ago that I had filled in the previous Matt’s answers with. “Now if you don’t mind, I have a list of questions I want to ask you before we send you about your way.”

“Oh I love surveys,” he said. “Do I get to enter a sweepstakes for answering? I always wanted a speedboat but my wife wouldn’t let me have it. Said that money was needed for our daughter’s tuition.” He chuckled. His response was verbatim to the last Matt I had seen.

“Alright, question one,” I said. As we ran through the list of questions I felt my eternal soul die a little on the inside as I prepared myself for our inevitable buyout.

""Did they not explain to you about fixed point time in any of your testing?""

The soul seems somewhat shocked and ashamed

""I mean, y.. yes but what does that have to do with any of this where am I?"" the soul asks me bewildered.

""You're in the office of afterlife management, many call me grim, death, whatever have you. Ultimately I just want to show up to work, do my bit until the shift ends, and go home."" I state flatly

""But how did I... when...""

""Yes! My recently deceased problem case, you've got it! When! Exactly the thing that killed you.""

""But I followed everything else correctly...""

""I get it, you're confused a bit, but there's a reason where every single bit of your testing for a license always made sure you knew not to travel to a fixed point in time""

""How would you know about that?""

""I am not of your plane, time has no meaning here. Everything that is, never happened yet and everything that isn't, is happening now. I swear, you're the fifth case just this afternoon. I had to stop my lunch break early just to...""

""But I thought you said time has no meaning here.""

""Listen, we have a strong union, and I'm proud of what they've done for us. They're a large part of why you're here to begin with.""

""That doesn't make any sort of sense""

""It certainly makes a whole mountain more than deliberately going against the very thing you were taught so frequently! Look, fixed time points exist for a reason. Do you know how awful our work was because of you time travelers? Certain events you just had to go back and alter and fix and alter and fix.""

""Look, I get that but what happens tomorrow is really bad...""

""You think I don't know that!? What's worse is when your kind gets all mixed up in a perpetual war of trying to 'correct' the past. Every person who died 'too young' or every villain who 'should have never risen to power' leaves a whole mountain of time traveling corpses in their wake.""

""Yes, but...""

""No, what will happen, has already happened. It is up to those in the now to guide the events that transpire! You were told that countless times before you passed the exam for your license but apparently it didn't stick.""

"".....well what happens now?""",5
1laipjj,mxlizq1,"They died at 17:37:04 their soul being successfully reaped and processed instantly and sent to 'heaven', as they call it, for their great efforts in the scientific fields. Then ten seconds later an exactly ten seconds older but otherwise identical soul arrived having been reaped and now is awaiting processing being stuck until I choose what do to. If this indeed was a case of a fragmented soul then the second soul should have arrived at most one or two second later, reaping is not incompetent they notice errors like that faster than anything and act even quicker. But if it wasn't that just what could it be? I dove deeper having to request records of the Time Keepers to actually look at the events that lead to it and I couldn't believe it at first.

I watched as a mortal, the soul in question, entered into the left entrance of a machine with two cylindrical chambers that were not connected and a short moment later exited from the right and then the left both identical and amazed at the sight of the other. Then the right chamber exploded and instantly killed the right, panic spread with the left so shocked they could not move and exactly ten seconds later was killed in the same manner as the left chamber exploded. It explained a part of the problem however it also made more questions and more so created some implications that did not sit right with me.

I called in the soul that was currently stuck in limbo, the metaphorical kind as the real one is just a storage now, and they moved from the old waiting queue, which was kept just for cases like these, toward my office. They entered clutching the pamphlet handed out also for cases like these titled: **A deadly flaw. Your moving on was interrupted, please be patient while the Grim look into it, after all eternity waits for you too.** Not the most comforting but at least well written to explain it all, and by the look on their face they had already read through it. I had them take a seat on the dated grey yet very comfortable couch and began explaining the situation from why they were flagged to my personal theories on what happened. Finally I gave them the floor as they probably had their own pieces of information to help solve this issue, and they in fact had just that.

The machine I had witnessed work and also kill was apparently a prototype cloning machine, something which would create a perfect copy of a physical object, a novel concept and now that I knew what it was a terrifying concept. It meant that the reason why they were flagged was because the machine not only copied the physical but the spiritual creating a second identical soul something which should most definitely not be possible, wither because it is unethical, unnatural, or in my opinion a major complication and possible wrench in our systems. I got to work sending messages to management about this invention and the current situation. Reaction time was always fast with at most a few minutes being needed to solve an issue, however the soul is still in my office hours later, with the only positive I have about it being that I finally have a partner to play games with while I wait for a response.",20
1laipjj,mxnrt23,"""The system has already taken care of you, you've been dead, long before you ever thought about becoming a time traveler. Your soul is already here and enjoying the afterlife that was originally meant for you.""

""Wait, what does that mean for me? What's going to happen to the me right now!?""

""You will slowly fade into nothing, as the folds of time slowly erase the ego that sits so arrogantly before me. You were warned of these things long before ever being able to set foot in your own time machine. While no one ever figured out the science behind it, the one rule that you all agreed upon was to not travel to fixed points. Travelling to fixed points meant death.""

""...but... I don't want to...""

""Just as I don't want to sift through thousands of millions of files manually while you all try to decide which was the best ending to WWII. For death's sake, that was such a nightmare before we implemented the current system.""

""...what can I do?""

""You've got two options really. You can live in the now, for all the better or worse that brings... Or you can live in the past. I'll let you rewatch your entire life, complete with sitcom laughter and music scoring, the works, you've got just enough time to relive it before you completely fade away.""

""...I think I... I would really like to watch that...""

I let out an exasperated sigh. ""Fine by me, take that door out, follow the hallway all the way to the end, third door on your... right? no, left, definitely left.""

""...Thank you, I guess""

The soul quietly, defeated, leaves my office. I sit at my desk and begin filing my report on the situation. Not the worst one I've had to deal with, but far from the best to be sure. My shift ends with no other issues and begin to make my way home. My family greats me warmly and we begin to get ready for dinner. 

""Should've chosen to live in the now"" I scoff to myself ""It's not too bad here once you get used to it.""",6
1laye76,mxp3p2g,"When the aliens first came in peace, they declared they would take away our most miserable humans and make them happy. At first, our world leaders thought this meant throwing all those trapped in poverty. The bottom of the rung. The lowest in the castes.

Turned out, the aliens saw our CEOs and political leaders as the unhappiest people too. Should've seen it coming, to be honest. After some futile exchange of firepower and a nuclear launch that mysteriously disappeared before hitting the alien's spaceship, we let them take whoever they wanted.

And then, they were gone. Just like that.

We humans filled the vacuum fast. Companies appointed new CEOs. We elected new leaders. In the massive shuffle, some people lost their jobs and hit the bottom of the rung. It was almost as though the aliens didn't manage to change anything after removing the unhappiest humans on earth. We were a rather depressing place to live overall, I guess.

It was only a year later, the aliens apologized and beamed back the people they took.

Turns out, they couldn't please those humans. They had grossly underestimated human greed and desire. Humans could only be temporarily pleased by what the aliens gave before wanting more. And more. And more, until the aliens conceded there was no end to this. There was always more to want, there was always something better out there.

Now, there was chaos. The old leaders wanted their positions back. The new leaders weren't about to back down. The lines were drawn. New elections were called for. Finances were fought over. Some country leader almost launched a nuke, only to be stopped by the aliens, who were regretting their attempt to bring happiness to the most miserable of mankind. 

There was only so much the aliens could do. They could disarm us so we didn't destroy each other in mutually assured destruction. They could provide material comforts and try to fulfil wishes. Temporarily. but they couldn't do anything to actually make us happy for long. They couldn't make us stop being flawed humans with endless desires.

As World War III erupted, it was at this moment, the aliens knew, they fucked up.

1ladvvf,mxk1ldo,"I chuckle, as I am chased by a hero.  
As I duck from a blow, I realize how to make my headquarters completely self-sufficient.  
It is a wonder, to be honest.  
My powers and intelligence scale based on how much pressure I feel under.  
As the hero keeps getting closer, and the hits almost land, I get a huge boost, and I escape.  
I get back to my hideout, and start renovating it.  
Though, it feels a bit odd.  
Why do I always manage to escape?  
Eh, maybe the boost catches them by surprise.

  
Day by day, I try making my plans work.  
Alas, without pressure, I can't really figure them out, but I can't complain.  
My civilian persona is an accountant, so I get plenty of ideas while I am at my day-job.  
Also...  
I started dating recently, and I love her, adore her, she's perfect.  
I don't know what I did to deserve meeting such an angel, but...  
I am about to meet her really strict parents.  
And oh boy, the pressure is building up.

  
Well, my phone is powered by a stable star reactor.  
I just cured 18 incurable diseases, and I know how to disseminate this information for it to be unable to be blocked, or faked, or stolen from me.  
Have created a way to give superpowers to non-powered individuals.  
Have created a bacteria that will eat away all the plastic, and other pollutants it can find, then simply dissolve in non-harmful elements.  
And I still have 2 more days until I met her parents.  
God...I am a wreck.  
And all the power, and intelligence can't help me find a way to calm down or impress them.  
And the heroes noticed this.



""You okay, Pressuro?"" Mr. Rays, asks me, as he stops throwing sunlight at me.  
""Yeah, just under a lot of pressure.  
Meeting my girlfriend's parents."" I chuckle, but he freezes.  
I have been easily avoiding his attacks.  
""Relax, they will like you. But they will like you even more if you aren't a villain."" he says, before flying away.  
That was weird.  
I leave, and for the next day I busy myself.  
When its time to meet the parents, I am a shivering mess.  
""Relax, they will love you!"" my girlfriend says, as the door opens.  
""Dad! Mom!"" she says, hugging the two who appeared...and I froze.  
For with my current intelligence, I instantly recognize them.  
Mr. Ray and Captain Volcano...two top-tier heroes, and apparently, the parents of the love of my life.  
""H-Hello! I am John S-Smith, a pleasure to meet you!"" I say, trying to keep it chill.  
I hope they don't recognize me, but if they do...

All the cowardly clerks start running for a back door. 
I turn as the first guard reaches me, laying hands on me. 
Guard 1 “listen here fellow “

I turn my head, flick my hand. Guard 1 flies backwards into the wall. Landing with a thud. 
I flick my fingers, Guards 2 & 3 , smash against each other crumpling to the floor. 

The vein on my head throbs, all the computers in the county clerk’s office explode. 
I strut out the door. 
Vending machines empty their contents. Parking meters wilt and bend over to the side walk. 

I think to my super AI , Sindy , “ send out the new system to replace the local government computer system, setup, have AI Bob run operations and storage.  Replace all employees with new pleasant robots”. 

Thinking “Sindy let’s buy that de-commissioned base outside the city. “ 
Sindy responds “John there is a silent alarm at your bank, apparently it is being robbed, I have deployed the robot squad. But you are around the corner “. 

I think back “ yes yes, I am on my way. That is where I keep my gold.”

I break into a sprint. 

I arrive at the doors, there is a U-Haul truck parked half on and off the curb. 

I pull open the doors, pausing to catch my breath. I yanked the doors open.  I strolled into the lobby. 

5 individuals dressed all in black with ski masks covered faces, holding a variety of weapons. One with a male voice was yelling for the tellers to empty their drawers, while a female voice was screaming, who is the manager.  A individual by the doors noticed me. Starts to raise his shotgun barrel to point at me. The others are occupied with the employees and customers of my bank. 

I flick my wrist, shotgun guy crumples to floor. 
I YELL “ STOP, HOW DARE YOU!”

Every one falls silent and turns their attention to me. 

Good, vein throbbing, waving both hands, like I am conducting a symphony.  I lift up the four of the robbers simultaneously. Slamming them into the ceiling then down to the floor, and up and down many times. Till I heard someone vomit 🤮. I figured I might have over done it a bit. As I let their crumpled bodies rest on the floor. 
The robot squad arrived, my robots began escorting customers then employees out to parking lot. 
The police arrived as I walked away. 

I glanced up in the sky, is that Miss Marvelous. Guess better to be late than never. 

I think to Sindy, “make sure the vault stays locked down “ “can’t have the law and Miss Marvelous sniffing around my gold “ 

Where are all the buses ? 

Sindy replies “someone stole all the diesel for the buses and trucks “

I get angry as I have to walk everywhere now. “Ok Sindy put out we need more employees for our new hydrogen fuel plant and for our hydrogen fuel buses. I just don’t have enough workers to build. “ 

Sindy asks “ have you decided what you want to do about henchmen, I mean employees healthcare?” 

I think at Sindy “yes, we are going to hostile takeover Memorial Hospital, beef staff with robots and all those Veterans we hired at job fair. All employees get free care as long as they treat at our hospital. “  

Sitting in n my office, I say out loud. “Sindy, I want barren land around the base we bought. I have an idea how to make it fertile for crops. “  

Sindy asks “do you want to buy it?” 

I replied “ steal, foreclose or pay as little as possible. “ 

Sindy says, “John , Miss Marvelous has just arrived.”

“Tell security to allow her in “ I said.

1la8u3x,mxjugp9,"He stood before me, a mountain of a man with hands as large as snow shovels, still holding the crushed bodies of the two heroes who tried to stop him from throwing a fuel truck into the children's hospital. The explosion blew up the gas main.

For a few minutes, bricks, mortar, and human body parts rained down on him, making him chuckle. I was close to him, so I could hear him muttering, ""...like tears in the rain,"" before he laughed.

I could almost touch him, but I opted to stay hidden and take a few steps back, as the falling debris and blood might have revealed my invisible form.

Screams and cries filled the air as parents, who had rushed to save their children, realized there was nothing left to save.

I shouldn't be bothered by all this.

Society never did anything for me but shunned me and kicked me in the face.

Why should I help them?

Could I even help them? I had never unleashed my powers beyond playing pranks on stupid supes.

My eyes locked onto a tiny hand on the floor, clutching a teddy bear soaked in blood.

It was so small. It could fit in the palm of my hand like a marble.

So small.

I couldn’t see. Everything was misty. The tears burned as they rolled down my cheeks.

I could feel a numb pain in my jaw. Why was I grinding my teeth so hard?

It took me a minute to recognize this rage swelling inside me.

Kids never hurt me.

Kids loved me.

Even if their parents told them to stay away since I wasn't a good role model with all those practical jokes they didn’t care.

They would laugh, point at me, share their sweets and fruit, and ask me funny little questions.

Kids never did anything to deserve this.

They didn’t get a chance to make up their minds, to choose a side.

My knuckles were white from squeezing my fists too hard.

He turned, looking straight into my eyes:

""I can smell you, coward. I can feel your fear. Run. Run, or you’ll end up just like these puny humans, crushed into a bloody pul—""

I lost control.

One of my arms swung—faster than sound—with a crack like a jet breaking the sound barrier. He didn’t even get a chance to blink before it made contact with his jaw, the bones piercing his cheeks and being ground into dust from the force of the blow.

The blow didn’t just crush most of his head—it launched him into a low orbit.

A few minutes later, I saw the rest of him burning up as he reentered the atmosphere.

His ashes mixed with the rubble and body parts, falling on crying parents like black snow.

I wiped my tears, and his ashes left dark lines on my cheeks.

A little bit of chaos. A lot of glitter.  
Barely a villain. Just enough to keep the heroes annoyed and amused.

But it's just a role.  
A performance.  
A mask with a sweeping grin wide enough to hide the truth.  
Because there's a shadow beneath the laughter—older than the city, colder than the midnight streets.  
A presence I don't let anyone notice.

I've been around longer than anyone remembers.  
I ended empires when their first stone temples stood.  
I whispered the last breath from gods, whose names have been lost to dust.  
And then...  
I got tired...

You can't understand what it's like to carry that many endings.  
To hold every final heartbeat, every last scream...  
Every mother's last goodbye...

So I walked away from it.  
I folded up my cloak and buried my blade at the edge of the universe.  
I made a new name for myself.  
I wrapped myself up in bright clothes for once.  
I surrounded my life with jokes and pranks.  
And smiles.  
And for a while, I forgot.  
I lived.  
I laughed.

She was Beacon.  
She wasn't just light—she was warmth.  
Not flashy, like the other heroes.  
She didn't try to be famous, just kind.  
She's the one who saved people who didn't make the headlines.  
She called me her friend.  
Oftentimes we would sit on the rooftops after she stopped one of my ""crimes"".  
We would eat greasy fries and make jokes back and forth.  
I liked her more than I should have.  
Quiet smiles. Quick glances. Moments where my mask almost slipped.  
I don't know if she ever saw through me, or if she even tried.  
But I could be with her, and nothing else would matter.

Then came Oblivion...  
He didn't come to conquer, he came to erase.  
Voidfire tore through my city. Heroes tried to stop him.  
They all died.

Just a slight redirection, so the superheroes would never actually hit hard, by ensuring they were half a foot further back, just for a brief moment on ""impact"".  They always thought it was some sort of kinetic storage skill that let me absorb their blows.  Left me as a warning that only the heaviest hitters could throw down with me, and that I was too irritating to actually jail.

Heh.  And when the heavy hitters came in, complaining about my being a waste of time, the pranks were hilarious.  Training them in case a monster came around, or some threat we'd have to team up for, even if they never realized it.

Glitter bombs, burning bags full of dog poop that they'd never picked up behind them as they walked their dogs.  Mailing them various things at their homes and jobs, just to mess with them.

Oh, I can't forget the paint grenades in their underwear and sock drawers!  They still haven't figured out how I'm doing it!

""It wasn't like all those other kids that do crimes, not really.  I did it for the laughs, to mess with them, not to steal.  To bring smiles to the kids, to ensure they'd have a good laugh."" I admit, in the privacy of my own mind.  ""Can't be too careful with what I whisper, after that one guy who could hear whispers came to town.  What was his name again?  Whisperbro?

Then I pause, looking down at a new shadow on the ground in the alleyway, before slowly looking up.

My attention focuses firmly on the flying saucer shaped thing of one 'Professor Aeromind, Villain Extraordinaire'.  I can't help but put my face in my free palm.

Seems like my break's over with.

It's a simple matter to amplify the distance of where I am, so I'm in my hidden lair.

A few moments to change, and I'm ready to face off with my most annoying foe yet... a villain that didn't realize I was training the heroes for extra-terrestrial foes, rather than them.

""And now,"" I muse as I reappear, putting on my voice of HAM as I walk past the local news crew, ""it's time for the Irritant to walk once more!  To irritate the heroes, to mess with the villains, and to make national TV collectively wonder if they're smoking something, and if so, why they're not sharing with their audiences!""

I grin, as the police cordon aptly freaks out at the realization that I somehow got past them.

Then my frown dies, as I spot a badly injured Blackjack on the ground, missing one arm.  Idly, I focus and amplify how fast his healing is countering the blood loss.  Won't be any good if I trained him this far, only for him to die on me, right?

""Ah, Blackjack.  It looks like you've been disarmed by a foe!"" I smile under my mask, letting him see my toothy grin.  ""Needing some help there, old acquaintance?  Perhaps a hand?""

""I would rather die than take help from a vi-wait, it's YOU."" Blackjack snarls, before blinking at the slow realization that I'm in front of him as his snarling rant dies, replaced by confusion.

""Buddies not faring so well?""  I ask, looking up at the flying saucer overhead.  Distantly, I can make out loud laughter, and screams of ""This is the end for you fools!"" from the distant craft.

""That's an understatement.  He's figured out how to use dimensional warping to displace arms and legs."" Blackjack admits.  ""I'm bleeding out, and my Super Dudes are up there without me as their heavy hitter.""

Idly, I focus, and with a twitch of power, I amplify how fast the warping technology will take before it runs out.

Both of us stare, as an almost eldritch looking monster claw drops in front of Blackjack rather than a human hand.

""Was that my hand?!""  Blackjack stares in utter terror, as I finally let myself frown.

""Looks like he's cooked up something new and irritating.""  I finally admit aloud.

""No sh-"" Blackjack starts to snarl, as I put up one finger in front of his lips.

""Not in front of the camera crews, Blackjack!  You're a hero, after all.  Act the part."" I amplify my whisper into his ear, ensuring the cameras don't pick it up.

""You're right.  As much as it pains me to admit it, I don't think your villainous ways are going to be up to snuff against whatever the mad Professor has cooked up this time, Irritant."" Blackjack shakes his head.  ""So long as the power source of that craft is giving him nigh-unlimited power, we have no chance against him!""

Idly, I look up, before the flying saucer starts smoking as I amplify the main reactor of the ship, into a distant sun.  Just to be safe, after all.  No risk chancing him having made some crazy failsafe bomb or something.

Watching it lose power and drop, I amplify how slow it's going, so it looks more like a controlled descent than a crash.  Inside, I can hear screaming from Professor Aeromind, as he discovers the joy of all his technology failing to work without it's precious power source.

""How did it fail?""  Blackjack stares in confusion.

""Perhaps an irritation happened, which left his technology aimed upon it's own power core?"" My grin at Blackjack never wavers.

Slowly, the hero raises one finger up while staring at me, then lowers it.  ""I swear, if your superpower is LEGITIMATELY being the most irritating person in existence, I'm going to want to hurt you.""  He finally bites out.

""Ah, my old foe.  It's not your skills.  It's how you use them!  Now, I've been working hard at making sure there's a 'no killing' policy on the villains side of things, and you've been working to do the same for the heroes.  Shall we both be irritating for our mutual nemesis and introduce him to what happens when heroes and villains team up to deal with people like him, that don't get the memo?""  I whisper into his ear, amplifying the sound once more.

Slowly, Blackjack grins to match mine, as he realizes exactly what my plan is.

For once, we're on the same exact page.

I'm going to enjoy paying Professor Aeromind a beating.



A few days later, I'm casually sipping on another ice cold drink with lots of flavored shaved ice, from a corner store, as I walk through the city once more.

The heroes have finally realized I may have more tricks up my sleeve than they realize.

Alas, for poor Professor Aeromind, his discovery of what it would be like to lose all four of his limbs during transport has rather become irritating for him.  Somehow they wound up in the middle of the sun.

Hmm.  Pity his plans for replacing the Super Dudes with a legion of mind controlled parasites grafted onto their bodies, somehow failed in it's entirety.

Somehow the parasite infected limbs wound up in the sun, too!

And if I'm subtly working in the background to amplify how many superheroes and supervillains might rise up with new healing powers, or powers involving building prosthetic limbs, who's to know?

No fuss, no muss, no issues.

And I get back to messing with Blackjack, by buying him one of the things I'm slurping on, just to irritate the hell out of him.

""Hey there, buddy.  Looks like you're missing a hand!  So let me give you one, by buying you one of these on me, huh?"" is the last thing he hears before I drop one into his remaining hand, and walk off.

""Hey, you left the straw cover on!  I can't get it off with one hand!"" is what I distantly hear from him as I walk out of sight, before I let my grin fade as I realize I'd forgotten something important the past few days.

It's a bit past time to amplify the length between alien invasion attempts, again.

The local stars are starting to run out of room with the last 57 attempts, due to their new super-metals in their star ships.  Whatever they've started to come up with that keeps their ships safe, at least.  And it's seriously getting on MY nerves.

Then a ranting Blackjack, still in civilian guise rounds the corner, shouting about ""You should get this straw cover off for me, you irritating- *wait a minute.""*

To grin or not to grin, and possibly let him realize it's me.  That is the question.",113
1la8u3x,mxlmfpk,"""Oh great heavens, what is going on here?"" i say looking at the few corpses on the ground, some battered heroes all around and some edgelord in dark armor covered in blood.

One of the supes turned to me and with angry tone screamed: ""We really don't have time to deal with your bullshit now Mustachio!""

To be honest i got a bit offended. It was ""Mr. Mustachio"" he wasn't my friend or lover to call me by just ""Mustachio"" Nevertheless my grin never wavered. I fixed my top hat, smoothed out my black coat and twirled my moustache.

""Oh but there is no need for such foul language friend. Who knows? Maybe i'm not going to do any mischief today. Pray tell me, who is this goon over there?"" - I answered him and he looked at me flabbergasted before he took a deep breath and shared some information.

""He calls himself Krieg. He surfaced a month ago and began going from town to town doing damage, stealing etc. We managed to stop him everytime so far but it's not looking good..."" - he looked uncertain, some minor wounds on his arms propably didnt help his confidence

""I see, thank you, it's rare to see such wise younglings like you these days. Sleep well, you might have just saved the rest of your friends"" i said while extending my cane forward. 

""Sleep? What are you talking abou--"" He didn't finish the thought. At the same time he stopped talking entire battlefield fell quiet. Including all the heroes, Krieg himself and propably half the town

Slowly without haste i walked towards - now uncouncious - man in dark armor. I took a rock that was laying nearby and sat on it. 

""Wake up friend. It is unbecoming of a knight to rest during battle.""

He shook his head as he looked at me, clearly struggling to wake up. 

""What the fuck just happened? Why was i sleeping... "" - he looked around - ""The fuck?! Why are they sleeping?!"" 

I shook my head - ""Calm down knight, by using such dirty words you bring shame to your fellows. Why don't you sit down and talk with me for bit hmm?"" 

He still looked confused. After a bit he sat down near me and looked at me warily - ""Who are you? What did you do?!"" - he asked his voice clearly not very calm. 

""Now now, calm your nerves, all in due time. I am Mr. Mustachio. I am a local expert in everything villainy, a true master of devious plans and a gentleman that makes all ladies weak in their knees"" - i handed him my business card and continued - "" What did i do you ask? Well I simply stopped you from breaking everything"" - i laughed

He looked even more confused. ""But why?! It says on your business card you are a villain, why stop me?! If you joined me, you could just make them fall sleep and we would have won easily!"" 

""No, no, no friend, you don't understand. I am not interested in you winning! If you killed all the heroes. What would i do? You can't be a villain without some heroes silly goose!"" - he looked at me as if I was insane, but he was somewhat used to that i guess since he didn't really press me on the matter. 

""But what kinda trick you used? How did you make us all fall asleep? It seems very convenient, i wanna buy whatever you used off you."" - he said with a smile. 

I smiled in response - ""You are wrong again friend! I used no trick, it's unbecoming of a gentleman to do that! I only play with the cards I've been give by fate. Nature itself has given me power to dominate the will of others you see!"" 

I saw him focus his gaze on me. I now had his sole attention

""Seems very powerful... And you could affect me... What are you doing in this shitty town? If you wanted to be a true villain im sure with that power you could have made it big.""

My smile widened more - ""And you wouldn't be wrong my friend! Let me tell you a secret, just between us. I actually used to rule you!"" - i saw him furrow his brows before and tense up as i continued - ""And i dont mean just you, i mean all of you! The whole world was mine!"" 

He took a step back - ""What are you talking about? That's impossible..."" - i looked at him - ""Is that so? Then why did you just take a step back? Did you perhaps remembered something? Or rather... Is it possible i let you remember something?"" 

He went pale and his knees went out in an instant- ""no No NO THERE IS NO WAY! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO? HOW DID I FORGET YOU... YOU FUCKING MONSTER GET AWAY FROM ME"" 

Now this was a reaction i was more used to back in the day 

""You see power to dominate wills is really, Really powerful, you can make someone bring you coffee, bend their knees, kill their family, or make the whole world forget you ever existed. But it gets boring pretty quickly... Sometimes you just want to go smaller you know?"" - i stood up and began walking in his direction

""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU JUST LET ME GO I WILL DO WHATEVER PLEASE..."" - his voice broke down - ""please just let me go...."" - he was almost whimpering at this point.

""I would let you go friend. But..."" - i look at one of the corpses laying nearby - ""You see the one with golden cape laying over there? I liked that one, he was so nice he even went out on tea with me once!"" 

He was terrified. Tears steaming down his face as pure terror set in, some, or most of it implanted by me. I wanted him to taste true fear. 

""So now, why don't you do me a favor, fly away from here, go into the ocean and once you are... Let's say 500 meters under the surface take off your helmet okay?"" 

""NO NO, PLEASE FORGIVE ME I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN PLE-"" he didn't finish. His body unvoluntarily set off the engines and flew off. 

I took out my pocket watch and checked the time - ""If they wake up in 5 minutes i think it would suffice... I'll make them think a meteor hit or something..."" - i talked to myself as I started walking away not really in mood for more villainy today. 

""ah"" - i remembered - ""i need to take out my hilariously oversized money bag from laundry, tomorrow will be a truly legendary stunt for Mr. Mustachio, Muahahaha""",49
1la8u3x,mxiz5w2,"I am doing the thing I usually do as a villain: have fun.  
So I tease, and flirt with the ladies at the market, and all around town to be honest.  
Annoy some patrolling heroes.  
Every now and then take something without paying, and chuckle as I run away.  
It is fun.  
As I am charming this new flower shop owner, whom I tried to impress for weeks now, hard to get women, but it is so worth, a huge explosion shocks us.  
I protect her from collapsing rubble.

  
""Thank you."" she says.  
I smile at her, and want to work my charms, as I finally got the opportunity, but several other explosions occur.  
I protect her, and take her out of the store, but seeing her life in ruins...she faints.  
I am pissed.  
""Who the fuck ruined my chance?"" I mutter, as I teleport away.  
In the middle of the town, a villain is laughing, as he is waving around one of the superheroes' arm.  
""Is this what you can do? This is all you heroes amount to?!  
Ha! This town will be mine from now on!"" he laughs, throwing the hand away.  
I catch it, and take it to the hero...  
He always plays along.

  
""Who are you?"" the villain asks.  
""Prankster! Run! He is a real villain!"" one of the heroes say.  
I chuckle.  
Man, how lucky I am.  
""I am the villain of this town, so piss off newbie."" I say to him.  
He laughs, and attacks me, raining down what seems a miniature sun on me.  
I sneeze, and it is snuffed out.  
He freezes.  
""Sorry, did I destroy your toy?"" I ask.  
""Who are you?"" he asks gravely.  
I snap my fingers, and every hero, and citizen, and camera gets some nighty-nighty time.  
I don't want them to know.  


""This town is my playground. Once again, piss off, before I get mad."" I smile at the villain.  
He snorts.  
""Do you know who you are talking to?!"" he roars, as 9 suns appear behind him, starting to melt the surroundings.  
I slap him away, and watch as he flies into the sun.  
""If you like suns so much, go take a hike in one."" I mutter, and snap my fingers.  
The town is restored, and the people slowly wake up, with faint memories of what happened.  
I chuckle, and go back to talk with Flora.  
She's a bit cold once more, after all, she forgot that I saved her...  
Oh, I should have tortured the dude more, though, to be honest.  
I like a challenge.  
""Hey Flora..."" I smile, as I watch her roll her eyes, but there is a slight smile there, hidden.  
I am getting there, slowly.",263

He turns and watches the upstart to his eyes...

1la8u3x,mxll6e4,"The Mountain of a Creature out of Lovecraft horror novel stood in the middle of Downtown. 
The Amazing 5 super heroes lay torn to pieces on the ground around the Creature feet. 
The Creature was chewing on the last head he had just bitten off of Girl Wonder. 
Major Euro head was gone, presumably eaten before I arrived. The IT was just stones scattered across the ground.  
The twins Freeze and Fire lay on the ground missing arms and legs, heads crushed. 
Lots of blood everywhere, I mean buckets and buckets of blood.  

I could feel my rage growing. 
I stepped out into the open. 

“STOP , you vile and foul beast, how dare you? HOW DARE YOU???” I yell at the beast. 

The Creature stops chewing and looks down its nose at me. Says “run and hide little huuumen, I sense no power in you “.

I grit my teeth, ball my hands into tight fists. Concentrate, one by one veins bulge on my forehead. 

The Creature right arm moves, grabbing a bus from the street near by. 
The Creature right arm slams the bus into its own face over and over. The Creature left hand tries to stop its right, to no avail. 
Soon the Creature is rolling on the ground left hand and both feet trying to stop its right arm from bashing the bus into it face. Black blood and gore fly from the continuous beating. 

Time passes, the Creature is Laying limp on the. I let the right arm fall to the ground. The bus falls out of its dead fingers. 

I collapse to the ground exhausted. I need rest. 

I wake up in the back of a police car, handcuffed. A officer reads my rights. 

“What the Hell am I being arrested for? “  I sputtered out. 

Officers chuckled, “ sir you didn’t pay for your burrito at Taco Alarm  before you ran off. The manager is pressing charges and wants you trespassed. “  

Why do I always get in trouble for the petty shite?",23
1la8u3x,mxmbdfn,"Thirty minutes into the hostage situation and I was really running out of steam. I'd only prepared enough material for about five minutes of monologue, but I'd only heard about the financial troubles of The Buns yesterday and if I didn't act soon my favorite bakery would be shuttered. So I'd been improvising. And after half an hour of improvised villain monologue it gets pretty hard to avoid repeating yourself or to say something that someone might take seriously enough to use as real inspiration. I wanted to avoid a Manson cascade. I usually took pride in my monologues, but this had been a rush job. Historically opposed to the idea, I decided next time to use AI.

I was about to start reiterating my points on how bank notes were printed by moon men when I saw the sluggish form of Stupendous Man meander through the air, and then slowly craahed through the plate glass window at the front of the bank.

""Stop raiding that vault, villain, or soon you'll be the one locked up!"" He extolled. Oh Paul. Those improv classes aren't really helping.

""That's far enough, STUPID-nous man!"" I said. ""Come any closer and I'll..."" uh... well, who was I to judge in the banter game? ""Do something we'll all regret!""

""Not so fast, you fiend!"" He said, flying towards me. Stupendous Man was the best hero in the city, which is to say woefully inadequate. He'd managed to double his flight speed since I started working with him, but it was still maxing out at around a dozen miles per hour.

I forced myself to stammer as he flew up to me, landed, squared up and then wound up for a punch. Paul could lift a few tons, but his striking strength was barely above a civilian who did pushups. Plus he was slow. And he telegraphed EVERYTHING. I'd been planning to get him into boxing classes. I knew the owner of a boxing gym downtown, who'd taught me to fight when I was a teen, a real stand up guy who ran free classes to underprivileged youth. I planned to do something to threaten the gym, and Stupendous Man would swoop in to stop me, and the owner, in his gratitude, would offer to train him for free. It would be a win win situation. The gym would get a little fame, and new paying customers to help pay the bills, it would be slightly more convincing to throw these fights. I decided to move up my timetable on that. I'd do it as soon as I could write a convincing monologue.

What would the theme be? Something about keeping the city weak so I could more easily dominate it? Something along those lines. Then a thought occurred. Maybe boxing wasn't right for Paul. There was a Muy Tai place that just opened. And a mixed martial arts place. Grappling would be great for him with that lifting strength. But the MMA place was across town for Paul and the last thing I wanted was more of his time spent stuck in traffic.

Paul drove a beat up 92 Buick with shoddy air conditioning and a radio that only worked sometimes, and I know getting across town in that thing, during rush hour, wasn't pleasant. And flying was even slower for him. So he liked to drive somewhere, find somewhere inconspicuous, and then change into his costume. He ran a food bank and paid himself a salary that only vaguely resembled a 5 digit number. In his free time, when he wasn't dealing with me, he volunteered. Everywhere. He built houses, he worked in the soup kitchen, read to kids at the library, walked the dogs in the shelter. He cleaned litter in the local parks and led a scout troop. It had gotten to the point that I needed to monitor his schedule to plan my villainy so I didn't interrupt him.

His punch connected, and I reacted appropriately. I rocketed backwards, flipping end over end, modifying my course to avoid one of the ""hostages"" who had begun to stand up. I collided with the wall of the vault, making sure to hit hard enough to leave a me shaped hole in the plaster that covered the reinforced vault wall. I'd impacted upside down, and teleported a blood capsule into my mouth and bit down. I pried myself free, falling to the ground, and slowly stood, making sure to sway a little like I couldn't get my balance.

A trickle of ""blood"" ran from my lip and I spit the rest of the capsule out. If I did it right, they might think it was a tooth. ""Is that all you've got?"" I slurred, squaring up.

""I'm just getting started!"" Stupendous man said. He lifted gingerly off the ground, ambled forward through the air and raised his fist for another punch. He wasn't going to land for this one? He was learning!

With a yelp I dove out of the way. He glided over me as I scrambled to my feet, pulling myself behind the teller desk. Stupendous man landed in  front of a kid who gaped up at him. ""Don't worry, lad, you're safe now."" He said, confidently, and turned towards me.

""We'll see how safe you can make anyone!"" I screamed, and ripped a pen from the desk, the little bead chain with it. I spun it around. ""You've heard the pen is mightier than the sword, but in my hands it's deadlier, too! Take this!"" I released the pen, and it sailed across the lobby and bounced harmlessly against his chest.

He stared down at it for a moment before locking eyes with me again. ""Looks like you brought a pen to a sword fight. Should have brought a sword! Now get ready to face my swords."" He held up a fist. ""Justice."" He held up his other fist. ""And honor."" I quickly did the math, calculating how much I'd need to increase my donations to the theater group so that they could open a second location close to Paul's house, allowing him to attend improv classes more frequently. I'd need to make sure a studio was available, the yoga place would work. I figured an unexpected windfall of half a million would let the owner retire. I'd need to make sure nobody else rented the place in the meantime, that tattoo artist had an eye on the space but I preferred to keep her downtown, there was a bus stop for the local school right there and I'd rather the kids see actors when they got off the bus than a tattoo artist. Although the tattoo artist did need a new location, the little strip mall wasn't getting much foot traffic these days, and if I moved her out I could turn it into a medical plaza, which would be much more convenient for the retirement community just outside town. Where would I put her? There was the spot besides the dive bar, but her work was pretty tasteful and the clientele there wouldn't appreciate it. Well, that was ok, the bar owner could move in to the old Thai restaurant that closed down a few years back. It wouldn't be hard to get him in there, and I could arrange for him to win tickets to some tropical destinations to inspire him to convert it to a tiki place. We needed a good tiki bar downtown.",18
1la8u3x,mxkz1ri,"The moth was pissed, this was his playground! These bulbs were HIS to bonk, those cotton fabrics were HIS to destroy, and damnnit! Those self righteous heroes were his to annoy the shit out of too. 

He perched on a building, wings folded, scanning. He was not going to let someone named ""dread"" ruin his fun. He killed two speedsters (he forgot their names), The meercat, and even good ol bosco. 

He saw it almost immediately, four meta humans, dressed all the same, trying to fight dread, in the middle of the sky, they weren't even from their lovely city of Alecville. They seemed to be losing. The moth didn't want to be a hero.  but being rich gives you access to some strange but completely legal things, like a colony of carnivore moths that can eat a cow in two minutes. That could be used for good, 

He flapped away, the moth had trained his little buddies to only eat dread shaped foods, hoping they would only crave the organic locally sourced asshole that decided to ruin everything. 

He was treading air beneath the five meta humans when he released his henchmen and henchwomen. 

The moth did not look. It was rather ugly just hearing dread scream as he lived the very common nightmare of being eaten by creepy crawlies. He did her the faint clatter of clean bones hit the ground as the moths slowly returned to their master. 

The four meta humans looked at him, in awe and shock, a nobody with wings just appeared out of nowhere and dissolved a tier one villain.

The moth tried his best to sound evil, 

""Let this be a lesson to anyone who encroaches on the mild annoyances of the moth!"" 

The four heroes quickly took him by the arms and dragged him across the sky, the one who looked like their leader turned to the supposed villain. ""I really do not care if you think you are a villain, the whole city owes you a steak dinner... but that was just creepy. The blue defenders will never interfere with your annoyances if you don't do that again."" 

""Seriously! You saved my life today, but eugh!"" Another chimed in shuddering.",34
1la8u3x,mxmyay2,"It was they night they brought that Pollack wannabe's crap modern ""art"" to the museum. I walked up to the wall, then blipped past it.

That's what I call it when I teleport. Blipping.

It's how I started getting called ""The Blip"".

So I sauntered through the place, took a minute to appreciate the Renoir, put googly eyes on some statues, put their mummy in the Saturday Night FEVER pose. I was in no hurry. I had all night and I was going to treat that hideous set of squiggles like a paint by numbers set; I couldn't wait to see the artist have a meltdown at the premiere.

I turned a corner and that's when I saw them. Captain Virtue and The Peace Princess. The Violet Vindicator. The Hellsquirrel. Almost the whole damn Lawcorps roster. Their heads were on the floor, lined up in a row. Their bodies... I'd need a week to sort out who's was who's. They were just spare parts and stains.

Standing in the middle was The Kogethian. I still don't know where Kogeth is, but I really hope he was the exception. The last time he'd come to town, he'd said he was the harbinger of an invasion, but was banished.

The people who did the banishing were the peopleburger sprayed on the walls now.

""What... what did you do?""

The Kogethian looked up from beneath his hood.

""You are called Blip. Walk away and you will not suffer their fate. I have no quarrel and you're not my concern.""

To my surprise, I was shaking. Not with fear. With anger.

""You killed the Princess. Why did you do that?""

""You are a villain in their world. You have little power, but you use it to do as you please. You understand why.""

""Princess... helped people. The Captain was a tool and Hellsquirrel was a psychopath, but... they all helped people! How could you?""

""Do you mourn them? Pathetic.""

My blood went cold. I stopped being happy.

""Did you just insult me? How dare you... how dare you come to my world...?""

""Don't posture, worm."" The Kogethian laughed. ""You have never done anything more impressive than shift your body a few meters at a time and you do nothing but make fun of people. You're a buffoon. Now leave before I decided you've bored me.""

I started walking towards him. I hadn't figured out what I was doing yet... but this was not OK.

The robed conqueror raised a gauntleted hand. I felt the stirrings of his power. He was going to throw lightning at me I think. 

"" Worm... die.""

No lightning shot out though. His arm went limp at the elbow like a wet sock. He looked at it and as much as I felt his malice, I felt his surprise.

I dropped his radius and ulna on the floor.

""What? How?""

""Do you know what it takes to teleport? At least the way I do it? You have to be aware of every molecule, every subtle force. And then you shift some of them. Like your femurs.""

As they blipped into my hands, I tossed them on the floor, too. The Kogethian shrieked as he hit the floor.

He screamed at me.

""I'll kill you!""

""I'm still talking."" I brought his jaw to me this time. The hard way. Through his skin. 

""Kogeth, "" I said calmly. ""I feel everything for light years. All the time. I realize how pointless this mud ball is. I have a perspective even someone like you, who walks through worlds, can't begin to comprehend. And when I see the pride and pettiness of this tiny spec, it makes me want to demonstrate just how silly everyone is being.""

I gestured and the quarter deflated warlord rose into the air, held there because I decided it. He stared at me with utter contempt.

"" But you... you're just a dick.""

I crushed him into a super dense marble. Slowly. Over the next hour. I kept his body running so he'd feel it.

Then I left.

The painting seemed kind of irrelevant. Maybe tomorrow.",17

I was even nice enough to give the kids her crayons back when I was done with that piece.

Artistry is an interesting pursuit; to add is as important for a constructive sculpture (like combining trash), as removal is for reductive sculpture (like stone carving).

In all these pursuits, however, I maintain one simple rule. Nothing irreversible.

It sounds more restrictive than most think, you obviously can't kill, but you can steal. You obviously can't deface and practice reductive sculpture, but you *can* swap something with something that looks like you defaced or destroyed it. And painting ridiculous cartoon monocles on political posters is a time honored tradition. 

But for someone like me, the rules are that much more... maleable. Moldable. Like putty. That's because things, and to a degree even people, are flexible to my will. I can manipulate them so, but their minds can be altered, or they may suffer through longer term effects. 

That is not allowed, because the rule says it is not allowed, and I would be a poor artist if I did not keep true to my rules. 

So, I can modify people, but in minor ways. A snap of my fingers and their hair is dyed, a useless flourish with a marker, and the cartoon monocle appears on their face. But never damage to clothes. An embarrassment like that is never recoverable, let alone reversible.

Yet this upstart seems to believe that it is not me, but my tools that cause such changes. They have marched through, destroying scenery, breaking property, killing people. Little is left, and certainly not enough that it can be reverted. Especially not the lives lost. 

Yet for all their power, they have not yet faced a true reality warper. I issued a challenge, laid out salt in a large circle, and waited for their arrival. They came, they saw the circle, and they laughed, ""Are you making your death into a final art piece?""

""No, I'm amending my rule. That I may do irreversible things within these boundaries.""

""Then I shall strike you down without even entering.""

""You can try,"" I reply with an easy smile. 

And, credit where due, they try. They use beams of heat and of cold, they use physical projectiles, as well as ionizing radiation. From dessication to disintegration, they try their powers. Nothing passes beyond the ring of salt.

They seem to get worried at this, and turn to leave. At least they try to. You see, turning someone is quite reversible, so each time they turn, they end up facing me again. They turn left, they turn right, they get desperate and try to fall in their side.

No matter what they do, they end up facing me. I can't help but respond to their spirited efforts, ""Not the best somersault I've seen, but a good effort.""

""What are you?""

""Take a step into the circle, and I'd be happy to show you. Until then, consider me a rater spirited artist.""

They attempt to get away after I say that. An odd choice, since I just turn them towards me once again. Before they realize their mistake, they passed the salt boundary. 

And then they are stood there, shaking my hand. They turn to leave, but instead they are stood there, shaking my hand. They try to punch me, but just before it hits they are stood there, shaking my hand. They open their mouth to scream, yet silently they are stood there, shaking my hand. They attempt to punch their own chest, trying to just be done with this, but before that they are stood there, shaking my hand.

""I told you it would be irreversible,"" I say, ""I never said it would be something as blasé as your death.""

Horror begins to dawn, but it doesn't have time to set in. Not least because they are stood there, shaking my hand.

At least until I'm bored with them.",8
1la8u3x,mxphw3t,"Professor Power looks over the smoking ruins of Brook City; a metropolis laid to waste by one person. Cars were upturned and reduced to mangled wreckages. Streetlights bent and ripped in half by overwhelming force. The bodies of innocents. Civilian, military, police. All rendered equal in this massacre. 

And the one thing that fills the Professor's mind the most, is Star Aqua holding the lifeless, broken body of Star Silver. Two of a famous retinue of magical hero women, having modeled themselves equally on magical girls younger than they and amazonians who prided themselves on strength and combat. Star Rosé is nowhere to be seen... 

Until the smoke in front of the warrior women clears and a hulking brute stands tall, Star Rosé held between it's monstrous fingers. A maw filled with malice and hatred, twisting into a sickening grin of sadistic satisfaction. The Mauler loved broken things! So much more beautiful than untarnished ones. 

Professor Power was never a violent man. He had never sought to bring harm to the Star Sisters, only to improve them through conflict. After all, to overcome a trial one must grow, and through growth one becomes strong. Power was in his name; he had enjoyed watching these young women become heroes in their own right. He had hounded them, an eternal antagonistic teacher since their days as the Galaxy Three, their former magical girl epithet. 

But today, he would bring his all to bear. 

The sky darkens, clouded over by an army of nanomachines. Technology imbued with the Professor's own will, his own incredible intellect. Every piece of technology down to the last molecule was his to command. And today, the command would be: 

""Kill."" 

The Mauler is launched backward by a massive machine. So massive that it rivals the maniacal monster in sheer strength. The machine hisses with steam and fury, hydraulic strength rocketing it forward like a train on a path of pure destruction. The Mauler roars and fights back, but is swiftly surrounded by two more of such machines. It is beaten brutally around the wreckage of the city, only managing to bring one of the mighty drones down with his ineffective might. Pain could deter a human opponent, but against metal? There was no stopping a six hundred pound mindless hulk of fury and metal, let alone two of them. 

By the end of the battle, the Mauler is crucified in the ruins of Brook City, a warning to every and all villains who might hurt the Star Sisters again. 

The Professor of Power was very educated in the ways in which one could be destroyed systematically, as strength comes from pain too. As the limbless, deaf and debilitated Mauler came to know.",6
1la8u3x,mxkjgnh,"Just a nitpick, oxygen tanks don't explode, at least not like combustible gas.  
Even shooting an oxygen tank with something that blows a hole will just make it violently eject itself as the compressed oxy jets out, and feeding the sparks made from the shot into a short lived display  of fireworks.

I ran like I hadn't done in eons.  
I ran with purpose...

I ran through flames and falling steel, through screams and silence.  
I ran like the world would end if I didn't reach her in time.

When I got there, he was raising his blade.  
Beacon—bloody, cracked, was still trying to stand.  
Then the strike came down.  
And I was there.  
I caught it in one neon gloved hand.  
And time stopped.

Oblivion reeled back, laughing. ""You? The Jester?""  
I looked at him, my bright colors fading.  
The mask was gone. The smile, cracked.   
The lie, burned away.

""I was The Jester,"" I said. ""But before that, I was something more...""  
He pulled back his blade, it's flames charring the color from my costume.  
""You won't be enough! I've ended GODS!"" he screamed.  
I stepped forward. The smoke and ash swirling and forming around me.  
""Only because you were allowed to,"" I said.  
And a black hood of ash formed over me.

He lashed out. Voidfire, antimatter, gravity bombs.  
Every cosmic trick a petty 'god' could conjure.  
They curved and missed.  
Many simply undid themselves before reaching me.

I was the reckoning.

""And you are supposed to be...""

Unmade not by force, but by the universe erasing him.

She was barely breathing.  
Her light flickered—low, and fragile.   
The thread of her life stretched thin in the air between us.

The guiding hand on a cold shoulder.  
The silence in the room.

1la8u3x,mxmbet4,"But what would I do with the old dive bar once he left? Ah, the community college would be wrapping up the year soon, I'd pose as an entrepreneur and hire a few people in the culinary arts program to turn it into a little hipster place. The kind where people who love to smell their own farts spend $25 on an all grass fed truffle burger and the fries are an extra order. That denographic was rather insufferable, but it was hard to have a thriving art community without them. It would also help the little art gallery around the block and the chocolatier across the street.

The next punch connected, another one where he didn't stop to land. It sent me sailing straight into the vault, directly into the stacks of cash, which exploded in every direction, starting a rain of money in the small room. My impact with the vault wall rang loudly and left a sizable me shaped dent. With a thought, I broke the security cameras as I impacted. For a breif moment, a fluttering twenty was directly in front of Stupendous Man's eyes. No one else had line of sight with me, so I snapped some cash out of the air, only twenty or thirty grand. I teleported that to my hideout before going back to the spot that I'd hit the vault wall in the instant it took before that fluttering twenty left Paul's line of sight.

I pulled myself away from the wall and stood, shouting so I could be heard by the civilians outside the vault. ""You've foiled me this time, STUPID-nous man! But you'll never catch me!"" And I teleported away.

After a quick shower, I went to count the money I'd stolen. I'd grabbed more hundreds than I'd thought, so I was closer to eighty grand. Well, that was ok. It was all insured, and I'd find uses for the excess.

It is an momentous event.

""At a dumbass."" my grandma from my father's side, smirks.  
Yep. So fun.  
Mom is the daughter of a prince of hell (grandpa) and a human, while dad is the son of an archangel (grandma), and an elf.

Before they could continue, the Power Crystal lights up.  
""It is ready! Son... it's your turn."" mom smiles at me.  
Dad also nods supportively, and I approach the crystal...with my two grandparents breathing down on my neck.

I jump in the shower, widows open, fan on high, shower curtain wide open to allow a breeze.

I hear soft feminine voice, “ I think you are cute. Could we meet up tomorrow as I am about to set?” 

I jump surprised at the female voice. I look around, not seeing anyone in my small camper.  The inside of the camper is illuminated by bright moonlight. 

I ask “ who is out there? , show yourself???” 

I hear a body less voice reply, “tomorrow when the moon sets, I will meet you outside, sexy. “ the voice purrs. 

I rinse off, grab a towel and dart around my camper looking for a person. Not finding anyone. 

As the moon sets, I am sitting on a chair outside of my camper. Scanning the woods all around my camper. 

Just as the last rays of the moon set. A woman of extraordinary beauty steps into view.  

“Hello “ I say. 

She says “hello sexy , we meet at last “ 

“My name is Kaguya-hime “ she says. 

“ I am Jeff “ I say extending my hand.

1lan60r,mxnbwtf,"It was sweltering hot, the summer sun abed behind the trees. The fireflies were flitting about, waking up as the rest of the world said their goodnights. One by one the cabin lights blinked out, until it was only John Samuel still at work, chopping wood late into the night.

Now the townsfolk had long since gotten used to John's working at all hours. He was an honest man, always willing to lend a hand whether it was fixing a roof or plowing a field.  So a little extra noise now and then? Not a worry for the townsfolk. Some might have even found it reassuring, knowing that John Samuel was still working away while the rest were asleep.

On this particular night the moon was full. John paused in his chopping for a moment and wiped the sweat off his brow, admiring the moon's bright glow. Her light crossed the fields, across barley and wheat and corn near ready for harvest. The fireflies couldn't compete for how brightly she shone.

John Samuel, as he was wont to do, went back to his work and kept chopping until the moon began to dip towards the trees. He stood beside a pile of wood so large it would be fit for many winter nights. He placed his axe down by the well where he drew up a bucket of water. To washing he went, and he was nearly clean when a voice whispered from behind him. 

""You would make a fine husband for any woman, John Samuel.""

John Samuel whipped his head around, first right, then left, but saw no person who could have spoken. He heard a laugh, the same tone as the voice. He pulled his shirt on over his torso, ignoring for the moment that he was still soaked from washing. ""Where are you?"" he asked the voice, standing tall despite his state of dress. 

The voice laughed again. It was a soft voice, a laugh that would have been sweet had he not been so confused. ""How strange that you should be with me every night, and still not know me. Let us meet in the morning, for now I must go.""

The moon went below the trees at that moment, and in the darkness John Samuel could not find the bearer of the voice, no matter how hard he looked. He kept his axe by his door that night and barely slept.

1lan60r,mxo3v0r,"The next morning John Samuel rose early and left his cabin with his axe resting on his shoulder. There on the path before him, though he had heard no sound, was a woman with hair as white as down and eyes as silver as the mirror he had once seen on a merchant's cart. She looked at him with a familiar smile, one all the more strange because he'd never met her until now.

""John Samuel,"" she spoke, and he recognized her voice from the night before.

Now, John had many questions, but he was a polite man as much as an honest one. He removed his hat from his head and bowed slightly. ""A pleasure to meet you, ma'am.""

The lady's silver eyes glinted with mirth, and she laughed more loudly than he'd expected. John Samuel stepped back at the sound, but the lady explained- 

""I haven't been called 'ma'am' in a very long while."" She paused just a moment before continuing ""And I've failed to introduce myself."" She reached into a bag at her side and brought out a round glass ball. It was lit as if from the inside, though dim in the daylight. ""It may sound impossible, but I am the moon.""

John Samuel considered the woman carefully. Her strange voice in the night, her silent approach in the morning, and the globe she held.  He considered her silver eyes, and her downy white hair. She waited patiently for him to consider, waited as if she had all the time in the world.  Perhaps she did.

And then he did something only John Samuel might do, when confronted with such a person. He invited her in for tea.

1la0q0l,mxh7drv,"The crowded court room buzzed as everyone of even the most minor importance seemingly had something worth saying. Hundreds of slightly different conversations taking place in isolated pairs. The priest bickered amongst themselves, the economic advisors spoke about the newly balanced budget as the late princesses “lifestyle” was no longer the responsibility of the crown. Mercenaries and soldiers alike discussed the possibility of a militaristic operation, already strategizing the best methods and tactics. 

The room came to a silent drop as the kings deep voice brutes out from his throne. “I HAVE MADE A DECISION”  

The eyes of the kingdom rested on the aging monarch. 

King Iris stood up from his throne and uncharacteristically grabbed a cigar from a nearby drawer before any servants could retrieve them for him. 

“We do nothing” the king says as he uses an impatient hand gesture to request a light. A high ranking general awkwardly pulls a lit torch off of f the wall and lights the cigar. “I beg your pardon my liege?” As captain Opal backs away. 


“We don’t do a damn thing, seriously I’m not bailing her out again. Shes 24. and I’m fucking done” the king says while taking a puff. 


A few tense moments of silence fill the room before a high priest breaks the stagnant tension “my lord….. shes the heir to the empire. Shes the signal of your house and the….” The priest is interrupted by the king 


“WHAT SHE IS,  IS AN UNGRATEFUL SPOILED BITCH……..” the king raises his hand towards a large ordinate map on the wall of the keep. Roughly in the direction of the Republic of New Rusigrad. “LAST WEEK WE HAD TO SEND A MILITARY EXPEDITION TO THE REPUBLIC OF NEW RUSIGRAD because she sent a letter saying she was kidnapped by soldiers.. we take several border forts in a FUCKING MILITARY CAMPAIGN only to find out….. shes hung over in a bar in a border town with no danger at all” after ending his statement the king looked back at the quiet room just waiting for an interjection. 

“Put sir, the” a finance minister utters before immediately being cut off by the King. 

“Captain Oripal or Opal or whatever the fuck your name is, how many men did we loose fighting a war for no reason?” 


Captain Opal pulls at his collar awkwardly as his nerves get the better of him “well, I don’t know exactly …I’d have to check with battle commanders a…” 


“HOW MANY WAS IT” the king shouted while approaching captain Opal.  



“2047 sir” the captain says in a sobering tone. 



The king eyed the crowd looking for any naval merchants. “YOU, merchant Hammir, why do you trade in a glorified canoe and not the 1st rate naval vessel I bestowed on you?” 


Merchant Hammor looked down defeated, “because your daughter keeps sinking the ships you gift me”


The king open his eyes wide “uh hu uh hu, and HOW does she keep sinking these behemoths of a vessel that cost YEARS TO MAKE” 


The merchant looked around unsure of how truthful the spectating  crowed expected him to be. “Um…… she keeps distracting the ship captains and try’s to steer the ships on to land because and I quote ‘we’re infringing on the rights of the fish’ and in all cases she crashes them into the natural reef and sinks them…. Often getting a non-significant amount of sailers killed. 



The king clapped, “yes you guys see? Just catastrophe after catastrophe for someone that should know better. I’m done saving her.” 


The esteemed financial minister, a career politician and diplomat who has served the kings father stepped forward. Perhaps the second highest authority in the empire after the King. “Iris, I get it…. But it looks bad if your heir is just living in dragon territory” 



The king glares at minister Tali, seeing him as an old friend and confidant instead of whatever official job he was doing at any given moment. But even with this mutual respect the king’s annoyance made him jaded “Yeah yeah yeah? Looks bad huh?, tell me. HOW MUCH GOLD DID THE EMPIRE NEED TO SPEND TO PAY BACK all the cavern and bar owners as well as……… exotic PET dealers……” 


The minister put his fingers together and rested them again his forehead in an annoyed fashion, knowing his response would not help any case to go save the princess “, “ugh………… 3.8 million ducats.” 


The entire room stared at the minister before the continued awkward silence was once again broken by the king. “Yeah, shes done. You know what? Start writing checks to the dragon lords, tell them to keep her,” 



A voice erupts from the crowd “THE DRAGON LORDS ARE OUR GREATEST ENEMIES” a minor aristocrat shrieks 


“Yeah? And me and the dragon lords are going to fly themselves into the sun after dealing with my daughter for any extended period of time. Win, win matter resolved.” The king walks back behind the throne seemingly leaving for the day",219

""Heir? Cornelius, I will be dead by then.""

""Caligula?""

""Yes, Cornelius?""

""What...what do you think happens if you die without an heir?""

""Chaos, obviously, but alas, I tried everything,"" I laughed ""...I will be dead by then, of course, so, why should I even bother?"" I sighed, longingly. ""I wish I could, just once more...ride a dragon...""

""Ride a...Caligula? Are you saying - ""

""Yes, Cornelius. I rode a dragon to the stars, in awe of the horizons...""

""When was...how many times did you ride a dragon?""

""Many times, I enter my dreams, and - ""

""Wait, what?""

""Oh, please! Dragons would eat any Human foolish enough to approach, I would never - but she? My daughter, will have the chance.""

""But what if they eat her?""

""Oh, Cornelius..."" I smiled, ""my daughter will find a way.

I, Faye Lambrois, daughter of Caligula Lambrois III, slept on a pile of bloody dragon gold, still cold.

The giant red dragon, Ourous, breathed fire from his nose, ""hey, Faye, thanks for helping out.""

""No problem, just bunking till my dad sends a party. You come back, I leave. I just want to prove to the townspeople he isn't insane.""

A little mailman came into the cave, ""hello, ma'am! Dr - DRAGON!""

Ourous laughed ""you are safe, I have better things to do to eat little, bony things. Please, Cows are far more filling.""

The mailman cleared his throat, ""oh - okay, um...Faye...your father, Caligula...said he is fine with you...leaving...but..."" he swallowed ""...is taking away your allowance...""

""...I'm sorry?""

""He said you're having a tantrum, and...""

I turned to Ourous, ""um...so...will you eat one, very specific Human?""

""Your father?"" he looked longingly, then said, ""no...cloth tastes awful. I will burn him, or decapitate - ""

I held my hand up, ""thank you, that's good enough."" breath, ""may I ride you to the capital? Revenge must be - ""

""Oh yes, sounds fun!"" he said, ""climb on!""",124
1la0q0l,mxhztt8,"The courtier stares at me, shocked.
""What?"" I ask.
""Your Majesty...
I know the princess is a bit willful, but she's still the princess of our kingdom.
Shouldn't we save her?"" he asks.
I shook my head.
""Nope.
It's the 38th time in 6 months that she is ""kidnapped"", and oddly enough always after marriage, or further education discussions.
Time to let her go, if she wants to go."" I said.
He bowed, and left, while I resumed working on the documents for a trade with the dwarves...

A month later, a letter arrived.
""It's from Lilia!"" my Queen said, giving it to me.
I threw it in the fireplace.
""Husband!  Why?! We haven't heard anything about her in a month!"" she screamed at me.
""Exactly. Also, she knows where we are. If she wants to say something, better say it to us in person."" I said.
Before the Queen could say anything, I swooped her off of her feet.
I knew how to avoid an argument with my lovely wife.

3 months later, she was waiting for me in the throne room, for a visit.
""Hey dad."" she says, smiling at me.
""Daughter. How are you? How have you been? Everything alright?"" I say, hugging her.
She says nothing.
I sigh.
""What's wrong?"" I ask.
""You took my allowance! And cut my magic crystal card's access to the family's account at the Dwarven bank!"" she said.
""And?"" I ask, smiling at her.
She was fuming.

""Do you know how embarrassing it is to not be able to pay!"" she roars.
""Then find a job. The dragon that ""kidnapped"" you, surely has acquaintances, doesn't it?"" I say.
She blushes.
""Fine. You win. Sent me to whatever school of magic, but I am not marrying a random prince!"" she pouted.
I nodded.
""You start in a month at the Silverwood Elven Academy, considering your talent in wind and wood magic.
It's a 3 year program, so you will finish at the age of 25, or faster if you are talented enough.
After that, your mom and I, have 12 suitors that we found acceptable. If you find one of them okay, then we go ahead with the marriage, if not, we will keep looking.
Now go, and find your mom, she was worried sick."" I said.
She nodded, and started leaving.
""And Lilia."" I started.
""Yeah?"" she asks.
""I missed you. And I love you."" I smile at her.
She blushes, mumbles something and leaves.
I shake my head.
""Kids..."" I mutter, as I tell the courtier to start ushering in the ministers, we had some things to discuss.",62
1la0q0l,mxi710n,"The court was aghast when the King abruptly left the throne room after being told of the news that his daughter, the Princess, had been taken by a dragon. Even the Queen herself – the ultimate pro in managing public displays of emotion – looked visibly shocked when she exited the chamber shortly after.

“What – the – fuck, - Edmond?” the Queen let out when finally alone with her husband.

“What? Don’t tell me you’re buying into this publicity stunt,” said the King, unbothered. “Darling, you must know by now that Clarice couldn’t possibly be kidnapped by a dragon unless she went out of her way to stage this little narrative.”

“Of course it’s a publicity stunt,” the Queen said. “You don’t have to sell me on Clarice’s cries for attention. But how could you act like this in front of the entire court? You were basically calling out her publicity stunt. Now everyone is thinking that, if the Princess is capable of going there, so are all of us in the royal family!”

The King now seemed concerned.

“You really think so?” he asked his wife.

“I KNOW SO,” the Queen replied, and she was livid. “I wouldn’t be surprised if those shitheads out there aren’t already wondered if I staged my own kidnapping by the trolls all those years ago”

“Oh, that was such a good stunt, wasn’t it?” said the King.

“The best”, the Queen agreed. “I really miss being fake-kidnapped. And while Clarice was a fool for going rogue like this, I can’t see why she would be craving for a fake-kidnap narrative of her own. You should be proud of her initiative, not dismissive!”

The King let his wife’s words sink in. He knew the Queen was right.

“How can we bounce back from this?” he finally said.

Moments later, the Queen was back to the throne room.

“You must forgive my husband,” the Queen announced. “As every parent here will know, the possibility of your child being harmed is enough to get any us – even Kings – into a deep state of denial.”

The Queen turned to soldier who had reported the Princess’ abduction.

“Alastor, gather all your men and do whatever it takes to rescue your Princess from the den. Even if you have to kill every dragon you find in our way. Now, GO!”",27
1la0q0l,mxmtsak,"""Pardon?"", my advisor Ruger blurted out rather bluntly, ""Did I hear right? You want to- what."" He started pacing around my office, left-right, left-right aaaand a circle. It was kind of amusing to watch him ponder over my words, I've never seen him this confused.

""Ruger my friend, my daughter Aileen is a damn handful. You know that. Everyone on the guard knows that. Erikson over there even came to me personally to beg to be reassigned away from her, because she's such a menace."" The large bodyguard in the corner shuddered heavily at the mention of his past assignment. ""So, if she's actually been taken, either the dragons will bring her back because she caused so much chaos OR she'll be eaten. Which is actually less than likely, since she's thinner than a polearm."" 

Ruger seemed unnerved by my casualty about the situation, nevertheless he stopped pacing and let himself fall into one of the big plushy armchairs. He let out a heavy sigh and brought up his tablet. ""Very well, I'll cut off the weekly transfers to her account. Do you also want me to cancel her cards, phone contract and various memberships?"" 

""The fancy memberships can go, but keep the phone online. She may be a menace but it's safer if she has a reliable phone."" Ruger nodded as he tapped away, letting out a sigh now and then. It took several hours, but we were eventually able to slog through all the accounts of my daughter and cancelled most of them. It was easy, since I was usually the account holder and the one keeping them stocked with money.


Later that day, in my private chambers, I stood on the terrace overlooking the capital. Playing with a glass of whiskey in my hand, I drifted off in my thoughts. Overthinking the what if? What if my daughter had actually been kidnapped? If yes, why hadn't we received a ransom demand by now? Had she just run off with a boytoy again? Would she return once  the excitement wore off? Ugh, she had become so unpredictable the last decade. 

""Henry."" My husbands' soft voice brought me back to reality. He came up beside me, tenderly grasping my hand and resting his head on my shoulder. ""The ambassador of the Sidion Alliance has contacted me directly."" I took a sip of whiskey, ""The Alliance of all the dragon clans... Must've been important."" I felt his grip on my hand tighten. ""It's about Aileen. It appears that she's been...well..."", he trailed off and I turned to look at him. He was desperately trying not to laugh, but failed as soon as he met my gaze. It took us about ten minutes until he was coherent enough to talk again.


""Aileen apparently went on a bender through half the clubs of the Alliances capital city. Some way through your little cancellation spree went in effect and her cards started getting declined. So, what does she do? Throws the biggest tantrum ever and gets herself arrested. Property damage, cursed out some law enforcement, vandalism and you know, all the same stuff your brother got away with all those years."" I stared at him, he was giggling with glee. ""But get this, she gets booked and tried to evoke our names to get out. Since she's a princess, they got the embassy involved, right?"" ""And what did they tell her?"" ""Well, Ruger informed them that she's on her own and that they can't help her anymore. Oh how I wish to have seen her face when the news got back to her!""


I just shook my head at the revelation. But, soon after I got infected by my dearests' giggling and we laughed until our sides hurt. Gasping for air, I was just able to stammer: ""Oh she really does take after her father.""

""Yeah well, the Alliance wants us to take her back though."" ""Nah.""",12
1laqa9r,mxoa9fr,"There is an island in the sky, roughly half the size of Australia. It appears on every map, on every picture of Earth taken from above. It is there, plain as day on every map since the world was fully explored. But there is no direct mention of it on record. No one remembers it being there, but at the same time, no one can remember a time without it. A lush island, floating far higher than the tallest mountain above the Pacific. Apparently full of vibrant ecosystems and undocumented species. We remain uncertain how it levitates, what energies could possibly keep a landmass in the stratosphere in perpetuity. It is called by many names in many languages. Arcadia is what the English speaking world calls it.

A land overrun by flora and fungi, with strange creatures glimpsed in the canopies and jungle pathways. The taxonomists bicker over where it all fits in the tree of life. A literal lost world. There is only one apparently unnatural thing visible, a towering, shining spire at the island's center. It whispers disquieting things into the ears of all who see it, even indirectly. No one can repeat the words, only relate that it chilled a thing deep inside them. A siren's call, simultaneously alluring and unquestionably forbidden.

Of course, explorers had to be sent. To date, none have returned. An unknown number of governments and NGOs have made attempts, but most of the footage and information from these ventures has remained classified. The most broadly known attempt was carried out by amateurs. Young people who wanted to be the first to show the whole world this island lost in time.

They thought they were prepared for anything. Food and water, oxygen tanks to deal with the thinner atmosphere, sunblock and cloaks to deal with the UV rays, guns to deal with any threat. Live streaming their attempt via satellite and helmet cameras. Slogging through a jungle in the sky. Strange creatures watched from all around, experiments in evolution unlike what could be found on any other landmass. It all began with such enthusiasm.

The anomalies started on day two. Whispers in a cold, alien language. A cocktail of malice and whimsy. The explorers reported auditory hallucinations, though the details of those were never recorded. On day three, the spatial distortions manifested. Persistent warping of light, the air bending it into a sort of alien script. The explorers reported a deeply unsettling sensation of being watched. Moving aberrations in space that seemed to sing. Songs like what aliens would sing to lull children to sleep.

The fear set in on day four. The explorers reported intense paranoia. Bursts of gunfire into the bush at apparently illusory targets. It remains unknown if any mundane predators large enough to threaten a human exist on Arcadia. It is the audience who report the next anomaly. Those watching after the beginning of day five report a deep sense of fear. A churning, painful thing in their stomachs, gnawing anxiety and profound feelings of danger.

The first goes missing on day six. There is a scream, then the data stream is severed. The last thing seen is a spatial distortion on the edge of the frame. The others rush to find their friend turned inside out. They decide then to try to get off of the island, and begin a trek to a site where they can be extracted. They walk through the night, reporting more auditory and visual hallucinations. Another goes missing, and this time they do not follow to find what has become of her.

At this point, the most disturbing anomaly kicks in. No one can bear to watch the events of the final day. Every viewer refuses to watch what follows, turning off the video, shutting their eyes. Forced exposure causes a massive spike in heart rate followed by a seizure, after which all memory of the viewed material is forgotten.

It seems apparent that whatever secrets are hidden on Arcadia, they will not be gleaned easily. It must be understood, it is a yawning blindspot in any attempt to form long term strategic plans. The powers of the world race to understand and document it, largely without success. Whatever lurks there could be more dangerous than anything humanity has yet encountered. What we do not know can most certainly hurt us, and Arcadia has demonstrated time and time again that it is more than willing to kill.",6
1la5kst,mxilv2x,"""You kiss your mother with that mouth?!"" I shouted at Hephaestus, a new and upcoming super villain that has more weapons than 90% of the countries in the world. ""On second thought, I just read Oedipus, so maybe don't answer that!"" 

He was enraged and pulled out several spears shaped like thunderbolts.  Uh oh, I thought.  Gotta be fast. Gotta avoid them. Those things could really do some damage. He fired them at me, but was still way too green to be any serious threat. In five years, he could be dangerous. Right now, my simple quips are causing him to get frustrated and lose focus. This should be easy. I'm afraid to pull out the big guns. One bad pun might send him into a catatonic state. 

The three javelins flew right by me as I took aim with my power gauntlets. A sudden burst of kinetic energy flew out from them, hitting Hephaestus and knocking him backwards through the wall (several walls actually) and into another part of the building. Oh damn, I hope I didn't hurt him too bad.  I walked through the Hephaestus sized holes in the walls and saw him, buried under a pile of drywall and desks, unconscious, but still breathing.

""Wave Force to the CPD,"" I said in my communicator. ""Hephaestus is down, 3rd floor, just follow the giant holes in the wall. I'll disarm him, you lock him up, over."" 

""WAIT A MINUTE WAVE FORCE YOU STAY RIGHT THERE AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS AND...""

""Oh is that you Captain Finnegan? Sorry can't hear you, over.""

""DO NOT LEAVE OR I'M PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST"" he shouted over the radio.

""Sorry Cap, you didn't say over at the end of your transmission. Uh oh I'm flying through a tunnel, I'm losing you.""

I heard some cops talking as they were walking through the rubble.  Time for me to leave. I saw an open window and flew out and into the cold Chicago sky.

I arrived in my tiny apartment and saw my cat was sitting by the window, waiting for me. 

Another, less cuddly, surprise was waiting for me also. A note. 

""I know who you are Wave Force. I know where you live. I know where your family lives. I know where your friends live. Enjoy the last night of your private life."" 

No. No no no no. I started scanning all the bugged ""secret"" lairs and hideouts, hoping for some chatter.
The first five bugs were silent, or didn't yield any important info. Until I got to Dr. Poison's office. I could hear him talking to someone over the phone.

""YOU DID WHAT?"" Dr. Poison shouted. ""I don't want to hear it! No. Stop talking. No. I don't want to know who Wave Force is or any other super hero. We have codes! We have rules! If we go after their families, they will come after ours! Goddamnit! You screwed this up! Do you know why they are heroes? Because they are good and kind people. Its literally in their name you moron! And you take away that goodness and kindness? What are you left with? Walking, talking, pissed off Nuclear Bombs waiting to unleash their force on US. No. You better hope any of the heroes you threatened do not find you! I'm ending this call. Do not contact me again."" 

Before he hung up, I was already flying to Dr. Poison's penthouse office. Even flying as fast as I could, I could see the look of terror and horror on his face as I crashed through his skylight window.

He barely got a word out before I had my hands wrapped around his throat and his body lifted five feet off the ground.

""Who were you talking to?"" I said. 

""I don't, I don't know what you are talking about,"" he said. 

I placed my left hand right near his face. He could hear my gauntlets powering up.

""Talk or this whole penthouse goes up for sale first thing in the morning. After they repaint the walls.""

""Lightning Lord!"" he said as he shut his eyes, waiting for the blast.

""Did he tell you anything?""

""I wouldn't let him! I swear! I follow the Code""

I dropped him. ""Is he still at the old power plant?"" I asked.

Dr. Poison was catching his breath and let out a quiet ""Yes."" 

As I was flying towards the electric plant, I sent out a few messages to friends and family, asking if they were okay. Everyone was fine. Everyone was safe.  As I arrived at the plant, several lightning bolts shot out from the ground towards me. He must know I'm coming.

I dodged them but was exposed and an easy target up here. I landed and made my way into the dark and destroyed power plant. 

""Oh Wave Force, or should I call you Edward. Did Dr. Poison give me up that easily?! ,"" he shouted.  ""I know you are here. After I dispose of you, all your friends and family will fall pray to 'freak' accidents! Hahaha! They will be deemed the unluckiest group of people in the world after all the 'random' lightning strikes hit them!"" 

I didn't respond. I turned my power gauntlets up to their maximum setting. 

""Come on, where are your jokes! Where is the good humor you always bring to our fights! I love your puns. I love your dad jokes! Your knock knock jokes need some work though!"" he shouted into the darkness. 

I crept up closed to him, still hiding in the shadows. He was on the open floor, firing randomly into the darkness, hoping to catch me or at least hit me. He was growing erratic and frustrated by the lack of response from me. 

""SHOW YOURSELF,"" he shouted as he fired more lightning into random directions. One hit just above me that I had to duck down to avoid getting hit. 

As he turned his back towards me, I quickly dashed over and stood behind him. As he turned around, I put my open palm on his chest.  ""Knock knock,"" I said and and let out a huge burst of energy. He went flying backwards into the steel walls. 

I walked over to him. He looked up at me, his face bloodied already, a huge scorch mark on his chest. 

I placed both my hands around his head and powered them up. The simple vibrations and sound of them made Lightning Lord shout in pain.

""It took me one shot to disable you. It will take me one shot to kill you. You are going to leave this town. You are going to go anywhere else but Chicago. So whatever city you arrive in, you let me know. Send me a postcard. You know where I live. And I will warn their heroes about you. And how you are a Codebreaker. This is your first strike. But this isn't baseball. You don't get three strikes. One more strike, and you are marked for retirement. And our retirement parties aren't as fun as the civilian ones. Do we have an understanding?""

He was too injured to say anything. 

""I'll take that as a yes.""",48
1la5kst,mximt4y,"*""There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.""*

*And woe betides the fool who, on a moonless night, sailing in the stormy seas, angers the god who chose to be kind.*

**~~**

""If you valued your life, you'd stop insulting my god,"" the boatman sneered. ""The storm is not his fault, but it is by his blessing we stay afloat and not sink beneath the tides. Did you not listen to the old tales of the great and ancient Lord Elvari I told you on the way here? You have been full of complaints from since you stepped foot in his town.""

""What kind of sea god can't do anything about tidal waves?"" The grumpy tourist shouted. ""Calm the seas, moron! Look, I don't need this so-called kindness of drifting in stormy seas! I need good weather, calm waters! Didn't that tentacle dork say he was a good god?""

**~~**

*He wasn't born a good god. He was born in the shadows, not in light. A prophesied Great Evil that would plunge the world in madness and darkness. But after years of spiralling into senseless violence, he chose to do good.*

*What then, separates him from the other good gods of holy pantheons? They were born to be good. They were told they were good from since their conception. But a dark god who chose good over evil? That is a deliberate choice. One that can be undone.*

**~~**

""Oh yeah?"" The tourist wasn't convinced. ""How scary can some tea-sipping terror can be? Hey, is he scared of one-star reviews on his website?""

The boatman didn't say a word.

""When are we actually going to see some abominations of the sea? Are they all hiding? Is this a scam? I paid good money to see leviathans, not get my boat rocked!"" The man hasn't stopped ranting. ""You see this harpoon? Clear this stupid storm so I can spear one of them sea beasts for photos to post on my Instagram! Tell Elvari to get his ass here and do something about the weather? Is this out of his domain? Does he only cover that small dinky town of Innsmouth? Is his influence that tiny?""

**""Do you know why an ancient god would choose to stay in one small fishing town? When once, he had spread his influence across multiple dimensions?""** The boatman was speaking, but his voice was calm, yet deeper than the depths of the Abyss, his eyes glowing a vivid violet. **Because he tries to limit the spread of his madness. Because he's trying to be kind. In doing so, he limits the insanity to zany silliness. But when you take that away, all that is left for you is endless horror.**

The boatman snapped back to his senses. The rich tourist who booked his boat did not. With every crash of tidal waves, the man would scream and stab at the air. Yelling incoherently about dangers from every corner. When he was out of breath, he'd collapse on the floor and sob uncontrollably, all while clawing his eyes out and bleeding from his orifices.

For he saw nothing but endless horror of an eldritch deity who decided to stop being kind for a minute.

""I could have you executed for your tone...mother.
I only destroyed the soul of a doctor, whom was the only one who could cure our poison.
Now, our demonic armies will be unstoppable!"" she says.
""You killed the family of the kindest, and most selfless man I have ever met!
You have no idea what horrors you might have unleashed!"" I say to her.
""Just because you have a crush on the man, mother...doesn't mean he is anything more than just a pathetic doctor.
Not a mage, not a Hero...so, why worry?"" she says.
Before I could say something, a general rushes in.

""Your Majesties! Our armies are dying!"" he says, bowing to both of us.
""How? Which ones?"" my daughter asks.
""All of them, on all fronts, and its spreading back to the Demon Lands.
It's a plague that only affects us seemingly, and it's...terrible, Your Majesty, it is soul crushing."" he says.
My daughter snorts.
""Just use the Adaptive Squad to create the antibodies. They are literally created for this."" she says.
Adaptive Demons...beings that can adapt to anything in moments, they are rare, but elite of the elite of our forces.
""They are all...dead of the plague, Your Majesty."" he says.
My daughter looks at me.

""Close the borders, let all those outside armies die where they are.
And prepare for the worst."" I say.
""Why? Because of one doctor?"" she asks.
""This one doctor has cured 7 of the 9 Bloodline Curses, that have been plaguing the races of this planet for millions of years.
This one doctor was travelling with his family, healing people for free.
This one doctor could gather the whole world, even some demons under his banner, if he wished to.
But he is kind, so he will do it all by himself."" I say.
""Do what?"" she asks.
""Destroy you, and all those involved."" I say.
She frowns.

""Do as the Empress Dowager says.
Hasten the birth of new Adaptive demons using the remains of the old ones, hoping that a new generation demon will be immune to the plague.
Purify water, and food before consuming, and start wearing masks."" she says, and the general bows, and leaves.
""You think he can do it?"" she asks me.
I sigh.
""He already did it. He will soon arrive, to either save us, or let us die.
But I think he will save us, he knows what will happen without us Royal Demons, though first we will suffer."" I say to my daughter, as I show her my arm...where a rash just appeared.
She widens her eyes, and looks at where the general stood.
The general who was on the frontlines...
""I told you. Unimaginable horrors usually came from kind people turned into monsters by circumstances."" I say, as I leave.
I hope a hot lava bath will ease the itch, and that David, I mean, the doctor will soon arrive.
For without the Royal Demons, the demonkind will go crazy, and once again enter a beastly age.",28

Why would they release the stable strain into a populated area intentionally? It’s a simple question, but the connotations are immense. In theory, it’s a sound plan, releasing a contagion to curb humanity’s pointless warring, but even at a passing glance, it’s easy to see the unintended effects.


Excessive bleeding from the eyes, vomiting, confusion, and mental instability besides the lethal components that made it so rightfully feared to begin with. They’re all reasons it should’ve never been done; but necessity makes a fool of us all.


But it didn’t work; it never would have stopped the death. Necessity; who’s mine or theirs? Was it even right to inflict your “truth” on another?


With one hand, I press a palm against my right eye in some ill-fated way to hide the brilliant sunlight slipping through my office windows and the chirping of distant birds. I’ve been here three days now; in this cramped office. 


Despite being a block away from the epicenter, it’s deceptively quiet. The usual honks and revving engines of the central roadway are absent, as are the hurried footsteps of my fellow staff members in and by the admin building. 


I can only linger in this cluttered space as I wrap my digits and hurl the chief administrator’s plaque on my desk in a flurry of paperwork and audible wrath. The guttural scream from the depths of my lungs is enough to rattle the windows in the throes of my frustration. 

“You dumb motherfucker Marcus!”


The lead scientist of the harmony project isn’t here to hear it, but it’s cathartic in the moments leading up to my collapse into my office chair.


At most, this pathogen was supposed to be used on the mentally unwell; it’s not a cure-all treatment. So releasing it was like prescribing Pervitin to an orphan. I’m glad the son-of-a-bitch died on the day of the outbreak. It was a service to the collective gene pool of humanity. 


I’m tired now. The rage lingering as it might be has been displaced by another emotion as I slam my head against the desk. 


Nothing can be done now. 


Pandora’s box has been opened. 


(…)


Such is life.


A sigh is the only noise to escape from the space between my head and piles of paperwork. 


At least I didn’t have to worry about pipe bombs in my mailbox in theory. 


The key word being in “theory”. ",5
1lafrqf,mxlbgtw,"Every time Shelly visits her mother, she hides what she's become.  
And again, she is dreading it, which, to be honest, is more a sense of discomfort.              
Similar to light ice wind crawling up your arms, raising the hair on your neck, and running as a shudder throughout your body. Body, yeah, right. Hers' a little different right now - again. Something *she* does not mind, but her mother... well, let's say they're another story.  
  
Magic is considered to be fictional in this part of the world. You don't share any other opinions on that matter; scientifically speaking, you will never see proof unless you’d walk across the border.              
To any other country in the vicinity, that is. ""Magic does not exist. Technology is everything"", welcomes you on signs at the borders.       
       
Shelly followed her half-sibling into the academy. Luckily, he does not have a bodily manifestation of magic. Hence, he stays at the mental dorms. She's not that 'lucky', according to her mum, who's been damming the conversation she agreed on her ex-husband sending both children there.              
Unfortunately, or as a blessing - in Shelley's perspective - the contract states you can't leave school, unless extensive security measures are in place. Due to her home country denying the existence of energies running through nature's fibers, this is impossible.  
  
Entering her room back home through a time-activated rune circle, Shelly hears her mum talking to her dad over the phone, probably trying to convince him to visit, for *Shelly's sak*e. The wise man has denied every invite since his former spouse read the contract's fine print. Shelly grins.    
Taking off her jacket, she walks toward her room door. With a deep breath, she clears her head before opening it.       
Her mother looks toward her as soon as she walks through the threshold, her mouth immediately pressing into a thin line as her gaze travels up and down her youngest child's body.  
  
""I have to go, now, don't think you can run forever, Gunther!"" Shelly's pretty sure her brother already arrived at her dad's, meaning her dad knows her mum is upset with or at least at her. Maybe he'll send Brian over again.  
  
""What is the meaning of this?"" Her mom is walking over to her. ""What did this *wizard* do to you this time?!""           
Taking a centering breath, "" He's not a wizard, mum"", Shelly shakes her head. ""At least not, as much as I am not either."" Her mum's now in front of her, ""Don't get smart with me, young Lady! What will the neighbors say?!""          
""That I have a strong sunburn"", rolling her eyes, Shelly steps to the side, walking sideways, always better to dodge the occasional flying shoe..  
""YOU'RE PINK!""",6
1lafrqf,mxlboby,"""Make it cold burn, then, I'm pretty sure, the neighbors are confused about where I study anyway."" She ducks, yeah, *the* shoe, which unfortunately barrels into a glass on the table. Shelly picks up the shards before focusing. The now slightly melting pieces come back together, and she watches as a new pattern, a night iris, imprints itself. Yes*, I did it!*    
  
""There is no need for that, we have enough glasses."" Her mum is now standing behind her. ""That insolent boy has zero control; you are not a test subject for his spells!""             
""I'm also working on rips in his projects, mum, that's how school works! Besides, according to the medi-witch, this one is also good for the skin. Look at the bright side; I'm not green again! And I don't even have a furuncle right now. He's totally getting better!""  
  
At this point, her mother's face is nearly as pink as hers, edging towards dark red.    
Shelly swallows. She could wait this out in a different part of the flat; there is no need to actually trigger her mom into something the woman denies she possesses in the first place.  
""You went to the med station because *you were worried*. Admit it! You were scared by his experiments!"" Shelly leans backwards as her mother leans in.         
Somewhere in the back of her head, a slight bell goes off. Someone is trying to enter.  
  
""It's not an experiment, mum, he's a nice guy, Akeno, would not harm me! I went to the med station because Le passed out in sparring class. The doctor just took a look at me, then.""  
Her mum scoffs.         
""Look, I know that you know that this will wear off in the next several hours. I love you, Mum. Still, you need to get used to me being at this school now. Dad wants to help you move closer. That way, we don't have to hide when I visit, like *this*.""     
The door to the room opens.",6
1lafrqf,mxlbphy,"""Your father can speak to me about this himself. I don't need a messenger."" The women look at the person entering the room now.             

""Our father would love that, mother, if you could spend five seconds without berating him."" Brian moves to lean back against the wall.         

""YOUR Father is the reason she's like..."" The mother gestures up and down Shelly's body, ""THIS!""

Her brother shakes his head. ""Imagine her going to school and accidentally melting the floor in science class, mother. You know that'd be a disaster!""

       

Shelly takes the moment to crawl beneath the table out of her mother's reach.

Her brother's gaze turns dark.  ""Did you break something again, mother?

The young man steps closer to his sister.



""I did no such thing! She just needs better friends!"" The woman's voice rises again.  

""You are aware that I can see fixed objects on their magic lines, right?” His voice rings through the room, somewhere between a taunt and condescension. “Nice pattern, kiddo."" Brian grins at his sister as he gets closer.           

""I'm not a kid! I'm fourteen!"" Shelly mutters, though her brother shakes it off, with a hand gesture, stepping in front of her now, back turned towards her. 



""Did you throw something at her?"" His voice is getting lower by the second.            

Their mother flushes while crossing her arms. ""Look at her, this is a disgrace! Again! This is the 6th time this year! IT'S MARCH - !!""

A cough from the door interrupts her tantrum.     

       

""Let’s keep this conversation between us, Cassandra. Kids, the portal behind me is still open. Dinners ready, I'll join you later."" With quick strides, their father crosses the room, pushes both children through the door into the portal, and closes it behind them. 

Brian turns to her. "" You good?"" She nods. Akeno's skin routines are getting better, I see."" He grins. ""Tell me when he does one without rainbow colors.""

Akeno sooo owns her a slushy for this.",6
1la2yi7,mxhp3gs,"For my time as a monster, I remembered nothing of what I was before. As far as I knew, my life began on an obsidian table deep in a dark wizard’s lair. My creator looked upon me with dark eyes and smiled. Were I not restrained, I would have tried to rip her throat out. As if she knew my thoughts, she smiled even wider. Then she uttered something, and all went dark.

I woke up again, this time in a forest. I did not know how far it was from where I was born. I recognized nothing. Throbbing in my head was the need to inflict harm. To rend flesh, break bone, and shed blood. I understood what I was, a weapon of terror unleashed upon the land for some end I did not know or care to know. All I valued was violence.

I don't know how long I remained in that state, falling upon caravans in the dark of night, raiding villages, pillaging farms. In my wake was sorrow and carnage, and I reveled in every moment of it. Increasingly powerful people began to harry my blood soaked escapade. I killed a few of them, but the terror I inflicted on peasants did nothing to prepare me for actual threats.

It all came to a head when I found warriors lying in wait at the next village I intended to slaughter. I was a dangerous thing, but I was not a match for ten people who knew what they were doing. I clawed and bit at them, until a hammer fell upon my skull and all went dark.

An uncertain amount of time, I woke. I found myself restrained, but the drive to slaughter and maim was gone. I felt large things drifting in my unconscious mind, things that fled when I reached towards them with my mind. Then I realized I was not alone. A wizard wearing a serious look stared at me with cold probing eyes.

As I floated restrained, people came to speak to me. I asked so many questions, received no answers. They wanted to know what I remembered, the people I had killed, how I had become what I was. They were keenly interested in what I could tell them about the wizard I saw as I lay lashed to the obsidian table.

Until finally, the wizard with the cold eyes stood before other faces I had spoken to, and stated, ""I've purged as much of her work as I can. He should be stable, I give a very low probability of a relapse to violent tendencies. We can begin reintegrating his previous identity. It will take time.""

They would make me go to sleep after that, and I would have the most vivid dreams. Soft dreams of smiles and days in the sun, punctuated by occasional sadness and loss. These were memories, memories of who I had been before I was turned into a monster. I knew that ground shaking emotions loomed over me, kept just out of reach. So many shattered pieces slowly being put back together.

Then began the pain. The horror of the person I was before I became a monster at what I had done as a necromancer's weapon. I convulsed and vomited, disgusted. Hundreds of people and thousands of animals slain, acts that the thing I was at the time was delighted to have committed. I begged them to stop, I begged them to kill me. I could not live with myself. But still the process continued, that same wizard with cold eyes staring at me, his face betraying none of his thoughts.

Deeper and deeper, unlocking more memories and latent emotions. Things that inflicted so much emotional pain that my mind had been protecting me from processing them. They explained that what I had done was not my fault, but still it was agony. I was often restrained to prevent me from doing long term damage to myself.

Until, eventually, the rain of blows ended. There was no more horror left to face, no more memories to reprocess. Apparently satisfied, the man with cold eyes smiled for the first time in my presence, ""What happens now?"" I asked.

""That depends on you. What do you want?""

""I... I want to atone. I don't want to kill or harm any person or beast ever again.""

""You should know that what we pulled out of your mind will help us hunt the person who made you what you were. We've been searching for years now. Her name is Natasha The Flesh Reaver. Do you have any particular notions about what you would like to do?""

""I think I would like to help fix people.""

""I can see about having you apprenticed to the local healers guild, if you would like.""

""That sounds nice.""

So I became an apprentice healer. The gruesome knowledge from my time as a monster actually helped me fix people better. My teachers and peers did not know what I had been, only that high ranking wizards had recommended me and were paying attention to how I managed. My mind would likely never heal entirely, but I could make the world just a little brighter as I began the long road to my own recovery.  A simple, modest life, but one worth living. Driven by the need to mend rather than rend.",53
1la2yi7,mxhvqaq,"The trap was set.

Carmen hid behind some bushes, waiting for the monster to approach the screaming convict tied to a tree, blood slathered onto him as bait. The monster hunter's rifle was locked and loaded. Ready to shoot before it could lunge at the man. She loathed her superior's orders to make a bait like this, so she was prepared to save him if needed.

A low growl echoed in the woods, scattering the birds and small mammals in the area. The monster, an artificially created homunculus-gone-wrong, imbued with excessive bloodlust to be a murder machine only to make its creator its first victim, was here. It sniffed the air, elongated limbs stretched out towards the bait. Blood dripped from its cavernous maws, no doubt from an earlier kill near the area.

Before Carmen could aim at its head, a black portal swirled into existence. Out popped a pale tentacle, which gripped a metal baseball bat and thwacked the monster on the head. The homunculus howled at the offending appendage, which gave the creature a few mighty blows to the head. When the monster slumped to the ground, the tentacle made happy cooing noises. More tentacles then emerged to pull the entity into the portal.

Carmen didn't need to intercept the portal; she knew exactly where to go.

**
--

It felt like many hours later, that the homunculus woke up in a garden near a tall, black building. And to a strange tentacled creature looking at it.

""Hello there, are you hungry?"" The octopoid entity cocked his head. ""What would you like to eat? I sure hope the answer isn't humans.""

It did not have an answer. All it remembered was a desire to murder everything that moved. To devour the flesh and drink the blood of its victims. Nothing else. And now, even that was gone. It still wanted food, but it had no idea what food to ask for.

""How about some tea and biscuits? I happen to have these on hand. How about some cheesecake? This friendly eldritch is always ready for tea parties.""

Before it could answer, a woman with a rifle charged onto the scene.

""Elvari, hand that homunculus over,"" she pointed at the aberration. ""It was created with only bloodlust in mind. It has killed many others. Eaten many humans. That thing is a danger to society.""

""I'm naming him Gobblesnork and adopting him,"" the eldritch god curled his tentacles around the abomination. ""You don't wish to kill anymore, do you? What do you want to eat now?"" He repeated his earlier question.

""Teaaaa. Biscuitsss,"" the homunculus pushed the words from its jaws. ""Cheesecake. Teaaa partayyy.""

""What did you do to it?"" Carmen demanded to know. ""Besides bonking it on the head with a baseball bat?""

""Have you ever heard of the story of an [elf's greatest revenge against The Devourer](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/18aatjg/wp_you_enacted_the_greatest_revenge_on_the/kbxfm93/) which killed many of his kind?"" Elvari asked Carmen while handing biscuits to the newly named Gobblesnork. ""It didn't involve murder. He peeled away at the madness within to restore its mind. To make it feel emotions. To make it learn to love. I want to do the same for Gobblesnork.""

""Alright, you win,"" she couldn't argue with him. ""Nobody else can teach a monster kindness better than another one like you.""

1la2yi7,mxi1gwq,"I look at the steel bars that keep me locked in, and remember.
I was a monster. An aberration created only to follow my bloodlust.
The blood I spilt could create rivers, and lakes.
The heroes that tried to stop me failed, again and again, until a mighty blow landed on my head, knocking me out.
Now, I am caught, and caged like the animal I was.
I was.
For now, my bloodlust is replaced...by other needs.
""Guards? May I ask for a canvas?"" I shout, hoping they will fulfill my needs.

I paint.
I paint rage, and death, and pain, and life, and the thrill of the hunt.
I am still caged, but I am freer than in my previous state.
I no longer feel the need to kill, to slaughter.
Now, all I feel is this strong desire to...paint.
To free my emotions, and my thoughts.
And it is working.
For today, for the first time in months, I feel normal, and I have a visitor.

""You killed my parents."" the young woman says.
""I apologize."" I say to her, as I watch her fiddle with one of my paintings.
""How can a monster like you, depict pain in such a wonderful way?"" she asks.
I sigh.
""I changed, after the defeat, something was knocked right in my head."" I smile.
She nods.
""Yet you don't deny you are a monster."" she says.
""No. I am, still could kill thousands with my bare hands.
I was created for slaughter, a mix of vampire, werewolf, and dragon blood flowing in my veins.
It just now, it's not a need to slaughter that I have, but only a possibility that I will never choose again."" I said.
She stares at me.

""My dad was a knight, and duke of the territory you terrorized.
I am the heir now, and I require someone to repaint the mansion, and do the family portrait.
And also...I require a shadow, that will do the things the duchy can't do, but has to."" she says.
I sigh.
""Must I become a weapon once more? If so, I would prefer to stay in this cell."" I say.
She stares at me intently for a good few minutes, then breaks out into a brilliant smile, that shall haunt my dreams, and my paintings...I know.
""Good! You truly changed, the alchemists and physicians were right.
You shall only act against criminals, and corrupt individuals that are smart enough to stay on the good side of the law in the light, disallowing the duchy to act directly."" she says.
Oh...so a Shadow Justiciar.
""I agree."" I say to her.
A month later, I am on the hunt for a noble whom does the unspeakable to poor villager girls...
The travelling, the fighting for a good cause...it feeds my need for painting.
Life is strange, but I can't complain.",12
1lac15h,mxk52tw,"The room was dark. His pipe lay cold. The air smelled of ink and wax. Saruman revised his letter to Galadriel yet again. Why wouldn't the words come?

He thought back to when he last saw her. A sip of wine, bitter. Then for the first time, he truly saw her. 

Her face, her golden hair, those starlight eyes. It was as if her image had carved her name into his soul.

Gandalf had been there. He brought the wine. But Gandalf didn't matter. His world had become entirely Galadriel.

He tried to shake it. Once he might have called the Uruk-hai. But now his hands reached for a quill instead. Sauron's voice once haunted him.

Now, he couldn't be bothered. He stood and paced to the window. Below, the pits were quiet. No hammers. No snarls. Orcs milled, confused.

He hadn't given orders. Instead, he stared up at the moon and tried for a comparison with Galadriel that wasn't trite. Pulling at his hair, he moaned. Every word he imagined was a cliche. 

Why hadn't he studied poetry rather than magic? He saw her in the moonlight. In the curve of the river. His chest tightened.

Gandalf had come yesterday. ""What's this, Saruman? Poetry?"" 

Saruman snarled. His voice broke. Gandalf's eyes held secret knowledge . As if he knew the source of Saruman's obsession.

An orc shouted outside. Saruman didn't move. What would she say if he sent an imperfect letter? He couldn't risk it.

The fire died. He sat, staring at nothing.",5
1la381o,mxi38no,"I get out of his costume, and take off the chest bandages.  
Goddamn Hero/Villain schtick.  
Why couldn't the Hero be also a woman? Would have been easier to pretend to be them.  
I hate this.  
I am a villain as a job from the government, to make sure all the criminals, and criminally inclined individuals gather under one banner.  
The hero is the same just for the other side, as righteous people can be just as dangerous as villains.  
Problem is, for the last 2 weeks, the hero didn't show up for work...  
And I had to cover for them.  
It's taking a toll, and the facade is slowly falling apart. 



After almost being killed by one of my own subordinates, I get home to relax.  
I enter my apartment, only to find him there.  
Reeking of alcohol, and who knows what else.  
""Zack? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" I say, slapping him with some water, slamming him against the wall.  
Perks of being an elemancer.   
He chuckles, not even fazed.  
""They want me to let you win...  
Then catch all the villains at the same time, for a big clean-up.  
But I heard that it is all a lie, they want to gather them to make an army! They have a way to mind control us!"" he says.  
I shrug.

  
""So?"" I ask him.  
He freezes.  
""SO? SO?! WE ARE TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TO DO AN EVIL THING BIGGER THAN THE VILLAINS!"" he screams.  
Good thing I have trapped the air inside, so nobody heard it, but me.  
""Nothing new, and also, they already tried.  
The device is in the costumes."" I say to him.  
He pales.  
""In ours as well? Already?"" he asks.  
I nod.

  
""Then how?"" he asks after a while.  
""I turned it off? I can control all the elements, this includes metals, and sand.  
Figure it out, drunktard."" I say, going to the kitchen to heat up some leftovers.  
He stands there frozen, like an idiot he is.  
""Sorry, Mia."" he says, sitting down at the table.  
""Shut up, and eat.  
You can sleep on the couch until you sober up, and then, I expect you to do your job."" I say.  
""Even after all that?"" he asks.  
""It does lower the damages to the infrastructure, and the civilians, and that's why we do it, not because the government."" I say.  
He smiles brightly, nods, and starts eating.  
Goddamn dufus...goddamn government...can't I just relax, and get paid for nothing?",24
1l9r1le,mxf9ydl,"""But my Lord Father, Prince Charming smells of lavender and roses and cedar...""

""Isnt he lovely, my sweetums?""

""The scent I felt when I have awoken was different... stronger, healthier...""

""That must have been some miasma from the simple folk who brought you back from the accident, sweetums.""

So the princess wandered around in the castle, searching for the places where the smells and scents occurred in the wildest varieties.

The lair of the Magician was full with the nose-twisting smells of the medicines, potions and poisons. She remembered some of these, applied on her during the panicked search for a solution to her slumber, but these were all clean, crisp sharp smells, not the, let's face it, peasant smell she still remembered from her waking moments.

The kitchen was amazing. All the exotic spices, fresh and preserved fruits and vegetables, fragrant oils for cooking, wood smoke, the sweet smells of desserts, but all these she knew and loved, nothing like the scent she dreamed of.

She had the idea to visit the places with less pleasant airs, and there she found it. In the stables, over the familiar smell of dung and horse sweat, there was the thin thread of that smell.

She followed it to a corner where a stable boy was munching on something.

""Boy, what is this you are eating?""

The stable boy was speechless. Managed to croak something which was similar to ""Your Majesty"", but that was all. And it was not even the proper way of addressing her.

With the help of the Chief Groom the boy gathered his wits.

""Your Majesty, it's knackwurst. It's my lunch.""

""Can I taste it? And by the way, it's Mylady, not Majesty. That's the King, my Father.""

""Your Mylady, everything here is yours. But... this is the last piece and I really like it.""

""Not to worry, young groom, I really just take the tiniest bit...""

Yes! It was that smell! The princess was sure now.

""What is this knackwurst? What is in it?""

""Your Mylady, it's pork, garlic, some kind of bread... I don't really know, I just eat it. Tom, the butcher knows better but he's disappeared two days ago.""

This was the first time the princess heard of garlic. At a table where saffron, cardamom or cloves were found every day, garlic was not common.

""What do you mean disappeared?""

""There was that big hubbub with your sickness, your Mylady, and he was one of the random people taken to your room. And then your Mylady was back, and some of those people were not.""

""Thank you, boy. And Chief Groom, I ask you that no harm shall fell on this stable boy by your hand or will.""

The only place where people can disappear this perfectly in the castle was the dungeons. There she went, and oh this place was a veritable cavalcade of smells. Horrible, bad smells, of fear, of excrement, of blood and of pain. 

She swept through the tunnels, the Dungeon Master running after her, trying to stop her with his useless words. She knew that a lackey was already on it's way to bring here her governess or even his father, so she had to be quick.

And she found him! She could have asked for his name, but the brown, warm eyes, even clouded with the suffering were the same, the sudden brightening of his face was telling.

""Open this door, Dungeon Master!""

""But Mylady, your father...""

""Open the door, now!""

Maybe the Dungeon Master felt that this was the first occasion when the princess commanded with the power she will wield when she gets the throne. Maybe he just disliked the cruelty of jailing people without any good reason. Maybe he was just a fan of the sausages of Thomas. 

Whatever was the reason, the door opened with a creak and she was in the filthy arms of Thomas.

Their second kiss was long enough that the King did see it when he arrived.",175
1la0hsg,mxixzbr,"The moon hung like a half-coin over the battlements while Lord Hargrave’s jaw twitched as though it sought to escape his face entirely.

""Why are you jealous?"" I asked, folding my arms. ""It’s not my fault none of you paid attention to her needs.""

Hargrave’s nostrils flared, as though trying to inhale enough outrage to survive the night. ""Her needs?"" he spat. ""I offered her dominions, armies, my own ancestral sword—""

""All of which she already has more of than you,"" I said. ""And the sword was compensating for something, I suspect.""

He bristled. ""You impudent cur! She is the Iron Princess! She is a legendary warrior, unbroken, untouchable!""

""Untouchable? No. Untouched,"" I corrected mildly. ""Unbroken? Not any more. That was her problem, wasn't it?""

His face darkened like overcooked gravy. ""You dare suggest—""

""I don’t *dare* suggest, I state it,"" I said. ""I asked her one question. And when I asked it, she didn’t want titles or castles or your dull, tedious attempts at performative courtship as if she were some bird to flash gilded feathers at. She wanted a *night*."" My voice lowered like silk sliding off skin. ""A long, long night. One where no battles were fought except the ones that left her breathless while she held my head between her thighs.""

Hargrave made a noise not unlike a wounded goose. ""You make her sound like a common —""

""Careful,"" I said, my smile turning sharp. ""Say it, and I’ll make sure you finish that sentence on your knees. She is still your sovereign.""

""But you—!"" He sputtered, caught between rage and some unarticulated horror at the notion that a common man could succeed where nobility had failed.

""I pleased her,"" I said simply.

He trembled with suppressed fury. ""I am a Lord of the Blooded Houses. My lineage is—""

""—a paper saying you were born,"" I said. ""Her body didn't care for your lineage when my tongue was writing poetry across her.""

The color drained from his face in such a hurry that it was probably halfway to the next duchy by now. ""You filthy fucking peasant.""

""I am,"" I agreed. ""Filthy, exhausted, and very successful. She's asleep right now, purring like a contented lioness. And you,"" I added, tilting my head, ""are standing here arguing with me, because you never once thought to ask her a question.""

Hargrave drew himself up, his voice icy. ""Mark my words, commoner. Your rise will be brief. We Blooded always reclaim what is ours.""

I chuckled at his double entendre because he didn't know he had done it, then I chuckled at that one. ""Bring your armies,"" I said. ""Though you might want to wait until she wakes. She's rather cross when disturbed, and is liable to lash out at whomever awakens her.""

Hargrave codfished, looked past me, went white, turned on his heel and stormed off.

Behind me, from the shadows of the tower, came the soft sound of silk against stone and the Iron Princess herself, voice thick with lazy amusement.
""You are going to enjoy tormenting them, aren't you?"" she purred.

I smiled. ""Only a little. Shall we go back to bed, my lady?""

Her hand found mine and pulled me back into her chamber. ""Yes,"" she whispered. ""You're not finished.""",42
1la0hsg,mxs411d,"P3:

""What are you doing?"" she demanded. ""And why should I not call the guards?""

The young man jumped and almost fell back before steadying himself. ""I'm sorry! I'm the son of a palace blacksmith, Miss Laurance. I was trying to get to the gazebo to look at the alignment. There's hardly a better place to see it with this telescope, but no one would let me in! Can you imagine losing such an opportunity?""

Laurance’s mind went blank. First, his manners were appalling; had she been anyone else, he would have already forfeited his life for addressing her so improperly. Indeed, she could see one of the hidden guards doing his best not to draw his sword. Secondly, a telescope. He had mentioned a telescope.

At that thought, everything else dissolved.

""I will leave aside your failure to use my title,"" she said, her voice crisp. ""You mentioned something more important.""

His eyes went wide. ""I'm so sorry, I got carried away, I'm the son of—""

""Not that,"" she interrupted. ""You mentioned a telescope?""

""Ah, yes. I have it here.""

Laurence had to make a sharp, subtle gesture to the guards to prevent them from descending upon him. A commoner pulling a large bag from the shadows was a worrisome sight.

Still, she was excited. A true smile finally broke through her mask as he revealed a beautiful, well-made telescope. Now, manners dictated that a princess could never be seen conversing with a commoner. *But no one will ever know, will they?*

They quickly set up the instrument in the gazebo and looked at the skies.

It was majestic. Magical. For the first time all night, she was entranced by the sight before her. After a long moment, she politely made way for him to look. It was only then that she realized she had not asked his name.

""By the way, what is your name?""

He reluctantly looked away from the eyepiece and gave a clumsy bow. ""I'm Paul, Your Highness.""

He looked as nervous and jumpy as a cat, as well he should, yet his curiosity still won out, and he quickly returned to the telescope. This made Laurence laugh, a true, genuine laugh, after which she said something she shouldn't have.

""Don't be so nervous. Honestly, this has been an extremely boring night. You saved me from missing this beautiful sight… please, call me just Laurance.""

The words hung in the cold night air.

In the sudden, sharp silence that followed, she felt their true weight. It was in the subtle scrape of leather as guards shifted their stances, in the faint metallic whisper of a hand tightening on the hilt of a sword.

A cold dread washed over her like snow falling on her head. She closed her eyes, it had been just a moment—a small indulgence in a shared passion.

Tomorrow was going to be a very complicated day.",6
1l9qc4w,mxenerp,"I ignored the rumors, and the babbling of drunk men and women in inns.
Yet now, the ship is silent, as I gathered all the crew on deck.
Around us the sea is calm, oddly so, as a fog descended on us out of nowhere.
""Captain...
Can you hear it?"" my first mate mutters.
I nod.
The slight shriek...it is mellow, melodic...
And it is approaching us.


""Prepare for battle.
We might encounter a pirate crew."" I say, and the crew brings out their weapons, and prepare their spells.
And then we see it.
A humgous ship...dragged by...
""Oh my Gods! Are those Abyss Whales?"" I hear one of my crewmates mutter.
Indees, the ship was dragged by the 2 behemoths.
The mast of the ship is a Screaming Siren, and on it...
Stood a woman.
I felt a dreadful feeling.
Then the woman disappeared.
""You smell of dirt. You just came to the Waters."" someone whispered in my ear.
I jumped back.


The whole crew tensed up, but when I looked at the woman that appeared behind me, I froze.
""Everyone stop!
She is not an enemy! I think..."" I shouted.
""Captain?"" the first mate walked up to me.
""You are blind."" I say to the woman.
Her pale grey eyes look at me.
""Yes, I am.
And you drylanders are in danger."" she says.
""You threatening us, pirate?"" the first mate growls.
She ignores him, still focusing on me.
""What is the danger?"" I ask.
She gestures around us.


""The Mist rose, and the Abyss awakens.
The Waters became unpredictable, and the beasts and spirits become aggressive."" she says.
The crew gasped.
""The Night of the Monsters.""/""The Breath of the Abyss."" they muttered some legends.
""Why are you telling us this?
You...you want to help?"" I ask.
She smirks
""Smart for a drylander.
Yes, Screaming Sirens are here to help."" she says.
""Why?"" I ask.


""Ma was a siren who helped others pass through the dangerous Waters, or to stop creatures from killing.
Pa was a pirate, that is true, but he explored the Waters, even against orders.
He never stole and killed though.
I continue their legacy...with my Siren crew."" she smiles, as the Screaming Sirens gets closer.
I can see the ship better, it's beautiful and...
Manned by men and women, all whom have various disabilities.
""All saved by me, all damaged by the Waters.
They are steeled against the dangers, for they have faced them already.
Are you ready be helped by us or are you too afraid?"" she asks.
""Lead the way."" I say, to the dismay of my crew, but a stare from me silenced them.
She smiled, and disappeared, as their ship started to move, and the shrieks resumed.
Oh my...was that...echolocation?
This was getting more and more confusing, and interesting by the minute.
And following them, we actually started to get out of the mist...
This, I want to get to know them more.
Their story...might be just more valuable than gold.",33

They say the sea demands a wary eye, lest you find yourself on the wrong end of the **Screaming Sirens**. Or so they say, and I hope it's true. This damned salt on my back itches, scratching at my skin like a thousand tiny crabs. I reach to relieve the torment, my hand slips, and I nearly tumble from this pathetic plank I'm clinging to. A quick, desperate scramble steadies me. Honestly, though, a shark might be a tempting alternative to this skull-splitting headache.

How long has it been? Two days, I think. I was aboard the *Sailing Pride*—an ironic name now, isn't it?—on a passage from Portugal to the Caribbean. Then, a storm. Not just any storm, but a beast of a squall that swallowed the horizon whole.

I was in the galleys, watching the chaos unfold in agonizing slow motion. A monstrous wave, truly colossal, dwarfing everything around it, crashed into our port quarter. It was easily half the mast's height. The impact was bone-jarring. A cannon, ripped from its moorings, hurtled straight for me. My life flashed before my eyes, only to be interrupted by another cannon breaking loose, deflecting the first one just enough. It saved me, but not the poor soul beside me. The cannon slammed into his chest and kept going as if he were made of air. Blood and gore exploded, a gruesome tableau, until I saw his oil lamp slip from his hand, tumbling straight toward a gunpowder barrel.

Pure, unadulterated terror fueled my legs. I sprinted, a frantic blur from starboard to port. Then, a blinding flash, a concussive blast that ripped through the ship, and… nothing.

The next thing I knew, I was bobbing on the open ocean, the acrid stench of gunpowder battling the salty spray. Something struck my arm, a sharp, sickening crack. I think it broke, but it was also my salvation: a large piece of the ship's wreckage. Clenching my jaw, I ignored the throbbing agony and hauled myself onto my new ""vessel."" There wasn't time to do much more than grip the board with white-knuckled desperation. A single glimpse of the *Sailing Pride* was all I needed to confirm her fate. The gunpowder magazine had detonated, tearing the ship in half.

After that, all I remember were the fading sounds of humans dying, drowning, burning… Yeah, best to not dwell on that.",5
1l9qc4w,mxfn6p6,"Jail was boring.

Ariel yawned. She could escape, of course, but it would ruin the plan. She was tempted to escape anyways, just to piss off Sebastian. An escape would also serve to reinforce her reputation. These sailors weren't nearly as afraid of her as they should be. They had already passed three planets they could have landed on, where her powers would be useless and she would be in actual trouble. But no, they insisted on bringing her to the core worlds for a public execution. The arrogance! Only one of the crew on the Imperial Dreadnaught Ursula looked at her with what Ariel considered to be an appropriate degree of terror. 

""Hey,"" she whispered through the bars of her cell. ""Hey Flounder.""

The man was a hybrid. Human DNA spiked with space born organics. She couldn't command him like she could the trueborn creatures of the void sea, but she could make him *feel* what she was. The man didn't respond. She glanced at the clock bolted to the wall above his desk. He looked at her with eyes wide with fear, then averted his gaze. Ariel sighed. ""Fine,"" she said. ""Be like that. I wasn't even going to kill you out of kinship, but this rude behavior leaves me little choice."" Flounder made a noise that sounded somewhere between a squeak and a whimper. ""Please, Lady of the Siren, I am as much a prisoner here as you."" Ariel gave him a flat gaze. ""Quite the proclamation from that side of these bars."" Flounder yelped as the airlock cycled. A man walked in and slapped the poor mutant. ""Chair!"" he demanded. Flounder scrambled to pull his own chair over to face Ariels cell directly. 

""Commander Rene,"" Ariel said. ""Terrible to see you, as always."" Rene sneered. ""I will never understand how such an idiotic girl managed to inspire so much fear."" He sat in the chair, and waved dismissively toward Flounder, as if he had anywhere to go. Ariel had seen him try before. The brig airlock was gene coded, and Flounder didn't have the right stuff. He just stood a little back, rubbing his cheek. Ariel looked at the clock. ""It's simple, really,"" she reclined her the uncomfortable steel bench and grinned at Rene. ""I keep besting you."" Rene's face began to turn red, but he composed himself before exploding. ""I have come at the request of King Triton,"" he said through gritted teeth. ""The Pirate King, your father, has agreed to diplomatic relations, but only if he gets back his love."" Ariel rolled her eyes at that. Rene flared his nostrils. ""I will ask you once, girl, and only once. Where is the Screaming Siren?"" Ariel glanced at the clock, then winked at Flounder. A shockwave shook the seat beneath her, and an alarm blared through the speakers.

""There she is now.""",10
1l9qc4w,mxi5vxe,"""Oh, you Amalia, no she isn't supernatural just extremely dramatic, and possesses a chip on her shoulder.""

The old sailor stared at me for several seconds before responding, ""Pardon?""

So I regaled him with the, Actual, tale.

Yeah, we grew up in the same town, knew each other since we were tots, and I can safely tell you that there isn't anything supernatural about her.

The real story, her mother was an entertainer from a foreign land, wonderful singer honestly probably where the siren part comes from, and her father was just a ship captain.

If anything he was a privateer, had a Letter of Marque, but barely ever did any real privateer business. Met, Amalia's mom while doing business overseas, but retired after her tenth birthday.

""Wait then what about the stories?"" He inquired, ""Her deadly voice and the sea creatures?""

Well, why she doesn't have any supernatural powers she was really good in figuring out how critters behave.

She figured out that dolphins can be trained while she was young, spent a lot of time at the beach training them, and liked to show off how she could get them to do things in command.

Also knows how to attract critters like sharks to areas, and how to get them to do things she wants. Not really tamed, but she knows how to get them where she wants them to be, or to keep them away.

Something about smells, I can't quite remember, been years since she explained it to me.

""What about her killer voice?""

I took a swig of my drink before continuing this part.

Well, remember how I mentioned her Mom was an entertainer, singing especially?

He nodded.

Amalia, is definitely not. Girl had the singing voice of a seagull feeding frenzy, but didn't like being told so. She was never afraid of raising hell when someone pointed it out.

Hah, deadly voice is right.

""Wait,how do we know that you're just not the one full of shit, exactly?""

Well,

""Captain, Amalia's ship was spotted off the eastern shore!""

I sat up from my seat, placing my hat and navy coat back on, before throwing some money on the counter.

""Well, we have kept in touch in a matter of speaking.""

As I walked towards the exit I gave one last answer, ""The only part you got right was that she is a pirate.""


(Some time off the eastern coast of the island)

~On tHe WavEs, the SIrlInG wAaAAvEs~

Captain Amalia, a Navy ship has been spotted off the starboard side!

Amalia jogged to the side, smile on her face, as she saw the familiar ship.

Perching herself in some ropes she called out.

""Gibson, still chasing me, people are gonna start talking you know!""

Her voices carried over the waters, passed the pod of dolphins that followed her vessel. Then a response echoes back to her.

""Someone has to save us all from that racket you call singing, Captain Siren Child!""

With a wirey smile, and a slight hint of frustration she mumbled to herself.

""Oh, you're gonna pay for that one."" She turns back to her crew, ""All hands to stations, and get some of those firerafts in the water.""

She gave a whistle, and the dolphins took up a formation at the ships side, ""Alright lads and ladies get ready to show little Gibby a new trick.""",5
1l9qc4w,mxgch34,"Part 2:

My mind usually rambles like this, but this time is a desperate attempt to cling to consciousness. If I sleep, I know I won't wake up, the numbness on my body tells me, its been a while since I felt my arm, that can't be good. The screams return, a chilling echo. No, think of something else. That old song from my childhood… how did it go?

""A fearsome tale we spin, me lads, of dangers on the foam, 

Beware the Screaming Sirens, lest ye never make it home! 

A woman at the helm, they say, with ocean in her blood, 

Born of pirate's fire, and a siren's deadly flood. 

With creatures of the deep at her command, and a voice to chill yer bones, 

Her song's as sharp as cutlass steel, that pierces through the stones!""

Gods, what an eerie song. Why are sailors like this? Why can't we sing about nice islands with sun-soaked beaches and plenty of rum? No, it always has to be something mysterious, deadly, and utterly grim. Ugh. So much for trying not to think about my impending death. Though, honestly? Being her crew does sound pretty badass if you ask me.

""I'd even consider joining them,"" I blurt out, not entirely sure why, but the idea strikes me as morbidly hilarious. ""Seriously, sounds like a laugh to be part of her crew.""

I stare up at the sky. I'm going to die here, aren't I? Man, at least I wish the clouds were still here. But no, it's all brutally sunny now. Guess I'll have to die on a happy note.

""Is that a proposition?""

The voice is cold, feminine, powerful. My heart punches against my ribs, a painful drumbeat. I look around. I'm alone, yet I hear it again.

""I won't ask a third time. Is that a proposition? Do you wish to join?""

Is that… *her*? Well, I'm already about to kick the bucket, so I might as well answer. ""Uh… sure, why not? I'm—""

A terrible pain sears through my chest. My heart pounds, faster and harder, until something cracks. A horrid, sickening sound. And then, I watch, horrified, as my own heart rips itself from my chest and plummets into the sea.

""Then it is sealed. Welcome to the crew.""

Suddenly, she's there. The most beautiful woman I've ever seen, mysterious and utterly serious. And somehow, I'm on a ship. An old, decayed one, rising from the sea itself.

""Officer, take him to his new quarters. He was about to die when we found him. He needs some rest.""

I try to speak, but the exhaustion is overwhelming, and consciousness simply fades.",6
1l9rblk,mxfgnwf,"I warned my brother that this ritual wouldn’t bring his daughter back. I told him that spirits often take far more than they give. But he wouldn’t listen. He summoned help from beyond, and it cost him his kindness. His empathy. His mind. The Ryan I grew with and loved was consumed by his hopeless, twisted prayer. 

I watched silently in horror from under a desk as the unnaturally stilted gangrene-limbed man I once knew as my brother stalk the empty office halls while beckoning out to his wife as if he were calling their children down for dinner. “Sheils, this is crazy honey. I love you but I need you to think about what you’re saying to me right now. Why should I starve myself and let the *face I own* spoil just because you’ve decided on a whim you want to keep it?  It’s not yours to keep honey, you’re being selfish. I’ll die if I don’t eat. Meet me halfway here”.  What sickened me more than his words was the tone of his voice. He seemed to earnestly mean every bit of what he had said- as far as he was concerned, his wife’s face *belonged* to him and he was entitled to eat it as if it were a sandwich she had playfully snatched from his fingers and run off with. 

“Found you. Mischievous today aren’t we?” I stifled a gasp and averted my eyes- but not fast enough to spare myself the grizzly image of the bravest person I’ve ever known- a woman any reasonable person would be lucky to call sister-in-law- flail her legs and defiantly scream as the towering spindled demon lifted her off the ground to meet his gaze. 

I closed my eyes and strained them until I saw stars in my vision. *CRACK*! Silence deafened the corridors. I felt the wind leave my sails as my stomach turned. “Charlie boy-o, not you too! What is going on with you guys today? Seriously,  I’ve had enough.  I know you’re down under that desk, you absolutely reek! Why are you looking at me like that? Did I do something to upset you?” I instinctively scrambled backward, only for the back of my head to make jarring contact with the cold granite wall I was pressed up against.",36
1l9rblk,mxfmiwr,"I hear the sounds of her voice all too loud despite the music blasting from every system in the house. I set it up on purpose to hide the sounds of the kitchen hood, which in turn is necessary to try and mitigate the scent, alongside copious amounts of air fresheners.

I move around frantically, knowing I'm on borrowed time now that she's awake. It'll only be another five minutes before her heightened senses zero in on me, maybe another three if she decides to make a game out of stalking me. These eight minutes are all I have to complete the final steps of the ritual.

I have no time to carefully measure the final pinch of alchemical ingredients. Eyeballing it is somewhat risky, but timing it is crucial, so I just go with my intuition and a low estimate. The heat of the enchantment is almost too much to bear, and sweat is dripping down my neck both from the temperature and the nerves. Still, there's nothing I can do now but see the process to its conclusion.

I hastily get the gloves and grab the tray with the blistering, searing mass of hand-crafted magic. I carefully arrange the prepared components and apply the arcane sigils with fresh blood. This is the smell that will draw her in in moments, but that's exactly what I'm counting on.

Not half a minute later, the doors to the kitchen burst open. There she stands, so familiar but so changed, with bloodlust in her narrow golden eyes, green scales running down her neck, and long claws promising naught but death and pain. Her jaws hang open unnaturally low, drool dripping down onto the floor, as her manic gaze surveills the scene before her. 

""Surprise, darling! Happy Transformation day!"" I exclaim, presenting her a tray with pieces of juicy medium-rare stake, carefully seasoned and accompanied with various veggies and pastries, combining into what could only be my greatest culinary masterpiece.

Her gaze softens and lingers on the plate, even as her drooling intensifies. ""Oh... Dear... You didn't have to..."" She mumbles, even as her claw reaches for the plate. I push it gently aside with a wide grin. ""Anything for you, my love. But not before you brush your fangs""",17
1l9kp4m,mxfkfjz,"""YEAH, NO SHIT!"" you cry, as the flames leap higher. The second you sat to enjoy your tea, the electric kettle exploded, engulfing your drapes and cabinets in a swirling inferno. You swat at the flames with your newspaper. You go for the fire extinguisher, but unfortunately, it's on fire.

""I must request that you relocate to the basement,"" your Tiny Maid Robot repeats.

You cough on all this drape smoke. ""HOW THE FUCK IS GOING TO THE BASEMENT A GOOD IDEA?""

""I must request that you relocate--""

Damn thing's blocking the only exit. You try to push the Tiny Maid Robot aside, but it is actually quite large and cumbersome. Countless anti-skid resistor pads line its weighted base. ""Tiny Maid Robot,"" you say, steadying your voice. ""This is an emergency. I request that you--""

""In case of emergency, please call the number printed on the inside of my control panel.""

The control panel is under the weighted base.

As if on cue, the flames leap to your spice rack. The smoke swells with Paul Prudhomme's Pizza & Pasta Magic.

""Shall I deploy the reticulated safety net?""

You wasn't aware this Tiny Maid Robot came with a reticulated safety net. What the hell's a reticulated safety net?

Before you know it, Tiny Maid Robot has deployed the reticulated safety net. You watch through its encumbering mesh as the last scrap of the kettle crumbles into char.

""TINY MAID ROBOT,"" you cry. ""REMOVE YOUR SAFETY NET!""

Tiny Maid Robot's head--an add-on you had installed to reduce the uncanny-valley nature of this whole thing--appears to slide from its robo-shoulders, thumping hideously to the floor. Why the hell wasn't the head more firmly attached? You watch, annoyed, as Tiny Maid Robot begins to secrete some sort of viscous brine. It issues a low, sonorous farting noise and then powers off.

Later, you watch from the curb as firefighters haul Tiny Maid Robot from the wreckage, and you fill with a resolve as bitter as your singed-off eyebrows. This is the last time you order appliances off Temu. Probably.

1l9p1hg,mxefvu5,"I arrive to the village, from where I am promptly sent to the forest.
Rude. They didn't even offered me a drink.
Nevertheless, I go where I am told and I do find the witch.
Quite easily, and as I see her, I sigh.
""Seriously?"" I mutter as I watch her tend to her vegetable garden.
She is literally linked to the entire goddamn forest' lifeline!
Now it makes sense how and why hundreds of villages complained about her.
I take her away, the whole forest is damage, which wouldn't be that big issue for a wizard...
But this forest is covering 60% of the entire Kingdom!


""Yo! Stalker! Will you come down and talk, or you get off by only watching?"" she shouts.
I freeze.
What...
I descend.
""Excuse me, I am William von Argent, Royal Wizard.
The villages around the forest raised a bounty against you."" I said.
She smiles at me, and gestures around.
""You can see my magic don't you?"" she asks.
I nod.


""You are a green witch, and you draw your power from the forest.
But in exchange...you tend to it, and protect it."" I sigh.
""So can you guess why villagers hate me, just before winter?
And after the harshest tax season? And a potential war on the horizon?"" she asks.
""They started to prepare for bad times.
Cutting trees and hunting."" I said.
""Overhunting and felling trees, when there are plenty of logs, and already fallen ones."" she frowned.
Then it makes sense.
""Want some tea? My cookies are legendary."" she continues.
I am surprised, but agree.


The tea and cookies are truly good.
""So? Am I going to jail?"" she asks.
She is so...calm.
""If I were a newbie, yes, but I know that you basically can't do anything detrimental to the land, nor can I take you away from it without damaging it."" I said.
""Then?"" she asks.
""Provide the villagers what they need without damaging the future of the forest."" I said.
She laughs.
""That is nice, but how can we do it?"" she asks.
""There is a part of the forest close to the Royal Capital.
We can meet there with ministers to find a way."" I said.
""Is that an invitation to a date?"" she winks at me.
I blush.


""W-well I will be going now.
I will tell Her Majesty about you, and have this movement started.
The forest snd the villagers are the foundation of our Empire."" I say, standing up.
She laughs.
""If only all wizards were like you."" she says.
I nod, and leave.
""See you then at the Meadow of Eternal Shroom!
Blushy!"" She shouts after me, as I fly away.
I almost fall.
Damn witch...
We just met, how is she doing this to me?
It must be the tea...or her smile...
Damn.",80
1l9p1hg,mxi5b4x,"Along the shoals of Willow's Tarry, brackish waves gently lapped the grey rocks and brown weeds, gently nudging the near dead shrubbery inward. 

A young woman knelt down to touch its brittle sprouts, paying no mind to the old man that was approaching her from the village's edge. He waited until he was a respectable distance behind her back, far enough to not impose any physical threat but close enough for her to hear him. 

He rose his walking stick to tap the ground and notify her of his presence since she undoubtedly didn't hear his steps in the grass and sand.

""Hello, wizard.""

""Greetings. I'm no wizard. I do not travel with the carnival. Although, I do drink with them quite often."" The old man chuckled. ""I'm a mage educated at Oxford. My name is Offal.""

The woman stood up and turned to face him, her drab skirt twirling with stiff muddy edges. ""Offal? That's an unfortunate name for a mother to give to a son.""

""Good thing it was my father then."" Offal noted that her eyebrow only rose a minute degree in amusement. He thought he was funnier than that. Then again, all men do. ""I'm here to meet a witch.""

""And you think I'm her?""

""Perhaps. I haven't a stone and a lake to verify though.""

The woman stiffened. ""That practice works on the most starved man just as much as the most gluttonous woman, wizard.""

""Not a wizard."" Offal corrected. ""I'm joking. Witches don't breath air. Why would they ever drown?""

""What makes you think that witches don't breath air?"" The woman asked. Was this another legend amongst the evangelical townsfolk? It was bad enough she had to give up sweeping her cabin because of last week's chatter.

""Well, fiction doesn't have lungs. They *come* from lungs."" Offal waved his hand exaggeratedly. 

""Oh."" The woman blinked. Offal reminded her of more than a few drunk uncles. ""I'm Beatrix.""

""Why did you think I was a wizard?""

""Well, the town keeps trying to get a trial for me and according to the town bylaws, we need a wizard from the court to officiate it. Then half the town argues that wizards are unholy and cannot be summoned even if to kill a witch.""

Offal nodded knowingly. ""And the other half?""

""They think the ends justify the means and that they need our town gypsy, Fred (who is really our town Etruscan) to summon a wizard.""

""And what does Fred think of this?""

""I dunno, you tell me. You're here, aren't you?"" Beatrix crossed her arms.

""Fair enough. A Greek fellow named Fred did show up in the Royal court asking for a wizard. He didn't realize that your town bylaws actually say 'mage', so everybody kept directing him to the carnival."" Offal muttered. ""By the time I was summoned, he told me of you and the town before leaving with the carnival to the east.""

""Huh. And what did he tell you?""

""There was a young woman who kept curing their town with the bark of various trees. And the town did not believe her when she said there was no point in divining humors.""

Beatrix smiled proudly. 

""He also told me that this young woman was also selling spells in hex bags at high costs. And that the wives who bought them are the ones needling their husbands to summon a wizard after finding their husbands still alive in the morning.""

Beatrix winced. ""I told them they had to express their energy hard enough. If it didn't work, they clearly still loved their husbands. That's something positive to take from the purchase.""

""I'm pretty sure they just wanted a dead husband.""

Beatrix's shoulders slumped. ""So are you here to take me to trial?""

""Yes, but not here. I'll take you to one of the lower Royal courts where you'll stand trial for practicing without an Apothecary license.""

""Not witchcraft?""

Offal shrugged. ""Witchcraft? The courts don't care about illusions meant to rob the gullible. Otherwise,  we would never have a carnival. Gather your things and I'll assure you it's probably a light sentence until you can pay the Apothecary guild for membership.""

Beatrix was surprised but nodded and started walking alongside Offal. ""So why did Fred leave with the carnival? He did have a life here.""

""Married some Romani woman at the carnival.""",12

I love the idea of a budding romance here and the fact that the magic users here are actually reasonable instead of just lobbing spells everywhere. You don’t see that in a lot of media anymore. Being wise used to be a prerequisite to using magic, it’s nice to see that in play here.

1l9k5i0,mxh7z2k,"My power is very confusing and is extremely challenging to use. The power to have all powers that nobody believes I have is, in all honesty, a bit of a mind f@&k. When I was first brought into the agency the agent believed that I was an all-powerful hero with limitless potential… my power thus made it so that I wasn’t all powerful and my potential was very much limited. When the agent asked me to demonstrate I was always handicapped by their belief in me. I remember when I started to fly and immediately crashed to the ground because the spectators thought I could fly. Same thing with super-speed (crashed into a wall), laser vision (awkwardly stared at a spot on the wall), breathing underwater (lifeguard had to perform CPR). I quickly realized that I needed to get creative.

 

The first thing that I had to overcome was how I personally defined the power I was using. Secondly, I had to convince everyone who is watching that the power I was demonstrating was not the power I was actually using because the moment that even one person thought that my power was anything other than what I told them could spell disaster. For example: I am not using the power of flight, I am manipulating gravity to allow me to lift off the ground. The average person would think that it was a flying ability, and I would reenforce that thought by telling them that “I could fly”. With this, incredibly twisted/confusing mindset I quickly went up the ranks of the Power Agency.

 

Everyone thinks that I could fly, have invulnerability, and mind reading powers. In reality I can manipulate gravity, have instantaneous regeneration and can see the future.",10

Jean looked at Mae, her large, bobbly eyes welling up. ""But look, he's so cute! I even named him!""

Mae's eyes went wide. ""You did what!"" she yelled. Jean’s chin began to tremble, but then the dragon, still nestled in her arms, stirred his head. With no mouth movement, his voice resonated in their minds, ancient and deep, a tremor through the very air.

**""What disturbs you, my dear Jane? Is this… 'Mae'… an issue?""**

Jean, head bowed, whispered, ""She just doesn't want you to stay with me!""

Jean began to cry, as any young girl would when denied a pet—except this time, it was a dragon. The dragon then turned his gaze upon Mae, and his voice, though still soundless, thrummed with a power that seemed to stretch across eons.

**""I may appear young, mortal Mae, but I am steeped in the collective wisdom of my ancestors, for we inherit their very memories. Worry not.

**""Nothing, mortal Mae. For our paths have intertwined, and I shall bear the name Willow with pride until the last ember of a dying star cools, until the cosmic twilight descends and the very fabric of existence unravels, when even the cold iron heart of the deep cosmos yields its final glorious light to the deep dark void.""**

""Um, what do those complicated things mean, Willow?""

The ancient voice vanished, replaced by a bright, excited boy. ""That we're gonna be together forever and ever more! Best friends forever! It's gonna be adventures and fun for the rest of our lives!""

Mae simply turned away, ignoring the dragon, who was now chattering cutely to an overly excited Jean as if he were an excited toddler himself.

""Please, take care of her,"" Mae said, bowing slightly to Willow.

And again, the ancient voice boomed, sending shivers down Mae's spine. **""Worry not, mortal Mae. Until my last breath, I shall guard her.""** As he spoke, the clouds above them grew dark, and thunder rumbled, making Mae grow pale.

""Bad Willow! She's my older sister, you know? I love her too!""

And just like that, the sun returned, bathing them in light. ""Sorry, Jane! Got carried away, but I looked cool, didn't I?"" The dragon grinned at Jane. And so, the story of the dragon and the girl began!",27
1l9eqox,mxc46g2,"It took a moment for my heart to stop racing. For the fear to settle into irritation. ""You could have mentioned this!""
The creature in front of me raised his hands, gleaming with black ichor. His skin was moonlight pale, and two graceful horns extended from his head. He looked like a mixture of a dream and a nightmare. Caught between one and the other.
His jaw set, ""what, tell you that im a monster? Watch you look at me with disgust like every other human?"" 

The grief in those words hurt. But simple assurances wouldnt fix it. But my instincts were usually good.
""No you ass."" Welp that's not how I wanted to start that sentence. But in for a penny in for a pound, ""you could have said hey I transform into a hot fucking shadow demon so I dont wake up and think im being robbed by fucking Satan."" I picked up the pillow at my side and hurled it at him.
He blinked as it hit him with a soft *flumph*

Silence fell as the pillow fell to the floor. Both of us in a state of somewhat shock. 

""...a hot shadow demon?"" He asked. Teasing but there was something in his tone. Hope that seemed fragile, like a flower blooming already expecting to be crushed.
A flush surged up on my cheeks. Hells. I had called him hot. 
""No. Shut up."" Real mature there. Smooth as silk.

He grinned, and holy shit were those fangs? Fangs? Shit . Id always had a crush on him, but this was insane.
He stepped closer to the bed. A taunting tilt to his lips, ""im pretty sure you said hot""
""Im pretty sure you should be apologising for scaring the shit out of me at 4 am.""
That made him laugh, the tension between us easing. ""I should. Didnt even notice the time to be honest.""

""Youve never been good with time"" being chronically late to everything was his habit after all.

""True."" He sobered then, ""you're actually okay with this?""

I scrunched my nose at the thought i wouldnt be. ""Of course? If you were going to hurt me you would have done months ago. But a little warning next time. Don't fucking lurk in the shadows like a creep""

That made him laugh again, and gods it was nice to hear it unrestrained. There was a resonance to it, a vibration in the air that was more than his normal voice. 
""Okay no thats fair. Didn't think about that. Was just trying to steal a blanket cause its cold as shit.""

I shifted to my side, lifted up the warm blanket. It wasnt a sexual invite. Something in him was certain id run away. I wanted him to know I wouldnt. 
""You sure?"" He questioned. Voice thick.
I wanted to tell him of course I was sure. He didnt frighten me. Even like this. He'd always felt safe to me, like a port in a storm.
""Get in dumbass before I leave you to freeze"" just once id like to say what I meant. 
Another grin dance across his lips before he slunk into bed with me.being sure to return my pillow as he went. He was cold. But as I brought the blanket up over his shoulders, letting the moment settle into calmness, I couldnt help myself. ""So...Fangs huh?""
""Shut up""
""No no theyre very cool. In a gothic I vant to suck ur blood way""
His voidlike eyes narrowed. ""Shut up"" but there was warmth there. An impish flash of delight took over me ""can I make a bite me joke or will that spoil breakfast?
He groaned and hit me in the face with a pillow.

Worth it.",166
1l9eqox,mxg49pn,"My thoughts whirled, grasping at anything to make sense of the beast standing in the kitchen coupled with the familiarity of its voice.

“T-Tucker?” I finally managed to sputter.

“Yeah, bitch, it’s me.” He retorted, words dripping in exasperation as he shuffled through the fridge. “Do we have anything like… more bloody or something to eat?”

I kept staring, overwhelmed with a disbelieving panic that only happens when something's too real to be a dream. So that was settled. Tucker, my roommate, my tragically gay soulmate, was, for some reason, occupying the form of a… monster. Patchy fur across his arms, eyes glowing faintly red, and... fangs, perhaps? Part lycanthrope, part vampire, part something.

“Tucker… why? What?” were the only intelligible words I was able to exclaim between stuttered confusion.

He sighed as if *I* was being unreasonable. “I took something at a party last night. I thought it was molly. I guess I don’t know what molly looks like. I was trying to let loose! God forbid!” He slammed the fridge door shut, perhaps with more force than intended, as we heard the clang and crash of bottles from within. “My bad.”

I found myself slowly emerging from the doorway I was hiding half of my body behind. It really was Tucker. He made a big to-do yesterday about wanting to go out with some of our more extroverted friends in lieu of our usual nightly routine of smoking weed and watching Gilmore Girls. I decided to stay home because I’m a creature of habit and now Tucker was… well… a creature.

“This is what I get for one fucking night out…” He was continuing to ramble while I was still in processing mode.

“You seem weirdly chill about it,” I started. “I mean – you do seem pissed, but this seems like the same amount of pissed as when Mindhunter got canceled, not turned-into-a-fucking-monster levels of pissed.”

He sighed and took a seat at the little thrifted dining table, gesturing for me to come join him. I very reluctantly took a seat at the opposite end.",15
1l9eqox,mxg4c3j,"“I had my freak out last night, babe. This is supposed to wear off by tonight. I was dancing with a guy. He gave me a pill.”

“And he said it was Molly?”

“He said it was going to keep me up all night and feel something I’ve never felt.”

I stared at him with blatant judgement.

“I WAS TRYING TO LET LOOSE.”

“Okay, okay. Sorry. Go on.” It was in that moment I started to recognize his actual features behind the monster-ness of it all. Tucker’s brown eyes, his nose, his mouth. It looked like him beneath it all, as if he was given the most world-class prosthetic treatment for a high budget film.

“So I took it. Went back to his place. Next thing I know, I’m either insanely horny, hungry, or both. He was thrilled. I figured I was hallucinating—looked in the mirror, saw this”—he gestured to himself—“and yeah. Not a hallucination.”

I stared at him, unwaveringly focused. “So who is this guy? He did this to you then?”

Tucker nodded. “Beth, this guy was a fucking freak. I was looking around his apartment and it was like a teenage girl obsessed with Twilight’s fucked-up fantasy. Books everywhere about werewolves and vampires and creepy-cryp—”

“…crypto-zoology?” I finished, and Tucker nodded again.

“Beth. This guy turned me into *this* with a pill. When I realized, I lost my shit, threatened to call the cops – he told me to just enjoy it and that I’d be back to normal within a day. Said the cops would fuck up my life if I showed up looking like this. I mean, he’s probably right. And, well…”

Tucker adopted a sheepish, guilty grin that he immediately tried to erase. And it hit me.

“Oh my god, Tucker, you fucking slept with him still?”

“GOD FORBID I LET LOOSE A LITTLE.” He exclaimed, standing up from the seat and walking away dramatically.

I put my face in my hands, processing the insanity of it all. I guess in this new age of tech and genetic engineering, to make someone appear different temporarily maybe wasn’t THE most insane thing, but the rate at which it worked – this mystery man was clearly a genius, though unethical and insane on countless levels.

“Tucker, we need to talk to him. What if he’s lying? What if you don’t go back to normal?”

It was clear Tucker didn’t want to entertain the idea that this was anything other than very temporary. “No. It’s temporary.” He asserted, suddenly very serious, and that was the first moment I heard real fear in his voice.

I nodded slowly. “Okay, you’re right. Temporary. Let’s just wait and see.”

“Can you please go get me a burger? I’ll send you money.” He said, continuing to ponder. “Actually, maybe a few burgers.” I rolled my eyes and grabbed my keys, about to head out the door.

“Actually – can you just get some raw burger patties at the store?” He corrected.

If he didn’t go back to his regular self that night, we had a very real problem.",14
1l9otoa,mxf2h6t,"""I fear for the younger generation of mages. They literally cannot read their Grimoire to any standard considered a basic level. Spellbook comprehension is atrocious. And the signs? They don't even bother, they just as the oracles to do their premonitions instead. They all just go chat with Gryneium, Phemonoe, and Tages, and just take what they say at face value.""

""I know, your eminence, and worse still, the instructors do it too, trying to figure out if the students have gone to chat with G, P, and T, they go chat with G, P, and T. Do they not realize how much hallucinogenic mist those oracles are breathing, all the time? Sure, they can glimpse the truth from time to time, and even a future future that may not yet come to pass, but still... I've always taken everything any oracle says with a heaping helping of salt.""

""As well you should, generative prophecy is as unreliable as these current students reading ability. Your report stated that less than a quarter of the students are even functionally literate in the arcana alphabet. The recently enhanced access to the oracles alone cannot be the whole cause of this. Tell me bluntly, administrator, what is happening here?""

""I think, sir, that perhaps the 'no mage left behind' initiative might have something to do with it.""

""What?""

""Respectfully, sir, some mages aren't meant to be archmages. The current generation doesn't *all* need to become esoteric researchers. We will still need some run of the mill artificers to make all the everyday things we use. Do you know the magic toilet enchantment by heart, sir, or would you hire out a replacement if your latrine enchantments wavered?""

""My latrine enchantments would never!""

""I'm not saying they would, but mine might, and I too, am a highly ranked archmage. I would certainly hire a lesser mage to fix the toilet. Toilets are beneath me, and you too.""

""But all mages should be equals!""

""High-minded, but impossible, and you know it. Do you consider us as equals, your eminence? You have easily triple my mana capacity, and double my years. I'm sure if we fought you would squash me in mere moments.""

""Hmmph. You've made your point administrator.""

""Have I made it strongly enough for you to rescind the 'No mages left behind' initiative?""

""FINE! Yes you have, but... I am placing *you* personally in charge of the return to the old ways."" 

""Unless you plan to undo the Legion of Locations Magic applied to the oracles by those archmages with more talent than ethics, I suspect we'll have to come up with a *new*, new way to teach them. Perhaps beatings could be part of it, though I suspect that might have other, unexpected knock on consequences.""

""Beatings were common in my day. We had a lot more necromancers back then too, *surely* they weren't related. Come up with something *actually* new.""

""Well... maybe beatings are out then. I'll think of something. Somehow, we've got the get the young mages back in their Grimoires, and out of their chats with G, P, and T.""

""Practical tests, more laboratory work as part of the curriculum, perhaps? Make them prove their skill in act, not just on the scroll.""

""Is that how it was in your day, sir?""

""Somewhat, yes. We didn't even have magic circles well researched back then, and communication stones? Forget about it, we just shouted down the hall.""

""Hmmm... I can work with that. We might have a half a generation of unfixable mages already, but the next ones we can hopefully keep from going down the same path. Some will fail, and some will shine, but all of them will have a place in society. I worry about these illiterate prophecy addicts though.""

""As do I. But lets worry about helping them another day. If our efforts at the next generation fail as well, then perhaps the same solution will work for both sets of generations we failed.""

""Wise as always, sir.""

1l93bob,mxa5qrz,"I could remember it well, part of the blessed curse of my kind. Unfading memory, no matter how old we grew. It was an average week day for most, downtime for us in our adventures. It had been an overcast day, threatening rain that never appeared.

We had been joking about a recent escapade, venturing into the cave of a pregnant Rock-bear and her mate. It was my idea, wanting to observe and study the birth. Part of my studies on rare creatures, exploring where no sane person would even dare think about. And it had been wondrous. They hadn't seen our arrival, nor notice our presence at their birth.

That was until Jernen sneezed. Out of the blue, where he couldn't hold it in. It made me jump, as it broke the stealtg enchantment upon him. The very, very angry papa bear showed his displeasure by attempting to eat Jernen. We had run, and managed to escape without further incident.

Jernen had looked over at me, a shy smile on his lips. I was finishing saying how I wished I could have someone to care for who cared for me, like the bears. And he had said in that quiet voice of his. ""I bet I can make you fall for me.""

I laughed, nudging him with my shoulder. I answered with two words. ""Challenge accepted.""

And like that, it began. He courted me throughout the years. I of course accepted it, because it was only a few decades to me. Plus, it was a challenge to him. It would hardly be fair if I ignored it.

We had wed a few years later. He wanted to experience it, as did I. With the benefits avaliable to married couples as well, it was a no brainer really. It had been a beautiful winter wedding, snowfall as we joined hands.

The years flew by, etched in my mind but melting away like ice in the summer. So many pleasant times, with me for the remainder of my long existence. A few sad times to mix in. The odd fight, and embarrassed apology after. A tapestry of life, mine and his together.

But it didn't last. He faded away, as they always did. He grew old, old and weary, whilst I remained appearance wise in my prime. Illnesses hit harder, his reactions slowed. I helped him, of course I did. I wouldn't abandon him now, not after so long.

And now, the spectre of death hung close. I could feel it, as could he. He lay in bed, breathing gradually becoming more laboured. But he still managed to turn to me, his humour present, as he whispered. ""So... did I win our little bet?""

I knew exactly what he meant. Many responses filled my head. Joking, comforting, even charming. But only one was right. I held his hand tightly, knowing it was only right for me to tell him the truth.

I leaned in close, giving my gentle smile. ""No. You didn't.""

He blinked, but I quickly continued. ""Because I had already fallen for you before we made it, my love.""

His face broke in a wide grin, looking up to the ceiling above. ""I'm so glad.""

It didn't take long after. He closed his eyes, as I sung over him, as he so loved. Between notes he breathed out, a rattling breath that I knew was his last. My sing petered out, as I leaned in to steal one last kiss.",617
1l93bob,mxc3ad4,"""Not the way you wanted to, darling."" 
He smiled, wrinkled lips shifting the hair around them back into the messy nest it inevitably became. 
""You bastard. Don't mix your silly philosophies into this, just admit it."" 
A smile of my own found its way as I tried to fix his beard once again. I uttered a few protestations as he kept pushing, trading small thoughts, but eventually I found enough of my words.
""I found a new sense of joy for the small nothings. You helped me see that, and I'll always carry it. But the way you love, the passion you lived in and for, that was never me. I couldn't fall for you, because I can't feel like that. 
A thousand years before you, maybe a thousand more, but these decades will always stay with me. 
You will always stay with me.""
He chuckled, a wheezing breeze that seemed to come from beneath him rather than his own body. 
""Sounds like I won well enough!"" 
""Because you're a stubborn little thing. Your species feels differently, you know."" 
His chuckles turned to coughs. 
""Or we have differen ways to esplain the same thing! Who k-nows, you might evn lose a tear for me..""
""My sweet summer being, brought to the autumn of life.""
My hand found his cheek, and my eyes found his, once-bright but clouded with age. 
""You were more special than I expected. Maybe, if we had another few lifetimes together, I would have understood enough of you to feel something similar to what you've described throughout these years, to what I've seen time and time again. Your choice of challenger was difficult, even for an elf."" 
His breath began to shorten even more, now. It wouldn't be long. 
""I know."" 
It was a whisper. I leaned closer, to make it easier for him, almost putting my face to his.
""But I also knew you were the only one I wanted to challenge."" 
His impetuousness always tickled me, which I had always found odd. I chuckled, and noticed water has fallen onto him, following his wrinkles off onto the pillow. As his light died, more came, and with a suddenness I realized where it came from. 
""Maybe you did win, after all.""",41
1l93bob,mxgb6d1,"I sit on the chair by their bed, doctors said there is nothing else they can do, but keep her comfortable. Humans die so fast. I reach down and grab her hand. She opens her eyes and makes contact with mine, “So, did I win our little bet?”

I look back at her. I think back the sixty years I’ve known her. Back to the time, 5 years after we met, and started adventuring together. We avenged her father, her kingdom, but in doing so, made it so she was unfit to rule. I think back on why I had joined. My old friend Domgar the dwarf had said this was to be his last adventure, and he wanted it to be with me. Considering I was the one who could drink his father under the table, it sounded like a request I could easily fulfill. His connection to the quest was three human generations back, when the great grandfather had attended his father’s funeral, had a drink, and a promise was made to help the family in time of need. 

So we had joined a party of adventurers, one Princess who had been chased out from her own land, family brutality killed eighteen years prior. Domgar had been waiting for her to come of age, and then when she was twenty five, she was ready. She had forged her blood axe, sharpened it, and was ready to use it. 

Finding the king, who had stabbed her father, after surrendering, pleading to not destroy their kingdom. Her mother buying just enough time to get the daughter out, down the hidden dwarfish tunnels to the north. Right before the Seven year tithe, a period of non-contact the dwarves do once every two centuries, training all the next generation. She lived there seven years under the ground, learning the forge. Blacksmithing, and finding a talent no one would have expected. 

When she emerged she learned of her kingdoms complete fall. Now a vast bog, as if the gods of death had cursed her kingdom. It was then she received the call, become justice for her people. For her family. But she must prepare first. Eleven years it took to prepare. I visited when just a year was left. She had locked herself in the forge, as was tradition from the god of the forge. He didn’t know when she would come out, but knew we had to be ready when she did. This is when I learned her story. 

She didn’t rush, like humans like to do, but she didn’t just wait like my kind do. She proceeded forward, and waited and got her perfect revenge. Two years we got revenge, three years we stopped the king’s resurrection but she lost her royalty status to do so. A noble sacrifice, but it left us afterwards, at the pub, wondering what to do from there. Me being a nomad wasn’t worried, but Domgar’s adventuring time had finished. He had his family to return to, his promise fulfilled. He had just bit us goodbye when she looked at me, a little drunk, and made the bet. 

And what’s a small bet like this, to a three thousand year old elf? I asked her “are you sure? I have rigorous requirements. I don’t stay in one place, but move around constantly.” 

“Then we will go together, and see the world” was her response. “Besides, there is nothing here or anywhere else for me now”

“You could have gone with Domgar. Returned to the forge.”

“I could have, but that isn’t the forge for me. His son who was trained with me should manage that fine. I’ll find my forge on the road.”

So we paid our tab, and slept off our drink, and we wondered. We stopped in various kingdoms, she forged weapons of war, or plowshares wherever we went. She helped local blacksmiths improve, but never had her own forge for long. Three years is the most we would spend in one place. And we would never go back. 

Thinking back over everything, I can’t name a singe point in time when I lost the bet, but I know I had lost it. Considering how drunk she was when she made it, and that we never talked about it since, I wasn’t sure she remembered it at all. I can’t speak though, I can only nod my head, and tears form in my eyes. 

She smiles as I cry, and grabs the locket that has hung around her neck since the bet. With a surprising amount of strength, she pulls it off, and breaks it open. And on one side I see Domgar. Perfectly crafted in the middle out of the red metal that was her blood axe, but tiny, so so tiny. “Return this to her when you have the chance. But this one” she places the other half in my hand and closes it around the warm metal “you keep.” 

She then closes her eyes, and her breathing slows, and stops. She grows cold far too fast. But in my hand, still warm, is a pair of figures crafted in a hug, a warm loving embrace. It is of her and I. I hang my half on my neck. Comforted by its warmth, knowing she will always be with me.

Wait, did she say Domgar was a female?",9
1l93bob,mxi1vu2,"""So, did I win our little bet?""

The healers have ceased their bustling around the room. The clouds of incense, whose spicy, saccharine smell I loathed when Elora first began her descent, are now strangely comforting. We have been doing this for so long, I find that I have come to associate the scent with her–with the long hours beside her bed, the frequent visits to the houses of healing that forced us to slow down. No more adventures to the edge of the world. No more slaying dragons.

""You know,"" I say, squeezing her hand, which is always so cold these days, ""I believe we have learned more about one another in the past few months than we ever did during our courtship or even our first year of marriage.""

She rolls her eyes. ""Tyr, I don't think--"" She gasped in pain, then sank further into the pillows. ""I don't think we have time for another of your... thoughtful replies.""

Still so sharp. Her quick tongue is one of the reasons I accepted her bet in the first place.

I have always been fascinated with humans. Though many of them walk through their brief lives as though they are immortal, their flash-in-the-pan nature seems to affect every aspect of their culture. With every second so precious, they are obsessed with convenience. They seem to have a new little machine or a new spell every time I blink. They speak of a single day as something one must take hold of, must wring, like a wet cloth, of all its pleasures.

Mother hated how much time I spent in the neighboring human village as a youth. But having only lived for twelve years, I had not yet grasped the meandering flow of time. I craved danger just as the humans do. Though I think Elora craved it even more than I did. 

I thought myself brave, even reckless, when I joined a band of adventurers. Then we met our first quarry–a massive troll who'd been terrorizing a defenseless hamlet nearby. And as I sat under cover, strategizing our best route to victory, thirteen-year-old Elora limped back behind our boulder–no one had even noticed her leave–with bloodied sword slung over her shoulder and eyes ablaze from the thrill of the fight. The troll had snapped her leg, but not before she had managed to plunge her blade into its belly.

It took many quests and many years for our band to learn to work together, and it was Elora and I, more than anyone else, who butted heads the most. When we were sixteen, I distinctly remember arguing that ""you can't just stab a dragon, Elora.""

And she disagreed!

""Is there a single thing you can accomplish without depending on that cursed blade?"" I asked, having stewed on the insult for months. Somewhat ashamed of my rudeness, I looked down and continued scratching a battlemap in the sand.

""I bet I can make you fall for me.""

Taken aback, I met her eyes, so green and so completely earnest. She quirked an eyebrow.

""Well?""

I let a smile slip onto my face, resuming my map-scratching. I had nothing to lose, really. Her life would be so short, so even if I stayed with her for the rest of her life, I wouldn't even have reached one hundred by the time of her death. It would certainly be an interesting few decades.

Mother would be furious.

I chuckled. ""All right."" I lifted my eyes to hers again. ""Challenge accepted.""

I was pretty certain she would win, but I did not expect to be beaten so soundly or so fast. Holding to human tradition, our courtship was short. We married only a year later. And I was right; Mother was incensed. Her fury is not as amusing as I thought it would be, though. She refuses to be in the same room as Elora or our son, Eldrin. “His blood is contaminated,” she says.

Our son is perfect, and his blood is fine. It is my bride’s blood that is contaminated. It kills her from within.

The healers say this can happen to humans sometimes. Their bodies get confused and forget to clot their blood, forget to defend against illness, and can even poison themselves. And this is not the kind of human sickness they can just cut out. Believe me, Elora asked. She would have taken a blade to this enemy, too, if she was able.

“Are you going to answer me? Or will you let me die without knowing?” Her tone is playful, but the question stabs.

I kiss Eldrin’s tiny, fuzzy head and transfer him to her arms. He stretches for a moment, then snuggles into her chest, asleep once more.

I struggle to speak past the knot in my throat. “Our time was not supposed to be this short!”

She grimaces. “Tyr–”

“No! I knew we would not grow old together. But when I accepted your challenge, I expected decades. Stars, I have not even reached the Slowing yet! You have not a single silvered hair. Our son–” I cannot continue. Instead, I bury my face in the bedcovers at her side.

Her cold fingers twist in my hair, and we lie there quietly. My body quakes with silent weeping for a while, until her steady breathing calms me. We breathe as one for the last time.

“So, I won, right?” She asks again.

I lift my head and choke out “Yes, Elora.” I cannot help the laughter that escapes as well. “You won, My Love.”

She closes her eyes with a satisfied smile. “That’s good to know.”",7
1l93bob,mxe9m09,"""What bet?"" ""You know the bet that I could make you fall for me when we started dating."" ""I told you then and I'll tell you now; I've already fallen for you. I love you with every fiber of my being. You and me are meant to be together forever. Now take this potion."" The dark gray haired old woman couldn't lift her back only weakly lifting her neck. The otherworldly lithe elf helped her lift her head as he opened a bottle filled with red shining liquid. As she drank the liquid her hair started changing from dark gray to brown and the rest of her body started deaging. ""Now we always will be together. I will always be with you."" The elf said. ""O great..."" the now young woman said sarcastically. ""Hey I just saved your life. A little gratitude would be appreciated."" ""You did it just as much for yourself as for me"" she said as she poked the elf. ""You're right."" He said as he embraced her in a hug.

1l9rzdz,mxfq1u4,"Yesterday was insane.

Planet Breaker returned and his plasma blast had incinerated a quarter of Capital City. Fortunately, he was stopped in less than an hour thanks to a quick response by the Capital Protectors. 

I work at a crisis hotline that heroes like the protectors call when they're at the end of their rope. We see these guys as unbreaking and unrelenting, but their close up seat to the things that the news would get fined for showing us weighs heavily on them. 

Almost all of the Capital Protectors called in before the end of my shift yesterday. A colleague of mine got a call from Steel. We knew that was coming. News footage showed him surviving a plasma blast that completely obliterated the family he was trying to protect. His impenetrable skin was perfect for protecting his internal organs, but his body could only cover so much. 

Another colleague was on the line with Track Star. I've received calls from her before. Her happy-go-lucky persona hides the guilt she feels when she's not fast enough to move everyone to safety. I'm sure she's in the gym right now training to run faster than a plasma blast, but I don't think that's gonna happen unless she comes across another radioactive hummingbird.

I heard at the water cooler that somebody had to talk The Thinker out of quitting. Her heart couldn't take another mind going silent moments before rescuers pulled the body from the rubble. She needed a reminder that she saves more people than she misses.

The hospital called us and my supervisor was on the line with Tank trying to convince him to accept medical care. He was tired. He happened to be on site for all 4 of Planet Breaker's attacks. He accepted medical care when he learned of Planet Breaker's fate.

Which brings me to Captain Capital. No call from him. We've never had a call from him. Maybe he has his own personal therapist that he talks things out with. Maybe he's just built for this type of thing. However, the fight ended with Captain Capital crushing Planet Breaker's heart. It happened so quickly, the news cameras didn't have time to cut the feed. 

Captain Capital had never ended a life before that (at least not to the public's knowledge). He never had to. He has a toughness and speed unmatched by anyone on the planet. He led the Capital Protectors for a reason. It was a move one would expect from a war hero like Tank, but Captain Capital always seemed so above it all. So unflinching. So unwavering. So consistent. 

I wasn't on the line with any of the Protectors yesterday. I had spent most of the day trying to convince Clonin' Cody that he was not responsible for the actions of his evil stray duplicate. I had a relatively uneventful day as I kept an eye on the news.

However, that changed this morning. I clock in, get to my desk, and receive a phone call within minutes. 

I hear incontrollable sobbing on the other line. 

""Hero hotline, here to support those who support us"" I say. ""Who is calling and how may I assist, you're not in this alone.""

The sobbing continues for half a minute. 

""Is everything alr—""

""The b-blood won't come off my g-glove..."" a broken voice manages to muster out.

Broken as it may be, this voice was recognizable from hundreds of press conferences, news interviews, and public addresses over the decade. It was Captain Capital as no man had heard him. Broken, hurt, and unsure.

""I've been washing my hands for hours,"" he continues, only slightly more composed ""b-but the blood won't come off.""

""Maybe you should take the glove off."" I respond gingerly, not entirely knowing what tone to take with a broken demigod.
 
""O-Okay. I can try that"" he responds. ""GAAAAAH!!!""

I hear him scream. ""Is everything okay sir?"" I ask calmly. 

""IT'S ON MY HAND! THE BLOOD IS ON MY HAND! IT'S UNDER MY NAILS! IT'S ALL RED! HIS BLOOD IS ON MY HAND!""

This one seems above my pay grade. I wave my supervisor over and place the phone on speaker, ""Sir can you hold on while just a second whi—""

""NO!!! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!! HELP ME GET THIS BLOOD OFF MY HANDS! PLEASE!!""

My supervisor also immediately recognizes the voice. 

""Hey Captain,"" my supervisor begins, ""Are any of your friends there to help with the blood?""

""Nononono,"" Captain Capital responds frantically, ""My friends can't be near me! I hurt people! I don't want to get blood on them too!"" 

""But Captain,"" my supervisor begins encouragingly, ""you save people. Even yesterday, you saved a lot of lives.""

There's a few seconds of silence

""Then why won't the blood come off..."" He says this in the steadiest voice he's had all call. We hear a click and then nothing. 

""Do you think that's the last we've heard of him?"" I ask my supervisor. 

""I hope so,"" he answers. ""That man's mind is gone. If he comes back, he's bringing only destruction""",6
1l9tu1v,mxgh7lf,"""Finally.""

Haral breathed the word, peering through the dense bushes. His leather armour was coated in mottled greens and browns, letting him blend in to the wild growths with greater ease. A pair of silvered daggers hung from a belt, as he held the prepared crossbow.

Cold brown eyes fixed on the prey before him, unflinching in their resolve. His breathing was light, keeping his body as still as possible. The smell of crushed plants filled his nose, natural oils obscuring his scent from the beast.

And what a beast it was. It was hunched, yet if it was tall it would be head and shoulders over him. Thick grey fur covered its body, rippling with each move. Long arms clawed the ground, carving furrows in soft earth. Its breath steamed onto the air, spilling from its fanged maw.

The werewolf pawed around a tree it had found, sniffing and huffing as it did so. Haral watched, taking care to aim carefully. He want a kill shot if possible, or at the least as close to crippling as he could to finish it off easier.

A sudden snap of a stick made him freeze. The wolf turned its head, peering towards the source. It gave a growl, lowering its head.

A patter of feet followed, as a figure burst into view. A human girl, nearly a teen, leapt at the wolf, extending her arms. Haral swore, watching as they grappled each other. Yet he gaped as she bit into the beast, giggling as she growled back at it. They rolled around as the hunter stood.

He raised his crossbow, shouting at the girl. ""GET AWAY! GET BACK!""

The girl turned her head, spotting him in an instant. The werewolf spun, positioning itself between her and Haral. It gave a snarl, as she quietly spoke. ""Who are you?""

He gestured at her to move. ""I'm a hunter! Now get out of the way! That is a beast!""

She reached out, patting the wolf. ""This is Fuzzy. He is nice, not a beast.""

The hunter snarled in return. ""Yes he is! He has been ruining Springriver, you silly girl. Now get out of the way!""

She crossed her arms, shaking her head. ""No! That's not Fuzzy! That's the new one. The mean one.""

The wolf crouched. He watched as her eyes moved over his shoulder, widening. Her voice was loud, piercing at something. ""Get down Mister!""

Before he could react, Fuzzy sprang forwards. Drool dripping from its maw, it was on him in a flash. He tensed, prepared for an impact. One that never came. Instead he felt a rush of air, before a heavy thud sounded behind. Growls filled the air, from the wolf he had spied and another.

Haral turned, spotting a brutal, animalistic fight. The grey form he had hunted snapped and clawed at one similar, though its fur was flecked with spots of brown. He felt a drop of sweat roll down his back, cold filling him. One werewolf was bad enough, but two was terrifying.

The girl pointed, voice desperate. ""Help Fuzzy, please!""

He turned, looking aghast. ""Help?!""

She nodded furiously. ""That brown one is the one you want!""

Haral rolled his eyes, taking a shaky breath. ""How can I believe that?!""

A snarl made him turn, seeing Fuzzy underneath the other. The girl screamed again. ""Help him!""

He gulped, shaking his head as he turned. ""Helping a monster, what am I doing?""

The crossbow rose, as he took aim. It shuddered as it fired, the bolt flying through the air and burying itself in the brown wolf's upper chest. It howled, reeling back. Hate filled eyes locked onto him, as it was pushed off balance by Fuzzy.

Haral shook his head again, grumbling as he shakily loaded another bolt. ""Stupid. This is stupid.""

But he didn't stop. He couldn't now. He could at least make sure the other one was dead. Then he could decide what on earth to do with this 'Fuzzy' and the girl.",6

I am free!"" the doppelganger said.  
""No, I didn't."" I said,  
It froze.  
""What do you mean?!  
He was the human one! The real one!  
And you shot him."" it said.  
I nodded.  
""That was my plan."" I said.  
It froze.

  
""What plan?"" the doppelganger asked.  
""I have seen the atrocities my friend has made, and so, I started looking for a way to clean out the trash."" I started.  
It was confused.  
""Since I couldn't go the legal way, considering how rich, and influential he was, I thought really hard.  
""How could I do this, without leaving a mark?"", and I realized.  
Best way to get rid of him, without nobody noticing is..."" I continued.  
""Is if he never disappears.  
It was you! You sent me the letter, and the vial of blood!"" the doppelganger said.  
I nodded.

  
""Why?  
Aren't you afraid of the damage I could cause?"" it asked.  
""To whom?  
To his huge company that ruins the lives of normal people?  
Or to his renown as a man who always gets what he wants?  
I tried for decades to curb his greed, and now I did."" I smiled.  
""What if I am worse?"" it asked, but I could see it.  
The doppelganger regretted saying it.  
""As if you could be worse.  
I saw you as ""him"", and you actually cared for your employees, freaking them out."" I laughed.  
It blushed.

  
""Now what?"" it asked.  
I packed my stuff, and turned to leave.  
""Doppelganger stuff.  
Get rid of the other body, and we have a barbeque planned, mate."" I said, leaving.  
""That's it?! You accept me?  
I am not human!"" it shouted after me.  
""Neither was he."" I answered, leaving the basement.  
It is cruel, it is wild...  
But it had to be done.  
The alternative was worse.",350
1l96u8k,mxfi0kg,"Clair looked at her ammunition: one bullet left. No pressure.

The scarred woman pointed her weapons towards the mass of cackling toxic blue. She could see red lights inside, one of them was the nucleus, the others decoys designed precisely for this: Conceal its position.

The mass of toxic waste chuckled with dark voice as a big man was fighting to get free of it, his tactical suit and skin getting melted in contact with the monstrosity.

""Clair! Shoot! Shoot! You have to hit the right one! Quick!""

Clair looked at her companion being consumed, sighting as she glazed quickly at the red lights. There was no time to be horrified, there was no time to save him, there was no time for pity or to remember the good times. In a few seconds she would also be engulfed in the toxic waste and then all would be lost, well maybe not, but she would be death and for her it might as well be.

As his companion screamed in agony and disappeared inside the monstrosity the lights focused on her. A chorus of bubbling sounds resonated from the creature to form things resembling words.

""And there was one left…""

As all the red lights focused on her Clair had a revelation. She aimed her gun and…

""BANG!""

 There was a silent on the room as the creature keep wobbling, suddenly the toxic waste hit Clair’s leg and she fell on the ground as it started to dissolve. The blue toxic mass made sounds similar to laughter as started covering her.

""You missed…""

""Je…"" Containing her screams of pain the scarred woman managed to also laugh as felt her cells being poisoned by the radioactive waste. ""No I didn't...""

""…huh?""

The monster paused and its focus changed, the red lights all looked at one of them, expecting something to have happened to it.

                                                                             **BANG**

Suddenly a bullet pierced the nucleus that the creature had just looked at, breaking it into pieces. The monster screamed and trashed about as Clair kept laughing while her body continued melting.

""Ha! Made you look!""

The toxic blue waste screamed, trashing about in fear and fury as Clair managed to craw what was left of her out of it. Her legs were now useless and she was already feeling sick due to the radiation, but for the moment she was alive.

The creature screamed as one for one it’s fake nucleus started to lose its red light one after another until finally only one was left, focusing at her, desperately trashing about in pain.

The scarred woman pointed at it with his index and smiled at it with a painful smile.

""BANG!""

The red light looked at the woman imitate once again the sound of a pistol before going dark. It was over.",18
1l9lk3j,mxfgf10,"It seems my parents only had a limited pool of luck to pass on to their children. My youngest brother has all the luck. Sure, things don't always go great for him, but every roll of the dice seems to land in his favor. Lotteries and ""random"" drawings always go his way. He thinks it's a karma thing, but the reality is that my inhumanely bad luck balances out his wildly favorable luck.

There can be a dozen doors lined up. One unlabeled door is locked, the others are unlocked. I will invariably smash right into the locked one. I don't win lotteries, dice hate me, and even strangers are often shocked at how abysmal my luck can be.

On my morning walk one day I decided I had finally had enough. I purposefully passed under a ladder that was leaned up against my apartment building. My heart was pounding. It felt good in an exhilarating, defiant kind of way. I went past my door and to the other side of the parking lot just to cross paths with my neighbor's black cat.

""You like this?"" I yelled at Lady Luck, storming through the living room into the bathroom to shatter the mirror with a hammer.

I went on a bad luck rampage, doing everything I could imagine that might invite more bad luck.

Huffing and sweating in a pile of spilled salt and shattered mirrors, I looked down at my hand. A large gash was burning in my palm, blood pouring out and running down my fingers. I cried out in pain and ran to the kitchen sink to rinse the salt out of the wound. I blotted at the injury with the kitchen towel, and it was dark and heavy with blood by the time I admitted to myself that I needed stitches.

""Great,"" I muttered to myself.

Driving to the nearby emergency clinic with one good hand wasn't easy, but it was made harder by my distracted mind. I pondered the many years of bad luck I'd already endured. A bad marriage, layoffs, and fluke accidents. I would have cut my hand without smashing mirrors. ""I hope you're having a good laugh,"" I said to Lady Luck.

A car honked at me as I pulled into the parking lot. I must not have seen them backing out. I sighed.

At the clinic a nurse gave me a tetanus shot and poured Satan's tears mixed with rubbing alcohol and battery acid into the wound. I yelled and scowled at the poor young man.

""Hold this gauze tightly against the wound until we can get you stitched up,"" he said, putting a wad in my palm.

I had just taken a seat in the waiting room when my name was called. A young lady holding a clipboard stood just inside the door leading back into the bowels of the clinic. As I approached I saw smile lines at the corners of her lips and eyes. She was closer to my age than I had thought. She grinned at me and nodded her head toward the hand where I pressed gauze tightly into the palm.

""Bad luck,"" she noted.

I shrugged. ""Par for the course.""

""Let's get you sewn up and on your way,"" she said, leading me to one of the many exam rooms.

I followed in a daze. She was gorgeous, and somehow I felt as though I already knew her. As she ushered me into the room I tried to catch a glimpse of her name badge. No luck. It was behind the veil of her glossy blonde ponytail, which flowed over her shoulder like a river of fine gold thread. My mouth hung slightly ajar as she pointed out the chair where I should sit.

She laughed and I forced myself to look away from her glowing smile and vibrant eyes, instead turning my attention to the injured hand.

""Do you cut yourself often, Brad?"" She said my first name with a familiarity that gave me goosebumps.

I chuckled nervously. ""No, and this is my first time getting stitches.""

""Well you've got nothing to worry about. I'm told my skill with the needle is unmatched."" She pulled a rolling table loaded with supplies over and sat across from me on a stool.

Our eyes locked briefly before I looked down again.

""Go ahead and hold your hand out so I can take a look.""

I extended my hand and watched as she gently pulled the gauze away and rubbed down the surrounding skin with a fresh wipe. I looked back at where her name badge should be. She had pulled her hair back, but now the badge was hiding behind a fold in her white coat.

Her eyes met mine again and she smiled. ""You must not remember me,"" she laughed. ""We went to school together.""

I looked up at her face again and squinted. ""I thought you looked familiar,"" I said, ""but I couldn't place your face. What is your name?""

""Kelly,"" she said. ""I sat next to you in math class.."" She paused, then added, ""We also had chemistry together one year.""

Her cheeks reddened a little. A little bolt of lightning shot through my brain and into my heart.

I looked down and gasped. She was already sewing me up.

""Wow,"" I said. ""You really are good at this.""

She smiled and definitely blushed. ""Thank you. It's not every day I get to help an old..."" she hesitated. Her eyes darted up to my face then back down to the stitches. ""Well, I'm glad I got to see you again.""

""We should catch up sometime,"" I blurted. Immediately I felt stupid. She was at work. We hadn't spoken in over a decade. I barely remembered her from school. And everyone knew 'we should catch up sometime' was dismissive and polite but not serious.

She was quiet for an eternity while I regretted ever opening my stupid mouth. She took in a sharp breath, opened her mouth, then closed it again. Finally, she pulled the last stitch through, tied a knot in it, trimmed the loose ends, and took my hand in hers to examine her work. Her fingers were soft and gentle on my hot, throbbing hand.

Then she looked up at me and smiled. ""It would be unprofessional to give you my number while I'm working,"" she said, and her countenance fell.

My heart sank and a pang of embarrassment made my skin crawl. ""Yeah,"" I began. ""Sorry, I probably...""

""But,"" she said quickly, ""My shift is over at six tonight. If you meet me here I'd love to get dinner with you."" She smiled through a look of terror.

I gasped. The moment froze in time. She was more nervous than I was. Her fingers were clammy and trembling. Her eyes darted around my face, searching for a reaction. Just when I thought she might pull her hands away from mine, I cupped one of her hands with my good hand and pressed her cool fingers into the back of my injured hand. The trembling stopped.

""That would be really nice."" I was almost too breathless to speak. I struggled to my feet. She got up with me, pushing the rolling table to the side with her thigh. She was still holding my hand. ""I'll see you at six,"" I said, smiling.

""Yeah,"" she sighed. Her grin was enchanting. I stared at her face, wondering why I hadn't noticed her in school all those years ago. ""See you at six,"" she repeated.

I hesitated, laughing internally at myself. Then I looked past her at the door. ""So, do I pay out at the front counter?""

She blinked and looked around as though seeing the room for the first time. ""Oh, right, yeah."" She looked down at our hands and chuckled nervously. ""I should probably let you go."" She pulled her hands back quickly.

I laughed. There was so much I wanted to say at that moment, but my flustered mind could only look down at the stitches and say, ""great job, thanks.""

""Any time,"" she said wistfully.

""See you later,"" I said, moving toward the door.

She smiled and made a little waving gesture, sliding her other hand's fingers behind her ear as though tucking an invisible strand of hair back. Her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail. I grinned.

As I turned the corner she called out, ""It was lucky running into you today!""",6
1l9k2f3,mxdis4f,"My last memory was of fire. The last battle was lost, and all the world was consumed. My brothers and sisters fell, one by one, standing firm against the insatiable hunger. The screams of all life tore at my soul as the Dark Gods laughed.

It was long before I was able to crawl out of shadow. Like a beast, nameless and witless, my mind strayed far from the realm of thought or memory. All the while, my body fought its way free from the snare of evil. Even now, with my wits returned, I cannot truly say what transpired.

The prophecies had spoken of the world's rebirth, had sung of creation returned to how it was in the youth of the Elder Days. Even so, when I awoke in a clearing of grass, surrounded by the rustle of trees and the twitter of birds, I at first brought only confusion. Quickly, this gave way to weeping. In death, victory. In pain, renewal. In sacrifice, new life. Perhaps I was alone of all the old world. But our loss had brought freedom and peace.

I wandered far, across hill and river, until I found people again. A small village, tucked between a forest and a lake. They fished and hunted, and their children played between the houses of wood. They treated me with all the rightful suspicion. I was a stranger to them. They had their own heroes, their own legends. My world was not theirs.

They were kind people, once I had gained their trust. I went to work wherever they needed me, taking a heavy load to distract myself. Often the memory of war and pain would burn brightly within, the loss of brothers and sisters moving me to tears in quiet and loud moments alike.

Sometimes I would become hearty at the feast. Sometimes I would dance with a stamina that outstripped even their most spry. Sometimes I would tell the children tales of valiant deeds from my world. They would sit with eyes wide, listening to stories they could scarcely comprehend. Though I would never truly be one of these people, these moments brought me as close to them as I could ever be.

One day, as I was felling a tree alone, there was a rustle behind. I turned to see a badger emerge from the foliage. It reared to its hind paws, and then bowed low.

""Hail, Phoenix Warden,"" it said in a voice born from the ground. ""We are gladdened to know that some of you have survived the cataclysm.""

""You know me?""

""Indeed. Mankind forgets, the world moves on, but the birds, the beasts, the tree spirits, we remember well. The sacrifice of your kind and kin will always be treasured, for the life it bought for many.""

""Thank you, noble creature.""

""It is you who are noble, Warden. This village is in good hands, with you to protect and to serve it. It may be a far cry from your ancient duties, but many will sleep sounder at night because of you.""",7
1l9gea2,mxda0ms,"Retired Darkness (The Burden of Feeling)

I saw him again, months after I accidentally broke the seal that let him into our world again.
The dark lord, Anikatos, sat beside me on the roof.

Anikatos did not speak. He didn’t need to. He just sat, legs dangling, watching the same indifferent sky I watched, as if the clouds themselves were ashamed of what they had drifted above.

He turned to me, smiling—not cruelly, but with the knowing weariness of someone who’d read the final chapter before the book even began.

> “And I thought I was needed to ruin humanity,” he said.

There was no venom in it. Only fatigue. He hadn’t come to kill. He’d come to observe the corpse twitch.

I looked at him, really looked. There was still something human in his eyes—beneath the shadow and the fire, beneath the weight of rage and centuries. A question, maybe. A hope long since dismembered and buried in some grave he could no longer find.

> “I want to change this,” I said.

The words felt absurd in the air—soft, naïve, a whisper trying to rearrange a hurricane. But I meant them.

I didn’t have power. I didn’t even have people. All I had was the aching belief that there must still be something salvageable inside us.

I noticed that the main thing required to change this world was how humans began to view the world. Their traumas rewriting their reality, distorting beliefs. 

So I began with the smallest thing I could: listening and trying to nudge some in a better path. 
Little did I know how much of a toll it took on me.

---

At first, I thought if I could understand the people around me—really understand them—I could help them return to themselves. I started noticing the tremble in their voices, the flickers in their eyes when they spoke of things that mattered. I tried to mirror back their thoughts without distortion. To become a quiet receiver, faithful and clear.

But it’s never that simple.

How do you speak your pain bravely?

How do you share your internal chaos as it is?

Even when they tried to explain what they felt, I saw their expressions stiffen—not out of judgment, but confusion. Perception, after all, is a prism. Every word they said refracted through their histories, biases, traumas. What I received was never what they gave. And what I gave in return… often felt incomplete.

I began to carry the awareness of not just their loneliness, but the understanding of how I misunderstood it. That made it heavier.

---
How can I help people? Especially the ones who don't help themselves? 

The exhaustion was unexplainable. 

I labored over every word, every expression, trying to ensure I caused no harm, gave no false signal, missed no subtext. I listened as though people were sonatas—layered, delicate, never quite played the same way twice.

I still hardly could help. Maybe slight pushes was all I ever did. How can I do better?

There was a slow, creeping erosion of hope. A silent question blooming in the back of my mind:

> “Will I ever find someone who listens the way I do? Who sees without assuming? Who understands without owning?”

And I block that thought. 

I seem to be simply tired of trying to be the bridge between people who had forgotten how to build. 

And suddenly, I got up, staring at Anikatos, 
""I don't know how, but I feel I cannot afford to get tired, I cannot afford to stop now. I need to gather all my energy and continue in my cause.""

Anikatos, silently raising his eyebrows, eyes dilated, and talking to himself
*There was one person who I knew, who had that same drive that I see in your eyes. 
He was one human that I respected, one human that I was destined to stop, as he was too naive. 
His name.... *

And he slowly breathes the name out, 
""Kronos...""

As I was busy walking around in extreme thought, I could hear this,
""Ayye Anikatos! How do you know my name?!""",16
1l8vdy5,mx7uhbu,"""Drink it.
It will save you."" the note read.
I shivered.
I looked around, and I could see no one, well...
Why would there be?
I am in a cage, soon to be sacrificed.
What do I have to lose?
I drink the potion, and suddenly I feel sleepy.
I allow sleep take me, maybe it will be better.


I awoke, breathless, not knowing where I am.
""Calm down.
Deep breaths."" a voice said.
I for some reason, do as told, and I soon manage to calm myself.
I look around and...
I AM HALF IN THE GROUND?
i crawl completely out, and look around.
I see a dress and some shoes...then I realize...
I was naked.
""What happened?"" I asked, dressing up, even though nobody was around.


""The potion I gave you faked your death.
Your village buried you, thinking it was a sign from the spirits that you are not fit as a sacrifice.
They caught a bear, and several boars to sacrifice."" the voice soon answered.
I sighed.
""Who are you?
Why are you hiding?"" I asked.
""Not human."" it said, and that answered both questions.
Oddly enough I wasn't terrified.
""Why did you help?"" I asked.
The voice fell silent.


""Hello?"" I asked.
""Sorry...
My reasons are a bit selfish.
I am one of the beings your ancestors see as ""spirits"" ."" it said.
I froze.
""Have you ever?"" I asked.
No answer was an answer this time.
""I see. Thank you for the help...
Where am I?"" I asked.
""In the Violet Woods behind your village.
Head East for a few days and you will find a town.
You won't be the first young woman there...they are quite a few of you I sent there.
Though you might have to marry fast, to be safe."" it said.
I nodded.
That was expected.
""Thank you again."" I said, leaving.
In a few days I arrived at the town with no hiccups, clearly the voice watched over me.
I felt conflicted, but didn't have much time to think about it as I was approached by the guards.
New life...here I come.",171
1l8vdy5,mx9qngh,"The waiting was the worst part, for those both within the village, and for those trapped just outside of it. A dozen steel cages lined the outskirts of the Village of Eir, the home to thousands of Eirans, who had experienced years of solemn peace as the rest of the continent descended into chaos. The Elders had said their village was chosen, that it was destined by the Gods to rise from the destruction that would take the rest of the world, burying them under avalanches and tsunamis, entire cities collapsed under the weight of war.

In each of the cages, a man or woman sat on their knees. Their ankles were shackled, chained to the steel in case any of them had the heretical idea of leaving. But no one would leave. It was ingrained in them since their birth that sacrifices were to be made. Many hoped they would not have to sacrifice their lives. But hope was not what bound them together. It was the Offerings, the thing they were now to be a part of.

Alyra knelt motionless in her own cage. Locked and tucked just at the start of the treeline, a mile from the wall of Eir. Her cage was the worst of them all, hidden in complete darkness, the forest echoed around her. At every chirp, every swoosh of a tree branch, Alyra's ears beckoned - aching to find the source in a forest of shadows.

She had been chosen a week ago. Along with eleven others. They were drawn, taken to the Hall of the Chosen, pampered and fed, bathed and clothed, had every need and desire met for a week straight. Until they were bound, hooded, and forced to trek the mile to their cages without a sense of who was with them in the end - of those who would see them for the last time.

Alyra found no solace in the dark. She despised it. The village was bright and beautiful and the week in the Hall was the greatest she had ever lived. *Of course it was*. She thought to herself as bones of the forest groaned and creaked. *It had to be. Or else why would anyone go through with this?*

She had to think. As much as she could. She had to distract herself from the forest in front of her, the one that held the barrier between Eir and the rest of the continent. Though part of her wished to see it. The continent that was both burning and drowning. *What kind of people laid beyond the forest? What kind of bright and beauty did they have in their final moments?*

Alyra snapped her head as a branch cracked to her left. Her eyes stared endlessly into the dark. She had been here for a few hours already, and though her eyes adjusted, she could only make out shapes. Those of trees and bushes and—

A flash. A shadow. Something moved beyond the edge of the trees.

Alyra took a deep breath. *This was it. This was the monster we held at bay.*

The stories the elders told the children were simple. Eir was chosen, yes, but that came at a price. Dark creatures and monsters roamed their world, and so it was that these monsters needed to be appeased. Twelve, they said, held the perimeter of Eir, and while warriors had tried to slay the beasts, none had ever returned. Seemingly appeased by the offering of those fine warriors, the Elders began the Ritual of the Chosen.

And a few generations later, Alyra found herself to *be* one of those Chosen. Ready, willing, and able to die for the greater good.

She closed her eyes and focused on the sound of her own breathing. She did not wish to see the monsters. She did not have that much courage to face her demise with her eyes open.

1l8vdy5,mxabhej,"I knew this day would come. I always knew it would come, ever since my birth I knew I would end up as a mountain bride. A women of high birth no older than 20 years old is sacrificed to the mountain god for another year of fertile land, and fertile women. Now, I'm trapped here the last noble woman under 20 in my family left. Come tomorrow the moment the sun clips the horizon this cage will be taken from this cave and lowered deep into the lake bellow the mountains that leads to a supposed hidden kingdom. I never bought that story yet it was drilled into me as long as I can remember. After several days of trying to force myself out of this steel cage here I sit holding my throbbing fingers rubbed raw from trying to claw myself out of this cage. 

""Oh there has got to be a better way to do this, or do I just give up already."" I mumble under my breath frustration lacing ever word. The cave the cage has been sat in is only lit by a single candle by the far entrance and the moonlight itself. Then it happens, something scaled reaches deep into my cage. It's almost a hand shape but it's scaled like a snake  with  long fingers  slithering trying to reach out for me.

""HOLY SHIT"" I screamed. I back deep into the furtherest corner of this cage. The walls seem to be closer together than I remember just a moment ago. As I watch the strange hand it suddenly stops and drops a small vial before retreating quicker than it came, but still far too slow for my liking.  I slowly began walking towards that edge of the cage a small eye seems to be looked at me from deep within the cave itself. 

As I grasp the small vial and with that the creature flees even further into the caves system until their existence can only be proven by this small vial itself. I exam it in the moonlight the color is a smooth golden color with what appears to be some kind go flakes the color of deep mine copper. The lid pops off with a small ""pop"" noise barely audible to me let alone whatever guard is posted 30 feet away. A quick smell and nothing seems too wrong with it, a hint of rose and a large smell of sulfur, then it dawns on me. This could be my way out, it also could kill me. I don't know what this liquid is, but what if it gets me out. It must be a LIVE sacrifice the village leader always said so. 

PART 2 IN COMMENT BELLOW (won't let me post the full thing hoping this works though!)",19
1l8vdy5,mxc3n0b,"I went willingly to the cage. The decision to be sacrificed was mine.  
It was, in essence, my vow of absolute fealty. Pledging my body and life to Teocihuiliztli and accepting their judgement, even if it meant being enslaved or eaten.  
&nbsp;  
I didn't see who came to visit my cage in the night; I was securely bound and blindfolded, my freedom willingly surrendered.
But I heard the rustling of parchment, the quiet clink of a bottle on the ground. A written prayer and an offering for Teocihuiliztli, most likely, by someone too shy to face our patron. They can be imposing.  
I heard my guard chuckle a little. I wonder why?  
&nbsp;  
The morning crowed, and I felt scaly hands picking me up, putting me on some kind of platter.  
I felt the warmth of the sun and the faint chill of the wind, heard the cheering of crowds as I was carried to my destination, to what must have been Teocihuiliztli's altar.  
As we went, I wondered; would I be freed, blessed to live a virtuous life? Would I become a slave, serving our patron's needs? Would I be food? Likely not the latter, for all the rumors the only sacrifice known to be eaten was an elderly widow.  
&nbsp;  
All too suddenly, the faint jostling of movement stopped. The crowd quietened, a priest announcing my presence.  
And then, my blindfold was removed. I looked upon Teocihuiliztli, the feathered serpent, the guardian of our people. And they were looking down at me.  
I could see the approval in their eyes, but also their contemplation. Weighing my soul, judging my fate.  
I watched as they turned their head towards what had come with me, the parchment levitating and unrolling in front of their eyes as they read whatever prayer(?) was within. I watched as that same force uncorked the bottle and Teocihuiliztli flicked their tongue, tasting the scent of whatever was inside.  
&nbsp;  
""...Tomato relish. Very funny."" The great feathered serpent declared.  
So much for gravitas.",9
1l8vdy5,mxd8ddr,"Pitter. Patter.

Between the slow, rhythmic dripping of condensation upon the frigid steel cage, and the thin hazy fog that floods the room, Euripedes feels himself slowly fall into a feverish daze. Yet, such a trance fell far from sleep, partly from the incessant drumming of impending doom, and partly from the adrenaline. 

He had occupied himself previously with counting, but he quickly lost count. Then it was attempting to trade cracks in the stone on the ground, but the trail was quickly lost to the darkness. 

He imagined the spirits surrounding him, echoes of dead family, eidolons of friends. The image of them levitating just centimetres off the cold stone floor as they formed a circle around him, alleviated some fear of death. 

Glory was to be had for the one dying. The provident sacrifice to bring joy to the world, and to bring forth the next downpour of rain. To die so that others may feast on plentiful harvests. His life ; insignificant in the face of so many lives. 

The cage, although disconcerting, was no more harsh than his homestead. The darkness, although a cloak for the faces that lurk behind, not more unfriendly than one that plagues moonless nights. 

Drip, drop. 

Oh to have enjoyed the steaming golden baths of Aeryi, or the immensely succulent fruits among the roasted pork of the king's feast. To have daydreamed underneath the shade of a waving leaf of palm, or betwixt the poetry and olive oil. 

All that… shattered in a moment. Perhaps there was never a feast nor poetry, or perhaps the leaf of palm is to be wilted prior to fanning.

Perhaps never was the idyllic sacrifice a glorious one. 

The illusory divinity of his god flashed before his eyes. The gesture of holy blessing as his god’s messenger demanded that the sacrifice be provided. The recoil of his village as he, the eldest of his family, steps forward in blooming glee.

1l8vdy5,mx9qpeb,"At the sound of another break of wood, she flinched. It was coming. A footstep. Then another. Then silence.

Her mind raced with the last twenty years of her life. It was a decent one, though even she could not admit it was good. Not in comparison to the decadence of the last week. In her heart, she wished for more.

*Clang.*

It was there now. Whatever it was, for Alyra still kept her eyes shut, but she listened. The echoes of the forest were replaced with breathing, not of her own, but of whatever stood in front of her.

Deep, guttural breaths. They were long and hoarse, and it sounded as if the creature strained to breathe. She slowed her own breathing in response. *I am ready.*

And then she felt it. A skeletal hand on her own.

Her eyes shot open, not purposefully, but out of fear. They only caught a glimpse, a creature no larger than her darting off into the shadows. The faint moonlight glistened off their back, as she realized that they shone – if briefly – in the dark. They were gone a moment later.

Her eyes flashed around. *What is happening? Why would it not take me?*

Below her, she spotted it. A vial, and a handwritten note. Alyra took a deep breath, her hand shook as she reached for it.

**The truth is not what you think.** The ink was barely dry; it fell all around the edges of the words. **They are lying. Drink. Come and see. Drink.** **The Chosen are not dead.**

**Survive. Drink.**

**The Chosen live. So can you.**

**Come and see. Drink.**

She dropped the note. Minutes passed. Thoughts overcrowded her mind until there was silence there as well. Alyra was in the dark of the forest, which she had noticed, even that had grown to a strange silence. The animals stopped chirping. The trees stopped swaying. Even the wind had stopped blowing.

Alyra had no idea how long it had been, but eventually, she wrapped her still shaking hand around the vial. Inside was a dark liquid, occasionally broken by a white streak that lit up and disappeared a moment later. It flashed at her, and as she stared, the liquid itself beckoned her to drink.

Alyra had some courage, yes. She did not fight when she was called, she willingly fell into the system. But it was here that she faced her greatest test.

Wait and most definitely die, by monsters or the Eirans themselves.

Or drink. Drink and face whatever came next.

Alyra took one final look around her, turned back to see the flames of Eir – bright and beautiful as the celebrations began. Then she turned to the vial once more. She mustered every ounce of courage she had left, that wasn't taken by the last week of decadence.

In one motion, she took the cork off the bottle, and drank it one, single swig.

A moment went by. Nothing happened. Then a minute.

Then she felt it. Burning inside of her, the liquid flashed and burned and cooled and dug into her being. She watched as the skin on her began to change. Once pale, human skin, began to shift into something bright and glittering and shining.

Then the cage door opened, and her eyes met the monsters.

Less painless at the very least.  That's when I decide, whatever this is, I'm going to drink it. I bring the vail up to my lips and force it through past my better judgement. The taste is metallic and sweet all at once. I feel it push down my throat warm and smooth.

""What did I just do?"" I mutter to myself. The instant doubt of my actions reaching me moments to late to change the path I have set myself on. It hits slowly my head begins to lighten my breathing feels slow, suddenly the cage I'm in is out of my view and all I can see is the glimmer of the moonlight upon the copper ore above the cage slowly turning from a rich red orange color to a cool teal green. Then, there is nothing for a long, long time.

Suddenly everything is happening at once I feel myself moving, fast, faster than I ever thought possible before the cool wind brushing my face leaving red marks on my cheeks. The I'm being put down on something soft, definitely not in a cage anymore. My sight is either gone or I am in a place where light itself no longer reaches. It smells damp everywhere around me but my surroundings aren't wet.

""Okay, whatever the hell just saved me, Thank you first of all!"" I say trying to sound much less terrified than I truly am at the moment. ""Are we in the dark or,"" I don't have the power to push the rest of the words out. Suddenly I feel a hand, definitely human, thank the gods. It hands my a cup I take it slowly pulling it close to myself trying to make myself as small as possible. I bring the cup to my nose and smell it. Water. Thank the gods I am so thirsty, whoever this person is they can kill me after I get a drink. I think that's fair. 

Quickly I smell smoke then a I see it a small candle lit. I'm not blind, that's always a good thing! I take a moment my eyes adjusting to the sudden dim lighting. In front of me I see the silhouette of a woman. My gaurd lowers, at least that part of my dignity is spared for the moment being. Then I look up and see her face, she's the woman from last year. All around me I see woman ranging from there upper 60s to lower 20s all around me.

As the water impacts gently against the frame, a streak of effulgence streams through the door. It has been a long while since the gentle caress of sunlight, and even for the possibility of a pretentious torchlight, he can’t help but grin a little. 



The door closes, the piercing stream of light trickles to a stop. 



In the total darkness, a set of light footsteps approaches him. The rhyme and rhythm of the steps are a counterpoint to the dripping sound of water, almost as if they had sparked a debate. Their music intertwined into a cacophony of echoes through the room.

Their steps stop just before the bars of the cage. Accompanied by a shuffle of burlap, a jingle of copper keys and chain, was a flutter of parchment and a clink of a glass. 



He felt around the space within the cage, finally grasping the bottle and letter. With what little precious ambient light, among the grey mist, was the shadow of a retreating, calloused hand. 



“Who art thou, the walker among phantoms?” He asked, his voice untrained and gravelly. 



As swiftly as the messenger had arrived, he leaves. 



Following the lifeline of dark ink on darker paper, the words; 



“Venomous courage, or excruciating cowardice. Thou hands never had the grasp of choice, let this be thine method thus. Spin thine illusion into the hammer that shatters the false messenger’s mirage, let it be the revelation that signifies their reckoning.” 



The cork slipped easily from the glass bottle. The volatile odour of almonds bore through the still air. 

This is a cause as real as any. To die for the world, for the next downpour of rain. 



To die, so no one else must.",6
1l8vdy5,mxcxp4y,"Sacrificing means the mayor will chain me to a wall near the cave and run away as fast as he can. The next morning someone needs to retrieve the remains and bring them to the village for a burial ceremony. For the last two years, that ""someone"" has been me. So, I’ve seen the demon twice and now, surprisingly, I’m his friend. How else can I describe his loneliness?

The potion stays in the cage – I don’t want to change my fate. The mayor is sad and pale. As always. The chains are cold and rusty – they will be replaced in a couple of years. “See you” – I say to the mayor's back. He did not respond. I’m waiting for the demon for a couple of minutes – it's loud and angry.  
  
“Why didn’t you leave? They mean nothing!!!” – Well, it’s hard to respond after a sonic blast like that.

“They mean nothing to you and everything to me. I know you don’t need to eat anyone just to keep us here.”

“I’m a demon and I need to grow in strength.” – He looks sad but still serious. – “No, my friend, you will not die today. You want to live here? You’ll live - again”. He placed his hand on my face and squeezed. Pain surged through my whole body — and in the next moment, I saw my grandmother’s face as she lifted me into her arms.

Hello, world. Of course, I start to cry – muscles don’t work yet, I’m too small — and far too smart — to try anything reckless. Attempt number 67. I hope that in this run, I’ll have more time. Maybe this time, I can change him.

As everyone raised their cups of wine high in the air, the witch was scurrying around, asking questions and making small talk with anyone who would hear her. None of them would last long. I didn't know if she could read the room, but it was clear she was only invited because of her nobility. Yet, she engaged with everyone, as aggressive as the last.



Some downright ignored her, but the sly smile on her face didn't fade. 



Her entire attire made her stand out. Her dark purple gown, bold eyelashes, void lipstick, and a pointy hat towering even the king's crown… so extra.



It was almost alluring.



That was until her gaze met mine. I tried to quickly look away, but she practically leaped across the room at that second.



She was now standing before me, hands behind her back as she scanned me like a curious animal. 



""Uhm… Is there something wrong—""



""Are you married?"" The lady interrupted, and I sighed.



It's not like I had anything better to do, so I went along with her games.



""No.""



She raised a brow. ""Have you ever been married?""



""No.""



She cocked her head in concern, ""A relationship, perhaps?""



""I have never been in any sort.""



""Really?"" She zoomed closer, almost sniffing my face. ""Your looks aren't half bad. I was sure you had a lady waiting back home.""



""I'm flattered, but I'm afraid I don't."" I then paused, slightly curving my lips. ""So, are you going to do your thing?"" I asked, and she grew curious. ""Matchmaking. I heard you were renowned for it.""



""Ah. That."" The witch flanked to my side, standing beside me as she took her hat into her hands. ""I don't do that anymore.""



""Why?""



""I suck at it."" 



Those words hit my head like a brick. 



""What? You didn't think I was self-aware of the fact that all thirteen of my attempts ended in both parties breaking up within a day or two?""



""N-No. It's just, I'm curious."" I said. ""What were the matchmakings like?""



The witch frowned but spoke, ""My first client was a tribal chief. He said he liked warrior women who were taller than him.""



I leaned my ear closer.



""…so I matched him up with a female orc.""



Those words hit me harder than the bricks before.



""D-Don't laugh!"" The witch blushed. ""He didn't specify it had to be a human!""



I let out a soft wheeze. ""And then the next?""



She cleared her throat. ""It was a princess, actually. She was tired of the dragons trying to kidnap her again and again, so she wished to meet someone strong enough to protect her.""



I leaned in again, hesitantly.



""… so I matched her up with the dragon instead.""



I almost fell to the floor this time.



""Listen! In my head, I thought if the dragon and princess got together, then every kidnapping attempt would be… a date instead... Plus, a dragon is pretty strong.""



""Just to be sure, my lady."" I steadied myself. ""Have you ever yourself been in a relationship?""



The witch looked at me surprised, then back at the ceremony before her. ""Even though I have royal blood, I'm still a witch—someone who practices taboo magic."" She said, raising her hands to show me the tips of her fingers painted black. ""People like us don't really have a good reputation, you see.""



""Huh,"" I remarked, ""They sure are missing out.""



Stunned, the witch quickly turned to me with wide eyes as I tried to change the topic. ""I mean. Being in a relationship could help you become a better matchmaker. Missing out on such an opportunity would be detrimental!"" I exaggerated.



""You talk highly for someone who hasn't been in one."" The witch retorted.



""Well, I'm always open.""



We both watched as the trays and tables of food before us were replaced by instruments, the hall morphing into a ballroom.



""Can you dance?"" The witch asked, putting her hat back on.



""I'm afraid I'm currently on duty.""



""That doesn't answer my question.""

No my main job is to attend political events in his name. It’s not like he hasn’t thought me much but I get why he loathes these events and why he sends me. 

Anyway here I am at the royal wedding. Nursing a glass of whatever the fuck vintage the elven ambassador brought. As I drink a noble that I overhear “Don’t you dare speak with the witch queen” “She’s coming” “Oh yes” “Why shouldn’t I speak to her is she going to curse me or something?” “Worse she’s a match maker.”

My brain is already flooded with ideas. Sure I shouldn’t talk to her but she’s the witch queen. She knows magical knowledge that make the court mage look like he can only pull a bunny out of a hat. There is too much to gain and at worst she tries to give me a date what can go wrong. 

I walk up to her nervously to say she is an extravagant woman is to say the least. I muster up the courage to introduce myself. “Hi Ms Witch Queen” I say nervously. 

“Oh hi darling. I don’t think I know you. You aren’t a member of any noble house as far as I’m aware.” 

“I’m Markia the court mages apprentice I act as he’s stand in. During these events”  

She smirks “The old fool did always hate gatherings, Can’t stand more then 5 people in a room at a time.”

I tremble slightly as I ask “I know now really isn’t the time but would you have any magical knowledge you would be willing to teach me. Even something small your just one of the greatest mages alive and I had to ask.”

She giggles and says “On one hand it’s not exactly a proper time to ask but I can’t help but find the hunger for knowledge an admirable quality.” She ponders for a moment before saying. “I know let’s play a game. I ask you some questions and after we finish I give you a grimoire I brought with me. I already finished reading it’s on the way here and why not give to the next generation of mages.”

I nod to excited to say words.

“First question: where did your interest in the arcane start”

“When I saw a wandering mage preform magic in my town ever since knew it was my destiny.”

“Humble background interesting. Second Question: what do you consider the most impressive spell ever cast”

“The great whether change. One archmage stormcrown ended the drought by forcing summer to end early.”

“It’s an unpopular answer but it’s not a bad one. Third question are you attracted to woman.”

I suddenly short circuited I was not expecting this question. I nodded and the witch queen simply said.

“Excellent. Now what is your ideal partner.”

I mumble unprepared. “I guess I want someone that is passionate about what they love and would be sweet to me. Also I kind of want her to be taller then me” 

“Well between your answers and the fact I was reading your aura throughout the questionnaire I say you passed.”

“Pass.. PASSED. Passed what!?”

“After the wedding you will go on a date with my daughter she’s just your type. You’ll love her.” She drops to Grimoire on the table. “Don’t worry I’ll raven you the details”

Only pain. And death.

It's noonday. I've buried 10 today. 
Hopefully, there will be only another 10 by nightfall.
My healing skills are useless. I can't even dull the pain. Only the gods could heal this. And only the gods could curse us so.

The village, the tribe is dead. Killed by enemy unseen. 

I feel sick. I will soon be consumed by whatever ails us.

I envy the dead. 

Soon, I will join them.",27
1l8xxoi,mxa8kyg,"Rosh'ga was sure something went wrong. He was supposed to join the human army against the Dwarves. He was sure they must have mistaken him for an enemy, for why else would they torture him so?

This is the fifth meeting he has been sitting through. Today. Where is the battle? The glory? For the past 3 days Rosh'ga has done nothing but sitting in meetings where he was told the same things over and over again?

When Rosh'ga asked one of the humans when the battle would start. The human only faintly laughed. He was beginning to believe more and more that this was some kind of battle preparation. This might be why the humans have always done battle with such fervor?

Could it be that the human soldiers were not afraid of death, for their will to live has been shattered by those meetings? 

Rosh'ga knew, if he made it home, they will need to try this battle rite.",10
1l8xxoi,mxbfwge,"The Orc warrior watched the bizarre glowing box in front of him.

It showed some moving tiny people in them, he was tempted to destroy the box and move on in his conquest, but the story was intriguing, it might detail the strength of the Human scum. It showed the story of some teenage boy and his automaton, meeting some family.

It also showed some form of magic that the humans have yet to show in their war. Maybe he should show this to the Chieftain, he'd know what to do. But the child in the story also reminded him of his own child, little Groa'thia, someday she will be big and strong too.

But the events of the story haunted the Orc warrior and inflamed him with murderous rage and grief. For the last words spoken in that scene drove him to cleave the cursed box in twain.

Those last words, but a simple name spoken in broken pauses by a monster neither human nor beast.

1l95po4,mxay11i,"An awkward grimace. Kyle knew the princess wouldn't like that answer, but it was the simple and honest truth. He was just some guy who was sent to another world with nothing but the clothes on his back and his phone, which, magically, was still connected to the world back home. It had infinite battery, high speed wifi, and the damn thing was indestructible. Nothing short of a nuke could crack it, and even then...who knows. He could even still call his family! His boyfriend was kinda jealous of the alternate universe stuff, but after Jeremy caught a glimpse of the pictures of those insane monster carcasses Kyle sent, and after he realized that plumbing wasn't a thing here, he quickly got over it.

The gods granted him no special ability. Just his phone. He cursed them at first, til he realized what a boon it was. 

He was stuck in a classic fantasy universe with an unoriginal demon lord character and a demonic 'dark' race infringing upon the human lands. There were even cute elf girls that were completely age-inappropriate (or at least they looked that way) for him trying to hang onto his arms, and even the princess herself tried making a move on him. Obviously he had to reject them, he just didn't swing that way. And even if he did, he was a 25-year-old man and teen girls were just not his type. 

So, after he did a little reconnaissance (aka bugging the royal knights into telling him everything they knew about whatever Kyle considered important to ask), he realized that he needed to learn magic, and maybe try to figure out how to introduce the concept of sanitation to these guys. Seriously, only rich people had soap! There were soap artisans and everything, and soap was just too expensive to mass produce. 

So the first thing he did was pull up a how to guide on making soap at home. It turned out to be pretty simple. A few oils, water, and lye and he had some basic soap, nothing fancy. He even said that he refused to patent the recipe once he introduced it before the king (once he explained the concept of a patent, at least), just because he wanted to spread soap throughout the kingdom cheaply and efficiently. 

He still got a cut of the profits, of course. And it was also a bonus that cases of the nebulous, unoriginal 'plague' with vaguely tuberculosis-like symptoms went down by 30%. 

So, once he was done with that he figured that he needed to learn how to use magic. Turns out everyone here could. It was a matter of will and imagination as well as access to training, not biology or anything of the sort. Magical energy ran rampant throughout this world, and all he needed to do was tap into it. Most wizards used staffs or crystal balls, but Kyle? He said nah. He'd do it by hand. 

He used to read a lot of fanfic when he was younger (oh who was he kidding, he still did), and he pulled up a few of the really worldbuilding heavy ones and tried figuring out how wandless magic worked in Harry Potter fanon. 

He succeeded in casting the patronus charm after thirteen attempts. It was a dolphin, and it shimmered a beautiful silver as it soared through the air. He was pretty sure the patronus charm didn't exist here, but oh well. He used it to defend against a lot of dark creatures, and it worked, driving the darkness away. He also figured out a lot more spells. 

*Thank you, fanfic writers, for your many years of service,* he thought, smirking as he drove another legion of dementor-like creatures away with his trusty dolphin patronus. 

He also made a lot of use of the killing curse. Oops? Oh well, he didn't really care. You'd use it too if you had a giant flame monster coming at you. 

And then came the prophesied fight against the dark/demon lord or whatever it was people called him. 

""Ah, if it isn't the hero, Kyle the Courageous! At last we battle, at last the prophecy—"" 

Kyle tuned him out after a while. He was too busy being annoyed by this world's hobby of giving people stupid epithets. He wasn't exactly courageous. He mostly just rode around on his horse (that he only knew how to ride from a YouTube video) shooting killing curses at demonic foot soldiers. 

He snickered a little at seeing the demon lord's character design. Yikes, this was the guy? He'd seen scarier villains in kid cartoons. This guy looked like Skeletor with stupid big horns and a thick, dramatic black cloak with serrated edges and a shoulder guard for some reason as the only piece of armor. 

He didn't wait until the big bad guy finished his dramatic monologue. Instead, he fired a killing curse at him. 

And then after the body dropped, he set him on fire. The smell was awful, but a quick spell vented out the room. 

After a few minutes, all that was left of the demon lord who terrorised this world for so many years was ash.

He strolled out of the castle with his head held high wearing immaculate clothes. He didn't even look like he'd been in a fight. 

And that was it. He completed the prophecy or whatever and he'd only been in this world for maybe...three months? Oh boy. Hopefully he still had his job. 

Now here he was, before the king and queen and princess, and he had just rejected her hand in marriage while also making a fool of himself at the same time. 

Hopefully no one would cut off his head. 

""Hero Kyle,"" the king said right after he rejected the princess, ""surely we can reward your efforts in some way. Perhaps some land? A title? Gold?""

He perked out. ""That's fine. Er—sorry. Gold. Gold is good.""

He facepalmed internally. He wasn't very good at social interaction, that was better saved for his boyfriend, the biggest social butterfly he'd ever met. 

But gold would be nice. 

So, he got what he asked for. A spacious, magically-enlarged bag with a shit ton of gold, and a way back home. 

There were three balls, two parades, and a knighting ceremony before the king all in his honor before he could leave, though. So in the end, he only was able to return home a month after he defeated the demon lord. 

And all was well. He had a seriously awesome story to tell everyone. Talking to his family through facetime this whole time really wasn't enough.",7
1l94odn,mxb4b2r,"Our astronomy told us we were special. That our lonely star sat in the void, far from any other stellar body. The nights were beautiful, the galaxy from which our star was ejected painted across the sky. We had so many questions, questions we later learned every fledgling civilization asked. ""Are we alone?"" ""If we are not, what are the others like?"" ""Can they be trusted?""

We husbanded our resources, knowing that we would be stranded on our solitary star for a long time, perhaps for the entire lifespan of our species. Our science grew, we plumbed the depths of mathematics, finding so many beautiful truths like geodes deep beneath the dirt. Our minds were brightened, then enlightened with new ways of seeing reality and of understanding ourselves. Faster and faster, making discoveries and creations that would have defied the wildest ideas of dreamers from only a century ago.

Until, after thousands of years, we found a means of faster than light travel. Over two decades, we refined it, until at last we could step from our lonely star all the way to the galaxy that spat it out. We found it full of signals, things we could not detect at our far removed point in space, but which we would have easily intercepted and translated millennia ago were it not for our isolation.

They were delighted to learn we existed, and so began a cultural and technological exchange. To our great surprise, we had surpassed almost all of them. Our understanding of mathematics was deeper, our physical theories more rich and complete. We had achieved things which they had thought were conclusively proved impossible. So many of their open conjectures could be readily proved or refuted by our mathematicians. Our algorithms surpassed theirs in almost every way. Our seclusion had forced us to grow in ways none of the others had, content in their abundance.

We had sleep walked into superpower status. Various polities vied for our favor, and our own societies and cultures were inundated with alien creations. Alien art, alien stories, alien philosophy. We were utterly unprepared for all of it. In the chaos, a contingent within our civilization crystallized. Alien influences were not necessarily deleterious, but we had to retain at least part of what made our cultures unique. We would learn and grow from our interactions with others, but the lifeblood of what we were, what we had won in our long years of solitude, had to be kept alive.

And so, time passed. The foundations laid by our ancestors were preserved. We came to grips with galactic society, and adapted to being a superpower. We did not fight in wars, we did not engage in political conniving and intrigue. Instead of losing ourselves, the keystones of our society began to bleed into the others. From our island in the sky, a legacy was born that would ring to the end of time.",10
1l8zy5m,mx90nm5,"''WHY NOT?''  
The guardian flinched at the yelling. They were used to the pleading, the bargaining and even the occasional threats, but sincere confusion while YELLING about it was a new one. ''Like I said. These are the Gates of Judgement, they look into your soul. Everything you've done, it sees, then I get to see it and determine where you go.''  
''BUT I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'.''  
''We'll see about that.'' The guardian stated flatly. As they finished the sentence, they gestured with their staff at the gate. The eye adorning the central lock flinched wide eyed, shaking slightly as it looked left, then right, then with a violent motion finally locked onto the recent, belligerent, arrival. As it peered deep into his soul, it began to murmur.  
*What? It never speaks.* The guardian thought.  
As it peered deeper, drinking of the man's very essence, supping at his nature, its' whispered nothing-words grew louder until the guardian could barely make out what it was saying. The murmuring grew and grew, the words were not words but the guardian understood them nonetheless. Their meaning were lost on them, but words like *Assured, violent, berserk, kind* floated around in this morass of meaning. The murmur grew to its' crescendo, then it settled.  
Then the eye locked eyes with the guardian, staring as if mad. The eye shook violently as it shared its' understanding with the guardian, as if it would break out of the lock and beat them to death.  
*What had it seen?*  
Then the guardian saw, and wept in cruel understanding.  
*Of course...*   
''You beat a murderer to death, to save more lives''  
The unauthorized choice, to end life to save life. The choice *this* gate has yet to understand. Perhaps the others had more exper-  
''AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.''  
**STOP YELLING**  
''This is more complicated than my station authorizes me to handle.'' The guardian said as-a-matter-of-factly, ''But know that your deed has put you on the grey line between salvation and damnation. You words with my betters will determine your fate.''  
The man just stood, clearly obeying the guardian's command but wishing to spea-*... yell*  
  
With another gesture, the eye relaxed, returning to its' resting position as the gate unlocked and opened wide. ''You may pass. The path will unwind itself for you. The Highers will know what to do with you.''  
The man walked and the gate closed behind him. The guardian stared out at the surrounding void, the silent nothingness that so often comforted them. Now there was nothing of comfort.  
*Unauthorized, but not unwilling. Your path is set, mortal, but you might pass to the light.*  
*If the yelling ceases, at least...*",36
1l8x54n,mx8iiet,"A nighttime gig at a museum. Who'd have thought that I, the ultimate frat boy who only took trips to sports venues, would have ended up here.


I won't bore you with all of the details, but suffice it to say that some drunken misbehavior at a sorority mixer led to me groping a girl that would turn out to be a powerful witch in disguise. And that's how I ended up here.


As I walk to the basement statuary gallery, yet again, the grizzled old security guard walks behind me - one hand on his stun gun. We both know the drill, as I strip down and climb onto the empty plinth at the center of the room. Just as midnight strikes, I immediately start growing to a height of 10 feet and my skin hardens into black obsidian.


Soon, the public will start coming in to see the most popular exhibition in town: the most realistic and scary statue of a werewolf cast out of indestructible black rock.


This is not what I would have wanted, but at least I know this is not what the witch would have wanted either. I guess that's what she gets for not being able to spell and cursing me to become a trophy - lycantrophy.


I think she meant to say ""lycanthropy.""",48

""Well, this is the time we say goodbye to our journey. And, regrettably, this is where I must also say goodbye.""

Most knew this day was coming, but none expected it so soon, so close to home. Hands were shaken all round, and not a few tears were poorly concealed. One by one, they all cantered away, down the crest, quickly dwindling amid the grassy hills. Before long, it was me and him alone, standing in stiff silence. Our horses had their heads bowed, as if aware of the tension.

""Farewell.""

""That's it?"" I could hardly contain my fury.

He sighed. ""When did you figure it out?""

""Blackburn Bridge. The way you cut down the bandit. But, I'd had my suspicions before. You were too familiar.""

""Small world."" He gathered his reigns up and turned his back on the castle. ""You expected me to betray the group.""

""Are you really surprised? Not that your people have a good track record anyway.""

He grimaced. ""Ouch. Well, for what it's worth, I left that life a long time ago.""

""Not long enough.""

For a moment, the calm demeanor slipped. The sneer, the hard eyes, the tilt to his head, it all revealed the face of the Shadow Elf who had haunted my nightmares for twenty years. ""I've ridden alongside you for five months. Does that really count for nothing? Do you hold to the past and memory so tightly?""

""Memory is all I have left. You saw to that.""

He sighed and looked to the Wild. ""We're not likely to cross paths again. Really, now is your last chance.""

It took me a moment of introspection before I released my hand from the hilt of my father's sword. ""As you said: it's a small world.""

As we drew apart, my horse trotting forward, he spoke one last time. ""I wish you luck. And I hope you stay with the group. They're good people.""

I stopped. ""Thank you, at least, for the help you gave us.""

When I at last turned to look, he was gone.",35
1l8zd4t,mx9rx6s,"I watched in horror as the kraken moved around the Velvet Maiden. My captain, Johnsson, had fought with all his might through orders and steering this beauty of a ship but now he was doomed to drown or be slain by the kraken. Even now I heard desperation in his voice, it was hoarse from yelling but held the hope I’ve long lost. 

The mast which held up a large sail with patchwork from past tearing made a sickening crack as it broke in half. A salmon colored tentacle collided with the hull and water started flooding in. The Velvet Maiden was bound to sink in the sea and never be found. Rain poured from the sky above. 

Never had I thought that I would drown alongside my captain and friends I found in this crew. You may call it delusion to even think for a moment that I’d be given the gracious gift of dying on land. 

Just as the waves rise and the kraken looks ready to ambush I see Madam. My heart breaks at the sight of her sleeping by a pile of ropes. It’s where she he usually enjoys her afternoon naps after she has pestered Johnsson for cod. The tiny rascal would’ve been thrown overboard had it not been the captain himself who brought her onboard. It was either her orange fur or sharp claws that had Johnsson swooned, I would never know the answer. 

I watch as she stretches and yawns. It’s a miracle she hasn’t woken up earlier. Poor thing would end here. Her eyes open and looks around at the messy state the deck is in. Barrels of fish roll over while the rest of the crew yells and screams from horror. She doesn’t meow or run away from fear. I swear I could see her eyes sharpen as she paws her way up to the bow. Without any trouble from the constant wobbling of the deck she jumps up and stands at the edge of the ship. 

My worry for her almost overwrites my terror of the kraken but I cannot bring myself to stop her. I can only watch as she stares the beast down. The rain that usually bothers her doesn’t cause her to become a hissing mess. She looks out at the sea and I feel the ship almost calm down. 

The ringing in my ears lessen as my hands stop shaking. I close my eyes and prepare for my final moment. My mind convinces me this was the calm before the storm or maybe it’s already ended. My body swaying with the tide or buried far below the surface. 

I open my eyes to see the blue sky. Something is sitting in my lap- Madam? She starts purring and I force my nervs to calm so I can pet her. The soft fur under my hands sooth my worries. My friends are all passed out, laying around the deck. 

I continue to pet Madam. 

Only one person is standing. Captain Johnsson. His eyes land on me from where he stands by the helm. The madman dares to smile at me after all that!? My brows furrow. 

He winks at me. 

I decide that this is the reason why he gives the small creature in my lap the finest piece of all our fish.",25

1l8pixp,mx6kyso,"I am doing a great deed indeed...I think.  
A human got lost in the Forest of Echoes, and I found them.  
Now, I am guiding them inside.  
They look scared, so I guess they are hunted, no worries though, as I am a Great Shadow, and I can hide anything, even a human.  
Albeit...  
The Forest of Echoes isn't friendly to outsiders.  
Let's see how this goes.

  
""Avoid the Trees of Blood, please."" I say, as the human shrieks as a root almost catches them.  
Weird.  
Usually Trees of Blood are dormant when I go past them.  
Did I chose a wrong route?  
""Come.  
The Lake of Freshness is close, you will be able to rest there."" I said, guiding the human forward.  
I hope they will appreciate what I am doing for them.  
Albeit...the lake is supposed to heal spirits, but does it heal spirits for fleshly bodies as well?  
Oh well...we shall see.

  
They didn't die, but they screamed, and rolled in pain, and collapsed after drinking the water.  
It's not that bad.  
From afar, I can see fire.  
Someone is still chasing this human.

As I watch over their writhing body, I slap away a Ghost Wolf.  
I am saving them...  
Right?

  
I get the human to the Heart of the Forest, the Sage's Hut.  
It's a small cave, not an actual Hut, that supposedly, houses a true Sage eons ago.  
This Sage preached, and cried for the lost souls, and thus we gathered here.  
Spirits, ghosts, shadows, and all those who can't truly walk in the light.  
This cave saved us.  
""Go inside...I think you will be safe there."" I said.  
""Thank you."" the human muttered, as they limped towards the cave.  
I could hear the other humans getting closer.  
Then I heard my human's screams...  
That does happen to us as well, every now and then, but we are safe afterwards, I guess?

Better than being hunted, no?

""You noticed that the sewers are reinforced, and larger?"" I asked.

1l8g6er,mx53edc,"Ratman gave his best smile when the mayor handed him his Outstanding Citizen Award. Something, something, his management of public services have been excellent, bla bla bla, he kept the sewage pipes unclogged, and improved living standards there...whatever, he wasn't fully paying attention.

Listening to public servants is not a thing that villains do. Villains like Ratman steal things. Rule over squatters and beggars living in *his* sewers with an iron fist (and claw). He clashed with superheroes occasionally. Usually, he was sent scurrying back to his labyrinthian sewers where the heroes lost track of him.

Yet now, he was out in the open, squinting at the bright sun. Waving at citizens, standing alongside other recipients of this award. Even the superheroes were clapping.

Was this a trap? To lure him out in the open, far away from the darkness of his sewers? The cheering, the applause, they seemed authentic. One kid with a pen and his hat asked for his autograph when Ratman finally got off the stage and could start feeling a little less awkward.

The pen didn't have a poison quill or hidden mechanisms.

""I want to be just like you! They say you fix smelly sewers and make it liveable!""

Ratman signed and gave a thumbs down that he switched to a thumbs up hurriedly. Kid looked happy, as did his mom.

The next person to approach was Vanstrom the superhero, with his hand outstretched. Ratman flinched on instinct, having been on the receiving end of his electric shocks. After much hesitation, he gingerly placed his hand into Vanstrom's for a handshake. A friendly handshake.

""Hey, good job, Ratman,"" the superhero patted him on the shoulder. ""We've fought in the past whenever people disappeared into the sewers, but hey, you been doing good, yea? You unclogged the sewer pipes. Took out all that trash. Keeping the city sanitary and safe beneath the roads. Our water supplies are clean because of you.""

""Thank you?"" Ratman was still bewildered by this turn of events. Yet his mind was racing. What if he could continue his petty thefts while still appearing as this good guy who maintained the sewers voluntarily like a good citizen? Could he get away with it?

Of course, he would. He must. Because Ratman is a villain, and some shiny useless award won't change that.

The, far too well dressed man for the Sewer Town gave a nod, and continued, ""Of course sorry this was a surprise visit so you were very much unprepared.""

He took out some notes, and began pointing out charts, he had in the whiteboard they actually brought down with them, and went over the whole spill again.

""As your, Sewer Demense, has expanded we began noticing a large increase in the city's underground infrastructure quality. After sending some, ""braver souls"" to investigate we noticed several repairs, changes, and signs of frequent maintenance that the city had not signed off on.""

This part was true, I live in the sewers after all, and like most people, I maintain my home. Also when the possible side effect of not doing so means drowning in sewage you find a great deal of motivation to do so.

""So we put two and two together, and realized it was you doing so, and after some deliberation the city council and mayor came to a conclusion.""

He once again pointed at the papers he handed me earlier. Including the check with several zeroes at the end.

""That is a check for previous services rendered, and would like to discuss your continued services in doing so.""

Me.

Here, quick context, I was homeless, PTSD from the war, and of course being a larger and intimidating looking sort didn't go well for reintegrating into society. When I got exposed to those weird chemicals I developed superpowers, and formed a psuedo-cult following among the homeless.

I started using them, my military training, and powers to form my own syndicate, and basically took over the sewers and a great deal of abandoned areas.

""While, your history is complex, we would like to point out that the level, and sheer degree, of your maintenance has not only kept it going, but has also improved its efficiency in certain places.""

He also pointed out some other charts, and continued.

""Also, the condition of the homeless has also grown to a far more acceptable degree. The number of homeless deaths has dropped significantly since you took power, and they are staying in communities they formed away from higher traffic and tourist areas.""

I gave an agitated grunt at that last but, but let him continue.

""So we would like to negotiate an agreement. The base terms are payment for your continued maintenance, we will delay planned demolition of some of the abandoned buildings you have set up ship in indefinitely, and as long as you keep your less scrupulous actions down here_""

He waved a hand for emphasis.

""We will turn a blind eye to them.""

I shifted on my junk throne for my next reply.

""As for the Capes and other vigilantes?'

He adjusted his glasses before responding.

""There are a few we can keep off of you, but others, well, they are vigilantes after all, and we will leave them to your discretion.  Or, lack there of as long as the rule of keeping such, ""business"" down here is followed.""

I sat, chin in my hand, and pondered the offer.

""You realize this is some serious corrupt shit you are offering, Right..?""

""Maybe so.""

He adjusted his tie, and folded his notes.

""But, it has saved a great deal of taxpayer money, and also Infrastructure and Utility improvement was one of the Mayor's main campaigns promises.""",67
1l8g6er,mx59zbc,"\- ""Okay... maybe you didn't undestand the first time. So I'll start again.

I'm a villain. I live in the sewers. Look, I'm telling you - I am a **bad guy**. Like, no one you ever knew before. I literally eat people, not because I _need to_, but because _I want to_. Did you get that?

So... when the first ambassadors came, they wanted a deal. They still would hunt me, but only on paper. The deal was, they would give me intel of the people that were in the sewers, and I would agree to not attack some specific people they asked; they even said they would forgive me, in case I made a mistake.

In exchange, I would need to fully disappear the people they would send here. Undesirables. Criminals. People they didn't like. People against the government. People they didn't want in the city. Bonus points if I could torture them.

So I did the right thing - I ate the ambassadors. Then the next ones. Then the mayor.

Next step, I am receiving gifts, letters, offerings from people, if I would just eat only one politician more... and gosh damn it, it happened.

The president tripped, and fell into a manhole. He was still alive when I found him. I made sure to fix that for him... and then I heard a party.

They were cheering, sending me booze, food, the best clothes I have ever seen, because I freed them from the dictator. Then, these people were pushed, and I saw other people pushing who pushed them... it was a carnage.

I didn't even kill most of them, once down here they started to fight between themselves, with **my weapons**, my things...

Here's the thing, sir. I am a bad guy. I know that. But even I have limits. I can't... live here anymore. These people, these... citizens... they scare me. A lot. I still have nightmares where they are here, screaming, bones shatered trying to kill the next one, just because they disagree on who are the _undesirables_ and who deserve to live and die.

I know I am the bad guy. I know I am insane. I know I am _cruel_, even... but not on their level. I really, really, want to get out of here... send me to hell, kill me, exhile me, anything - I just want to never be seen again"".

The agent scratches his head, worried.

\- ""You see... our police now depends on you... because death penalty was unpopular, so we... like... started to throw the criminals into the sewers, and then...""

\- ""Please, no...""

\- ""Well... I can offer you a job? Law enforcenment? Ever wanted to be a cop?""",33
1l8g6er,mx5m23m,"I haven't been above ground for years, but we do get a picture of what's happening there. Aside from TV (the reception is terrible , but we do get cable and streaming)  and the internet, you also get an idea based on the influx into the sewers and the stories they tell... Some are criminals, stolen goods and drugs to be stashed, some merely desperate. 

I pick my fee, take my cut, and the most disorderly of the criminals tend to disappear. Mulch helps things grow , with a bit of artificial light. And because sewers are kind of damp to live in, we fixed them, and used the tunnelling equipment to create underground spaces to live and work in. There's a fee we charge people of course ...  And some of it can be payable in work and food  and some can be via contraband and goods trafficked in from above, some via enforcement. We've been expanding. 

Still it was a surprise when the city sent down folks to treat with me. I did have a couple of cut-outs, but the story got passed upward, and this I had to hear for myself. 

Things have gotten bad up there. It's not just laws/legality (legality above ground isn't the same as that below and vice versa), it's the chaos, and disruption. Things decay and are helped along. Some of it is intentional with multiple bad actors, but you'd be amazed how much of it is simply lack of competence . The outflow of people and goods from above has become very noticeable even to the dim folks in what passed for authority , and some of the folks leaving recently haven't even been that desperate..  Many of the newcomers have found a place with me quickly, as I recognize talent. Hey, what works, works. 

The offer from the city officials, as I said, is something I had to hear for myself. A 10 year dictatorship, with immunity for me or my viceroy, a free hand to put food, infrastructure/housing/transport etc on a better founding, a sizeable fee payable in instruments of my choosing.. and that was their opening offer. I asked about dealing with the existing leadership, the ones who had allowed thing to get this bad, and they didn't blink. ""A free hand"" they repeated, ""we've heard how you run things down here"" . I heard them out and though they pushed for an answer , merely told them I needed time to think it over. ...

Once they had gone, I pulled together some of my key guys (it's true I had built a rather large and efficient organization, but it's what was needed as we grew underground), to make plans. As I told them, I wasn't thinking of taking up the city's offer exactly, but we still had to make plans. Every one of us had to think bigger. It was time for me to come back up above ground, and some of my guys with me.

The world's a sewer",21

Sewers, by their nature, are an unwelcoming place. Dark, dank, and full of things best left to the imagination. So why did Ratty live down there? Simple. It was a large, open area with multiple escape routes, a lot of adaptability, and a natural deterrent in the form of its appalling smell. Even the top heroes hated dealing with Ratty, each one knowing it would take days to get the smell out of their clothes. And, as silly as that sounds, that tiny bit of disgust was enough to buy him a lot of time, with the heroes drawing straws over who should be the one to enter the sewers, giving him a chance to hide any evidence.

 

Today, Ratty sat in his crummy office chair, the one that had springs poking out of its brown leather cushion. While the springs had annoyed him when he first discovered them, he now didn’t mind their metallic point, using them to scratch his lower back whenever he felt a harsh itch coming along. Torn furniture was something you just had to adapt to in the sewers, especially since the rats loved biting into anything that looked like it might have a taste to it, and if Ratty had to choose, he would much rather have them biting his furniture, than his body.

 

The flickering of his monitors made it hard for him to read his gardening magazine, having to hold the magazine a little higher than he was comfortable with, blocking the heavy shine coming from the screens as they illuminated the dark building he sat in. He licked his forefinger and switched to the next page, letting out a small ooh, when he saw a stunning patch of roses. While he didn’t have a garden, not seeing any reason to maintain one in a villain hideout, he often dreamed about it. That dream justifying his decision to keep subscribing to the monthly Sunflower Sun lover’s magazine.

 

Just as he was about to let himself indulge in a few plant based fantasies, the screen flashed orange, detecting some movement near his central manhole. He lowered the magazine an inch, since an orange detection wasn’t uncommon. Sometimes it was council workers, other times it was punk teenagers wanting to throw a firecracker down a manhole for laughs. Both things weren’t worth him getting riled up about. So, he continued reading, only stopping when the screen flashed red, telling him that someone was making their way down into the sewers.

 

“I haven’t even done anything.” He groaned, setting the magazine down. For once, he was innocent. Well, innocent if you count activities from the last two months. He had killed a supervillains henchman three months ago, but recently he hadn’t done anything. He reviewed the footage, noticing two suited up men climbing down the manhole, both with faces so disgusted that it looked as if their lips and noses were going to tunnel back in through the skulls.  

“They don’t look very super.” Ratty commented. He knew superheroes, and those men weren’t super, nor heroes. They were government figures, some form of it, at least. Most likely on the lower end of the scale if they had to climb into the sewers. You didn’t see many mayors making the journey.
 
He considered fleeing. He had equipped his small home for maneuvering through the sewers, so it wouldn’t be hard for him to avoid detection. The tiny building sitting atop a flat metallic surface, one held by two strong robotic claws. If he entered a coordinate on his computer, the claws which were connected to the sewer’s walls would pull his base through the tunnels, moving it to his desired spot. This being the easiest way for him to avoid heroes, while also keeping his feet dry.
 
But the longer he stared at the men, the less inclined he felt to flee. They weren’t heroes, so they didn’t want a fight, which piqued his curiosity. He watched his camera, making them trudge through the dirty sewers before moving his base closer to them, enjoying the looks of disbelief on their faces as they saw the floating, tiny base hovering above them. A ladder dropped from the base, while Ratty laid down a plastic sheet over the floor of his home, not wanting them to dirty anything.
 
The men exchanged looks before the younger of the two climbed the ladder first, followed shortly by the older, much stockier fellow. When they arrived inside the base, Ratty got a better look at the pair.

1l8g6er,mx591b4,"I sat in my study it was the only place in my miles long sewer dungeon. I have basically converted the entire city sewers into my personal kingdom, and I have basically been going to war with the city above trying to add it to my kingdom. So explain to me why I have an ambassador from the overcity here not to beg for peace or reach a truce but to have me be the official minister of the city sewer system. 

“I can assure becoming an official contractor for the city for the purpose of maintaining the sewers is a good deal. You already do it just cash a paycheque once in a while and fix up problems effecting the city faster. I assure you we won’t interfere with your ecosystem here.”

“What kind of trick is this?”

“No tricks. The sewer system has long been plagued with problems and we have never managed to hold it unlike you. Your rule here has led to you maintaining the sewers in a way we never could.”

This intrigued me ruling the undercity in such an official capacity could help me work on my projects without do gooders annoying me. But it will hinder my plans to make the city bend the knee.

1l8g6er,mx5bawn,"I'd love to read more about this, of how he increasingly justifies his petty crime and balances it with unmistakably good acts while also completely confused with the shifting public opinion. I quite enjoy the conflict and nuance here. 

I'm imagining the gnashing of teeth from some prim and proper heros standing around watching the rat man petty criminal being given an award for actually accomplishing something meaningful and helpful to the population at large. 

Frankly, I've been running with this story in my head and going nuts. Ratman is actually a very bad / low grade villain, probably not very smart in general. But surprisingly adept at water management and earthworks. 

Some parts of the city are letting him get away with small heists and robberies as areas that he frequents gets upgraded with vastly improved sewerage and water tunnels and drainage to fit his over complicated and silly escape vehicles.

""Oh SuperBatMcHero man, no need to save us from Ratman.. he's harmless really. Last month he 'broke' into the school, stole a bunch of gym equipment but when we filled in his tunnel, we found he replaced all the lead pipes with new hardware and removed ancient corroded fittings. The lead levels in our school district have never been lower, and replacing gym equipment under insurance is way cheaper than a full infrastructure rebuild""",32

George was the younger of the two. A man in his mid twenties who held a confident swagger, despite having just wandered through a sewer. The youthful confidence even spreading to his haircut, which was a stylish brown bob that perched atop his skull. The older man, Adam, however, lacked any of that confidence. He was a man who had been beaten down by life, giving him deep circles beneath his eyes and a slight slouch to his appearance. While they both wore similar suits, it was easy to tell who took more care of their clothing, with George’s neatly ironed and washed, while Adam’s lacked any of that care.
 
“Hey, man. What’s up? I love how cool your place looks. Is that a nighty sky painting?” He said, with all the enthusiasm of a sleazy car salesman, trying to coax someone into buying a crappy 2003 Hyundai that would fall apart as soon as the contract was signed.
“Starry night.” Ratty corrected, gazing at the painting. He disliked people like George. People who believed they could be everybody’s friend. That positive can-do attitude that was almost insulting. It was as if they saw everyone as a sucker, that was just dying to be their pal. Ratty couldn’t have wanted anything less than to be the friend of someone with the personality of an excitable dog.

“Right, right.” George nodded. Before he could say anything else, Adam stepped in.
 
“Not a terrible place for a man who lives in the sewers. I’m Adam, and he’s George.” He said, tone formal, with no hint of warmth behind it. As if his mom had pushed him out of her body while reciting her tax returns.
 
“It isn’t bad,” Ratty agreed. If one had to describe the home, they would call it a cute home in a bad neighborhood. It had a kitchen, bedroom, tv, and even a recreation of a famous painting. The base itself was perfect, it was just the location that killed it.
 
Sensing that Ratty wouldn’t ask them why they were here, Adam continued. “We are here on behalf of the city’s waterways division.”
 
“Here to remove me?” Ratty snarled, having expected this day to come, eventually.
 
“No. George, you want to tell him why we’re here?”
 
“Yes, sir. Well, on behalf of the city’s waterways division, we are here to present you with a certificate for outstanding service to the community. It’s an honor, Mr. Volkina. I mean, Mr. Ratty? Wait, which is your birth name? Cause I said it’s Volkina, but Adam was like. It doesn’t matter, grumble, grumble-“
 
Adam and Ratty made eye contact, a brief middle aged man to man stare that silently said. Young people…. Ratty snatched the certificate before George could prattle on any longer. “Why would my mother call me Ratty? Nevermind. Yes, thank you. Is that all?”
 
“You’re not going to ask why we gave you that certificate?” Adam, a man who rarely asked questions, had expected this to be a lot harder than it was. That urging him to do the unthinkable and actually show a crumb of interest in the situation. 
 
“Not really? I kind of just want you gone. Is it a trap?” He asked, shaking the flimsily laminated paper, only for it to make a small, wibble wobble noise as it shook.
 
“A trap? No, not at all. We’re so proud of you, that’s why we had to give you the certificate. You’re doing so much for the community and everyone is super stoked to have you looking after things, so keep that close.” George smiled.
 
“So, it is a trap?” Ratty mumbled, assuming George had done the worst acting job in the history of acting.

“No. Since you’ve been down here, our city has never been cleaner. No busted pipes, no clogged systems and overall everything been running a lot smoother. That’s why the city has given you this certificate. It’s their way of thanking you for everything you’ve done. No traps, no tricks, and no tomfoolery.”
 
“You realize I’m maintaining it solely to keep my base functional. Clogged systems mess up my escape routes.”
 
“Whatever the reasoning. We still appreciate you keeping things sanitary. If you check the back of that certificate, you’ll see we even stapled a check to it.” Adam moved two of his fingers, making a flipping motion.
 
“Staple it?” George sheepishly scratched at his neck, and when Ratty flipped it over, he would find the check stuck inside the laminated certificate, with George laminating the two pieces of paper together.
 
Adam groaned, thinking about how he could solve his colleague’s mistake. “We’ll get someone to transfer the money into your account.”
 
Ratty read over the numbers on the check. $10’000, more than he had earned in the last three months. “Hey, will I get more of these if I keep maintaining things?”
 
“I can’t say for certain, since that’s above my payroll, but if I had to guess, I would say yes. Councils love saving money, and having you down here is a lot cheaper than sending our own men down to do the same work. If you leave, the cost of getting the resources to do what you’ve done would be at least six times that a month. Maybe more.”
 
“Hm. Ok, you may leave.”
 
“Right. Thanks for hosting us. What a lovely home.” George stepped forward. “Love the place, ever think about getting some plants in here? I know a guy who knows a guy, who knows a lot of flowers that don’t mind the darkness.” He stated, stepping onto the floor, leaving a dirty print as he left the plastic.
 
When Ratty grumbled, Adam hooked George’s collar beneath his fingers. “Sorry!” He said on his colleagues’ behalf. As the two left, the plastic scrunched beneath their feet, filling the room with the sound of twisted plastic until they left the home.
 
Ratty cleaned the mess before returning to his chair, squeaking when he sat on the spring. He rubbed his backside before perching himself on the edge of the chair, reading over the certificate. “Maybe I can cut back on my crime if they’re paying me? It’s a lot less work.” He mused.
