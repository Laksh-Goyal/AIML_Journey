1lgtwz8,myzcohn,"It felt wrong. The air was so dirty, it felt like I was breathing ash.

I glanced around the room, the shimmering golden light of my [Aegis] spell the only thing separating me from the stunned medical professionals on the other side. A quick silent-cast of [Thought Acceleration] brought the world to a standstill as I contemplated my return.

Four hundred and eleven years. I had lived in Rovira for longer than most, my player attributes easily carrying me to the peak of magical power decades faster than even my closest peers. I had mastered more than half of the known magical disciplines, even invented a few of my own. I founded a guild, guided an entire nation into a new era of peace and magical innovation, and I likely would have gone down as the single greatest mage in the last ten millennia.

But now I was back on Earth, and it hurt to breathe. A cast of [Purify] swelled in my chest for a moment, gentle green light bursting forth in a wave that roared forth from the room. In moments the air felt different, cleaner and more soothing. The doctors before me seemed stunned, a few rushed from the room to investigate what I had done. They needn't have bothered, my [Purify] likely covered half the city by now. Plenty of individuals would be coming to investigate the epicenter.

I moved my hands and adjusted my hospital gown as I began to stand, my passive regeneration already fighting back the atrophy in my body. Instead of worrying over that, my mind spread outwards, to the three rooms nearest my own. And I felt them there... my companions.

I lowered my [Aegis], and with a thought I was dressed in my guild regalia once more. ""Hello. My name is Otto, I am a level 997 [Prismatic Mana Sophont]. Thank you for the care you have shown my body whilst my soul was abroad.""

I offered a polite bow, before striding past the growing crowd. It was time to bring my friends home, we likely had quite the work ahead of us.",143,1750511722.0
1lgtwz8,myyyvg1,"Okay, that works, which is bad.  
I try several other magic, and they all work.  
I cast telepathy, and read the minds of the people going in and out of my room.  
Nobody knows a thing.  
They all think that I have been trapped in a VR game, when the helmet malfunctioned, and fried a part of my brain.  
It is a miracle in their eyes, that I woke up.  
But I know the reality of things...  
My soul has been yanked out of my body, and I lived a looong life in another world.  
I had a life, a family, everything was good there, and I want back.

  
""Son!"" my mother cries on my chest.  
I can finally sit up, my muscles starting to regain some strength.  
My mother...mom, has been working hard these 3 years, yes only 3 years passed in this world, to keep me alive.  
Many wanted to shut off the life support after a year, but not her.  
She knew I will be back.  
Maybe magic while not apparent, really exists here, and these ""motherly intuition"" and ""6th sense"" stuff, are actually dream magic, or divination?  
I can hear her thoughts, I can feel her happiness.  
How do I tell her I lived tens of thousands of years, and have a family that could build an entire country in our world...and that my feelings for this life are...almost non-existent?

  
""I know you have lived a life in the game, but you will have to come to terms that this is your real life."" the therapist starts. It's been 6 months since I came back, and I can walk, and eat and talk on my own, but they can see it.  
How unaffected I am by everything here. And the fact that I spend all my time researching the game company doesn't help with the impressions.  
""I can understand that, but please, if I felt, saw, experienced an entire life there... Why would that be any less real, than what is here?"" I ask her.  
She falls silent. Yeah, this always happen.  
But I don't care, I will go back, no matter what.

  
It's been a year, and basically I confirmed that magic exists on Earth, its just dormant, and much more difficult to communicate with.  
But it exists, and it is almost stronger, and purer that what we had on Eldria.  
I can do it. I can open a portal back home.  
""Honey! I am home!"" mom says from downstairs.  
She spent each free moment of hers with me...  
Ever since dad died when I was a kid...we were there for each other, the two of us against the world.  
""What are you doing?"" she asks, coming into my room, watching me scribble the runes.  
""Come, mom. I will show you your great-great-great-great-grandkids, and your daughter-in-law."" I saw.  
She frowns, then smile, willing to humor me, before gasping...as a portal opens.  
""Let's go...home."" I say.  
She follows without a moment of hesitation...  
Maybe this is why I have been returned...to get mom to a better place.",532,1750505787.0
1lgtwz8,myzb5sw,"No one had noticed the magic that appeared, too busy with their tasks at hand.  I let the spell go almost immediately, but knew this wasn't something I wanted to share right now.  The doctors and nurses completed their tasks and after a few round of questions, left me alone in the room.  A few hours later, a new nurse popped in to take my vitals and chatted about how excited everyone was that I had woken up.  While she was finishing up, a young doctor, probably freshly minted, came in and conferred with the nurse.  I could tell that he was lusting after her, but trying to remain professional at the same time. His words, obviously in an effort to impress her with his access to the project, painted a bleak picture for me.  They left together, making a coffee date while I lay there stunned at the news.

Struggling to summon a minor amount of power, I lay there in hospital bed, watching magical energy playfully twist between my fingers as I contemplated my next move.  The amount of available mana on Earth was sparse, far different from the VR world..  Everything from the VR experience still felt raw and more real than where I was now.  A single tear escaped my eye, to be joined by the multitude of others that followed when realization that the life I had painstakingly built, the loving family I'd had, were all just code in a computer database somewhere.  I yearned to rejoin them, but the doctor had offhandedly remarked that I could never return.  That shattered me.  I learned that the entire system had been taken offline and scrubbed back to the base version.  All of my adventures, my wins and losses, my family and treasures were gone with ignorant keystrokes.

But I still had my skills.  Physically, I wasn't even near where I had been in the game, but all the knowledge still sat in my brain, waiting to be used.  I glanced around the room, first with my normal vision before slipping into my alternate, mana detecting mode.  I could trace the wiring in the room as if the walls were ghosts of their former selves.  I could see the usual connections outlets and light switches, but there was an unusually thick cluster that connected to what looked like a device near the corner of the room.  Switching back, the only thing there was a wall clock with dark spots on it, as if the face were a Dalmatian. I let my mind expand outward, sensing emotions and triggering my innate Danger Sense.  It went off immediately as I felt the hostile, malevolent intentions coming from down the hall directed towards me.  It wasn't inherently violent, but promised pain.

*They're watching me*, I thought. After a moment or two, I made a decision.  *Let them watch this*.

The spell I cast as a favorite of mine from the other world.  I had used it in and out of combat, and had refined it down to a single gesture and a spoken word.  Power slowly filled my body as I drew it from the near empty environment around me and I said the command word with a slight twist of theatrics, invoking a short teleportation spell.  To the people watching on their screens, there was a flash of light and puff of colored smoke and the empty blanket on the bed slowly settled to occupy the space I had been taking.

I stood in the parking structure of the hospital, next to a beat up Toyota Celica with out of state plates.  I could faintly hear the alarm system at the hospital going off.  I imagined the panic and commotion going on in the room I had just vacated, but I needed to keep moving to stay ahead of the people who planned to use me for their own ends.

Logically, I knew I couldn't go home.  They knew everything about me, including my address.  I even remember signing that form for them to upkeep my apartment during the course of the program.  My parents and sibling were probably compromised as well.  Sadly, I felt less of a connection to them than I had to my virtual family.  The centuries I had lived virtually removed most of the feelings I had for them, and while this was bittersweet, it gave me the freedom for what would come next.",145,1750511121.0
1lgtwz8,myz6a0x,"Well, if that works, then-

I open a portal home. To family. My wife peeps through, and finds me, unchanged since we first met, on the hospital bed. My children, grown up, are confused, but recognise me despite me being younger here than there.  
I do not see myself through the portal; there is no 'me' there anymore.

The staff are freaking out. The device trying to handle my pace shut off, and the bits plugged into me have been ejected by fantastical means without doing any harm to me.

My family - my progenitors, and so on - had parted from this world. My friends, forgotten about me. One or two of them kept an eye, but only one ever visited me, wondering whether I'd even return.

And now I have.

A week has passed since my awakening; it feels like the leylines here have been already ignited - invigorated - communed with? I hear stories of others having awakened with literal magic, some even parting for other worlds where their anchorage had settled.

I've invited my closest friend to the other side to find adventure and solitude, and provided him a means to call upon me there should he need it.

I hadn't heard from him in that time, besides occasional texts of his relief - freed from this world's constraints.  
...He'll be fine.

I begin going through the troublesome complications of sorting out matters with the press and systems too rigid for my new state of being to fit within.

It's like trying to swim in shallow water that barely goes up to your feet.

So, I start with some major things from that 'game' world.  
With the Church of the Three Ls. The cases of our world bleeding over. Of the characters there hearing the stream-talk, accessing -our- internet, playing -our- games.

The more I told them, the more I -showed- them, even hosting in-person demonstrations for the unconvinced, the more the ones who made that world virtual became... enthused with it.

Now, I take a night's sleep in a place I called my other-home, it having been vacant of it's previous cohabitants, and having been permitted as a place of stay for my family so that I may show them this world.

Thankfully their physiologies are resilient; this world is full of chemical mayhem and longterm entropic residuals, and I'd rather my love not be rendered ill by the mere act of seeing what a world void of magic and full of humanity has been like.

Sure, there's a lot to dislike, but that's to be said of any world rife with civilized life in the ways we recognise it.

...But first I must tend to my wife.",64,1750509134.0
1lgtwz8,myzcch6,"I was noting down the most outstanding readings from the scanner. After we administered the neuroactive solution, the patient's neural activity skyrocketed and exhibited patterns foreign to me in all my years studying this field. The head doctor announced that he would begin the decoupling procedure. My fellow observers and I awaited it with bated breath from behind the glass screen to the operating room.


The patient, Laura Rowe, was the first to experience a neuro-VR headset malfunction of the kind that trapped her mind's activity in a virtual world. Forcefully disengaging the apparatus proved nearly impossible because of the risk it posed to her brain - so she had been placed in a sustained comatose state for five years. In that time, many more such incidents occurred. Teams of researchers and doctors worked tirelessly to find some means of bringing them back.


Eventually, we managed to make headway. Laura's brain had been appropriately primed for the procedure, so the headset was removed with ease. Still, her readings were spiking in abnormal ways. I thought the scanner must have been faulty.


The girl jumped from her bed with a speed and agility that shouldn't belong to someone who had been comatose for five years. More than that, she took a defensive stance—her left forearm shielding her chest while her right hand flew to her hip in search of something.


It was far from unexpected that someone in her circumstances - who had essentially lived for years in a different world - would have difficulty adjusting to reality. What shocked me was the fact that where her left forearm stood, the glowing figure of a shield began appearing and covering her form. In her right hand, something akin to a magic staff materialized. Her face showed traces of surprise, which were quickly replaced by concern.


I was beginning to doubt my sanity, so I turned to a fellow on my left. ""Are you... seeing this too?"" I inquired.


""If you're asking, I'm guessing I'm not mad then. Good,"" he muttered before returning his gaze to the patient.


The head doctor, Adam, who was in the room with her, shook off his surprise and began speaking to her. ""Uh, Miss Laura, I know you must be confused and disoriented, but I assure you that you are safe here. Please lie down and I will explain everything."" His voice must have been as calm as he could manage to make it. Still, it was shaky and betrayed the fact that he would have appreciated an explanation himself.


She did not reply immediately. Instead, she extended her right hand and inspected it. She looked at her staff for a few seconds, scared, before bringing it forward slightly and summoning a small ball of painfully bright light. It stretched out into a larger flat disk. From the angle I was positioned, I could see inside it - there was a woman with long hair holding a crying child. It hurt to look into that light, but I forced myself to capture as much information about this event as I could. It soon disappeared, but the look on Laura's face changed to one of great relief.


My mind was desperately attempting to discern what my next course of action should be. The woman could, after all, pose a danger we had no means of addressing. Yet what department or agency could I have called? What was even happening?


""The real world? It has been a while,"" were the first words that came out of her mouth after she inspected her surroundings.


""I'm sure your intentions were all well and good, but I see no reason to remain here. I hope you understand."" Her stance had relaxed, and she spoke casually.


""Ah - what do you mean? Are those weapons?"" Adam asked. The poor guy must have lost it.


Laura ignored him, turning to a nearby mirror. She touched her face with curiosity. ""So I have to live with this face now? A pity. Aris is in for a shock. I wonder if Liam will recognize me?"" she appeared to be thinking aloud.


""Right! Well, I appreciate you keeping this body alive so far! No need to bother with that anymore. I'll be leaving now, before my wife decides she needs to come rescue me. Byee!"" she chirped, before using her staff to carve a tear into the space behind her - like a localized incision into the fabric of reality, a hole with gleaming edges. She jumped through it, and it closed neatly behind her. Adam was left alone, staring madly at the empty room before him.


""You saw that too?"" I turned to my left once more.


""Mhm. How long until the government weaponizes this, do you wager?""",53,1750511592.0
1lgtwz8,myzdxq5,"The last thing I remember was her voice.

""Two days,"" Mirandeya said, the storm curling her hair across her face. ""If you don’t return with the key before then, the Door will close. And it won’t open for you again.""

Behind her, beyond the glass, my wife and daughter stood. Smiling. Waiting. I pressed my palm to the pane. My daughter mirrored me with her small hand. I smiled back.

Then I turned. Faced the portal.  
Stepped forward.

Nothing.

No sound. No weight. No light.  
Just absence. Cold, dry, infinite.

Then—impact.

I crashed downward into a bed, lungs seizing, eyes snapping open.

White ceiling. Hospital lights. A dull beeping to my left. The air stank of antiseptic and recycled air.

A nurse walked in pushing a cart, not noticing me at first. When she did, the tray in her hands clattered to the floor. She screamed and ran.

A doctor came next. Flashlight in my eyes, clipboard, calm voice.

“You’ve been unconscious. Three years. VR accident. Neural trauma. It’s a miracle you woke up.”

I didn’t answer.

I knew this world. Recognized it.  
The outer layer. The testing ground.

They would lie. They had to.

“I am Seradin Vael,” I told him. “Sealed Voice of the Seventh Gate. I’ve come to retrieve the key. Time is short.”

He looked at me carefully. Wrote something.

Then: “What do you think of the name Peter Dawes?”

I stared back.

He said Peter had a wife. Kids. A life in Indiana. He showed me a photo album.

I didn’t recognize anyone.

Later, they brought “my family.” A crying woman. Two teens. She hugged me. Told me she missed me every day. That I was finally home.

I smiled gently. Told them I’d had dreams. Nothing more.

I didn’t tell them about the kingdom. About the real family waiting on the other side of the Door. They wouldn’t understand.

For days I waited. Watched. Marked time in silence. The seal was closing. I needed the key.

Eventually, the doctor returned with it. A small metal object. Cold in my hand. Stamped: **317.**

I knew that number. Three mages. One swordbearer. Seven mortals. The Founding Code.

He gave it to me after I said the words he needed to hear.

“I know now,” I told him, eyes low. “I’m Peter Dawes. It was just a simulation.”",28,1750512212.0

""No way!"" The buff icon appeared in the top left corner of his vision, and Drew opened his eyes wider. He sat up and immediately tried a regeneration buff only to see it take effect as well. As he processed the information, a nurse had heard him awake. She walked in to see him glowing with several auras, but he dismissed them when she entered the room. 

""Glad to see your finally awake,"" she smiled at him as she reached the side of his bed. 

""Where are my parents?"" that was the most important question. They'd gone to great lengths to pull him out of the game, and now they weren't there when he woke up. Then, he had another realization. Had they waited too long? 

""How long was I out?"" he asked. He started testing his abilities as soon as he was conscious, so he didn't know if that was why he felt so well. He'd spent years in the game, and unconscious in a soil bed. The nanos that connected him to the AlterNet were supposed to keep him healthy. However, he had no idea how long ago he'd been disconnected and brought to the hospital.  It certainly looked like a vastly different hospital than the one he remembered before the game. But, the nurse's uniform had a nametag that said, 'Fennville Hospital' along with her name, 'Miranda'. 

""They're on the way,"" she reassured him. ""You weren't out very long at all,"" she smiled. ""You just got here; a bit ahead of them."" 

""Oh,"" he nodded, and at the moment the door opened again. Both parents rushed in to hug him. He remembered the warmth and the smell of holding them, and he let himself tear up a bit. ""I thought I'd never get to hold you guys like that again!"" he grinned. His mother, an austere, lean woman with silver hair, seemed to get even more emotional at that. She was overjoyed at seeing him again. 

""So, what'd I miss?"" he asked finally. The hug dragged on longer than even he expected, and both his parents were unexpectedly quiet. But, he imagined there was so much to say that it was hard to know where to start. 

It wasn't like they hadn't kept in touch. He could still communicate with email and text from within the game. When he first logged in, everything was so real and immersive it felt like a whole new life entirely. One that he designed himself. Thanks to that, and the ability to communicate to the outside world, he began spending more and more time logged in to the AlterNet. Then, everything changed one day when he couldn't log out. He'd spent almost three months in the game, trusting the nanos to deliver nutrients to his body and suddenly the option was no longer available. 

His parents didn't even get mad. They were happy to hear from him at all, and everyone went about their lives as if things were normal. Drew met someone and had a family, and he shared it all with his parents by sending them photos of their 'digital grandchildren'. Then, his parents said there might be a way to get him out, and they started coordinating a rescue. Drew had kept his awareness of the game and he enjoyed his wife's company, but he never let himself get attached. He repeated it all the time whenever talking to his parents, and even when showing off the kids, he was adamant they were only NPCs. The decision to leave was never in question. 

""Well...,"" his dad sighed as his mom squeezed Drew's hand. ""...we know what happened, and how,"" he said. The older man looked into his son's eyes with tears forming. ""... you died, son.""

""What?"" Drew didn't know how to make sense of that. 

""It's called 'Blooming'. Unfortunately, the back alley AlterNet connection you got didn't give you all the necessary warnings. But, Sharp Development showed up on this Earth with the real AlterNet, and that's how we set this up."" 

""What?"" Drew shook his head again. He understood the general idea, but he was still confused. ""I died, and I came back?""

That night, I waited for the ward to sleep. Drew the seal beneath the window with a spoon and a broken pen. Whispered the names. Placed the key at the center.

Nothing.

Tried again. Different order. Adjusted angles. Nothing.

The portal wouldn’t open.

I sat in the dark, hands shaking, key gripped tight. Breathing shallow. Walls pressing in.

Then I heard her.

“Daddy…”

Faint. Clear. My daughter’s voice.

I turned. The window was fogged with condensation—but there, in the center, a small handprint pressed against the glass.

I stood. Reached out.

Light split the window frame. Golden, pulsing, alive. Through it, I saw the marble halls. Banners of the Seven. Home.

I dragged the chair to the door. Wedged it tight under the handle.

Footsteps approached from the hallway.

“Peter?” the nurse’s voice. “We heard something—are you okay?”

I didn’t answer.

I stepped onto the radiator. The wind from the portal hit my face. It smelled like rain on stone.

I looked back once.

The door handle rattled.

“Please,” she said. “Let us in.”

I turned toward the light.

And stepped forward.

""'Blooming' is a way to permanently live in the AlterNet,"" his dad started the explanation. ""The nanos that are supposed to keep you alive continue improving the process until basically they give you a root system. Then, a redwood sapling starts growing in you, and out of you, capturing your soul and taking over as your body. We didn't know how to tell you there was a sapling coming out of your chest."" 



""I was a tree??"" it was concerning in and of itself, but there were deeper implications. ""How did I come back from being a tree??"" As he asked the question, he felt his mom squeeze his hand tighter, and warm tears landed on his fingers. 



""You don't come back from that, son,"" his dad shook his head. 



""I was rescued... wasn't I?"" he asked. His dad gave another subtle shake. 



""Not in the way you might think. Your 'rescue' is just us getting a chance to reunite,"" he gestured at the hospital around them. ""We're in the AlterNet right now. We were making our characters when you woke up,"" he added.  



""So.... my body's dead, or I guess a tree. I'm still 'trapped' in the AlterNet, then?"" he asked. 



""Your spirit is alive,"" his dad nodded. ""This will be much better than just texts and emails.""

Five years is not so long in the grand scheme of things but when that is all of your existence, five years is precious. 

There was the before, of course. There had to be a before. One doesn’t just appear in the world as a full grown woman, but despite Grammy Ada’s countless attempts - the vile concoctions she made me drink, the stories she told of her time spent traveling, hoping something would trigger - the before never returned.

My beginning was blurry. Grammy said she found me, bloody and ragged, wandering the nearby forest. No one in the nearby town knew who I was, and though everyone assumed bandits, it was anyone’s guess as to what really happened. 

I’d overheard Grammy’s musing over those first few months. Her whispered murmurs as she stirred a new batch of something that was supposed to make me remember. Whispers she wouldn’t dare say out loud. Magic, after all, was forbidden. Taboo. But it was magic, she thought, that had made me forget. 

That first year, I found myself back in that part of the forest many times, despite knowing the risks, hoping against hope that I’d find something. A locket, a bag, a scrap of cloth, anything with a clue as to who I was or what had happened, but I found nothing. It took time, but I had finally begun to accept that the before would remain unknowable. 

That was until the day I heard Grammy Ada scream. 

It was the first time I’d ever heard her raise her voice. I was inside the small cottage chopping vegetables for a stew. Grammy had left that morning to visit a friend in the village and though I usually accompanied her, she insisted she’d be fine on her own. I should have known better.

“Grammy!” I called, bursting outside. “Grammy Ada!”

She screamed again, a raw sound I didn’t think an old lady was capable of making, and I took off for the edge of the woods. My heart pounded. I had no idea what I’d find once I got there, much less what I’d do.

Grammy’s scream was cut short. I ran faster, hiking up my skirts and cursing the stones that seemed determined to make me fall. 

A short distance into the woods, at the edge of a small meadow where Grammy and I would hunt for pokeweed in the summer, I found her sprawled on the ground. I slid to a stop. Four men stood above her, all armed with knives and one pointing a sword at her throat.

“Let her go.” My breath came in short ragged gasps and my vision fuzzed at the edges.

One of the men chuckled. “Back away missy. This doesn’t need to concern you.”

Grammy moaned, and for a moment I saw in her place a child. I knew them. A sibling? A friend? I blinked and it was gone.

I sucked in a breath, clenching my teeth. “I said, let her go.”",87,1750546806.0

That was the first thing I felt, finding myself enveloped in darkness. The ground was warm beneath me, my body sore beyond imagination. Then I heard it. Footsteps. They were slow and unsure, but someone was approaching me.

With a grunt, I forced my eyes to open and was met with the bright blue sky stinging my vision, tears already forming from the harsh light. Before I could move, a shadow loomed over me, and I saw a woman staring back at me, her staff ready to swing.

“Outsiders aren’t allowed in these sacred woods,” she said, her eyes scanning me like I was some sort of oddity.

“Sacred woods?” I muttered weakly, struggling to prop myself up on my elbows. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” As my vision cleared and expanded beyond her, the world came into view. The dirt was scorched black, and debris and shattered trees lay scattered around us. If I didn’t know any better, an explosion must have happened.

Glancing down at myself, I saw that I was wearing what looked to be armor, or at least what was left of it. The pieces that clung to me were battered, the symbols burned beyond recognition. Despite the state of the armor, my body seemed to fare better, though I was riddled with cuts and bruises.

*Was I in battle?*

Looking up, I saw the woman lower her staff to my neck, her suspicion hardening. “Are you here to kill me? Who sent you? Who are you?”

I tried to push myself up further, my arms trembling with the effort. “I am…” The words got caught in my throat. I don’t recall ever seeing this woman in my life. In fact, I couldn’t recall any faces. Surely, I had to know at least my name. But even the most basic fact eluded me as I slumped back down, fresh tears mixing with those already stinging my eyes. “Who am I?” I whispered, more to myself than to this stranger. “Why don’t I know?”

The woman studied my face, her grip on the staff loosening. “You really don't remember, do you?” She raised her weapon away from me and offered her hand. “I have a horse nearby, and you could wear my old clothes when we get to my cabin.”",16,1750554614.0

A quick glance, showed me, a thin man holding Raines of horses, a man holding Miss Jones from behind, a man with a sword held to miss Jones face. He was screaming at her. Something about Gold. 

The thin man by the horses, spotted me then. He blurted out, “Mr Big some body here “ 

The man with the sword turned in my direction, shock on his face.  Yelled out, “Bevus , Butthead get out here now! Right now you idoits!”

Two large men stumbled out of the cabin. One appeared to be trying to hide a pair of Miss Jones underwear in a pocket. 

Mr Big pointed his sword at me, “ kill him , maybe she will talk then “ 

As the large men moved forward. I launched my axe at the man known as Mr Big. The blade buried deep in his head. 
I was already moving, I bent low, scooping up the handle of a nearby shovel. As the first large man got into range. I swung the shovel, the blade nearly severing his head from his body. 
The next man was almost on top on me. I spun, jumped into the air, and landed a spinning high round house kick to his head. There was a wet crunch and he fell limp to the ground. Like a sack of potatoes. 

The last man had drawn a sword and was running towards me. But he saw something when I turned to face him. He dropped his sword and started whimpering. Begging for forgiveness, begging for mercy. 

I walked up to him, kicked him in the balls. And while he was clutching his family jewels. I picked up his sword. Then cut his head off in one swing. 

I walked over to each man I had already fallen. I stabbed them through the heart and took their heads off. 

I then took all the heads across running water and burned them to ashes. 

The bodies I took in a different direction.  Built even bigger fire. Burning all to ash. 

By morning I arrived back at Miss Jones cabin.  

She did not even come outside. I gathered up the men’s clothing , weapons, equipment. Everything that was theirs. Tied it to the horses and rode off . 

After half a day’s travel I arrived at a way station. I was able to trade the men’s clothes and equipment. I got credit for Miss Jones. I traded 4 of the horses and kept 1. 

I rode out with the weapons. 

It took 2 more days hard riding. But I made it to a walled city. 

Here I traded a gate guard a dagger, for information as to who would give best price for weapons. 

I found the armory and the fellow in charge. 
“Do you be Rob the armorer? “I asked the stout fellow. 

“I be, Be thou whoust you? “ Rob slurred. 

I started laying weapons on the big table, “I be a weapon trader “ 

Robs eyes lite up, “you’ve pretty blades , what you name friendo?”

I grin at Rob, “they are works of art, made for war. You not find there likes around here.”

Rob stumbled, then sits down, “just what are you asking?”

I ramble off, “4 daggers of highest quality, 2 of the finest arming swords, 1 excellent long sword, a battle axe and a war hammer each of beautiful materials. I am not sure, what are you thinking?”

Rob rubs his face, “ I got to be able to sell them. I got to be able to feed the family, I got over head.”

I say “you got grog and strong drink to buy”

Rob says “ damn right I got strong drink to buy, a businessman got to relax “. Rob stop rubbing his face. “Hey! , what you mean ?” 

I say “what about 30 gold coins?”

Rob says “too much, 4 gold “

I say “15 gold coins?” 

Rob thinks he has me on the edge, “ 6 gold coins “

I stutter “I can’t go lower than 9 gold coins “ 

Rob smiled grabbing my hand shaking vigorously, “you have a deal my friend “

Rob pulls out a coin purse, and counts out 9 gold coins. 

I leave and begin my long ride back to Miss Jones cabin.",12,1750552479.0
1lh56k1,mz2bvay,"The man with the sword stepped over Grammy, leveling the blade at me. “And I said this ain’t your concern.”

Instinctively, I reached out with a grasping motion, felt my hand close around something solid, and yanked. Vines shot out from the ground and wrapped around the man’s sword, pulling it from his grip. It fell to the ground with a muffled thump.

The man looked up at me, eyes wide. A look I knew all too well: fear.

I felt my stomach curl and bile rise in my throat.

The man with rusted sword and ragged clothes no longer stood in front of me. It was no longer a bandit the villagers so adamantly warned against. Before me now stood a hooded figure in dark robes, silver insignia glinting on their chest. No longer were we surrounded by forest but smooth stone, polished to a sheen. 

Behind them, a second figure, shrouded in shadow, lay curled on the ground. 

“Let her go,” I said again, voice wavering.

The figure leaned in, its hot sour breath washing over me. “You cannot escape.”

Stones beneath the robed figure cracked. I stumbled back, gasping, as vines curled their way up from the cracks and slowly began to wrap around the figure. 

The figure didn’t move. Didn’t struggle. Under its hood, there was a faint glint, and I was certain they were smiling. 

“We will find you,” the figure managed, choking out the words as tendrils curled around their neck before fully encasing them in a dark green cocoon. 

A hand tentatively brushed my shoulder, and I jumped. 

“Shhh,” came Grammy’s voice. “Aerith, it’s okay. It’s only me.” 

The name pulled me away from the dark chamber. Away from the hooded figure. 

Aerith was what Grammy had decided to call me five years ago. She said it was a type of flower found on the snow covered peaks of the Therin Mountains. A flower the same blue as my eyes and strong enough to weather the toughest of snowstorms. 

I opened my eyes to find Grammy’s wrinkled face looking down on me, full of concern.",84,1750547379.0
1lh56k1,mz2vo93,"I found myself lying on a bed, the scent of healing herbs filling my nostrils as bandages covered most of my skin. The woman, I still didn’t even know her name, tended to me with gentle hands. The bedroom was simple, though I couldn’t help but notice an empty crib in the corner.

“Your wounds puzzle me,” she said, her fingers glowing with soft magic as she applied healing herbs to a cut on my leg. The warmth of her touch eased the dull ache that still pulsed through my body. “They should be extensive. You should be dead.”

I blinked, a chill running through me despite the warm room. “Dead?”

She nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line. “If not by the injuries, surely by the dark magic coursing through your veins.”

*Dark magic?* In me? My heart hammered against my ribs. I could feel something foreign writhing beneath my skin now that she mentioned it, like tiny insects moving under my skin. Her eyes darkened with something I couldn’t read. Knowledge? Perhaps, but whether it spelled danger or hope remained unclear.

The silence stretched between us before I managed to speak. “How was I found?”

“I was searching the woods for its gifts when I heard the sounds of battle, which should have been impossible. The ground shook, and I saw a massive fire erupting, though I suspect a magic user must have cast it. When I arrived, I found you at the center.”

I slowly nodded, though her story did nothing to jog my memories. My gaze drifted back to the crib, and something twisted in my chest. “Do you have a child?”

“My husband and I had dreams of raising a family.” She sighed, her shoulders slumping as she set down the herb poultice. “But the empire and its troubles took my husband from me. Before we departed, he gave me a map of the forest and promised to find me so we could raise our family in peace.”

“I’m sure your husband will return,” I said softly, wishing I could offer more than empty words. “You just need to be more patient.”

She bit her lip, a tear rolling down her cheek. “I’ve been patient for five years and accepted that I will live in this cabin alone.” Her eyes met mine, and something shifted in her expression, a spark of something I hadn’t seen before. “Until you arrived.”

I looked away, the weight of her gaze too making me feel uncomfortable. “I should leave when I’m healed. I don’t wish to trouble you.”

“Think nothing of it.” She stood, smoothing her hands on her worn apron. “Helping to return your memories to you will provide a nice distraction from my usual chores. Perhaps... perhaps we can help each other find what we’ve lost.”

Just before she reached the door, she turned back. “I am Sarya, by the way.”

“Sarya,” I repeated, testing the name. It felt good to have something solid to hold onto, even if it wasn’t my own identity.",18,1750554683.0
1lh56k1,mz2bw53,"“Are you okay?” I managed. “You were-”

Grammy nodded. “Blasted rock made me trip,” she said gently, brushing the hair out of my eyes. “I’m alright.” She glanced over her shoulder. Behind her, the ground looked like a stampede of cattle had run through, and two of the bandits were fully encased in vines. “Can’t say as much about those blokes.”

“Gods,” I whispered. “I’m sorry. Are- are they…” I couldn’t bring myself to finish.

Grammy shrugged. “I say they deserve it. Attacking an old woman in the middle of the woods. And in broad daylight no less.”

Grammy stood, knees popping. “You dear, have the ears of a wolf. It’s a good thing you came when you did. Can you stand?”

I nodded, pulling myself shakily to my feet.

“Those parasites ruined a perfectly good adderfruit pie. Adelaide made it specifically for you.” Granny bent over to pick up a mangled basket. “She thinks you like them.”

I did in fact not like adderfruit pie. It was entirely too mushy. And sour.

“We’ll have to tell her it was delicious,” Granny continued, picking up the least broken of what had fallen from her basket. “The cow, at least, will like it. Now, help me carry this back to the farm.”

“I-” I started. “I mean. Will you-”

My hands began to shake. She should report me. She should report me and have me hauled away for using magic. Never to be seen or heard from again.

Grammy rested her hand at the small of my back and steered me towards the farm. “Let’s keep this between us,” she said. “We’ll find ourselves a nice, hot drink, and you can tell me what you remember.”",96,1750547387.0
1lh56k1,mz2vtvd,"Kythaela. That was the name Sarya gave me, chosen from an old book of forest spirits she kept on her shelf. “It means ‘lost one who finds their way’,” she had said with a gentle smile.

The afternoon sun filtered through the cabin windows as I watched Sarya tend to her herb garden. Two years had passed since she found me broken in the scorched earth, and this peaceful life had become my world. The dark magic that once writhed beneath my skin had faded to barely a whisper. Sarya said it was because I was no longer connected to whatever source had fed it.

“The darkness in you… it’s military in nature,” she had explained one evening while examining the faded scars on my arms. “Someone bound shadow magic to your very bones, either by choice or by force. Without knowing your past, I cannot say which.”

Those conversations always left me restless. Had I volunteered for such power, or had I been cursed? The question haunted the quiet moments between our daily routines. I mended the roof, preserved meat for winter, and taught Sarya to track game through the forest paths I somehow knew by instinct.

But in truth, the not-knowing had become bearable. Sarya filled a void in my chest I hadn't even realized was empty. It was in her laughter at my clumsy attempts to weave baskets, her humming while cooking as I set the table, and her dozing by the fire after yet another failed memory ritual. In a way, I knew Sarya felt the same way.

I was carrying our evening meal, a fat rabbit I’d snared near the stream, when a scream shattered the forest stillness. The sound came from the direction of the cabin. Sarya’s voice, screaming.

“Sarya!” The rabbit hit the ground as I broke into a sprint, branches tearing at my clothes. The taste of fear flooded my mouth as my mind went wild. No one else came to these sacred woods. Sarya had been certain of that.

I burst through the treeline to see five mounted soldiers surrounding the cabin, their armor bearing the crimson eagle of an empire I should not have recognized. Yet somehow, I did. One guard dragged Sarya from the splintered doorway by her hair, pressing his blade to her throat while she struggled against his grip.

“This is your last chance,” he snarled. “Do you pledge your allegiance to the Empire of Vallonde?”

The guard’s eyes found mine across the clearing, and the world stopped.",20,1750554742.0
1lh56k1,mz3kxn0,"In the grand throne room, the general marched forward to accept her gift. Hundreds of soldiers and nobles filled the vast hall, their whispers filling the air. However, she had eyes only for her emperor, her reason for being. She knelt before the golden throne, head bowed in perfect submission, as Emperor Vallonde rose.

“You have served me well, my dear general,” he proclaimed, dark magic filling in his palm like liquid. The power crackled with energy, and she could feel its hunger even from a distance. “Under my shadow, you will perform wonders beyond imagination.”

Tilting her head up, the general opened her mouth willingly. The dark magic poured down her throat like molten ice, burning and freezing simultaneously. She felt it spreading through her veins, wrapping around her bones, becoming part of her very essence. The blissful feeling was intoxicating. 

She had never felt so powerful, so complete.

Time blurred forward to a muddy battlefield. Strategic formations meant nothing when she could reshape the very nature of war itself. 

The general raised her hand, dark energy crackling between her fingers, and unleashed it upon enemy soldiers who dared stand against Vallonde’s will. Their screams of agony became songs of triumph as her magic twisted their bodies and minds, converting them into shambling enforcers for the empire. She watched with cold satisfaction as former enemy soldiers turned their weapons on their own comrades.

The scene dissolved into smoke and flame of a burning village where another rebellion had been crushed. Sitting astride her warhorse, the general surveyed the destruction with the detached appreciation of an artist reviewing her work. Charred bodies littered the streets, and the burning smoke made her soldiers cough, but she breathed it in like perfume. War was her element, but it was the breaking of spirits that truly made Vallonde’s gift worthwhile.

Dismounting with grace, she strolled toward a half-collapsed house where her guard was beating a man with the hilt of his sword. The victim’s wife and children huddled nearby, forced to watch.

“Now, now, my eager soldiers,” the general purred. The violence ceased instantly, her presence was command. “You beat a dog and it will only learn to endure the pain.” She plucked the sword from the guard’s hand and approached the family. The blade found its way to the wife’s throat, and the general felt the familiar thrill of absolute control. “But threaten to take away what the dog loves…” She pressed the steel closer until a bead of blood appeared. “And it will sing any song you wish.”

The husband's scream tore through the air. “I’ll tell you everything! They’re planning another rebellion in Morcan in two weeks, a strike on the garrison. Please, I beg you, don’t kill her!”

The general tilted her head, studying the wife's terrified eyes. It was the same look she’d seen in thousands of faces across the empire’s conquered lands. Somehow, the look of absolute dread never got old.

She didn’t bother glancing at the groveling husband. “How lovely. But tell me, broken dog…” Her voice nearly dropped to a whisper. “Do you pledge your eternal allegiance to the Empire of Vallonde?”

Still pinned beneath her soldier's boot, the man nodded frantically. “I do! By all the gods, I swear it! I am yours!”

The general smiled. 

Pulling the sword away from the woman’s throat, she watched as a tendril of dark magic, thin as spider silk, wormed its way into the woman’s neck. The wife’s eyes went blank for a moment before focusing again, now carrying a look of absolute obedience.

“Excellent,” the general murmured. “Now you have a beautiful spy in your own home. You both will perform your duties for Vallonde and ensure the rebellion will go as he sees fit.”

The memory blurred one last time.

The rebellion had been officially crushed, its leaders executed in the capital square. But the general knew two key figures remained, Gileon and Sarya. The couple had never appeared at any uprising, yet had fed rebels crucial healing magic in exchange for food and shelter. Without their support network, it was only a matter of time before desperation forced one of them into the open.

Intelligence reports spoke of a legendary map leading to a forest sanctuary even Emperor Vallonde couldn’t locate. It was dismissed by her fellow officers as rebel fantasy, but the general knew better than to ignore any possibility. She had spent months mapping potential hiding spots, looking through ancient texts and interrogating captured rebels. This hunt would be hers alone. The emperor’s personal gratitude for delivering the final rebel leaders would elevate her beyond her peers.

Now she had Gileon in her sights, and he was leading her exactly where she wanted to go.

The man darted between ancient trees, hurling bolts of healing magic that she deflected with ease. Her dark energy absorbed his light-based attacks, growing stronger with each exchange. She could have ended this chase within moments, but patience would yield far greater rewards.

“Running only delays the inevitable!” she called out, her voice echoing through the forest. She kept her distance close enough to maintain pressure, but far enough to let him think escape was possible. Gileon was wounded, favoring his left side where her shadow tendril had grazed him earlier. Soon, exhaustion would force his hand.

The general watched as he stumbled against a moss-covered boulder, clutching his ribs. His breathing came in ragged gasps as he glanced around desperately. Then, with a surge of magic, he conjured a shimmering portal in the air.

Exactly what she’d been waiting for.

As Gileon leaped through the dimensional gateway, the general sprinted forward and dove after him, her fingertips grazing the portal’s edge just as it began to collapse. The magical backlash tore her from visibility, but she managed to tumble through into the sacred woods on the other side. Behind her, only her map leading to this spot remained scattered on the forest floor.

She emerged rolling, already raising her guard, but Gileon’s wild punch still caught her jaw. The blow cast away her invisibility as she spat blood, glaring at the rebel mage with fury.

“Assaulting Vallonde’s prized general?” she snarled, wiping crimson from her lips. “I’ll see to it that you watch me break your precious wife before I drag you both to Vallonde’s feet.”

The words seemed to ignite something in Gileon as he screamed. His healing magic shifted, becoming raw elemental force as he threw himself at her with the fury of a man with nothing left to lose. They traded devastating blows, their combined magic tearing ancient trees apart and ripping the sacred earth apart. Light and darkness clashed in explosions, sending tremors through the ground.

The general found herself genuinely challenged for the first time in years. Gileon fought not for victory, but for the woman he loved. That very desperation made him dangerous in ways her military strategy couldn’t predict as her injuries grew. Still, her dark magic was ultimately superior. She was already preparing the final strike when she saw something that made her blood freeze.

Gileon’s eyes held no fear, only acceptance. His hands glowed not with attack magic, but with something far more terrifying, a self-immolation spell that would consume both their life forces in a massive explosion. She tried to stop it, but it was already too late.

“For Sarya,” he whispered.

The world erupted in blinding white fire.

When the flames cleared, General Misara lay broken on scorched earth, her memories already fragmenting like ash on the wind. Through dimming vision, she saw Gileon’s body dissolving into golden dots of light, his sacrifice complete. In his final moments, his lips moved in what might have been a prayer.

Or perhaps her name.

Cheryl was the neighbor of dreams. When someone else in the building had trouble with their finances, she slipped an envelope under their door with no expectation that it be repaid. Additionally, when someone had a job interview, they left their clothes on her doorstep. Within four hours, she returned them cleaned and pressed. If asked, she provided interview prep. For a while, there was speculation she used to be an HR manager.

Every Sunday, she baked a large meal in the morning. Everyone came and went as they pleased. A few dropped off dishes of their own, but she did the vast majority of work. At major holidays, she left cookies at everyone's doorstop taking care to account for allergies and dietary restrictions. A rumor emerged that she used to work at homeless shelter.

Her ear was always open, and her shoulder was always warm. She had the uncanny sense of knowing when she was needed. When Gerald in 8A's dad died, she appeared at his door at 3 AM to comfort him. Her hugs quelled the internal strife. She used to work in religion that was the only explanation.

Molly in 3C was a sweet young child who saw her scaley tail and spread it around the building. Everyone thought that it was a child's imagination at work. Grant from 4B saw it and thought he was mad. He told no one. Rachel from 5E, Chris from 9A, and Ruth from 2C saw it as well. One drunk New Year's Eve. Everyone confessed to their sights. They went up to 10A and confronted her.

""You found out. I hoped it would come later,"" Cheryl laughed, ""To tell the truth, I am a dragon. I don't eat people or kidnap princesses. I know my presence causes fear. If anyone wants me to go, I will do so. You can say it at anytime in private. If you are scared, leave a note in my mailbox. I'll understand.""

No one took her up in that offer. She was too good a person. Over the next few years, new tenants came and discovered the truth. They kept the secret as well. One day, Bill showed up at the front door.

""Does Cheryl Smith lived here?"" he asked Rachel.

""She does,"" Rachel replied.

""Oh no, she's dangerous that one.""

""She's eighty. She can't be that dangerous."" Rachel giggled to hide her lie.

""That's what she wants you to think. Let my friends and I take care of her,"" Bill said. He walked away. 

Afterward, Rachel ran through the complex spreading the news. Everyone was nervous They ran up to tell Cheryl who packed her bag.

""Sorry about the trouble. I must go,"" she said. The tenants begged her to stay. She was a vital part of their community. She shook her head. ""It's not worth the trouble for you.""

They convinced her to stay for a little bit longer. She sighed and agreed. The next day, Bill returned with his friends. A small party of families convened in the lobby. When they entered, the children simultaneously threw a tantrum. The parents chased the kids around acting shameful and angry. 

The hunters navigated through it and found themselves on the receiving end of several kicked shins. The parents chastised their kids. One hunter tripped over a kid who lay on the ground. A few parents acted hysterical to pull hunters away from the group to complain about the hardship. When the individual was significantly isolated, they were hit on the back of the head and knocked out.

Bill didn't notice a quarter of his hunters were gone when he reached the stairs. At that point, he heard a loud thud. Someone lay on the floor, and a white goo coated the floor. The man looked up at them.

""Sorry, going to make the stairs sticky,"" he said. They walked to the elevator. They opened it to find several couples having loud arguments. When they returned to the stairs, they found the goo stuck to their shoes and made it hard to walk. They became separated in a line. When Bill and two others were on the eighth floor, they heard crashing. They turned and saw several residents came out and threw stuff at the hunters. The compatriots wanted to turn around, but Bill insist they press onward.

At the ninth floor, they were startled by a small army armed with baseball bats. They were skilled fighters, but they were overwhelmed by numbers and difficulty. Bill ran ahead to the top floor. He was all alone except for Molly.

""Why do you want to hurt Cheryl? She's been good to us,"" she said.

""She lies to you. She will hurt you soon,"" Bill said.

""I am okay with that."" Molly ran up and kicked him in the shin. Four more people emerged and tossed a net over him. They tackled him to the ground and tied him up. With the last hunter subdued, they loaded them into various cars and drove them away.

John and Fingers had opened windows on 3 floor. Their M60 was in place a behind a large oak desk. Belts of ammo at hand.

The roof several men laid on the roof with various large caliber scoped hunting rifles . Each was already lining up shots through the fence. 

“Start dropping targets as soon as the Dragon Slayers, breach the gate or fences.” I tell the roof top snipers.

I call out over the radio. “Here they come. “As the roof top snipers begin engaging targets.

1lh5kij,mz1wedd,"""Jessot, come in now!""

The boy looked down from his seat on the cottage roof. Dark hair covered the top half of his face, hiding the pair of eyes that few dared meet. Not for appearance, for the deep brown irises were hardly uncommon. What was though was the intensity that shone within. Like he held back a presence that would rattle anyone to their core. Like he could see into a person's innermost thoughts, and know whatever they tried to hide.

It was a look he had had since he was born. His birth had come during the Day of Black Sun, an auspicious event. Yet it was no fanfare that came with his arrival. No, it was screams. Screams from his mother, laying eyes on him for the first time. She had screamed and screamed, trying to escape despite the cord connecting them. She called him monster, the first name he was given.

His father had taken him nonetheless. He had brought Jessot home, and given him the name of his father's father. There he was raised, his mother vanishing not two days after his brith. A boy more comfortable alone with his thoughts, who always listened, yet seldom spoke. A boy who leapt from the roof without fear, stepping inside to find his father.

Henron watched his son enter, walking quietly. He worried for him, as all parents did. He hoped Jessot would grow up happy. Not necessarily rich and famous, but happy. He hoped he would find someone nice to settle with, and have a trade he enjoyed.

But for now, the most important worry was dinner. A simple spread of stew and bread, a staple of their home. Jessot sat opposite his father, as they shared the meal. Henron filled the air with his voice, talking about the farm, his carving hobby, even gossip from the village. And Jessot listened, absorbing it all in silence.

It was only as they began to clear that something changed. A knock at the door, making Henron frown. He left to answer it, leaving his son to carry on clearing.

Yet Jessot stopped to the sound of raised voices. He set down the empty pot, quietly padding out to find the commotion. There he saw his father arguing with a pair of heavy set men. Both bore long healed scars, as one spoke with a sneer. ""-shame you lack hospitality, friend. But maybe you'll open your coin purse instead?""

Henron opened his mouth to shout back, but was interrupted by a quiet voice behind. One that was seldom heard, and shook with authority. ""Judgement.""

The two men froze, as Henron turned to look. Jessot walked up, staring directly at the two. The thugs started shaking, trembling beneath his gaze. He watched them without blinking, as they slowly sank to the ground, twitching silently.

Finally they stopped. Jessot looked up at Henron, as his father spoke breathlessly. ""What... was that?""

And his son replied, in a voice far older than he should have. ""I judged them, and found them wanting.""",48,1750541859.0
1lh5kij,mz26oae,"But in my case…

I was born during a powerful eclipse.

Which, in this world, is more a curse than a blessing.

While growing up, I learned that people born on the day of an eclipse—like me—are called Children of Doom.

Most children are abandoned the moment they’re born—offered to the Forest of Abyss as a sacrifice.

But I was lucky...

An old woman found me before the forest did. She raised me as her own. Since then, I’ve been hiding from people’s eyes.

Because people would kill me on sight.

Every eighteen years, the cursed eclipse returns. And tomorrow... is my eighteenth birthday.

For that occasion, Granny suggested we go to the market to buy ingredients so we could celebrate my birthday with joy.

So, Granny and I were walking through the village market, picking out ingredients for tonight’s dinner.

The sky was clear, peaceful, and calm. Villagers were talking and bargaining.

Until—

A shadow fell over the earth.

People gasped, shielding their eyes.

“The eclipse?!”

“What? No—it's a day early!”

I looked up, eyes wide.

It was happening... now? It was supposed to be tomorrow!

The sun was disappearing behind the moon.

“This has never happened before!”

Panic spread like wildfire.

My grandmother grabbed my hand, her voice trembling.

“Celus... run. Now.”

“Granny?” I looked at her panicked expression. “Why—?”

“Don’t ask questions!” she hissed, shoving me away. “Run, before it consumes the whole sun! Hide under anything!”

I hesitated, but nodded—and ran.

But...

I was too late.

My body suddenly cracked like dried earth, glowing fissures blooming across my skin—lava burning from within.

I collapsed.

Screams erupted around me.

“GET AWAY FROM HIM! THAT’S A CHILD OF DOOM!”

I barely heard them. Just the agony.

Flowers wilted in a nearby shop. Fruit rotted on the vine.

The people scattered, afraid they’d end up like those flowers.

The pain was too much to handle. I thought it would end soon.

But I was saved...

Good thing eclipses don’t last long.

The sun broke free slowly...

Light returned. The eclipse ended.
So did the cracks.

I gasped for air, heart pounding in my ears.

“How... how did he survive?”

“They’re supposed to die at birth!”

“We have to end him now—before more chaos comes!”

“No!”

My grandmother stepped in front of me. “Don’t touch him! He is my grandson!”

“Can’t you see?” someone shouted. “The eclipse arrived early! The omens are changing! We can’t let a Child of Doom walk free!”

I looked up to see panic in their eyes. They were ready to pick up weapons... there was no doubt.

“We can’t let him walk—”

“Enough.”

A booming voice silenced the crowd.

Figures in tall silver armor emerged, cutting through the people.

“What happens next will be decided by the Queen.”

A hush fell.

A woman stepped forward—tall, cloaked in white, her face hidden behind silk. Only her long black hair spilled from the veil.

Whispers rippled:

“The Moon Queen...?”
“Warriors of the Dawn... they’ve come?”
“The Queen must have seen it all... in her visions.”

She knelt beside me, close enough that I could feel the cold energy rolling off her. She gently tilted my chin.

“It’s my first time seeing a Child of Doom,” she said softly, inspecting me closely. I felt a shiver run down my spine.

Then she paused.

“Or should I say... the end of humanity.”",14,1750545491.0
1lh6w2h,mz29k8g,"Brutalist architecture implies permanence in an impermanent world.

The dilapidated rebar skeletons of the twentieth century's concrete structures spit in the eye of any cold-hearted cynic that spent their career trying to convince the public that the simplicity of a smooth gray brick had anything to do with its integrity. The earth moves. The foundation cracks. The stone crumbles. And the steel can delay this, but it cannot stop it.

Steel sells the same lie, that there could ever be a structure built up in one lifetime that will not fall in another. But every construct is born with its own destruction in the design. I tired myself out of construction. The rigid false-permanence of steel disgusted me. I couldn't bear to give birth to another dead-end building. I crave the humanistic and the genetic. I wanted to grow something that knew for itself how to grow on without me.

So welcome to The Flesh Hotel!

Here, no guest sleeps in the same room twice. For at each new stay, you should not be the same person, and neither should your room. In fact, don't even think of it as a room. Remember your first home, the total protection and warmth provided to you by your mother. You did not rent a room in your mother. You slept in a womb. Come stay in another.

The Flesh Hotel doesn't have a foundation. She has roots. And they're not stubborn. The tendrils know better than to stagnate and whither once the nutrients in the ground have depleted. Their plasticity keeps them mobile and constantly on the lookout for richer soils. Today, the hotel overlooks a meadow. In a few years, we may be down at the lake shore, or standing high on that hill over there. 

The chairs look and feel the same as any fine upholstered leather. These floral tapestries are exactly what they seem, daisy chains of living fibers, blooming, pulsing, and emitting a pleasant fragrance as they filter our dust from the air. The plumbing.... The plumbing works. Let's just leave it at that.

I grew The Flesh Hotel with humanity in mind. There is no part of this system that works without the symbiotic relationship built between the hotel and her guests. The Flesh Hotel lives, and will live, ever-evolving alongside us. As we meet her needs--and her, ours--we'll discover new needs that have never been explored before.

Take your shoes off.

I mean it, take them off right now. The socks too. Get your soles against this floor and feel her wash your feet clean. Did you know you've been needing your feet cleaned? When she's done, they're going to smell like petunias. On my stays, I'll occasionally skip the morning shower and lay myself flat on the bathroom floor for thirty minutes or so. I stand up as clean as a newborn. Baby-smooth skin. I mean look at me. I'm beautiful.

She's beautiful. She's The Flesh Hotel, and she's the farthest thing from brutal that you can imagine. I promise.

""I...I have not been honest with you,"" she said, ""I...this is not my true form.""

""Oh..."" I took a breath, ""...well, what is it?""

She pressed her hands together, quietly cat a hymn, and change into...

...um...a brunette with brown eyes, and...acne?

""Oh. I was expecti-""

""I knew it! Wait, expecting what?"" she asked.

""Like...honestly? A dragon or tentacles, not just...the same person I married.""

""Same person - do you not see me? I'm hideous!""

""I mean...you look the same.""

""What!?"" she *shouted.* ""I look awful!"" she began crying, putting her hands together to start her hymn.

""Hey, hey hey,"" I grabbed her hands, removing them from each other. ""There's nothing wrong with this, Humans get acne too.""

""Wait..."" she sniffed, ""really?""

""Yeah. I mean, so what your hair's different? How does that - ""

""It means I'm not a true High Elf.""

*Now* there was a silence.

""What?"" she asked.

""I um...I don't know enough about elves to...what's a 'true high elf'?""

She was silent too, until she quietly asked ""...you don't know?""

""I...I promise I don't.""

""True High Elves are...are the destined ones, the ones who lead their people, but I was cast out, because...""

""Of hair color?"" I asked.

""It's...it's what we're taught, and...that blondes are smarter, and - ""

""What about the Orkings, they're all blonde but equally stupid, like all fucking orcs.""

""Did you believe this was a thing in Humans, too?""

She began to frown.

Her true form is her...but with long, red hair, instead of her blonde hair?

""Always."" I smile.

That's hardcore.

1lgv8mh,mz1i479,"""Darling... Do you have a moment?"" Drayla, the young, beautiful Druid I'd settled down with a few years ago, walked into my study, somber and scared. 

I put down my pencil, having scribbled down some ideas to bring my art to life. ""For you, I always have time to spare, my love."" I turned the chair around, looking my beautiful girlfriend in the eyes.

""I... Have not been transparent with you, about a part of who I am."" She looked down at the ground, tears falling rapidly. ""I'm sorry I've been lying to you!"" The tears came faster still.

I stood up and was instantly in front of her, carefully wrapping my arms around her torso. ""Love, it's okay. To be afraid, to wonder if what you share will make your loved ones think differently of you. But, one thing I need you to understand, is that no matter how you appear, no matter what your past, I'll always love you."" I squeeze her tighter.

""Well... I... This isn't my true form..."" She stepped away from me, hair slowly changing from its soft auburn, to the searing orange/red of the sun as acne covered only a few additional spots on her face. ""I'm a freak... No one has ever stuck around after showing them my true self... Why would you be any different..."" She buried her face in her hands, tears starting to fall, but never reaching the ground. The heat from her hair evaporated them faster than they had time to fall from her chin.

""Wow, honey. Who'd have thought you could get hotter than you already are. Figuratively and literally."" I laughed a bit, before taking one step and appearing behind her. I took her hair, hot as the sun in my hands and smiled. ""Ah, this feels amazing!""

She tried to step away, but I pulled her close by wrapping my hand around her waist. Gently resting her head against my bosom.

""Glimmer, stop! You'll die!"" She tried again to pull away, but the effort bore no fruit. ""Honey, seriously!"" I could feel her begin to panic.

""Relax, my love."" I pulled away, gently twisting her to face me. My clothes were on fire as was my hair. But I didn't have a care in the world. I didn't feel pain, just warmth. I looked down at the flames, smiling softly. I shook my head violently, the flames being cast out of my hair, going out before touching the ground. I snuffed out the remaining flames by flicking my right wrist once. ""See, no big deal.""

Draylan's jaw was slack, her mouth hanging open in shock. ""I... But... You should be dead...""

""Love, I've a secret too... I can manipulate reality. Bend it to my whim with something as small as a thought, whether consciously or subconsciously."" I lean against the wall behind me and sigh. ""People are deathly afraid of me when they find out about my power... So I understand not feeling confident in sharing my true self with others.""

""So... You understand the gravity of my predicament..."" She tackled me to the ground, wailing, letting years of pent of emotions out. ""I love you, so fucking much!""

I held her close and tight as tears swelled in my eyes. ""I love you just as fucking much. You're one of the most beautiful women I've ever been with and I wouldn't change anything about you!""

Her crying stopped and she giggled a little. ""Even though you _literally_ can. That carries a bit more weight to it, doesn't it? To tell someone you wouldn't change anything about them, when you can do that with nothing more than a thought at minimum.""

1lgw4wq,myzqbt3,"A lone woman stood at the city outskirts, shielding her eyes as she looked up. The glare of the Egyptian sun blazed from the surface of the spacecraft as it hovered to the north, taking up all the horizon and half the sky. The news report had said the UFO was the size of Luxemburg, its gargantuan bulk disrupting the weather and possibly altering the rotation of the planet. It was far too big for any weapon on Earth to destroy; and even if it was, the resultant debris would strike the most strategic shipping lane in the world.

She waited in silence for their delegation. A radio buzzed in her ear, every frantic leader of humanity from Norway to Argentina listening in while the General relayed simple commands in tight whispers.

With a shriek, the shuttle finally arrived, dropping to the cleared highway with a cyclone of wind. A ramp folded down, and tall, spindly figures in bright-orange armoured suits emerged. One stepped forward and gestured.

""*Where is our repository?*"" it croaked out.

""Right there,"" the woman said, pointing over her shoulder at the towering structure crouched against the distant cityscape.

The alien leader stared at it for a beat. ""*Excellent. We shall take it now.*""

""Wait. Do you want to inspect the contents?""

""*No. Best not to unseal it outside of controlled conditions. We could alter the locality to facilitate, but that would not be good for you or your people.*""

Chirping sounded from every alien, in what could only be an expression of humour. The woman's reciprocating smile was strained.

""*We do, however, ask that you come with us. For insurance. Also, if all goes well, you can fill the position left by the last human ambassador's untimely demise.*""

She merely nodded ascent, as instructed by the voice in her ear, and joined them as they walked up the ramp into the ship. At the last step before the door, the alien leader paused to look back. Two shuttles hovered in to hoist the repository into the air.

""*You humans remain bizarre mysteries. Why you would store our repository in a container shaped like one of your horses is beyond us.*""

For a moment, every muscle tightened, and she heard the sharp intakes of breath in the War Room. But there was no suspicion in the voice, only genuine curiosity.

""It's an old cultural tradition,"" she said after taking a breath. ""A symbol of respect and an offering of peace.""

""*Aha. Perhaps you will tell me of its origin one day?*""

1lgw4wq,mz0wdr9,"The spacecraft's propulsion sent the Mediterranean waters spraying up onto the slanted glass and stone face of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the new library of Alexandria. It hovered violently, immense power emanating from its enigmatic engines.

Sam shielded her face from the mist that blew at her along the boardwalk some hundred meters or so from the library. She squinted through the waters and harsh morning sunlight, trying to make out the general shape of the craft. It was wide and large, but that was all she could be sure of.

An exact replay of the pre-recorded message blasted out over the screaming propulsion system. ""Greetings humanity. We have returned to retrieve the information repository that we let you borrow.""

Sam's ears popped and she cracked her jaw, wincing at the tremendous volume of the craft's announcement. Suddenly, all went silent for a moment. The ship cut its engines and floated for a pause before slowly falling onto the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It came crashing down, sending three meter tidal waves to the shore. Sam ran for a nearby hill away from the shore, desperately seeking shelter. Before she found a place to hide she was hit from behind by the cold, salty sea water. She had the brief sensation of flying before being suddenly and unceremoniously dropped on a street a dozen meters from where she'd started. Miraculously the wave hadn't thrown her into a nearby building or broken her in half across a lamp post.

Several car alarms began sounding, filling the intense void of silence left by the extraterrestrial spacecraft. Sam struggled to her feet, soaking wet. Her shirt and jeans clung tightly to her cold body, weighing her down. The morning breeze made her gasp and she flicked her arms, wiped her face, and shivered, staring at the massive craft bobbing in slow motion just off the shore.

In that moment a host of survival instincts and urges to satiate her curiosity went to war. Her legs twitched to run away. She felt an unseen force expelling her from the vicinity of the gigantic metal structure in the water. But questions that needed answers seized her by the throat and threatened sleepless nights and years of regret if she didn't go closer to investigate.

The air exploded around her as the announcement played again at the same volume as before, but without the competing engine noise. She recoiled away from the source of the sound, holding her hands tightly over her ears and clamping her eyes shut. The sound shook her internal organs and left her chest empty and heart pounding. But the message and its implications were too much for an Egyptologist to ignore. A borrowed information repository? When had they left it, and into whose care?

Sam had to know.

She looked around, trying to get her bearings. The wave had tossed her onto a street she knew well. She jogged toward the boardwalk again, water gushing in her shoes and squishing between her toes as she ran. Her soaked hair mostly stuck to the sides of her face but some of it slapped and whipped around while water drained out and ran down the back of her neck. The briny water was in her nose and she spat and coughed against the wind until at last she arrived at the plaza in front of the spectacular work of art that was the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.

She had arrived at the same time as a small craft that must have detached from the mothership. It was nearly pill shaped, mostly smooth with a few lines and features that gave it a sparse amount of texture. It had no windows, and it rested on four landing legs. A door was already opened and from inside a group of three aliens were emerging.

Sam held her breath. These didn't look like aliens, they looked very much like humans. They wore simple clothing that almost resembled something she might expect to find on earth, but not quite. Their tops were woven fabric, with a coarse weave and bright colors. They wore accouterments on their shirts that glistened in the sunlight. They all wore long, flowing skirts made from a more fine and smooth fabric. One had all the features of a human female, including long hair, while the others were decidedly male. They both appeared bald and wore tiny squares of fabric on their heads, secured in place with strings that tied under their chins. The female had no head covering, and her hair was hanging shiny and smooth in long, straight strands without any styling. Her harsh jaw line and big eyes were intimidating, especially since she had already locked eyes with Sam.

Sam froze and stared at the woman without moving. The small party of visitors stopped as well. Despite there being a handful of others locals in the vicinity, the three extraterrestrials were all observing Sam with pointed interest. After a moment they advanced toward her. She was frozen, unable to move, or perhaps just afraid that any movement on her part could trigger an intergalactic war.

Sam heard a soft, kind woman's voice coming from the female. Her mouth was not moving, but it was definitely a sound and not just a voice in her head. ""We have analyzed the linguistic tendencies across the human globe and determined that this language has the highest probability of achieving successful communication outcomes.""

They both stared at each other. Just as Sam was about to nod her head, the woman looked down at one of the devices attached to her shirt, touched it, and then Sam heard the same voice uttering what she assumed to be Chinese with its tonal inflections and stuttering cadence.

""No, no,"" Sam said. ""I speak English well enough.""

The woman smiled, touched the device on her chest again, and the voice resumed in English. ""Excellent. Now, please take us to the information repository. We entrusted it to your people at this very site.""

""When?"" Sam asked. ""When did you leave it with us?"" She immediately regretted asking the question. There were too many considerations when it came to measuring time. But before she had finished considering the problematic nature of the question, a response came from the device on the woman's shirt.

""Your culture appears to unanimously mark time in terms of revolutions around your host star. Exactly two thousand four hundred and thirty nine point four three one two two three revolutions have passed since we entrusted the repository to your people. We had only promised that you could have it for two thousand cycles. We are within the agreed upon time period for retrieval.""

Sam looked over her shoulder at the library building.

""Is this the new monument in which you house the repository?"" The woman asked. ""It is very different from the one that was built near this site last time we visited.""

Sam winced. ""The repository,"" she began. ""Can you describe it for me?""

""It was a collection of bound and unbound documents on woven sheets, recorded using dyes and threads according to the custom of our people. It was most convenient since your people were much too primitive to interact with our more advanced information storage media.

Sam felt sick. ""Crap,"" she muttered, more reflexively than intentionally.

The woman's face contorted and she looked down at the ground. She looked up again. ""I do not see any excrement. The meaning of this word in this context is lost on me.""

Sam's shoulders pulled up into a half shrug and she grimaced. ""I'm afraid I have bad news for you,"" she said.

The woman cocked her face a little to one side and she looked on expectantly.

""There was a war,"" Sam began. ""It happened more than two thousand revolutions ago. Everyone from that time is gone. We have crude, unreliable records from that time, but none of us was around at the time, so we can't be held responsible. I hope you understand."" Beneath the layer of salt water, Sam could feel herself sweating profusely.

""We are aware your species only lives for approximately fifty to one hundred revolutions around your star. We understand that you were not involved in the war. What does the war have to do with our information repository?""

Sam tried to smile sympathetically, but she wasn't sure if the facial expression would be understood. ""One of the leaders in that war had his soldiers start a fire here in Alexandria. That fire spread to the library where I believe your repository would have been stored. Somewhere around forty thousand scrolls and documents were burned and lost forever in that fire. I highly doubt we still have your information repository. If it wasn't destroyed, we've surely lost it.""

There was a long, uncomfortable pause. The woman's face was impassive. The men watched her carefully. Sam felt herself vibrating internally, shaking with fear. Eventually the woman's eyes settled on Sam's and the voice returned. ""Show us what you have,"" she said simply.

Sam gawked open mouthed and gasped. ""We have so much,"" she began. ""But perhaps we can start with some internet searches and...""

""Yes,"" the voice said. ""Do what you can. We must retrieve whatever still exists. It is imperative. Show us everything that you can show us.""

Sam pulled her cold phone from the soaking pants pocket where it lived. She was grateful for the nearly universal demand for water resistance in smart phones. ""Alright,"" she said, moving to stand at the woman's side. She showed her the screen and searched for 'oldest living documents from library at Alexandria"" and began scrolling through the results.",19,1750529921.0

""What?"" 

""Time's up. It's been exactly an eternity."" He massaged his hand aggressively, they only way he knew how.

The red hot collar that had seared my neck for as long as I could remember crumbled away.

""I don't think that's how eternity works,"" I said for some weird reason.

Across the cave, on the other side of the bubbling lava puddle another demon was doing unspeakable things to some poor soul. 

""Look, sonny,"" said Zepharion, ""my wrist is killing me. I can't swing you round like that forever.""

""But that's what eternity means.""

""How do you know?""

I sat on a rock beside the lava flow. It was hot, but I've done hotter. Honestly, after this much pain, it gets more boring than anything else. The familiar noxious scent of burning flesh rose from my thighs.

""How do you know?"" Zepharion repeated. ""They tell you eternity is an unimaginably long time. Well, just cause you can't imagine it, doesn't mean I have to do this forever.""

""So what do I do now?""

""Do I look like a demon who gives a shit? Aaargh!"" Zeph groaned in frustration as he squeezed his wrist hard.

""What's wrong with your wrist?"" I asked.

""What's wrong with my wrist? You were there! Spinning you around for an eternity isn't easy on the joints now, is it?""

""That's a bit weird, though. No?"" I wondered aloud. ""It's like, they can keep me perpetually healed to increase suffering, but they can't extend that to the staff.""

Zeph rolled his 6 eyes at me. ""I'm out of here.""

""To where?""

Zepharion shrugged and continued to massage his wrist. Ignoring me, he called across the lava pond. ""Bazariphon! What you doing over there?""

Bazariphon stopped and turned his three heads to face us. ""Just some unspeakable stuff. Why, what's up?"" He stood up straight. The victim of his unspeakable thing stood up and backed away nervously.

""Well,"" said Zepharion, ""I was thinking of calling it an eternity. Maybe get a couple drinks, and maybe go do some possessing later. What do you say?""

""Not trying to interject in anyway,"" I interjected, ""but what am I supposed to do? It's not like I've been rehabilitated. This is all I know. What am I supposed to do now?""",232,1750498654.0

It shrugs, takes off my collar, throws a hoodie, and sweatpants at me.  
""You were sentenced to Hell for an eternity.  
An eternity has gone over, the universe has reset, now you can go to Heaven, and see where your new allocation will take you."" it says, as a huge Gate appears next to us.  
Before I could ask another question, the demon disappears.

  
Dressed up in oversized clothes, I go through the gates.  
After all, it can't be worse than Hell, can it?  
I found myself in a pure white office, with a...well, hot office lady sitting behind the desk.

I blush.

Any preferences?"" she asks.  
I am confused.

  
""What do you mean? Can someone explain what is going on?!"" I ask.  
""You were sentenced in Hell after your life on Earth as a mortal for an eternity.  
Eternity in this regards means the lifespan of your universe when you were born in it.  
Your universe died, and now a new one has been born, and needs souls to repopulate it.  
Here come in the souls from Hell and Heaven."" she says.

She nods.  
""There are right now 9834778 intelligent species drafted for the new universal cycle.  
As you are really early, you can choose one."" she says.

One that would allow me to live a good life?"" I ask.

“Metric time?” I asked as I brushed myself off. 

“All the extra dimensional planes did. Time zones between planes was such a mess. It is midnight in Hell and three am in heaven - what time is it in limbo? No one knows. It always seemed like it was five o’clock in Valhalla. Moksha didn’t have time at all - so it was always a bad time to call,” the demon seemed to be exasperated just explaining all the problems with time between the planes. 

“I had no idea it would be so complicated,” I said. No broken bones from the landing but I am scraped up a bit. 

“Right? Right‽ It was just a mess. So this guy, Sandford…. Sandford something or other, anyways, this Sandford guy came up with metric time and we all agreed to adopt it,” the demon said with a nod. “It took some getting used to but it works good.”

This had to be the strangest conversation I have ever had. 

“So, it has been my pleasure being your eternal punishment and all. If you hated the service, please take the time to give me five stars on the survey. It really helps with my quarterly reviews,” the demon said as he gave me a terrifying smile. “If you follow the path to the left, with the burning chunks of brimstone, it will lead you to the road of the damned and you can follow that to purgatory.”

“To purgatory? I thought I was done.”

The demon gave me an understanding nod. “Yeah, common misconception. You finished an eternity in Hell. You then have two eternities in purgatory, then an eternity or so in limbo, then at least three eternities working in parking enforcement, then some time in Heaven, then you are reincarnated.”

My brain just wasn’t processing his words. “Whaaaa? I don’t even believe in reincarnation.”

“It doesn’t matter,” the demon said sympathetically. “I once tortured a guy who didn’t believe in gravity. Falling out that window still killed him though.” He put his massive hand on my shoulder. The weight of it nearly taking me to my knees. “Look, Tim - you need to stop worrying about what you believe and start thinking about what is. Live in the moment - you know? Take the time to really enjoy each part of your afterlife. Because if you don’t - it will be over before you know it and you will be reincarnated. You can’t get this time back. It is a precious gift. Enjoy the whole thing.”

“Ok. Ok,” he sniffed. The demon was crying. “Gonna miss you, Tim. Now - get out of here before I start swinging you around again.” Sniff. Sniff.

Only then did it hit me what this meant. No more afternoon skinning sessions. No more saline rain sizzling in the day's wounds on my way home. Never again would I see the fire spout from Molokh's eyes as he prepared to set my mustache alight.

""Do you call it that when you've been dead an eternity?""

Thinking about it that way, it didn't actually seem that bad, I realised. Of all the delicious ways I'd been dismembered these past millenia, dismembering my mind hadn't yet been among them. Disappearing was something I'd never tried. And disappearing at the hands of him I'd learnt to love...

Their appearance was ambiguous and impervious to description - whenever they leave my sight and return to it, either by my blinking or turning away, they look different. The only consistency is the wings and a... halo.

Not an angel. Not fallen either. They explained it to me throughout the apparent eternity- they start talking, I listen. ""...For us, 'eternity' is a subjected term. Time has no meaning here, and so the experience of 'eternity' can mean anything from your 'one second' to 'yes' to 'no'.""

They gesture to me. ""Meaning that when -we- say 'eternity', you may perceive it as 'a moment', with the equity and equality of the ambiguity within such a phrase rendered entire.""

I am baffled. ""So you're saying that... 'eternity' can be but a 'moment' to your kind?""

The demon giggles(?). ""Yeah.""

Nor can I, but something in me remembers.

The demon smirks. ""Redemption robes."" They go on to explain about how one 'graduates' from eternal suffering with their assigned sinbreaker - a demon specialised in beating the bullshit out of their designated sinner... And then help them leave Hell a changed soul.

After a different kind of eternal experience, and a few arguably merry-by-my-old-standards-from-Earth circumstances later, I had convinced the less atemporally inclined demonkin to unionise.

It was not easy. And now we need to migrate to uncharted spaces.

So first, we went to Limbo. The Between. The Unassigned Space. The Blank. Those are many names for this intermediary domain, but it will serve as our root of excursion-

Well...crime went down. People heard about my ability, so...now? I'm a servant. Only murders left are spur-of-the-moment, or...snipers, basically. Dana Point is a small place, but...

""Hey, I...I'm here for you."" I still feel bad, but...

1lh5rfv,mz1vttv,"There are a lot of things on this Earth that exist because we *believe* in them.

Case in point: for much of my life, I, like all other human beings on this planet, was convinced that I was someday going to die. I woke up every morning and expected to find wrinkles, and so they appeared; I expected my hair to thin and turn silver, and my back to fail, and the arthritis to start up with its dull shooting pains (the agony, *God,* all that pain that I could have avoided if I had known). I accepted the helping hands of friends and strangers with dignity as I struggled to cross streets, to climb stairs. When my heart began to fail and cancer shriveled up my lungs, I was expecting it. I believed in it fully.

Until I met Sally.

She was -- of all things -- a volunteer at the hospital where I was expecting to die. A young girl, I'd thought; perhaps the same age as my granddaughter. Sixteen, perhaps, with curly blonde hair. Something sad in her eyes.

I told her after her first mandated visit that I liked to play chess. I was good at it -- used to be a part of a local chess club, but never bothered to go professional. She was better. She beat me at every turn and helped me analyze the boards after (*knight to A6, see, you got excited and you lost focus of your queen,* never *let me swoop in for the kill like that again, Ralphie, it makes me nauseous*), but it all became more difficult as my organs failed. As the warmth seeped from my fingers, and the doctors started pulling my children aside for hushed conversations about my health.

I glanced toward the wall. I was remembering my wife as the doctor was giving the negative prognosis, counting down my days. She'd died only ten years before. Also lung cancer. She was a smoker, and a drinker, and a sweet person. She was *fun.*

(Soon, I might see her again. I believed fully in my own death, but beyond that, I couldn't be sure.)

If I could have cried in that moment, I think I would have. But my family was there -- and after they had gone, there was Sally with her chessboard, ready to play.

I'd started calling out each move I wanted to make out loud, unable to push the pieces. Today, I told Sally to leave me be; I said it more forcefully, I started to yell. I was ashamed by my death, that heavy black certainty pushing down. I couldn't play. Couldn't play anything, soon enough.

""I'll be dead in a week,"" I rasped. I grit my teeth. ""Find someone else to play with.""

Sally's reaction wasn't what I had expected: it wasn't anger, or sadness, or confusion. She chewed her lip, glanced over her shoulder, and stood to shut the door. Her white sweater seemed to glow as she slowly walked toward me and bent over to whisper in my ear with her sweet, bell-like voice:

""Listen to me very closely, Ralphie,"" she murmured. ""You need to convince yourself that you're going to live, and live well.""

I shook my head. But she kept pressing: ""Believe me,"" she insisted, blue eyes flashing, ""I was once where you are. I thought I needed to die, too, but all you need to do is believe that you won't, and I promise -- smart people like us, Ralphie, we're meant to stick around. We're meant to live forever.""

A ventilator hissed. I sucked in cold air and closed my eyes, battered by pain, wishing for morphine, almost wanting it all to end. Get it over with, already. What the hell was she talking about?

""For me, Ralphie. Do it for me."" Her lips pressed against my forehead. ""I haven't had anybody put up a fight with me in chess like that in a hundred years. C'mon.""

Then she lowered herself into a squat at my bedside, and kept whispering: ""You are twenty-three. You are twenty-three. You are twenty-three--""

Over and over and over and I finally found myself crying when the knife-stabbing hurt took me over. I wasn't a man, then. I was a corpse. I tried to call for a nurse but Sally's pale white hand seized the call button, *You are twenty-three twenty-three twenty-three...*

\---

As I slid into delirium, slipping further down that dark tunnel with no light at the other end, I started to believe it.

*I am twenty-three.*

*I am twenty-three.*

I opened my eyes. The hospital room was clear. Sally was smiling down at me, and I found myself able to sit up, suck in a breath. My hands not the speckled versions that I was familiar with, my body light, and I sprung out of bed in a rush of panic to find a mirror.

*What?* My brain stuttered, and melted, and felt like it might be leaking from my ears. *What? Was I dead?*

Sally clapped a hand on my shoulder. She seemed shorter, now; I'd regained some of my height. ""You're not dead yet,"" she said. ""Not letting you off that easy.""

Her eyes twinkled.

Now, they are gone.

Maybe I should start the way I started for months at a time. Hi. My name is Beck, and I'm an addict.

No, I didn't attend meetings for alcoholics, or druggies. I was a gambling addict. My wife left me after I squandered our son's college fund. Looking back, it was a pretty stupid risk, but if it had paid off, we'd have been set for life.

I was alone. My tiny little apartment. It's a studio. I say was, but, really, I still am alone. My now ex-wife Linda and our son Jason kept the house. She always made good money. I was always good at blowing it at the casino, or the track.

They make it so easy. Hell, I can open up an app on my phone, and place a bet right now. Cover the spread? Sure. Fill out the bracket? No sweat. Sign up now to get $200 in bonus bets? I'd be stupid NOT to do that, right? That's a free $200, right?

Wrong.

Anyway, I was pretty much at rock bottom when I met him.

Funny little guy. Thought he was a Leprechaun at first. Short. Bearded. Only in the stories, Leprechauns wore green, and carried gold, and this strange little man was draped in browns, yellows, reds, and oranges. He looked like he fell out of a fall festival, or was crudely assembled by some folksy crafting shop near Halloween.

Anyway, he introduced himself as Nick McIllrick. Said he had a deal for me. The little man told me he could grant me impossible luck.

I had to take the deal. With good luck, I could win back everything I lost. I could finally show Linda and Jason that I was worth a damn, that I had money, that I knew what I was doing.

But, Nick McIllrick told me, there was a catch. I had to give up something I held dear. Something I loved. And like I said, I was at rock bottom. I didn't have anyone, or anything, to give up.

Then it hit me.

If I gave up my gambling addiction, my love for gambling, I would still have the good luck he promised, and I wouldn't even need to gamble, because good things would just always happen for me!

So, I tried my best to sell it to him. He was hesitant at first, but eventually, the strange man accepted the deal.

Only, the deal wasn't what I expected.

I don't feel it anymore. The call to gamble. The desire for the thrill of making a bet. But, like I said earlier, I'm still alone.

Impossible luck doesn't mean good luck.

I've been hit by two cars since then. Struck by lightning three times in five months. A pipe burst in my apartment almost as soon as that little devil in yellow disappeared. Ruined everything I owned. Found out my insurance lapsed the day before due to non-payment.

My luck is impossible. Impossibly bad. And even when I do flip a coin, or call a game I can't afford to place a bet on? I only ever win when there's nothing on the line. And I feel... nothing.",58,1750501636.0

""I'm scared, Pop. I'm scared.""


""What're you two hollering about out here?""


It was his mother. Hands clasped in concern as she walked out to the mild argument that was boiling over.


""The gorilla thing."" Jeremy answered first.


She began to speak. Then paused. Then remembered.


""Oh shit. The albino gorilla. Yeah, he mentioned that.""


""And?""


""He, he got the shit beat out of him by a gorilla."" His mom answered. ""It was blonde.""


""-Albino."" They corrected.


""And then it left.""


Jeremy shivered as he pointed. ""You were there too?!""


""Hey, Jerry honey, he didn't go after me. So I didn't-""


""Whole time I'm alive, none of you mention the damn gorilla?""


""Well, we didn't want to scare you."" Aaron promised.


""I should've been learning Kung Fu. Trap shooting or something!"" He shouted. ""Ki channeling like Dragonball Z. Stopping generational curses!""



""Granddad tried shooting it. Things just got worse.""


Jeremy angrily stormed off as the pair watched.


""...So I was going to go to the store? Should I stock up on gauze and antiseptic?""


Aaron considered her idea. ""Probably?""",425,1750458522.0
1lgeihc,mywx5mk,"I sat in the park, and waited.

I turned 18 yesterday, and was told it would be on its way. I was told several months in advance, and the reason why they waited was, ""because we didn't want you to worry, and there really isn't anything you can do about it.""

Fuck that.

I am a, Locked In, internet goblin, and I knew Exactly, what I could do about it.  So I waited, saved up money, put out some ads, and went about some sites, and made sure I was ready.

This pale ass, shit eater, got away with this with my Dad, and Grandad, but unfortunately this lined up perfectly with what I needed to know.

As I sat, and contemplated how this would go, I heard some noise, and I knew it was here.

It didn't try to sneak at all. It was just walking down the park walkway, people rushing out of its way, when it locked eyes with me.

I didn't care about avoiding the aggression signs, it was here for me anyway, and I stood up and stood several yards away straight ahead of it.

""I was told you were coming.""

It grunted, and wooped, in response.

""But, unlike the ones before I actually prepared for this."" 

I proceeded to take off my shirt, I wasn't gonna cower away from this now, and took out a whistle. With one loud burst on it, they arrived.

They stumbled out of bushes, walked from behind the bathroom, a few even crawled outta drains(Why I don't know).

""Behold, the power of $20 is $20!"" I cried out, and now let's answer the question, ""Who Would Win!?""

It began pounding it's chest, which actually makes a pretty funny noise unlike what King Kong would imply, and began charging.

""A Hundred guys, or One Gorilla!"" 

With a psychotic cry, we charged at it.

For whatever happens, this gorilla will not whip my ass with Ease!!!

1lgeihc,mz0cbbg,"“But I have been through seventeen cycles already,” I said.  “You’re saying this magical simian will materialise in a few weeks for his violent celebration?”

My father sighed, and waved away his Hover-E. I followed his lead and the drones between them effected the anti-dig field around us.  The uncanny silence from my implants descended, in that way where you don’t realise how much background stuff you are paying some attention to before it goes, my notifications stopped scrolling and I better heard the birds in the jungle canopy below us.

“I’m serious,” he said, and even looked directly at me, something of a rarity.  “This will be the sixth or seventh generation it would occur and I have no evidence that you’re any different.”

“You are serious,” I repeated.  “Right.  Well, how badly?  How badly beaten will I be?  What about you? And also, what the actual.”

“I have no longstanding conditions, and precious few answers,” he conceded.  He seemed restless and I knew he didn’t like feeling unplugged even partially and temporarily.  A car rose from the canopy along with a hundred or more brightly coloured birds squawking and fluttering. I wanted to use my tech to identify them, which I clearly never did, or I would know, but not having the ability just to whimsically have them scanned and catalogued in my selfdoc made me want to do it.  

My father stood and moved to the railing, resting his hands on there, and I was reminded that he was nearly 40 years older than me by the way he moved.  This seemed to be happening more often now, despite his detailed health regime and exceptional anti-aging care. 

“I can only assume,” he said. “That this is one of the biotech assimilations or whatever you call them now, that is now simply living down on Monoco’s ranch.  He didn’t try and communicate, unless, ha, his blows were a love language.”

God, I loved hearing him speak, his rich, calm timbre, but this was peculiar stuff. It belied the anxieties of the real man, this rich tone and his effortless command of his speech. 

He continued: “No communication but there was intelligence in its eyes and he wore some kind of cloth around the midsection.  Could have hidden anything and I don’t think real - sorry, *original* - simians ever wore clothing of any sort to my knowledge.”

“They did not,” I confirmed. “But I mean why?  What should I do?  And how?  How always the same day? If I was in a panic room or flying or in a bunker or something,  how’s he getting to me?”

“Just wait for you outside, I guess,” he snapped, sounding annoyed, and I realised this was wrapping up, his patience ended. “I’m just warning you,” he said, “So you know, and more to the point, you know he won’t kill you or leave you permanently injured. I have to say, I forgot all of that when it happened to me and I was screaming in terror, so perhaps you’ll do better.”

“Without doubt,” I said smoothly. The anti-dig field dropped, I was back online, my Hover-E drifted back in near-field range, and I felt myself relax a little. 

*How much of that did you get, already know or how much more can you tell me*? I subvocalised to the drone.  My father was already to the elevator without a backward glance. 

“All, all and quite a lot,” said my Judas drone out loud and quite clearly.  I heard my father laugh before the elevator doors snapped shut behind him and cut off the sound.

[Part 2 coming together in my head, if wanted].",10,1750523663.0
1lgeihc,mz19tzp,"When the day dawned, I ended up doing exactly what my grandson’s wife had suggested, and I took my breakfast alone up on the sky terrace.  I sat in the same chair I had inhabited on the day my father told me about the white gorilla, not even a month earlier.

The party was due for early evening, and I had an autocar on float near the tower to whisk me to hospital for any repairs beforehand.  I felt curious and rather at ease with the whole surreal episode.  My Hover-E was instructed to stay by the elevator, just out of near-field. Whilst my drone had all the protective programming and hardware you’d expect, I now understood that there would be no intervention from that quarter. I drank some juice and studiously ignored the fruit salad for a while. I checked my bag of spare clothes nearby more than once, and recognized that I was more nervous than I credited at first.

I hadn’t paid much thought to how my antagonist would arrive.  This balcony was some fifty feet or more above the high points of the nearby jungle canopy.  This turned out to be no obstacle to fate however, as I heard and then saw him hauling himself over the railing about twenty paces away.

I had not been up close with a gorilla before and I had not truly realized how imposing they were.  Unmistakably male, this one.

He looked directly at me as he approached. He had not stopped for a breath after his climb.  He did indeed have a swathe of blue-grey cloth around his torso, sharp against his white fur.  I could barely see his deep-set eyes beneath his hulking brow, so I couldn’t confirm my father’s comments on intelligence.  I had risen and moved away from my chair and the small breakfast table.  I always abhorred mess, and would not like things to be disturbed.

My seconds of reflection were over and he was upon me.  I instinctively threw my hands up and started turning away, and still his first blow hit me far earlier than I had anticipated.  It hit my between my shoulder and chest on my right side, and something cracked as dull pain washed over me.  I was in the air, then slamming against the hardened railings of the balcony, blows to my left side and back that hurt worse than his opening blow if anything.

For an opening blow was all it was.  He was on me again, grabbing my foot, and swinging me such that my head, now covered my my arms and hands, slammed into the balcony again.  I think I broke a finger, but my skull was ringing and throbbing, and my hands were not my concern.  I thought I was going to die from his first blow to the chest then, as the numbness spread down my side.",7,1750534342.0
1lgeihc,mz19v8r,"He lifted me by my hair until I was nearly upright, and for a moment I believed he would try to throw me over the railing, but instead he used his free hand to smash into my midriff.  Ribs cracked, I threw up into my mouth and then down my face, and he released his grip on my hair so I collapsed down onto the mats covering the floor.

He stood off then.  Eyeing me, I think, but I was occupied with moaning and in genuine belief that I had such internal injuries that I might die before my Hover-E could even administer whatever triage required.  After a few seconds, I opened my eyes and pushed myself up to see. He didn’t look any smaller when I was lying down, that was for sure.

I made it to my knees but my breaths were ragged and now my finger weirdly throbbed worse than the surely worse body blows.

“Why,” I croaked out.  “Are you doing this.”

I swore it looked like he was considering a response.  Instead he gazed calmly at me, then turned to leave.

“Wait,” I said.  He stopped.

“Tell me why, please, why me, and why Father,” I croaked.

He turned back to me.  The morning sun caused the usual panoply of peach, reds, oranges and blues in the sky behind him, and his pale fur picked up the myriad colours, making him seem almost opalescent in this quiet, high place.

He touched a hand strangely to his side, to an area where the cloth covered his muscular body.  A recorded voice rang out, harshly in the stillness: “Revenge,” said the voice.

He moved away unhurriedly yet was gone before I could formulate any more words.",6,1750534354.0
1lgeihc,mz1a0zx,"My Hover-E came over, and the next thing I remember was waking up at around 10:30am in a private room at the Esperanza Verde Hospital.

No-one else was there. The readout on the display facing me showed I was in fine shape, and all had been patched up successfully.  I felt good, but light headed and I didn’t really want to know what cocktail of things I was on.  I instructed my Hover-E to begin discharge and watched the notes and confirmations float across the display. “Drink little alcohol at your party,” was the final instruction. “No narcotics”.  The amount charged to the family account was eye-watering. I winced a little.

Some night this would be, and I didn’t even have visible wounds to show off. And I could hardly raise a complaint to Monoco’s Autonomous Ranch, where surely both humans and tech would refuse to confirm or deny any such creature was resident.

 \*\*\*

I did learn a little, later.  More than the bland talk of my family’s involvement in Uplift generally: that was hardly a secret.

Not from my father; he'd said all he was going to say, and likely less than that, but instead from an old recording stitched into the Monoco archive, misfiled and tagged under *agroecology* *ethics*. It didn’t take much digging once I knew what to look for. The white-furred one wasn’t some random offshoot mistake or long-lived creature of resentment and controlled aggression. He was of course engineered; back when that word still implied aspiration instead of apology.

The uplifts had names, once. Families. Vocalizations recorded with eerie clarity: not quite language, but closer to lament than anyone had admitted at the time. The project had ended badly, like most things that start with patents and end with sterilisation orders. But he survived from this one Project in particular.

And he, the one who came for me, is more than ritual. More than revenge. He’s the embodied memory of a broken promise. Tasked, encoded, and apparently sustained by some blend of biotech and sheer will.

I wasn’t attacked to be punished. I was attacked to remember.

It will be my son next. When he too turns seventy, in less than thirty years' time. I wondered faintly if I should break the cycle, or if I even had the right to. But it was time to get to the party.",5,1750534407.0

1lgpw7z,myygimj,"There are 3 people locked in an undescript white room, an unlikely trio. One is a Redneck, gruff looking, a good heft but a clear indication of muscles under that fat.

Then there is a jock, clean face, perfect teeth, 6ft tall, a man the woman would swoon for. 

Lastly there is a pipsqueak. Big glasses in front of his eyes and signs of balding on his head. The smallest of the three, both in width and height. 

""I'll stay"" the Jock announces. ""You two leave, I could not forgive myself if any of you suffered for my benefit""

""Hah"" the Redneck laughs dryly. ""You are not hard enough to survive on your own. I will stay, I'm used to hardships from the farm. This is nothing, a little vacation if anything.""

""No!"" The pipsqeak joins in ""You both will leave and I will stay""

The Jock and the Redneck both look at him for a moment. Then they both question at the same time. ""You will stay? Why that?""

The pipsqeak smiles lightly. ""Well, I am weak...""


""Exactly"" the Jock butts in ""You are weak. This is why one of us should stay""

""I wasn't"" finished the Pipsqeak says. He motions them to come closer and starts to whisper. ""Because I am weak, I am of no use in a rescue operation. You however"" he points at the Jock ""Have lots of strong friends. And you"" he points at the Redneck ""Have lots of weapons in your shed. I want you to go out and then come back to rescue me""

""Why are we whispering?"" The Redneck whispers.

""Because we don't want whoever put us here to hear us."" The Pipsqeak replies.

""Ahh right"" the other two both whisper in unision.

""Now here is the plan"" the Pipsqeak starts ""You know my friend Hacker. When you get out, you will likely not know where I am. Contact Hacker, they will be able to locate me. Get your friends and your guns and storm whatever this place is. Hacker will handle the information side"".

After the 30 minutes were over, they all stood up and hugged one last time. A voice came from an unseen speaker ""Now, who will stay?"" It asked. ""I will"" the Pipsqeak said, tone shaky. 

A door opened. They could see armed guards on the other side as the Jock and the Redneck left.


3 Days went by. The Pipsqeak still sat in the white room, taking on a meditating pose. Suddenly, the door burst open with startling sound of an explosion.

""Oy!"" The voice of the Redneck came in ""Vacation is over, its time to leave""

The Pipsqeak smiled. He got up, left the room through the destroyed door, fistbumping the Jock and his many jacked friends on the outside. He winced a bit as he saw the armed guards on the floor. ""Now lets get out of here"".

**1 day later**

The Pipsqeak scrolled through the news. ""A research cancer research facility in New Mexico has burned down. All data has been lost and no footage was found on any of the surveillance cameras. Police suspects terrorism, but has yet to find any evidence"". The news report says.

""Good job on the information control"" the Pipsqeak says joyfully.

""Ha, what can you say, I am a pro after all"" Hacker replies haughtily.

*Well, he says ""tourists"". ""Adventurers"" is technically the correct term. Mercenaries looking to make a name for themselves, knights with nothing better to do, disgraced nobles hoping to get their old bloodline back in the ""right place"", all congregating in some random hunting town in the middle of fucking nowhere because some dickhead thought it a good idea to stab an Artifact into a rock and speak a prophecy about it. No this had to stop. All those idiots milling about annoying the townsfolk had to go find something better to do, and that damn sword had to fucking go as well.*

The fourth, lying on the grassy floor of the gently lit clearing, heaving and groaning next to the rock, sputtered out, ""A little help?""

The third, next to me, nudged his foot against the old man gently, ""Cmon oldbag, you're 78, and Ancestry dot com said you had like. The blood of Charlemagne. Can't you give the sword another go?""

The fourth wheezed, and groaned, hacking and coughing as he tried to stand up again, placing one hand upon the hilt of the blade... Before giving up, leaning against the rock.

The first looked down at him, and shook his head, ""Bloody 'ell.. You're bloody 78, mate.. Oldest we got, surely if you were Charlemagne's great-great-great-great-great grandson you'd be able to get the sword off!""

I chimed in, ""Yeah, just give the bleedin' sword another go!"" I gave him a hopeful smile.

My smile quickly faded as I watched him continue his unstoppable groaning. I waved my hand infront of my nose, scrunching it up as I lean to the third as he pulled up his phone. ""What about Jack?""

The third shook his head, and spoke, ""Nah. Too Irish. Good candidate, but, you brits'll never accept a dude from Ireland as king.""

I think for a moment, and brilliantly comeback with, ""But wasn't Charlemagne, like, French, or something? Why don't we just stick with King Arthur""

He shook his head again, ""Nah. He was of the Franks. Protofrench, but, more Germanic, like England.""

I nod knowingly. Then, I remember. ""What about Lon? Think he'd be better?""

He thinks for a moment, then brings up Facebook on his phone. ""Yeah we'll see about him. He's got a 50% match with some ancient descendant of Arthur.""

The three of us walk off, we'll find another one. This time, for SURE.

As we leave, the fourth crones out, ""HEY! Aren't you gonna help me home??""

While testing the new game Hell's Ascent, an MMORPG, where the 18 levels of Hell are trying to break into our reality, which causes rifts in space and time, I was stuck inside.  
No log out or quit button appeared.  
The beta version only had 4 levels of Hell, but even that meant hundreds of dungeons appearing all over the world, spewing out monsters, corrupting NPCs, and having to survive natural phenomena events like space storms.  
I don't know how long has it been since I was in, but I managed to clear all dungeons, and even face 3 out of the 4 Princes of Hell, that rules the levels of Hell available in this version.

1lgmrvi,myxpjko,"My last semester in college was just like the rest. Lonesome. I knew I was part of the problem. You can't really expect to enjoy youth when all you do is play video games in your dorm room. I had been invited to parties and had many opportunities to make friends, but doing nothing was easier than doing something.

I didn't really have a right to regret.

Either way, being such a gamer had its pros. I was able to apply as a beta tester for a new VR game, one that could suck in your very consciousness into its world.

It was an odd experience. Every artifact I held had weight to it. Ever time blade cut through the flesh of a monster, I felt a resistance.

Even the NPC's felt like actual humans, or at least, it did a well enough job to give the illusion of one.

By the time I realized I couldn't log out, I didn't even care. I had talked to so many more people than I did in the real world. I was treated as a hero every time I protected a village from a dragon.

I even fell in love with the princess of the northern kingdom, and she fell in love with me after I rescued her from a group of bandits.

I got stronger. I got married. I tamed a forest hound, and  and cried as he died in my arms after years of adventuring together.

Then, one day, while sitting on the couch, I noticed that the perspective of the lamp in the corner of my room was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D, but... just.. wrong.

The game wasn't perfect. It was in its early stages, and it had a lot of bugs, so I didn't think much of it.

That was until the lamp started to grow wider and deeper. It was still inverted dimensions. It took up my entire perspective, and all I could see was red. Perhaps the game file had been corrupted? I still don't know, but the next thing I knew, I was back in my dorm room, my roommate standing ahead of me, an electrical plug in his hands.

""Hey man. Sorry for bothering you, but I need to charge my laptop.""

I couldn't even stagger out a word.

What felt like an entire life inside the game was but a mere hour in the real world. I tried to log back in many times, but the file had grown fully corrupted. I wasn't let in.

I tried contacting the developers, but I never got a response. I waited for the full release version, but to my dismay, it seemed that they had abandoned the project altogether.

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression. I was grieving the loss of my wife and my ragtag team of men and women who always stood by my side. I cried for them even though they were nothing but lines of codes.

No one else can understand my grief. I have never felt more alone.

I sometimes wonder if this 'reality' was an illusion too, waiting for the me on the other side to finally pull the plug.",19,1750480121.0
1lgfqsw,myw29yq,"\[Part 1\]

White walls, white tiles and white sheets? And an annoying, blaring siren? I slept in a grove, a peace, a serenity that was incomparable, and now? I looked around, my essence radiating against the tiles.

The heavy door opened, as multiple men in black kevlar and gray clothing, with weird circle and arrow insignias ran in, pointing their weapons at me. ""Freeze!"" one said.

I looked around once more. The cell had glass near the ceiling, and I could see two men in lab coats looking down on me. I looked back down to the men in clothes.

""I said freeze!""

One of the men in a labcoat said something I could not hear, followed by ""roger!"" from one of the guards, I presume?

""Am I being guarded?"" I asked.

Silence.

I looked around, and asked ""where am I?""

Nothing?

I've been asleep for a long time, and I remembered I cannot talk to these...furless beings. Well, their head has fur, I guess. I then, at the speed of light, entered the one who had been talking, as, from the other men, loud sounds, with black spots appearing on the tiles.

Entering his mind, I saw him in a hospital, instinctively knowing this place, a place I had never been, as something called a 'Minnesota', childhood, more of these beings...I'm remembering, 'Humans', I think. They were rare, the Fish-like Atlanteans, the Orcs, the Dwarves and Elves, the Fae, all far more interesting, and visited me more.

Other words of importance came. 'Home'. 'Love'. 'Life'. 'Janitor'. 'Promotion'. 'Mobile Task Force'. Strange.

I left, as the men once again made the sounds. I saw their...items...guns? I remember when those beings had crossbows. It's like that, but...loud, and they keep firing. I look to the man in the labcoat, who looks...stunned. Perhaps he is of more use?

I slowly approached, moving through the wall. ""Hello."" I said.

He began running.

Blast, right, I must telepathically speak to matter-based lifeforms. Silly me. I then entered his mind. Who are you? I asked.

He fell, then turned to me, speaking in some language, but his thoughts, I could hear No No, the Anomaly has gone Rogue! I repeat, the Anomaly - someone get the MTF here!

The thoughts are the same, but I cannot understand his spoken words, oddly. Please, I began speaking to him, Think to me, do not use these out loud words. I cannot understand them.

His face softened, then looked me up and down. He started speaking, then said Oh, I see. You are the one talking to me.

Yes.

I - look, I was here to study you, but we don't know what you do!

Ah, of course, I replied, I understand you do not see creatures like me much anymore. The Elves were mostly my friends, but as time passed, I grew more solitary. I confined myself to a beautiful tree, but...I'm afraid she passed. Tell me, where are the Elves? Or the Fae?

He looked around, said something, then asked The Elves?

Yes. The Elves. Or even the Orcs. They're dumb, but they can party well.

He looked around again, I'm sorry, Elves? There are no Elves left.

Really? What about the Atlanteans? Surely, they exist.

Don't tell it it can't know it...oh no! His face grew immediately distraught.",133,1750457650.0
1lgfqsw,myw3ua4,"So, I entered his mind as well.

A fascinating mind to be! White walls were his beginning! A glass cylinder of green liquid, then one day pulled, and coached. Then, memories - memories of a younger age were created when he was an adult? Strange, strange.

I searched his mind further, and found much of interest. Creatures of impossible strength, ones who may heal, those of knowledge beyond fathomability, yet, with no true intellect to speak of. I saw a silver comet, turning locals to aliens. And a poster, with an addiction. Ghosts of families, a shed with a poor, dead woman. A chicken that grew thousands of times its size, and a flock of lizards.

Yet, nowhere did I see Orcs.

I looked for elves, but saw only images. Yet...I have seen fictional orcs and elves? But alas, why are these images not important?

For Atlanteans, I saw only bones. Long, past dead ones, in storage facilities, to be seen only by other fellow men and women in coats.

And for the Fae...

A place. A place of names, where it can be taken, where the colloquial becomes the literal, a place referred to, as 'The Forest outside Normative space' where these men prepare for months, for their lives. And I see them! The Fae, they...

...they...

...are only here?

They used to roam the lands, the creatures? And now a place...a factory...that...

...

...oh no...

...Oh no...

...OH NO!!!!

It's all part of protocol! We must protect the public from what can't be explained by silence, to - to secure, cont -

I flashed my light, blinding him, and all around, and I flew, seeing the place I was held.

A nondescript facility, gray, with no windows.

I flew further, reaching The Forest where Names have Power. I looked around, and saw in their faces: recognition, and happiness. ""I am home,"" I said.

""Welcome back,"" replied one.

""I am home,"" I said. ""How is...everything?""

I nearly doubled in height, my muscles expanded until I looked like I could deadlift buses one handed, my flat human teeth fell out as sharp new teeth ripped through my tender gums.

“Just sit down here and someone should be coming soon to see you,” she said while gesturing towards a bland looking office chair in front of an even more bland looking table.

And she turned around with a smile and strode outside through the door again. Felix looked up to find the source of the flickering light and found the broken fluorescent tube in the ceiling. Not a surprise really, but looking at it at least took his mind off the blood. He could feel his hunger rising.  
A different door opened and a barely perceivable whisk of brisk air announced the arrival of the interviewer. He looked away from the flickering light and to his surprise a familiar face took place opposite of him across the table.

""I'm not sure, really. It was subtle. Perhaps Phthisis? Or maybe even Cronus?""


Zeus scoffed. ""Phthisis? Demon of decay? I doubt she would help anyone. And Cronus stays on the Elysian Islands. No, this is some human trick.""


I shrug diffidently. ""I'm the end, it matters not. I reached the acme of the mountain - and not only that, but I have rolled that stone here, to the peak of Mount Olympus! And with the help of Hades, no less.""


The gods gasped, then after a moment, began to chuckle. A joke! Sisyphus jests. Of course. Nothing more. Hades laughed, loudly. ""Help? After you tricked my wife? Who do you think cursed the stone to roll away, hmm?""


""Fine,"" I returned. ""If you don't believe me - here it is, the stone itself.""


I scuffed my foot on the smooth stone floor, and a small, flat disc slid a few inches forward. It teetered, but its flat slides could no longer roll. 


Zeus himself stood, walking to the stone and lifting it in his fingers. ""It... Feels like the same stone, but... I swear it was much, much larger than this pebble! What is this trickery?""


He crushed it to dust, staring down at me. I couldn't help but laugh, a giggle erupting from my mouth. Zeus snarled, but I held up a hand. ""All things decay. It is the nature of things since Pandora opened her jar. Rolling a stone will wear it away, eroding it bit by bit, until nothing remains. At the end, I slid it slowly up the hill, which caused it to flatten until there was nothing left to roll. And then I carried it to the top, where Hades found me. It was Hades who brought me here, and it was you, Zeus, who crushed the stone and freed me from my curse!""


I laughed triumphantly. ""Don't you see? I was right in believing that my cleverness surpasses even your own. I've outsmarted you, and earned my life back!""


Zeus dusted the last of the stone from his fingers. ""Hmm. You are right; you are clever. You've tricked Hades, even myself, and all of those present. Your plan to trick me into destroying the stone is beyond even your trick on Persephone, or Thanatos. Hmm. Good job.""


I grinned. I'd done it. It had taken... Well, a very long time. But I won. I won!


Zeus returned to his throne. He raised his hands for silence. ""Unfortunately... There was no agreement in place to grant you immortality upon the conclusion of your impossible task.""


He fixed me with a grin of his own, and I suddenly felt my heart sink. ""You may have the cleverness to trick gods, but you cannot dictate commands to us. But, I feel generous. Rather than destroy you outright, I will give you a chance, and this time, should you succeed, you may have your immortality, and return to the land of the living as well. But first, you must complete this task: you must wear the mountain flat. You will be given a new boulder each day, until you have worn the mountain as flat and smooth as this floor is now - but without the help of my father or anyone else. Decay will not help you, only your own cleverness.""


He leaned forward, and whispered so only my ears could hear, ""Clever your way out of that, Sisyphus, you little turd.""

""Repeat that?"" Zeus said. 

""Simple,"" the titan said. ""I hired a helicopter crew to airlift the boulder. Imagine my mirth it took them a few minutes to accomplish a task that has taken me millenia and failed.""

Zeus exchanged bewildered glances with Apollo.

"" What is a helicopter?"" Zeus said.

Now, it was the titan's turn to struggle. ""A human invention. Its...like...sort of like.... em....a flying chariot that doesn't need horses. And it can carry things. Like stones."" 

A murmur went through the assembled pantheon.

""It's clear you used the human's invention to circumvent your punishment."" Zeus said. ""But I suppose further punishment is no longer warranted. Therefore, we commute your punishment.""

Sweat poured off my face but I knew....

*I knew I had cracked it, this will work!*

The pain was intense, but I noticed I could relax a bit, just a bit, before I did it again, and the rock stayed put!

The rock was almost there, just needed to wait a bit.

My wedge needs to grow out, it'll only be a week or two,  thats nothing!  The wedge i just used sat there looking up at me, cracked, jagged, a bit bloody,  but it was there, helping  me out.

I looked downhill and saw the evidence of my long game, my plan.  After all, they said it was ME who needed to hold the blasted thing up.  There was ME scattered along the path, incremental spots of ME.

I looked down again and saw that the bleeding had stopped.  Good, thats going to heal up nicely.

And when Hades asks I can tell him, it was ME all along!  Well, a part of me anyway.  

The hardest part was learning how to jam my toe into the space at just the right angle.

""What is the meaning of this?"" exclaimed Hades ""How.. How did you reach the top? You must know I enchanted the boulder to never reach the summit""

""I will admit you had me stumped at first. Escaping death proved an easier endeavour than this. I fear if I tell you then I'll just be back to pushing this boulder again, no? Perhaps we could work out an agreement.."" Sisyphus said as he casually picked up another handful of pebbles.

""Yes yes, you play nice on your way to the afterlife and I end your punishment. Now tell me how.. How did you break my enchantment? It was made so no matter what you did you'd never be able to push it to the top.""

""Indeed, and true to your word it would never have left me *move it to the top*. However, when you have countless lifetimes you begin to notice a few things. Did you know that the enchantment only kicks in once you reach exactly 20 ft from the summit?""

""Hmm.. I do not remember specifying that exact amount, but this should not matter""

""And of course you know the enchantment only takes effect when something is exerting a force upon the boulder. No matter how securely you fasten a rope, no matter how sturdy a structure, it will find a way to roll back down the mountain. However, that enchantment will *only* take effect *when a force is exerted on it*.""

Hades frowned. ""I do not see your point yet..""

Sisyphus picked up a unique pebble that Hades had not noticed before, one of a brilliant deep green. He placed it near the top of the pile of pebbles that he'd been slowly building during their conversation.

""You would agree this rock is not at the summit of this glorious mountaintop, yes? However, what happens when I remove the topmost pebble from the pile? Is the green pebble not closer to the top than it was before?""

Hades froze, then his frown grew deeper as realization began to sink in.

""No force was applied to the pebble, and yet it is now closer to the top. What if I removed more?"" He began plucking pebbles from the pile until all those higher than the green pebble were gone.

Hades suddenly looked around noticing for the first time how unusually flat this mountaintop was. ""No, this is impossible, it would take you an eternity..""

""If I can't push the boulder to the top of the mountain, then I had to simply move the top of the mountain below the boulder. Yes, it would take an eternity, but an eternity is precisely what you gave me""",16,1750471783.0

Because of course they would make themselves comfortable atop the mountain in a private plane of existence.  How else would their grand halls remain hidden from mortal sight?

""Hello?  I, Sisyphus, have completed my task, at long last!""

Silence, utter silence answered me back.  I rested against the stone that had been my personal nemesis for an eternity, and the grating sounds of it against the divine marble floor was thunderous in this place.

""Seriously?  Nothing?  I knew you were petty, but this is absurd!""

I straightened up and storm deeper into Olympus, intent on finding anyone here.  Just beyond the atrium I saw the columns were host to lush vines, the ceiling crumbled about the floor, and the skeletal remains of someone half under the toppled structure.

""What...?""

Further searching only revealed more remains, all long deceased.  Even at the grand throne of Zeus, there was some skeleton sat there like a tasteless decoration, still clinging to an orichalcum javelin fashioned like a lightning bolt.  The brassy metal was flawless still.

""What is going on?""  I asked aloud.

*They're all...dead.  The gods of Olympus are dead.*  I thought to myself.

1lgi4lz,myx50mm,"An aroma of boiling broth, chicken, and an array of mixed vegetables permeated the small dwelling. On a bed laid a man whose sightliness justified the stew's preparation, while a woman could easily be mistaken for a hired cook—otherwise none would guess she wore his rusty ring. Ladling a heaping bowl of it, she carefully placed it on a beaten night-stool next to him, a journal on top of it—handwriting from her husband that she knew he'd never be able to read again.

""Smells...good,"" Ternl leaned forward and croaked out. Vema pressed a finger to his lips.

""Keep your energy until it cools. Once you eat, you'll be back in health,"" she said, readjusting the cloth around her mouth to give herself a false sense of vigor.  

Ternl made a shaky thumbs up and leaned back into his sweat drenched bed. 

While he rested, or rather laid in silence, Vema thought of all the things that made the ugly man attractive. It was his speechcraft that drew her in. It was the way he could write with such eloquence, handwriting a blessing for each page his pen stroke. She cast her eyes down, knowing that had she had not gotten that news twenty years ago, she would've turned her nose down at the portly man.

So, she spent the next moments reliving all the tales he crafted. The couple didn't have much, because exiled princesses must be reminded of their fall from grace, but she made sure her husband would always have the most appealing looking journals. It wasn't because he needed that beauty to compensate for his genetic shortcomings, but because a writer of his caliber deserved them.

""Here,"" she began, ""it's ready."" But as she went to spoon feed him, there wasn't a response. 

Vema glared at the bowl, threw it, then stormed out their small shack. Tears flowed in equal measure to her anger, ""Damnit! Damnit! Damnit! You got what you wanted! Are you happy now!"" All her cursing didn't make her feel any better, and she didn't quite know who would find pleasure in this tragedy. In the end, however, it wouldn't matter much.

The year is up. I wake that morning with dread in my heart, but a smile on my lips, for I will savor this day with my husband, come whatever may.
He doesn't take the day as anything special, even knowing what he does. ""The chores won't do themselves even should I die, so best do them.""
Such simple wisdom is part of why I live him. I help with the tasks I can and we talk while working. Before I know it, evening is upon us. We retire to bed early that night, but do not sleep for many hours.

The next day dawns and I awaken to find my husband missing. My heart clenches, and I rush to dress, running into the kitchen to find him serving a pot of steaming tea to a guest. A familiar guest - the very prophet that had doomed my first husband.

""You have questions."" She said, without turning around. ""I have answers. Come. Sit.""

So I did. We listened as the seer explained that the match my parents had chosen for me was a terrible man. He would have usurped the throne by killing my parents and stealing my freedom, and in turn died at the hand of my cousin exactly a year from the day we were wed.

John, however, was no mere placeholder. As my true love, he broke the fate of my intended first husband. Furthermore, because he had lived through my curse, the nobles would consider him more than worthy to be a Queen's Consort when the time came.

Irridia is inhabited by astounding creatures who are as magnificent as they are deadly. We do not exterminate them, though some do die in the occasional accident. No, when one of the local fauna breaches the barriers to keep them out of settlements, we do our best to see the beast is returned to the wilderness unharmed. I lead one of these containment teams.

Another day, another call. A Thanaticus, one of the apex predators of Irridia, has found its way into a residential zone. The risk to local inhabitants is minimal, lockdown is in effect. We are to go out, sedate it, and return it to the wild far from any of our settlements.

It is eerily quiet. No sound of people, just the breeze and rustling leaves. We keep our eyes peeled, Thanaticuses are ambush predators. If it gets the drop on us, it could get messy. Down streets we walk, hyper aware of everything around us.

Then we hear a voice. I signal my team to follow me towards the source. Louder and louder, until we get eyes on. The Thanaticus is there, towering over a human. We watch as the human touches it, cooing and showering the beast with praise, ""Good girl. You like scritches almost as much as my dog!""

I knew humans had a reputation for questionable judgment around dangerous fauna. Describing some of the most dangerous creatures in the galaxy as being 'friend shaped' and 'in need of pets.' I thought it was a stereotype, an exaggeration. But now I am confronted by incontrovertible evidence that it is true.

The Thanaticus casually flicks the gaze  of three of its eyes towards us. It does not regard us as a threat, and returns its focus to the human. The human turns to us, then says, ""Oh, good. You're here to take Darcy back where she belongs.""

I am perplexed, ""Darcy?""

The human gestures towards the Thanaticus, ""I thought she needed a name. Don't hurt her, she's a sweetheart.""

I open and close my eyes. This doesn't seem real. How can this be real? I'll have to think about it later. I pull out the sedative syringe, and inject its contents into the Thanaticus. In twenty seconds its hulking form lies on the ground unconscious.

I call in the extraction vehicle, then turn to the human, ""You do understand that what you were doing is incredibly dangerous, right?""

""It all worked out fine, didn't it? And I got to make a new friend!""

I want to speak, I want to impress on this human just how insane it is to walk close enough to a wild Thanaticus to pet it. But I don't think anything I could say would make them see it that way. I sigh, and turn my full attention to preparing the creature for transport.

I ride along as we fly deeper into the jungle, far from any inhabited place. We lower Darcy to the ground, inject the antidote to the sedative, and flee as quickly as possible.

""Oh my goodness it's adorable!"" I heard one of my crew mutter. How could they think this weird thing was cute? I twisted one of my eyestalks to look behind me and saw the human member of our team walking forward, eyes wide, mouthparts forming an upward curve.

""Jensen, What are you doing?"" I asked, greatly concerned. She had holstered her weapon and was continuing to advance on the creature.

""I haven't seen one of these since I was a little girl on Earth!"" She was slowly advancing, and positioning her body to be smaller. She held out a hand to the creature, allowing it to move it's  face to her hand and smell her. I raised my weapon, prepared to fire if the thing made any sudden movements. Jensen pulled out a small portion of her rations from a pouch on her belt and handed it to the creature with an open palm. The animal took it, and she began to stroke it, muttering something, though all I could make out was ""poor thing"" and ""good boy"". 

I was surprised by how similar it looked to Jensen, or at least how many features matched. Exposed ears (thankfully Jensen's were usually covered by a helmet or the head strands she called 'hair'), four limbs, pink tasting organ in the mouth, bilateral symmetry... It got me wondering, was this one invasive from Earth?

Jensen had carefully wrapped a length of cord around the creature's neck, and was now leading it back toward the team, the creature followed willingly, pink tasting organ hanging out of it's mouth.

And it was trained? She acted like people just kept these things as pets! Oh Idr, please let my transfer go through soon!

Before I could voice my objections, the thing began yelling. Short low sounds that seemed to come from the throat. Jensen looked down at the creature, visibly concerned. ""Why are you barking?"" She shifted her gaze to the floral wall, which was now starting to shake.

That was until I realized I was far from rich.



Noblemen, lawyers, and kings—they all had so much more. Colored gems that shone from all facets, scrolls of pristine parchment that could unwind to no end, leather grimoires, silver swords, and much, much more gold.



Compared to them, I might as well have been a poor man on a street.



Somehow, despite being so tiny, humans could earn so much more than I could only wish for. So I did what any other dragon would do. I turned into them.



It was hard learning their language, their way of life, the way they tied their boots, filled out their taxes, rent, housing. There were so many moving parts compared to just sleeping all day in a cave, waiting for adventurers to challenge you.



Suddenly, I had to be the one to challenge them.



Either way, time was on my side, and if I tried hard enough, I would be able to climb up the corporate ladder, soar through the rankings until I was making more than I ever did in that small cave.



That never happened. Instead, I found myself begging on the street. 



So I looked for other, more overlooked means.



Remember when I said I always wanted to kidnap a princess? Yeah, well, I just didn't think it would be like this.



And to my surprise, it worked. I had assembled the weakest of ragtag teams, yet it worked… for a moment.



By all means, it should have worked.



It would have worked. 



If only that princess weren't a bloody dragon in disguise.



Months of preparation were torn to shreds. She quite literally burned a hole through the hideout; hell, she burned the whole place down. I saw my men get scorched, crisped, and flung in the air and into her maw like fresh popcorn.



And then her husband came… on all fours…



I had to slap myself twice to realize this was not a dream.



""You were a dragon this entire time!?"" Her husband said in disbelief.



""You were a dragon this entire time!?"" His wife mirrored the same.



They both gritted their teeth and screamed slurs at each other, stomping what was left of my work and my men beneath their feet as the couple's quarrel escalated.



I gave up, letting myself go as I no longer felt the need to contain my body into a tiny human. I rose higher than both. My wings expanded, my neck grew, and I only asked one question as they both turned their wide gazes at me. ""Why did you both shapeshift?""

1lg34sq,myxcajz,"It was rare that I had the opportunity to resume my standard form these days. I’d taken a human disguise the first a few centuries ago, which was a relatively short time for a dragon, but the disguise was much like a formal suit. Some occasions simply called for wearing it and it was pleasant enough for a short while, but once the event was over it was convenient to swap back to my more comfortable attire.

I used to only wear the disguise for a day at a time returning to my lair after each day. The form required relatively little upkeep, and was convenient for earning riches rather than stealing them. Provided of course that the workers didn’t know their boss was a dragon. People always seemed to have a problem with that for some reason that was beyond my understanding. It was fine for a human to work them ragged, but even with generous pay, humans were much more likely to revolt against a dragon. So I wore my “suit” increasingly often. 

Somewhere along the way I’d had to change up some details, as it became increasingly difficult to explain my longevity, but this most recent change had been the hardest. This time when I tried to build a new persona, I needed a birth certificate that I didn’t have,  a social security number I was never given, and all sorts of other proof that had never been necessary the last time I’d done this.  Thankfully as with most things a person could need, there was a market for it, and with enough money, I’d been able to buy assistance in the process.

That’s where I met Scarlett. At first our meetings had been entirely business, but I had offered a much higher than market price payment for her service in building me a new fake identity. I had salvaged the situation by requesting tutelage on how to play the role requesting more of her time than what it took to simply forge papers. First we had our extended lessons then to my surprise she’d invited me to coffee at a shop that had recently changed ownership nearby where I had supposedly grown up. Claimed that it was a good way to give credence to the disguise, by being seen as a regular somewhere where the former owner was no longer around to dispute it. On one claw I knew she was interested in me for my apparent wealth, but on the other she seemed genuinely kind and helpful, and actually seemed to care. 

I’d never tried the romance thing in any of my prior disguises, I’d been to a brothel or seven back when they were more prevalent but that had been transactional, and short. This was the opposite, logic dictated that we should have separated as soon as our deal was done, but now we seemed to gravitate towards one another. 

It took us only two years to marry after that, and we’ve been married nearly 10 years now. In that time I’d grown to enjoy the quaintness of human life. Both of us were wealthy and given the nature of our meeting we both knew better than to ask the source of the other’s wealth. She was perhaps the perfect woman for me, since she could be close but never pried at for information on who or rather what I was beneath the suit. Just as I never asked about her customers or location when she’d need to step away for a job, only when she’d expected to be back. This time I was supposed to have an entire month,  longest  job she’d taken since she’d helped me out 

I always used the time to return to my old lair, drop my disguise and just enjoy being a dragon again. Albeit with a few more amenities than most. 
I might have had a few renovations done to my cave in one of my earlier lives as the owner of a construction firm. My workers had been paid triple their wages through that job and told the customer demanded absolute secrecy, never knowing I was both the boss and the customer. They’d figured it was quite obviously a dragons lair and requested even more for hazard pay. Still it had been worth it. The convenience of having an internet connection, electricity, and running water meant I could enjoy the perks of being in my dragon form while enjoying a hot bath and a watching a cheesy movie. 

My peaceful evening was interrupted by the a ringing sound from my laptop where I had it plugged into the large flat screen TV. Scarlett’s name appeared on the screen. I rushed to retake my human form and reach my computer. I tapped the answer button.

The bounce that answered was not Scarlett’s
“Good evening Mr Marigold,” the voice said.

I froze. Scarlett NEVER allowed anyone to use her phone or laptop, there was too much potentially incriminating evidence from even the simplest job to risk someone accessing something they shouldn’t.

“Who am I speaking to?” I asked trying to contain the already building anger.

“That’s not important. What is important is the condition of your wife. She is currently in our custody, and in case you were worried she’s still breathing. If you would like her to remain that way, you will transfer 10 million dollars into our accounts using the instructions I am sending you now.”

A zipped file appeared in the chat window. 

“You will receive further instructions once we have confirmed the transfer. We should not need to deliver this threat, but allow me to make it very clear that if you go to the police not only will your wife die, but we will release everything she has on you. Goodbye Mr. Sterling.”

The switch of names was all I needed to know the man was not bluffing.

“Wait!” I called just before he ended the call, “What if I don’t have 10 million liquid right now, how long do I have?”

The man paused as if he hadn’t even considered this a possibility. I saw the call mute for a moment the man apparently had to discuss the issue.

“We are aware of the significant breadth of your means. You have until midnight to deliver 2.5 million dollars into the account. You will continue to provide us 2.5 million dollars for the next 4 days  the last of which you can consider a convenience fee. Goodbye Mr. Marigold. Do not keep us waiting.”

The call ended immediately thereafter.

“Shit, shit, shit.” I had the money, that wasn’t the problem, the problem was I had 0 confidence that the bastards who took her had any intention of letting live.",16,1750474378.0
1lg34sq,myxcg8r,"I looked at the time 9 PM , I still had 3 hours to make the initial transfer.

I grabbed my phone from the human clothes I’d set aside and began to dial a number. 

A man in his early 30’s answered the phone with an annoyed tone.

“I don’t care what kind of warranty you’re selling if you don’t delete this number I’m going to… “

“Eric its me Mr. Sterling.” I said 

“Micheal? What the hell man, you sold the company and just left. I thought you were dead, the whole office assumed you’d just gone off to try and finish your bucket list or something.”

“Something like that, look, I am still alive but I need your help. I know you don’t work for me anymore but I need your other skills.”

“What skills”, he said clearly trying to avoid the topic.

“I know you got busted as for hacking into privileged systems , it’s the reason I hired you to the security team in the first place. I need you to track a wire for me.”

“Shit man, that’s not as easy as you think. What happened.”

“The less you know the better,” I said, “can you trace it or not.”

“No, wire transfers don’t include any useful location information.  I need something actually on their device. What about a phone number?” 

“Do you know what brand is it?”

“Does it matter?”

“Some phones can be tracked with an online service in case you lose it. It can be remotely activated ”

It didn’t take long after that for Eric to enable tracking on my wife’s phone and for me to disable it on mine. 

“According to their phone they’re somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.”

“Could it be a VPN?” I asked throwing a term I’d heard her use before to disguise her location.

“No this pulls gps coordinates, it could be spoofed but if I had to guess it wouldn’t be since the service settings were all default.”

“So she’s in the pacific, can you get me a map.” I asked.

“Her phones somewhere in the pacific, but it’s not moving so she’s not on a plane,” he said hesitantly, “Sir, are you planning to go after her.”

“She’s my wife, and she’s in trouble, I need to help her,” I said realizing my angered and bewildered voice was betraying a worse intention.

He seemed to hesitate for a long time, time I couldn’t waste.

“Eric please, I need to find her.” I said.

Finally he agreed sending me an image a few moments later marking my target.

“Thanks Eric, you’re a life saver.”

I followed the instructions on the computer sending the first quarter million before  returning to my draconic form and launching myself out of my cave.

As a dragon I was a several ton monster of muscle and power compacted into a sleek flying form. My Silver scales glinted with the ambient light of the surroundings significantly more so with the city scapes I’d passed over. 

It had been decades since I’d allowed myself to fly over a city, but today stealth was not a concern. Everyone knew dragons existed, most suspected that they walked among them, but none were stupid enough to flaunt that fact in urban areas.  I did not care, moving in a straight line across the country towards my target.",14,1750474441.0
1lg34sq,myxclpg,"It was bright again by the time I found it, my tiny cell phone was nearly dead from keeping the map app open throughout the journey. Just a line further and…

I felt a presence. A scent that I could not mistake. Another dragon was nearby. My stomach turned as I realized there was more to this plot than I’d imagined. Another dragon had targeted her because of me. They knew what I was. They knew and they were going to kill her for it.

I forgot about the phone, following the scent alone to the lair. The lair in question was positioned in a large rocky outcropping a dark volcanic spire reaching up from the ocean floor with plenty of spikes about it threatening to rip apart any ship that dared to get too close.

I moved toward it painfully aware that my scent must be apparent to them too. It did not take long to spot the entrance.

I rushed into the volcanic lair landing on the rocky ground and forcing my way into the cave.

What I found terrified me, there was a chair fit for a human, with a cell phone I recognized smashed on the ground beside it, but no Scarlett.

Just as I was about to bellow my rage a strong force hit me from above as another form landed upon me. Claws tore in to my back attempting to tear the tendons of my wings but I threw the weight aside. Hearing a large thud as the other dragon slammed against the wall.

I looked over to it, seeing the vibrant red scales that coated its form as both of us attempted to recover. Silver drakes and red drakes had been enemies since the dawn of dragons. Any time they’d met it was guaranteed that only one of the two would leave the battlefield alive, if even that.

I growled my rage but she vocalized her.
“Get out of my home!” The she drake snarled pouncing at me and forcing me backward into a section with a lower roof where a sharp stalactite scraped against my back. 
I waited for her next charge ignoring the pain as I ducked slammed my head upward driving a horn into the soft spot where her arm and front leg met. I received a blast of fire as payment as she unleashed the flames upon me.

The flames caused a searing pain through my body forcing me to retreat, I allowed her to take a bite at my tree ail as I turned, bracing myself for pain as I waited for her to take the bait. As soon as she chomped I slammed downward forcing her jaw into the stony floor hard enough to crack it. That bought me the time I needed, diving out of the entrance into the water I extinguished the fire before it melted the skin beneath my scales. She followed soon after, giving me my first look at her properly. Her stomach bulged outward and sagged suggesting a recent large meal.

She spat another fiery breath but this time I was in position to return with a frosty spray on icy mist . The two breath weapons collide. The collision immediately turned to steam then fog as visibility quickly 

“YOU ATE MY SCARLETT!” I roared as I moved through the steam tackling her off the side of her rocky lair’s entrance.

The two of us toppled down the rocks scorching each of us some additional cuts and bruises before finally slamming into the water surface together.

“Wait I-“

I didn’t let her finish, she’d foolishly wasted her air and I was going to punish her for it. I pushed down taking us further under the water, using my more powerful tail to hold us beneath the waves.

I saw it there the fear in her eyes , the realization that she’d fucked up in a big way by eating the only person I’d ever loved in this world. A rapid shooting pain suddenly spread throughout as she first bit into my arm and then used the momentary distraction to free a leg and bludgeon me directly in the groin. I did not have the external weakness of human men in this form, but when faced against another dragon’s strength the area was still more sensitive than most. She immediately swam to the surface. Forcing me to follow suit.

“Stop,” she screamed as I burst through the watery surface.

“You killed my wife!” I exclaimed 

“I am your wife,” she yelled back.

The fog had begun to dissipate allowing me to see her vaguely.

I stopped, trying to contest the obvious trickery but I could feel the truth of it.

The fight left me quickly after that a mixture of love and hatred for the dragon in front of me. Apparently she felt the same way, looking over my silver scales with disgust.


I was the one to finally break the silence.
“Why?” I asked.

It was not why she’d hidden this from me, no we’d been to comfortable in each others secrets for that. 

“Why’d you leave?” I said finishing the question.

She looked down, placing a hand on her stomach. Where the visible bulge rested.

“I’m going to lay my eggs tomorrow,” She said, “I couldn’t maintain my disguise while giving them a chance to develop properly and I wanted to raise them better than I had been. I wasn’t going to just go to my husband of 10 years explain I was a dragon and ask him to throw away the rest of his life span raising half dragons.”

“So you thought threatening yourself for 10 million was the obvious choice,” I commented

“I knew you could afford it, and I needed the money. I was going to buy land I could use to raise our half dragon kids, until I could teach them to hide.”


I rested a scaly hand onto the lump where the eggs were forming and preparing to push free. 

“Except they aren’t half dragons, they’re half silver and half red.” Surmised.

“I’ll take care of them,” she said, “you can go back to your life, and you can forget we ever met. No other silver needs to know you fathered hybrids.”

“And leave you raise them on your own? Not a chance. Your scales may be terrible, but I’m not dumb enough to break off something like we had over done a dumb feud.” I said.

“And even though you’re as shiny as a disco ball you at least have a decent head on your shoulders.” She jested in return.

1lfxw0b,mysbica,"""You know what? This the... Tenth time? Yep. The tenth time.""


""Tenth time? For what?""


Her cup on the table steamed as she stared it down.



""Every time I get a girlfriend. They go home for Christmas, meet somebody they haven't seen in years."" He outlined casually.



""Christian is just a friend."" She denied.



""Yeah, yeah, everybody's just your friend. Lemme guess. You got overwhelmed. Ate a few meals together. Hes great, right? Now you're coming back to break up with me."" He understood. ""Right?""


""Ummmm...""


She sat back. Dark hair falling out of her hat a little.



""Yep. Never fails."" He smiled. ""I have some massive deal to handle on the holidays. I can't go. Or I'll get fired or whatever.""


""It's okay. I know you really need the job."" She suggested in disappointment.



""I know."" He agreed. ""But for whatever reason. Whichever one of y'all I wind up dating-""


""Wait, who is *y'all*?! Are you cheating on me?"" Her voice raised.


Huh. They usually get mad. Or make fun of it. This was new.



""Can I finish?? Please??"" He asked her firmly.



""Are you?"" She snapped.



""No. I got dumped last year on Christmas, by my last girlfriend. And the year before that. And the year before that.""


""Maybe it's you.""


""Maybe, but ten years in a row?"" He asked. It was like being stuck in a shitty romcom.



She tensed up. ""I'm your *TENTH* girlfriend?!""



""We're adults! Do I ask you how many guys you've dated before you got to me?!""


A few people glanced over. They were making a scene. Of course they were. It always went like that.



""I think, I think we should see-""


""Other people?"" He finished for her.



""Yeah.""


""That's cool. Go right ahead. I'm done. You're moving back home. Aren't you?""


The look was one of both sadness. And concern. Because he wasn't chasing her. He'd learned that the hard way. He wasn't about to be some stalker or washed up ex.



""Yeah?""


""Never fails.""


They both sat there for a bit longer. Snowflakes bouncing off the fogged windows facing the storm outside.



""I still love you."" She admitted.



""I *loved you* too. You're leaving."" He assumed rightly. ""It's okay. I'm not mad. I get it.""


""You seem kind of mad.""


""Who wouldn't be? If I went home for Christmas and found another woman, then came back to break up with you. Wouldn't you be mad?""


""You're such a dick.""


""I guess that's why I keep dating assholes then."" He laughed.



He watched her storm off. Her plate still steaming. He shouldn't have said that. But, after the tenth time of throwing on some cheap Christmas sweater to go to a diner or something and get crushed?


Or knocked out? Or being embarrassed?



Not having it. Not this time.


It dawned on him, that somebody was watching him. Their waitress wandered over carefully as he went back to working on his eggs. They were getting cold now.


""Hey."" She started in.


""Hi.""


""Is the food okay?""


""Oh yeah."" He glanced up. She was his type. Again.


""I hope I didn't interrupt anything."" She said, brushing some blonde hair out of her eyes.



""You didn't. It's cool.""


""Is there anything else I can get for you?""


The idea of an eleventh go around just made his stomach ball up. He reached for his wallet.



""No. I'm good."" He denied. ""Here, can I get my check?""


""...Sure thing."" She deflated slightly.


He slid two twenties up to her hands. ""It's not you. It's me."" He fanned a third one for 60 dollars, and placed it under her hand gently.



He stood up and palmed his plate as he walked towards the door. ""Keep the change, okay?""


She stood there for a moment. ""Wait! You can't take the plate with you!!""


""That's why I gave you a big tip! Bye!!""


To hell with the holidays. He plotted his first New Year's Eve alone. The vacation he always wanted. Somewhere warm this time. Miami sounded like a great choice.

1lfxw0b,myucwdx,"“He isn’t supposed to remember any other Christmas”

The voice was faint; right on the edge of hearing.

Annabelle was staring at him, silent. She seemed uneasy, as if I wasn’t reacting how she expected.

She repeated her last line; “It’s not you, it’s me. I don’t think we are comparable.”

The voice sounded irate, “She’s messing it up. It’s ‘compatible’, not ‘comparable’. How did this moron pass the basic literacy test? Call Steve. Tell him his fee is at risk.”

It still sounded a long way away, like a radio in a distant room, but clear as a bell.

Annabelle bit her thumb nervously, “Aren’t you going to tell me how you just got the project backers interested?”

“She’s breaking the script entirely now! That doesn’t happen for three minutes. Get production on the phone. Season reset is going wrong.”

Another voice, a bit more calm, came smoothly into my straining ears, “He hasn’t said anything since the outburst.”

“He knows it’s ten. How could he know that? We wipe his memory.”

“Dave, is that light supposed to be on?”

“Oh cra..”

Silence. 

Just Annabelle’s big, sad eyes looking at me. Begging me to say something. The subtle background noises in the snowy park coming back with a little rush of something undefinable, like a memory of a dream.

“Why does it keep happening, Belle? I know you know.”

Her face crumples into a mix of tearful agony, and she wails. Actual wails; not the ladylike tears that have dripped down her cheeks in recent months.

“It’s all going wrong! You’re not supposed to remember anyone else! I’m your childhood sweetheart! Me! Me! Me!”

She actually stamped her foot. I thought they only did that in those ridiculous novels they are printing these days.

“I paid good money for this, and you’re ruining it!”

Something was happening on the outskirts of the park. A blue haze, a grid of some kind, like a child’s drawing in the air. It was uncanny and eldritch. It brought a dark fear into my soul.

She had pulled a strange rectangular device from her purse, and was holding it in front of her like some magic talisman. 

I recoiled as it glowed, and the same voice I had heard earlier, but fainter and tinnier, squeaked from it in a harsh staccato.

I couldn’t make out the words, but my beautiful Bella, changed so much in character, changed her face right in front of me.

Quite literally.

The long, pale face grew rounder and darker, the nose wider and longer, and lines appeared where no lines belonged on an adult human female. The lifeless grey hue of her face repulsed me, and I snatched up my walking stick from where it had fallen and ran for my life.

It was twenty minutes before I stopped, my breath and thoughts uneven, my heart still racing. This was an otherworldly thing. A terrifying mystery most intriguing. But no amount of running would give me answers.

My previous thoughts of wealth and power among men seemed childish and worthless now, for this could be something much more lucrative; much more empowering.

I will get to the bottom of this, or my name’s not Ebeneezer Scrooge.",97,1750439249.0
1lfxw0b,myus37z,"The snow gently fell from the starry night sky, we both sat together on the old park
bench, where we’ve sat many times before. I looked over at her, bundled up in her winter coat,
scarf, gloves and beanie. I bought her the outfit not two months before while we were planning
this trip. She wanted to visit her family, her sister recently had a baby and she wanted to see her
niece. However, she loved cold weather about as much as a cold-blooded animal. So I decided to
take her out on a shopping trip, told her it was an early Christmas present. The way she lit up, the
joy on her face, the excitement of being able to pick whatever she wanted, it brought me enough
happiness that the cost didn’t matter. Her smile was something I’d pay any cost to see.

I looked down at my watch, 8:57pm, December 24th. In about three minutes I’d hear
words that would shatter my life. She reached up her gloved hand to the sky and let the flakes
collect in her hand. She mouthed words I’d later come to learn were, “leave him, leave him not,
leave him, leave him not.” She had been conflicted since the trip had started, my work had been
very busy, and I’d been taking calls the entire trip. There was a big project in the works,
something that’d set us up for life, technology that would change the world. We could live the
fairy tale life we dreamed of ever since high school. Trips across the world, see any and every
sight we wanted, take our time and experience a life free from worry. But every time I took those
calls, the look on her face was painful. It began as if she was coming to a realization, then it
shifted to a quiet denial.

Right as my watched hand struck 9:00pm, the snow stopped falling. She turned to me,
grabbed my hand, and looked me in the eyes, “I think we should break up.”
Pain. A stabbing pain pierced my heart, no matter how many times I’ve experienced it, it
found a new way to break my soul. Our relationship, the life we planned, built upon years of trust, struggle, determination, was broken by six words. We sat in silence for a long time, I did
my best to choke the tears but they still fell down my cheek.

“Why,” I asked, I tried to keep my voice even but it was impossible, “why do you want
us to end?”

“We’re going down different paths,” she said, letting go of my hand and looking to the
sky “you’re doing amazing things, your project will help change the world. You need someone
by your side that can support you, be there for you. Someone who can compliment you, help you
become the person I know you can be. But I don’t think I can be that person.”

 “I’m just a simple girl, someone who wants to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy a nice
quiet life. I’d like to make coffee in the morning and watch the sun crest over the mountains in
my little cottage, and look forward to my simple, boring day.”

“I can drop the project,” I said, my fists tightened. “You are the most important thing in
my life. If you want a simple morning with a coffee, then that is what I’ll give you. You are my
reason and hope, the person I picture when I see a better tomorrow. Your kindness is what gives
me breath, what drives me to become a better person. I don’t care what I have to do, so long as I
can keep you in my life, because without you I am nothing.”

She leaned her head into my shoulder and let out a long sigh, “I cannot tell you how much I wish I could be selfish right now. I want nothing more than to take you away to that mountain cottage and live that life. But I can’t do that, your talents are meant to be shared with the world. You are destined for a life in the spotlight. A life of fame, where you become the person who changed the world with his wondrous inventions. I want to keep you to myself, to keep you hidden away so that I am the only one who knows how special you are. But the world needs you more.”

She sat up, brushed the snow off of her coat, leaned in, and gave me a final kiss. She lingered for a moment, her eyes filled with sadness for what could’ve been. The snow began to pick up again and so she walked away. Fading into the snow, leaving me by myself on the park bench. I
looked down at my watch, 9:05pm. I gripped it with my fingers, all I’d need to do is twist. Just
that simple motion and I could see her again. A simple twist and I could turn back the clock, try a
new angle. Find some other words I could say, something I could give her, anything to keep us
together. I’d tried yelling, begging, pleading, making us not go on this trip. I’ve spent a decade of time trying everything I could to keep this relationship alive. But no matter what I tried, nothing worked. I’d even offered up my project, the thing I had been building towards my whole life, but even that wasn’t enough.

It felt as if I was pulling my own heart out of my chest, but I moved my hand away from
the watch. I slouched back against the park bench and looked towards the sky. Maybe she was
right, we were going down different paths and I just needed to accept it. Our lives had been
forever changed by each other for better and for worse. But it was time for a new chapter to
begin. I slowly stood up from that park bench and left, leaving behind what we had been to begin
a new life.",33,1750443554.0

As I step out of the diner, my despondent look slowly gives way to a warm smile.  My shoulders rise.  I lift my head, letting out a puff of steam into the cold winter’s air.  Man, I love winter…

“Y’know baby-face, some people might call this intruding on another’s guy’s turf.”

I whirl at the voice to see an old man in plaid, his flabby arms crossed over his chest, and despite the words, a warm smile gracing his rosy cheeks. 

I raise my hands, the wind disturbing a perfect curl of hair over my forehead.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about, old man.  You have your ways of getting ready for your time of year, I have mine.”

“Still, do you have to do it so close to my time?  You don’t see me spreading tinsel over people’s Valentines.”

1lfxw0b,myw9uzj,"She stood across from me, her gaze much the same as all the rest; never on the eyes, downcast to the side. It was a gaze of reservation, distant thoughts, and muddied nostalgia. The warm palid colors of the house felt much like a distant dream, a memory built upon all the pictures surrounding us.

The first one had hurt the worst. We'd fallen in love during college, and life had been great. Somehow, I had landed the job I always dreamed of, and showered her with every luxury I could. She'd gotten a job of her own, every bit as ambitious as I was, and we took as much time off as we could, venturing the world together as we had always talked of.

Then, Christmas. I had gotten a call about a crucial deal that needed to be closed, and couldn't afford to take her time off. She wanted to spend that year with  her family, and we agreed to make up for lost time after the holiday. When she was gone, I had bought the ring, expectant to propose. Instead, I met Jared. She never even said goodbye.

Once was a heartbreaking coincidence. The sort of thing that burrows into your soul, sure; but still just a coincidence.

After a few years, I'd moved on,  and decided to try again. I gave the ring to my brother, he got engaged with a woman he'd loved since middle school. That's when I met her. Her name was Kim, and our love was fast; my mother described it as ""dangerous for the purse"". But I didn't care, I gave everything I could, showed as much love as I was able.

And then Christmas came. A horrid sense of deja vu pervaded, as my boss described a contract that my skills were needed for. She even said that Christmas wasn't that important to her, and she'd love to stay with me. Then her parents called, and my worry, admittedly irrational for the time, deepened.

It hardly took a week. I cried the most ugly tears I had in what felt like a decade, and got drunk enough on the day of the deal that I blacked out over the call. That, and many other circumstances thereafter, cost me my job.

The year after, after somehow squeezing my way into a new, arguably better position, I went home for Christmas. It's a sleepy sort of town in the middle of Nebraska, where the snow gets rather heavy, and the lumberjacks never seem to rest. I met a girl there, and for just a moment, my heart thawed. God, I wish it hadn't.

She had blonde hair, cut short, and piercing blue eyes. With a quick wit and ambition that excelled far beyond my own, it wasn't particularly surprising that I would fall in love.

Our year spent together made me forget why I'd ever been hesitant to love. We traveled as much as we were able, and for brief moments I could imagine a day whereupon I'd slip a ring on her finger.

It was a day in October, as we sat cuddled on the couch, watching some movie or another, that she dropped a bombshell, ""So, Christmas is coming up,"" She said in a raspy whisper.

My heart stilled at the mention.of the holiday, but I didn't let it show as I said, ""Yeah?""

""My family is... pretty traditional. They make a big show of it and everything. Kinda, surprising, I know, but...""

I could hear my blood start to pump through my ears as I hesitantly replied, ""You'll be going home for the holidays?""

""Yeah,"" She said with a grin, ""You wanna come with?""

At the Exact moment that she posed the question, my phone started ringing. My hands shook slightly as I answered it. Sure enough, it was my boss. According to her, a client with really important backing would need help around the Christmas Holidays, and it was urgent enough that they'd booked three months in advance.

I wasn't surprised when it turned out her hometown was not my own. I also wasn't surprised to learn that she'd met an old flame named James. At that moment, I vowed to never again fall in love.

My vow lasted three years, and in those years, I grew to quite prominent success. During an annual Christmas Party, I met a woman named Alice. She was a fierce redhead with a roaring flame beneath her eyes. I tried, as best as one might, but before I knew what was happening, I found her in one if my old sweatshirts.

""You really used to wear this?""

""Can a guy not like sports?"" I asked rhetorically.

She rolled her eyes, ""Well sure, but this would look like a cosplay on you, ""

I chuckled, and despite everything, knew I loved her.",15,1750460252.0

I fidget with the ring in my pocket.  
""I worked for us, and never expected a thing in return...what transactional?

She falls quiet.  
""Look...Matt,  you are a good guy, but you can't give me what I need."" she says.  
I almost snap, but keep it together.

  
""So, a man whom you haven't seen for 15 years, and spent like 9 days with...can?  
You do realize that it's been just 9 days since you returned, and on day 7 you called me to break up, right?"" I ask her.  
""I don't love you anymore...maybe haven't loved you for a while now..."" she mutters.  
Before I could say something, the ""other one"" comes, and hugs her.  
""I think that is enough."" he says.  
I stare at the two, and at her family looking at us.  
Her sister is looking at me apologetically.

I wasn't going to let it go so easily. ""Why? Every single girlfriend I've ever had dumps me on Christmas Eve. Did you meet someone else?""

I heard the sound of something slamming down onto the counter. ""No, you idiot, it's BECAUSE you didn't come over for Christmas! Think about it - every girlfriend you ever had dumped you on Christmas Eve! Because you were busy at work and they wanted you there with them! Like I did!""  I heard her sobbing over the phone. ""Screw the stupid job, you moron, all I wanted was for you to meet my family so we could be together for the holidays. But no, your stupid project was more important than me. Well, fine, I can take a hint. I hope you two are very happy together."" She hung up.

It started 10 years ago, when I was just 23, with Dani. I had a project at work that could lead to a promotion come the new year, one that could allow me to leave my parent's place and get a nice apartment with Dani. She went home to Tennessee for Christmas, and stayed there. A week later, she updated her profile photo to one of her with a smiling farmhand. I got the promotion, and settled on a cozy studio. 

The next year things were really going well with Emily, until I had to turn down her invite to go to New Hampshire with her for Christmas- I had a deadline of the 24th, and promised to come after, but got a text saying she reconnected with a high-school flame, and not to come. I used my holiday bonus to go skiing with my little sister. 

The year after that, Becca went home for Hanukkah while I was snowed in at an airport on the way back from a work trip that created hundreds of jobs- when I did get back, it was to find my girlfriend decided to give up her job in the city and work at the family restaurant instead. I adopted a cat, and pondered being single. 

Then Marisol, a co-worker who I had a fling with, decided to leave our very lucrative job to become a snow sculptor. In Florida. She fell in love with an ice deliveryman.  The bonus we were going to use to travel to Italy instead paid off the last of my student loans and contribute to a scholarship so others could avoid them. 

I would have loved to gone to Michigan with Thea for the holidays, but my buddy Joe was having some scary health problems. He didn't like asking for help, so I secretly arranged a holiday fundraiser which unfortunately meant I couldn't go to the little town on Lake Michigan. Thankfully, the fundraiser was a success, and Joe survived. My relationship did not. 

The next year, as my side hustle was turning into a legit business that I could actually live off of, my girlfriend Nina asked me to come to Oklahoma with her. 2 weeks after Christmas, because that's when her family could get together. It was the day I was presenting to investors. It had been on my calendar for months. Nina straight up ghosted me, but the investment was secured, and I was able to commit to my dream career. 

The next year I was hosting my own family at my recently purchased house, something I'd put a lot of care into. Of course I invited Vanessa too, but she wanted to go back to the UK, where she was swept off her feet by a literal lord. My house is nice, but it's not Downton Abbey. I had a great time delivering Christmas cookies to my new neighbors though. 

My business incredibly successful the next year, and I was hosting a company holiday event while Jess went back to help at her parent's beach resort, saved a sea turtle, and decided a life of solitude was better than our cozy pizza and a movie nights. The holiday party allowed me to donate enough toys that every kid at the local Boys and Girls club got a gift. 

Last year I thought I'd finally make it through the holiday season, relationship intact. Hailey had grown up just 10 minutes away, and we were going to do Christmas Eve with my family, Christmas day with hers. That is, until my old high-school basketball team beat her old high-school during the holiday classic on the 23rd. She'd gone to the game while I wrapped up a project so an employee of mine, a single mom, could go to her son's Christmas pagent. I got a text from Hailey with the final score saying ""rethinking tomorrow"" and then nothing. I think she blocked my number. Then my sister reported seeing her on the arm of the basketball coach. So, that happened. 

Now I'm with Bree. Or was. She left for Ohio a few days early and now, just as I was driving to the airport on Christmas Eve day to join her I got a text saying ""Going to open a bakery in Ohio! Can you go send me that apron I left at your place?"" 

I was pondering that text the entire flight to Cincinnati. And while waiting in the car rental line. And in the two hour drive to Bree's hometown. I had her address in my GPS, and as I pulled up to the single family home in a quiet neighborhood my phone chimed that I had arrived. 

There were lights on, and the faint sound of carols coming from the house. I walked up the snowy steps and rang the bell.",8,1750469824.0
1lfxw0b,mywn9nk,"The air in the diner is tense. Gwen had returned from a visit with the family, and we were catching up. Two plates, each bearing cheese sandwiches sit unattended between us, growing cold.

“Things have been, well, awkward between us recently.”

I sat there, staring at her. She was everything I had ever hoped for, everything I had ever wanted in a woman. 

“You’ve just been so distant lately, always working, always busy.”

I did this for you, why don’t you see that? This project they’ve stuck me with - it will be revolutionary. We’ll be set for life when all this is over. Why don’t you understand that?

“I know it’s been years since I last saw Greg, but when we met, it was like no time had passed at all.”

These last few months have been the best of my entire life. I had been thinking about proposing soon, after the holidays were over and things had a chance to calm down. And now? It’s all falling apart. 

“Words can’t do it justice; it was like magic.”

I tried to be the best boyfriend I can, and she still decided to dump me, on Christmas Eve no less! How could this happen again? …Wait, what?

“I haven’t felt like that in so long. And sure, we would have a way more modest life, but I’m okay with that.”

Something’s wrong, something is very wrong. This - this happened before. This conversation has happened before. The exact words changed, the person saying them changed, but at its core, it’s the same conversation, over and over again. 

“Adam, please understand. I love you-”

“But you’re not IN love with me,” I finished for her. That’s what they say, every time. I don’t understand what’s going on; it’s like there’s a bank of fog surrounding my brain, but the more worked up I get, the clearer things become.",10,1750464936.0
1lfxw0b,mywsfra,"“Have you ever considered that you might be the problem?”

I stared at her in disbelief. I was so close to making the biggest deal of my life. I was set to make millions of dollars. Millions. I was considered handsome (and I KNEW for a fact that I was. Not trying to brag or anything, but I was considered for modelling. Eat your heart out Adonis. Or something like that, I don’t know.) What could be wrong with me?

“Every big event, every single holiday, every little thing that matters is just forgotten and ignored, like it’s not even worth remembering.” She continued and she stood a little taller, like she had just thrown a weight off her shoulders. “New Years Eve, Easter, Valentines Day, my birthday, Thanksgiving, Graduation, my f@£#ing mother’s funeral, it doesn’t matter, you’re never there!”

I stood there, dumbstruck. She was ending our relationship over this? Over ignoring stupid, pointless celebrations that nobody cared about? And it wasn’t like me being at the funeral made any difference. Not with all the money I had coming in. 

Besides, her mother was already dying. It wasn’t like it was unexpected. 

“But the money-“

“F@#k the money!” she shouted, tears running down her cheeks. “F#@k the money! It’s always about the f@#%ing money! Do you know how I spent my birthday?”

I didn’t really know, but it’s not like it mattered. I was in the middle of something that was going to make me millions. 

“I spent it at home waiting for you to come and take me out to that special day for me. You know, the one that you PROMISED! The one that you said would be perfect. The one that I missed celebrating with my friends because you PROMISED to do something special.”

I don’t know what her problem was. Friends are overrated and I don’t like her friends anyway. It was why I offered in the first place. And I did text her to cancel. At half past two in the morning after. It’s not like I didn’t say anything. 

“Babe, I don’t think you understand. I am on the verge of making millions. Set us up for life. Don’t you understand? I do this for us.”

“You already have more money than some countries. You have been set for life for years,” she snapped back. “Years. But it’s never enough. It will never be enough. It always has been just another million dollars and you’re done. But you’re not. You’re not. You never are. You always have to have more, like you could lose it all tomorrow if you stop hustling for a moment.” 

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. Lose it all? I had seen my father lose it all. I had seen how he had just blown through his money like it was nothing. I had seen how my mother had thrown parties so extravagant that they became the stuff of legend, even as our finances were collapsing. 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” I snapped back. “You know full well that it’s not enough. Not yet. But once I finish this project-“

“You’ll move on to something new to make more money,” she said with a resigned sigh. She looked at me, a strand curly red hair falling over her eye. You need help. Professional help. Help I can’t give you.” 

“Well I’m sorry that I don’t take you on extravagant dates to rival kings,” I said and she rolled her eyes.

“I don’t need fancy dates,” she said, shaking her head in exasperation. “I don’t want you to pay for fancy holidays. I don’t even want you to pay off my student loans. I just want you to make the effort. To actually be there when I need you. To keep your promises.”

I don’t know why she’s so upset about that last part. I’ve had good reasons for breaking those promises. She should understand that I had to make that money. Time was money that I couldn’t afford to lose. I thought she knew that. She was an engineer, the first person in her family to go to college, a woman who wanted to change the world. I thought a driven woman like her would understand. 

“But you don’t make the effort. You only bother if you’re not about to make more money. That’s not how relationships work. That’s not how good relationships work.” She paused and took a deep breath. “I’ve been telling myself for months that it’s okay. That the good times outweigh the bad. That you’re doing it for us, for our future, for our future children. That you love me and that one day you will show me how much I matter to you. I’ve been waiting and making excuses and I’m just tired of all the bullsh#%.”

“I do love you!” I protest and I point to the intricate gold and silver necklace on her neck. “I brought you that necklace, didn’t I?” 

For a moment, it looked like she was reconsidering her decision. Then she unclasped the necklace and handed it to me. She held my hand and looked me in the eye, her expression solemn. 

“You don’t understand. I’m not sure that you’ll ever understand. It’s not about the material things.” She shook her head sadly. “You can’t buy love. You can’t buy happiness. I saw my parents treating one another with love and respect and kindness. My best friend in high school is getting married to the love of his life and he’s genuinely happy.”

“He?” I asked and my ex frowned slightly. 

“Yes, Nick. He was my best friend in high school. He-“

“I get it,” I said cutting her off. “You’ve realised that you’re in love with him and now you’re off to win his heart.”

“For your information, Nick is gay,” she said with some annoyance. “And I’ve known that since we were both thirteen and he came out to me.” I opened my mouth to say something, only for her to cut me off with a wave. 

“I saw how him and his boyfriend treat one another. I’ve seen how people treat people that they love. I’ve seen what a healthy relationship looks like and…” She shrugged. “This isn’t it.”

“That’s ridiculous!” I protested. “There are women who would love to be in your shoes.” 

I wanted her to be hurt, but instead she just looked sadly at me and shook her head. 

“You should have picked one of those ones instead,” she said, before turning and walking away. 

For a few seconds I stood there, her words playing through my head. She was talking nonsense of course, but still…

That year with Alice was far more cozy than I expected. We spent many late nights ordering pizza or take out Chinese, watching trashy romcons and jibing at the characters on screen. As the year progressed, however, I felt myself grow more and more cold. By the end of September I had the shakes, and couldn't possibly tell her what was wrong. And so I waited, and sure enough, the call came.

I stood at the counter in the dining room, the day after Christmas, staring at my phone. My body was shaking as I waited patiently for it to happen. Just as I'd dared to relax, a knock came at the door, causing me to bodily jump.

Each step felt like the end, as I pulled open the door. Alice stood there, before she walked in. She was stiff, and wouldn't deign to look me in the eye. I felt myself shatter as she walked around the counter.

""What is his name?"" I demanded, a hard Rage gurgling to the surface.

""W-what?""

""What. Is. His. Name?"" My tone never rose beyond an even and flat monotone, but from the widening in her eyes, I knew she could see my anger.

I took a moment to take deep breaths and try to better school my expression, as she replied, ""T-Tom,""

Nodding, I said, ""And let me guess. He's someone from your hometown. Someone you used to love back in,  back in fucking highschool? And he just happened to be in town at the same Goddamn time, and... and you decided to change all of your principles, quit your fucking job, and run away with him to become a housewife under, what, the Spirit of Christmas?!""

She slammed up from her chair, the harsh scrape biting against the floor as she replied, ""Something you'd clearly NEVER understand, because your job is Too Impodtant to celebrate one of... one of the most...""

""One of the most WHAT, Alice? The most important holidays? Do you even fucking remember telling me, back in goddamn SEPTEMBER, that you didn't care that much about Christmas?? Fucking hell, I cared more than you. I went... I went out of my way to buy you gifts, shit I knew you'd like. And you got me a Card. What did Mister Motherfucking Hometown get you?!?""

""He... he got me... he got me Roses,"" She replied, swaying on her feet.

""Holy shit, Alice?"" I rushed around the counter, grabbing her right as she fell, ""Alice, what's going ""

She Blinked, and for the briefest of moments, a single piece of snow rose up from her eye. I stared as that strand branched, and...

The world was dark, and a fierce chill entered my veins. The house was gone, and naught but a void stretched into the depths of infinity. In the middle of it all stood a man, burgeoned in red cloth.

""You are... irredeemable,"" The man whispered.

Hesitantly, I stood up, shaking under the mind-numbing pressure of the cold, ""W-what... what is this?""

""You are... Unlovable,""

""WHAT IS THIS?"" I shouted, desperate, as the man turned to me, white beard billowing below him. 

""You are... Unwanted,""

Stepping forward, surprised at the resistance that begged to slide my feet against the invisible ground, ""Are you... are you...""

The man grinned, and it was a thing of yellowed, cavity strewn teeth, ""I am Saint Nicholas, the Patron of Gifts, God of Love... and YOU, you are the Ice Lord, to be the Death of all that is Good. You,  are Jack Frost,""

I shivered as the cold began to burrow deeper into my veins, and shouted, ""I found love! Multiple times, but you... you took it from me!?""

""Took? I suppose I did. Your form of love is UNACCEPTABLE,""

""What... what does that... what does that MEAN? What did I do wrong?""

""Do you think it coincidence that every person you have 'loved' has left to become a housewife?""

""You took away their freedom to make them a fucking..."" I struggled, then, raging against the invisible storm begging to take over my body, ""No. I won't... accept... it,""

A woman answered, a few years older than Bree, but similar enough in looks she had to be her sister, Allie.

""Hi is Bree -""

""Oh thank heavens, Luke, right? I am so glad you're here. Bree has gone absolutely mental, and we were humoring her, because it's the holiday, but I actually think she's lost it, please, come in.""

""Uh - okay -"" I said, confused.

""She seemed perfectly normal when she got here last week, excited to introduce us to you, but over these past few days she's been in a baking frenzy, despite almost never baking, and, shit, the guy who removes the snow for Nana is here. His name is Jay, and he seems charming, but I remember him from school and he is a deadbeat with 3 kids he never sees. The only reason he clears Nana's snow is because he can show off his plow.""

""And Bree is in love with him,"" I guessed.

""Holy crap, did she tell you that?""

""Educated guess.""

Allie led me into the living room where Bree's parents, grandmother, brother in law, and nieces sat around a tree. Bree was cuddled very close to a man who looked like he belonged on a magazine cover.

""Bree, look who made it!""

Bree tilted her head. ""Who are you?""

""What?!"" I asked. ""Bree, it's me, Luke. We've been dating 8 months now.""

""You've only talked my ear off about him and sent a bazillion pictures of the two of you being adorable,"" Allie added.

""Luke?"" Bree said, then her eyes widened. ""Luke! Oh, uh, hey! Did you bring my apron?""

""No, I didn't bring your apron. I was already on my way to the airport. After using the holiday drive profits to host brunch for the homeless. As was the plan?""

""Oh,"" she looked saddened. ""Well, um, I'm sorry, but I've had a life-changing experience and -""

""Please,"" I said. ""Please explain what happened between when you left the city and now.""

""Okay, well I did some work in the airport, got on the plane, rented a car, stopped at a rest area where an odd little man gave me the most amazing hot cocoa, came here, worked late from my room, went to Nana's, met Jay...""

""Hold up,"" Allie interrupted. ""Did you say you accepted a drink from a stranger at a sketchy roadside rest?""

""A cocoa,"" Bree said. ""He - he had this ""Christmas magic"" aura to him, you know?""

Allie and I exchanged glances, and then I noticed Jay looking anywhere but the conversation.

""Jay, do you know what's going on?""

He sighed. ""I might have a side gig as an elf at one of those Santa photo places, and one of my coworkers said for 50 bucks he could get me a girlfriend by Christmas day? Weird little guy, but he said he had years of experience. Even showed me a few photos of his work. There's one dude who fell in love with a snow sculptor in Florida. They have two kids now!""

""They were drugged,"" I said horrified. ""Drugged by some weird Christmas elf.""

""They?"" Allie asked. 

""This has happened to me before,"" I explained.

""Look, I'm really sorry,"" Bree said, ""but I'm very happy here, and I'm about to sign a lease on the bakery, so....""

""Yeah, I get it."" I sighed. ""I don't suppose there's a hotel in this small town? I'll leave you too whatever this is, and -""

""Nope!"" Allie interrupted. ""Sorry, but I've heard enough about you to know that I much prefer my kids have an uncle Luke than an uncle Jay."" She faced the other man ""Get in touch with your elf coworker. Have him undo this. ""

Jay sighed and pulled out his phone, sending a text. After what felt like forever his phone pinged.

""He says to put $100 on the mantle. And, uh, he's sorry about all the other times.

Allie humphed. ""I'm not putting the kids Christmas money -""

""I've got it,"" I assured her, pulling out one of the crisp $100s I'd been planning to use to take her family to dinner. I placed it on the mantle and a moment later it vanished, replaced with a mug of eggnog.

Carefully, I passed the mug to Bree.

""I don't know if I should-""

""Goodness you fool, drink it!"" Nana snapped from the corner. ""He came all this way for you, and he's loaded!""

Bree drank. Then she gasped, and pushed away from Jay.

""What just - how - Luke! You made it!""

""You can leave now,"" Allie said to Jay and he headed to the door. 

""Merry Christmas, Bree"" I said, taking the spot vacated by Jay.

""Merry Christmas, Luke"" Bree replied. ""I'm so happy you made it, and congrats on a successful holiday charity drive! She smiled at her family. ""Everyone meet my wonderful boyfriend, Luke. Luke, meet everyone.""

He'd decided that laying down would be showing weakness. They were going to operate on him and it would be best if they didn't think he was weak. Herb believed that when people think you're weak, something down deep gives them permission to fuck up.

Strength is all that matters. Might is right. Keep'em worried. Just like dad always said.

The digital clock ticked over. Just a few more minutes.

Herb noticed that he was plucking at his gown and stopped immediately. Fidigiting was a lack of control, not being in control was weak.
 
He inhaled deeply. The air was scentless, tasteless. Was the parasite eating up smells now or was the room just that sterile?

As the thought of the parasite ran through his brain, Herb blacked out. 

When he came to he heard his voice asking, ""Doc will this tingle?"" 

""Hurt actually."" The doctor answered. The doctor wasn't looking at Herb, Orban was looking at his abdomen.

""Will that be a light pain or...?"" Again the voice was his but something was off. 

As the haze cleared Herb realized it was coming from the mouth that had grown out of his stomach. 

He was careful not to form the ""P"" word in his mind. It didn't like it when he thought that. Herb wanted to think it to show that he didn't care what it felt or wanted. Herb wanted to project strength. He'd tried projecting strength but it was tied deep into his nervous system and it was difficult to do much these days.

He'd never felt so weak.

The doctor answered it's question as he nodded to a nurse that was on his left, ""No, agonizing."" 

The nurse slipped a needle into a hose that hadn't been in his arm just a few mintues before. Herb wondered how long he'd been out.

A coolness in his veins warned him that the nurse had just hit him with a sedative.

1lg2q00,mysxed2,"I stared at my dad, my mouth hanging open after he dropped that bomb on me.  The Human-Rowan war had devastated the planet, over three billion people dead and it was only now that the climate was beginning to go back to normal.  I had studied the war in high school, just like every other student, but I had no idea my dad had any part in it other than being a soldier.

""How did you-"" I began but stopped when he raised a hand.  His grin was a cocksure as ever, and he turned he head to point behind his right ear.  I watched in amazement as a shiny, metal port appeared as if by magic. ""It's camouflaged unless I will it to reveal itself,"" he explained.  ""I was part of a secret project, a real Hail Mary if you will, to interface with Rowan technology. As the only survivor of the process, it was on me to make the most of it.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My middle-aged dad, the one who told terrible Dad jokes at barbeques and was the most cautious man I knew, was a real war hero.  I paused to gather my thoughts before asking just one question. He interrupted me, like he was reading my mind.

""How? Well, with the interface, I could link to their tech, take it over and do whatever I wanted with it.  Repurpose it for deadly results.  My first mission was getting onto a battle cruiser, something that took an entire battalion of Marines to accomplish.  Once we were there, I hooked in and took over.  Purged all the Rowan out of the ship and landed it in Area 51.  I was the bridge that translated all their technology, information and battle plans.  The military reverse engineered the ship so we could build more, build better.  The war turned a corner at that point, but I wasn't done.  My last mission was on their battle station orbiting Earth. I was inserted with a team of specialists, real go-getters.  We breached and made our way to the central database.  For over ten hours, they held off waves of Rowan soldiers as I downloaded and transmitted the entire sum of their knowledge.  Jumped us light years ahead.  They even had information from other species that they never bothered to translate or use, but we sure made the most of everything.""

""They never told us any of this in school,"" I muttered.  ""And they never will,"" he countered.  ""It goes deeper than just utilizing their technology against them.  The Rowan were a hivemind, every one of them connected to another.  I broke it, that special connection, and it broke them as a people.  After that, it was more of mopping up then real battle.  They had lost their cohesion, their special trait that we couldn't seem to overcome before.  Most of them did the dirty work for us, ending their lives, unable to live without being part of that gestalt.  And it went past the ones here on Earth, far past.

The world didn't believe it for a long time, but it did happen, after all...we are free, aren't we?

  
""How? You?"" I ask.  
He nods slowly.  
""I got infected, when I was at my lowest point, almost ending it all...  
Many would have thought that this meant I was an easy target, right?"" he starts.  
I nod.  
""But nope.  
The voices? The link? Absolutely useless against my mind.  
Not only that, but my anxiety, paranoia, hypochondria, and the endless deadly scenarios were transmitted through the link back to the hivemind.  
The link was nigh-indestructible, so...they kept being infected by my thoughts."" he continues.  
I gasp.

  
""Then, I suppose the government managed to create a device that could identify hivemind individuals, because they found me.  
And they were shocked, and happy to see me...as me, and not a member of the hive.  
When I told them that the hivemind is begging for me to stop, and why it asked so...  
They apologized to me."" he says.  
""Apologized? The government?"" I ask.  
""They doubled down, feeding me the worst things I couldn't even imagine before.  
Let me tell you, humanity is fucked up.  
But hey...after I saw those files, and videos...the hivemind voluntarily retreated, freeing every human, and leaving the planet.  
I became a Hero, with a lot of perks, and met your mom in rehab, where she was volunteering.  
The rest, you kind of know."" he says.

1lg2q00,myt679d,"When the old ant moved, his back leg dragged. Why did the Queen and her royal guards show him such respect? We didn't know. We just knew he was slow.

For nineteen seasons, he strained under loads half the size of mine. He'd fall behind on foraging runs. I'd hear his wheeze in the tunnels.

He didn't pull his weight. He was an embarrassment. I couldn't understand why the colony let him continue.

And I felt ashamed. You see, he's my father.

Last week, I snapped when he dropped a seed. ""You embarrass us,"" I said. ""Stay in the nest. Let us handle it.""

He didn’t argue. Just nodded and scraped his bad leg through the dirt. But later, I guess this prompted him to speak.

Now he stood at the entrance to our restoreum. My siblings had gathered. Another lecture. Whatever. I hung back, hoping to slip away. 

""Long ago,"" he began, ""a rock fell from the sky. It was smaller than a seed. Hit near the oak stump. It brought something with it. Not alive. Not dead. A fungus. Thoughts like one mind stretched across stars.""

My antennae twitched. His voice gripped me. He never told stories.

""Bees got it first. Wings stopped. Hives went quiet. Their queen came to us, half-dead, and warned we were next. Said the fungus would eat the tunnels. Choke the brood.""

A shift in his stance showed the scars. Deep gouges I’d always chalked up to age.

""We fought. Us, the bees. Your uncles. Everyone. Tore through the rot. Chewed its veins. Days blurred. Weeks passed.""

He paused. The limp dragged again, but slower this time. Measured.

""Lost half the colony. Took a spore blast to the thorax. But we stopped it. Burned it with sap.""

The yard around us hummed. Bees passed overhead. The colony hummed with the same sounds as always. But it felt different now.

""That’s why they come. It's why they share honey. It's why we guard their hives. That fight bound us.""

I looked at him, bent and tired. But I saw something else now. ""Your limp?"" I asked.

""I was at the final battle."" He said. ""Lived, most didn't.""

Above us, a bee dropped pollen. That night, I heard his wheeze in the tunnels. I still felt ashamed. But my shame was different. It was for not recognizing who this brave, old ant truly was.",15,1750426704.0
1lftqig,myr9rvd,"""WHAT.""

Asjoljsbi's voice was shrill. Chirping, even. Rose blinked, still sucking on her lollipop. It reminded her of those silly-looking birds that flew around her backyard sometimes. She popped her lollipop out of her mouth.

""You're a goof!""

""I HEARD YOU, HUMAN."" A tendril lashed out at the cavern walls around them. The stone it struck changed color and shape until it was a writhing black tumor of eyes, teeth, and hair, but Rose wasn't paying attention. ""WHAT ARE YOU?""

""I'm a first-grader!"" Rose put her hands on her hips and puffed up her chest proudly.

""...THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT.""

""I'm a girl!""

""I WAS AWARE.""

""You look funny!""

""I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. A MORTAL SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WITNESS THE SECRETKEEPER OF THE STARS WITHOUT THEIR MIND SNAPPING. COULD YOU PERHAPS BE A VESSEL? OR A NIGHTCRAWLER?""

Rose wasn't listening anymore. She waddled over on stubby legs to one of the tendrils and poked it with her finger. The tendril bubbled and popped, erupting into a huge mist of spores that ensnared mortal creatures under Asjoljsbi's control. Rose giggled and waved her hands, trying to catch as many of them as she could.

Asjoljsbi shuddered. It wasn't working. They retracted their tendrils, much to the disappointment of the... thing. ""CHILD. SPEAK. WHO BIRTHED YOU?"" This time, Asjoljsbi's shrill voice was a little more restrained, a little less booming.

""Wha?""

Could it be? There was no way. Not possible. This had to be someone playing a prank on them. Was it that damned Shub-Niggurath again? The bastard always seemed to fancy having new mortal children. But there was a way to find out.

""HOLD STILL.""

Two tendrils reached out and poked and prodded at Rose's arms, legs, neck, and head, searching for any signs of eldritch residue.

""No tickling! No tickling! Stop!"" She cried out in between hysterical giggling. ""Not fair!""

A few minutes of careful study later, the results came back. Asjoljsbi was stunned. There was nothing. This truly was an ordinary child.

The Secretkeeper of the Stars pondered this for a while, withdrawing their tendrils. Many minutes passed in silence, during which Rose restlessly moved about the cave opening she had somehow wandered down.",210,1750393662.0
1lftqig,myrcmhn,"""It's not Halloween yet,"" Sarah stared at the eldritch horror beyond comprehension. ""Very impressive costume. You must've put a ton of effort into it. But you're a few months too early.""

The mass of undulating black flesh and sludge met her steely gaze with an impenetrable stare. Only to blink with dozens of eyes and wobbled like an oversized, misshapen jello. It tented its tentacles, which seem to be having conversations with each other in screechy cat noises. Its mouth, which stretched from a bulbous head to this rotund mid-section, which Sarah assumed was a stomach, wrenched itself open in a silent scream.

""Yes, it is a good act,"" she sighed, patting the creature on the head. Only to later pull her hand away and wipe the slime off. ""Nice texturing. Almost like a real slime monster.""

*“You’re not dead.”* The oddly shy voice that came from the monster carried confusion and caution. There was no reverb or echo or blood-curdling edge. Just a voice that could belong to a child trying to make a surprised pikachu face, only to flounder about like a floppy jellyfish on dry land. *""You're not scared.""*

""I'm alive, and tired, and still have work to do,"" Sarah remarked. ""I'm sorry I don't have any treats for you, so please go home.""

“All who witness my horrifying visage scream in terror!” The creature gesticulated wildly, flailing its tentacles as though it were a panicked octopus that forgot it could breathe underwater. “You do not fear!How can you withstand the horror that is my terrible tentacles and not melt into a puddle of dissolved flesh and bones? By Hastur and Cthulhu, this has never happened to me!”

""Oh, you're a Lovecraft fan? Cthulhu is your favourite?"" Sarah asked, hoping it could stop panicking and talk about its hobbies. ""I used to play Call of Cthulhu RPG with friends. Do you want to play together? Get to know each other. Don't be scared.""

""Okay..."" it sniffed, blowing chunks of thick wax-like substances from its...mouths? Sarah could not see anything resembling nostrils on the creature's face. ""Teach me. How to play Cthulhu games. How are you not scared of..."" it paused, scrunching its features searching for the right word to say, ""...creepy costumes.""

""I'm a middle school teacher. When you're trapped in the public school system for as long as I have, nothing phases you. Absolutely nothing.""

""Nothing indeed...nothing I do scares you...you...monster!"" the eldritch entity sobbed before screaming of fearless teacher who refused to comprehend the horrors at night. Of a teacher who gazed into the Abyss without batting an eyelid and made it blink and cry.

1lftqig,myrhxwm,"The creature emerged from the pain of existence, from the cracks of woe. It wrought itself into being, twisting the formless echoes of suffering until it was whole. An energy pulsated through it, each new breath breathing into it an air of despair, until all that it was came to be. 

It new its purpose. It knew *pain.*

A sound made it swivel, its body twisting in torment. It knew every language, as all language contains that which should not be said, but it could discern the dialect nor the meaning. 

It could only be described as... *Psspsspss*

The eldritch monstrosity gazed up, as a human crouched low, arm outstretched. Its hand contained nothing; only a sense of beckoning. 

Again, that sound. That intriguing sound. 

*Psspsspss*

The beast, alive since before eternity, knew not what to do. It wasn't sure of what horrible torment to wrought, what awful agony to inflict. 

""*There's a good girl*,"" the human said, shuffling towards the horror. ""*There's a good girl.*""

The monstrosity ebbed, eons of excruciation within its throes. A timeless second in wait. 

The hand reached out, making contact with the beast, with the formless amalgamation of all that was wrong. It moved across it again, again. A ritual repeated, each more deliberate than the last. 

""*Now aren't you something,*"" she said, her smile etching into her wrinkles. ""*Such a pretty little girl.*""

This was not how it was supposed to go. 

The human's other hand reached towards it, and it moved backwards, almost defensively. The hand soon made contact however, reaching beneath it and cradling it upwards, into the human's arms. 

""*There there,*"" the human said, holding it as if it were a baby. ""*Let's get you a home.*""

The horror gazed up at the human, as the suffering at its core churned. What terror to reap. What despair to defile. 

The human walked slowly, deliberately, cradling the beast in its arms. She sat among a smattering of boxes; a makeshift bed.

She kissed the beast on what could be called its forehead. 

""*We all need a home,*"" she said almost to herself, stroking the horror tenderly, lovingly.

An eternity of suffering; a moment of respite. 

Something arose in it. Something it could not name, but only feel. 

Something it much preferred.

1lftqig,myr19s8,"Okay.  
I just watched a house sprout legs, and a mouth, and eat a car.  
Then a myriad eyes bloomed on it, all staring at me.  
Was I terrified? Hell yes.  
Did I react? Hell no?  
Why?  
Because I couldn't understand what the fuck did just happen.  
So now...I am having a staring contest with a goddamn thousands eyed house!

  
The House's mouth opens, revealing teeth that have...eyes?  
I almost faint.  
It rolls out a ridiculously long tongue...and it licks me.  
It fucking licks me.  
I want to scream. I want to run away, but I can't.  
I am frozen in place.  
This is too much for my brain to comprehend.  
I think I have shut down.  
My body ain't bodying.  
Then it gets worse.

  
The House roars at me.  
Yeah, you heard that right, roars at me, and tries to step on me.  
I don't even flinch.  
Not because I am not scared, I already soiled myself, but because I am simply having an out-body like experience.  
The House freezes as well.  
Growls, and takes a few steps back, still staring at me.  
My eyes are dry, and sting, but I can't come to make myself blink.  
Then...  
The House whimpers.

  
I watch as it lowers itself to the ground, legs disappearing, eyes blinking and disappearing.  
One more low whimper escapes its terrible mouth, and it disappears as well.  
Now...  
The house is a normal looking house.  
And the weird atmosphere, and dreadful feeling disappeared.  
I see a purplish cloud leaving the house, and occasionally looking back at me, before disappearing into the horizon.  
I collapse, twitching.  
Before everything goes dark, the only thing I can think about is...  
Did I just scare away a scary monster?  
Did from fight and flight, and freeze...freeze really work?",94,1750390059.0
1lftqig,myremr8,"I couldn’t comprehend it. Even as I tilted my head to the right, I couldn’t figure out what the creature was supposed to be. Was it a man? Woman? Dog? Cat? Bear? I could see all of those things in it, while also seeing none of them at the same time. I sat up in my bed, pulling the blankets over my knees, continuing to examine the creatures’ many rotating heads, each flashing with what I assumed was a different emotion? Or perhaps it was the same one? It was hard to tell when those floating faces rotated around its oozing dark body like moons caught in a planet’s orbit.
 
“I am all. I am nothing.” Its voice made my windows wobble, threatening to burst open if they raised it even a decibel louder. When it moved, it mimicked a slug, crawling slowly towads my bed, as its imposing form leaned over my body. Each head swirling around its body faster, with yellowed teeth, green teeth, white teeth, and I still had no idea what I was looking at.
 
I remained silent, not exactly frozen in fear, more held in place by startled confusion. It was scary, in the same way that finding a cockroach in your bedroom at night would be scary, not a oh my god type of fear, more an ick. The body of the creature throbbed, causing the sores on its skin to drool a green ooze, threatening to drip onto the floor. The body reminded me of an oversized balloon. One so thick it would pop if it brushed against a hair of grass. Though, before I could understand its body, it deflated into a deathly thin frame, one that showed the animalistic skeleton underneath its skin.
 
“Join us. You will become a part of us. We hunger. You will hunger too.” Its long, perfect fingers traced my chin. For all its strangeness, its fingers were pristine with painted red nails. If one saw them in a magazine, they may even think they belonged to a hand model. The softness of their touch easing me slightly.
 
Again, its words were intimidating, but the longer this went on, the less fear I felt. In fact, I felt more confused than anything. What was this thing? I couldn’t even decide what parts of it I was supposed to fear at this point. I slid its hand from my chin, that spooking the creature who shifted back.
 
“You moved.” It hissed, its frail chicken legs bending backwards as it went into a squat. “Why did you move? You shouldn’t move.”
 
“I’m confused.”
 
“Confusion is fear.” It said, confidence growing as it crept forward.
 
“No, I’m not scared. I can’t even tell what I’m meant to be scared of. Every time I get scared, you change into something else.”

“BAAGSGASDGAS” It screamed, generating a sound that forced the windows open, letting in a chill that cooled my body to the point of almost freezing it. I whimpered, breath coming out in a gust of condensation. “Scared yet?” It snickered, the faces all bouncing with laughter, and I was terrified. For a second.

 

The faces again changed, big chubby cheeks wailing on one, a glossy lipstick wearing one following that, before ending on a comically plain face with fuzzy eyebrows. The whiplash from seeing all those faces taking me out of my horrified state. I pulled my blankets up, warming myself until the chill left. “That was a little scary.”

 

“A little scary?” It stepped back again. “NO, no, No.” Each no had a different tone, as if it was being filtered through a hundred voices. The orbs of floating faces stopped their rotation, forming a line before its body. “What if all my faces eat you alive? Nibble bits of your skin until you're nothing but a pile of bones that we can use to pick our teeth clean with.”

 

Again, my fear heightened before I realized one of the mouths didn’t have any teeth, having lost them when it shifted. The constant changes becoming more noticeable. Now, that’s all I could focus on, unable to comprehend anything else. “That one’s missing its teeth.”

 

“What? No, it isn’t. Can you truly not understand what lurks before you? What is going to kill you?”

 

“I… really have no idea what you even are. Are you a monster? A bunch of faces? I don’t get it.” I rubbed my nose, doing my best to try and take a guess at what the mess of body parts was. Bravely, I stepped out of my bed, approaching it to get a better look.

 

It flinched, its size deflating, becoming smaller as I got closer. “No. Stay back.”


It almost looked cute now, a fearful tiny creature that shivered with my every step. Then it grew again, its body hitting the ceiling as its heads stared down at me. “I’ll kill you.” It shouted, though it lacked any heart, the creature already pushing itself against the wall, trying to keep away from me.
 
“I can’t even tell how you would kill me.” I admitted, and that appeared to be the final straw for the creature. It squealed, dashing away towards the window. When it realized it was too big for the window, it shrunk to the size of a bee and grew a set of large-boned arms from its back. These arms helping it to fly, with their skeletal fingers flapping, giving it some air. I tried to grab it before it left, only to miss it, having to watch as it escaped my home.
 
I watched it for a minute before closing the windows. I had so many questions to ask it, but it appeared I would never get the chance to find out what it really was. The creature was long gone, with no intention of ever coming back. Resigned to the fact I would never see it again, I shut my eyes, needing a few minutes before I could get back to sleep again.

1lftqig,mys38uk,"The woman walked home like a leaf caught in the wind. Thin, exhausted, her eyes wide and hollow. She held her keys loosely in one hand, her steps automatic, as if her body remembered the way even when her mind had long since let go.

The house stood just as it always had—gray, old, familiar. Two shallow steps led up to the front door. She climbed them slowly, paused before the door, and stared at it for a moment. Then she reached for her keys and brought them to the lock. Her fingers trembled—not from fear, but from sheer fatigue. The keys slipped through her grip and fell to the wooden porch with a dull metallic clatter.

She didn’t react right away. Instead, she stood still, looking down at the keys as if trying to remember what they were for. Ten seconds passed. Maybe more. Then, somewhere above, a faint sound broke the silence—like a window slamming shut on the second floor. It was soft, but unmistakably inside the house.

The noise brought her back. She bent down, picked up the keys, and stepped away from the door, her head tilting up toward the second floor.

There, in the window, she saw the back of a head. Gray hair. A pale nightgown. The figure stood perfectly still, turned away. It wasn’t clear who—or what—it was. An old woman? A stranger? A shadow?

And then she remembered.

Three days ago, her sister had called her in tears. She’d had a dream, a vivid nightmare. In it, she had wandered through this very house in the middle of the night. In the boy’s bedroom—the boy who had died just yesterday—she had seen an old woman standing beside his bed.

She had asked, ""Who are you?""  
The woman didn’t answer.  
She asked again, ""Why are you here?""  
The old figure raised an arm and pointed silently at the sleeping child.

Then she turned.

Her sister saw two enormous, hollow eyes—emptier than death itself. Her skin was black, like oil, and her smile was made entirely of glass.

She’d woken up screaming and called right away. At the time, it had seemed like nothing. Just a dream.

But the next day, her son was gone.

Now, standing before the same door, she remembered it all. The keys felt heavy in her hand as she brought them back to the lock. One turn. Then another. She paused, her lips moving into something that almost resembled a smile. Not warmth. Not courage. Just quiet surrender. Or maybe acceptance.

""I’m not afraid anymore,"" she said softly.

She turned the key a final time. There was a faint click as the door unlocked and drifted open.

1lgds9i,myvuixg,"I barely noticed it at first. Too busy inspecting my latest sets of spirits, sampling a shot of each. I wasn't too happy with this lot, too much of the alcohol taste cutting through the rest of the flavours. Good if someone wanted to get hammered, but hardly worth the coin otherwise. Still, what was done was done. I could still find someone who would want it.

But as I straightened up, I felt the tear on my back. A low pain, but one I knew all too well by now. It made me glance up to the ceiling, muttering to myself. ""Moonrise already? Darn, I'm running a little late.""

With that I left my sheds, quickly locking them before dashing through the cooling air. Every step came with other small tears, the skin around my joints breaking. I scowled, knowing I had only a few more minutes before I was too far gone.

Thankfully, with the coming change my speed increased. In swift seconds I was safely in my home, closing curtains and stripping at the same time. It was only when I was completely nude did I stop holding back, grabbing my skin and *tearing*.

Great chunks slipped off, as a body too big to fit beneath emerged. I was fit as a human, but as my wolf-self I was a display of muscle, covered in a fine layer of white fur. I stretched, groaning as my bones clicked in relief. It was easy to peel off what skin remained, as it was loose now.

The worst part was the fact I was now left with my... peelings. I had to get rid of them, but they weren't anything that I could exactly throw out. Thankfully, I had a way. I balled up the pieces, sniffing as I set them into a plastic bag I had on hand.

Scampering to a specific wardrobe, I took out my oversized clothing. From the big and tall section, they weren't the height of fashion. But then again, I only wore them once a month. I squeezed them over my thick body, before padding to my laptop. I had left it open, with the tracking of the usual pizzas. En-route, as I had ordered hours ago.

Knowing my gameroom was ready, I just had to wait. And wait I did, listening.

I knew when they pulled in. Their car was one I had heard countless times before, the sounds recognisable. I grinned, heading over to the door. Counting down in my head, as I heard their footsteps, I opened the door just in time.

There they were. My friends, the pairs of monsters. Darcy and Victoria, both vampires smiling as Victoria held up a cooler. Then Herrus and Cleo, the mummy's. I eyed their bandages, pushing the door open as I stepped aside. ""Hey guys. Good trip?""

Herrus nodded, a flash of red visible beneath the cloth over his eyes. ""Not bad.""

I welcomed them in, watching as they headed directly to my games room. A pile of overnight bags were left, as they always stayed over. They took their usual seats, as I held out my arms to my vampiric pals. ""Go on, let's get this over with. Cleo, my skin's in the bag.""

I ignored the pain of bites, as Cleo gave a smirk. ""Thanks Alex. I needed a refresh.""

I smiled, shrugging. ""At least you can use it. The pizza's on the way, so shall we get started?""

Darcy nodded, pulling away as he licked his lips. ""Mmmm. I needed that. I vote poker.""

I sniggered at that. ""Oh good. Worked out how to bluff yet?""

He swore at me, despite the grin brewing. Good-natured laughs echoed around, as we sat around to begin our monthly catch up. A way to hang out free of our guises, a way to relax. We had been doing it for the last five decades, and I was hoping for it to carry on for many more.",7,1750455108.0

""Oh that's perrrrrrrrfect, that's absolutely delectable"" 

She purred in tune with the vibro hum of her cybersaber. I always thought the damn things were show until I saw them using them to execute us openly in the fields when they came to rip everything away. Everything we bled and sweat for, all torn down by fine print and government indifference.

I saw it now, I had watched her move in far enough. I could finally let go. It was funny in so many ways, so I gave in. I started to laugh. It hurt, it spilled more of the wound out onto the floor, but I didn't care anymore. She stopped and cocked her head quizzically at me.

""Oh? Is it funny now? Funny that all this waste was for nothing? Funny that all of this was by design? Funny that you lived an entire life for nothing? Oh yes, I agreeeeeeee"". The smile crept across her face like a rip through a ships hull. Full of a visceral terror that what was about to come next was inevitable and as uncaring as space itself.",11,1750435006.0
1lg63ss,mytyb2z,"""No... but this is"". The last of my breath gone, I slammed on the bulkheads hardlock. It had taken everything we had to get her here to the elevator, and more still to bait her into the airlock. Poor Jenna wasn't pregnant, hell she wasn't even my wife, but she had been a staunch ally and a confidant and I'd be damned if I was going to let her plain fail here when we had all given so much.

I don't even think the general registered it at first, she was so drunk on what she would be able to do while I was unable to defend myself. She was so focused on playing with her new toy that I didn't even really need to worry that she could have bolted to the door, that she might have made it out. She didn't even try till it was too late.

The internal airlock behind her slammed shut and the ramjet seals started locking into place. Only then did her eyes widen and she turn her menacing grimace away from me. I tried to stand up again, making good purchase this time pulling myself up using the bulkhead unlock. I didn't have to worry about triggering it by pulling myself up anymore. We were locked in, and standard procedure meant that the airlock was the only door that would open once the emergency sirens started and the doors were locked.

""No... I said again... This... was... the funn..."" I collapsed, pulling down the release and hearing the last of the oxygen be sucked from the room. The last thing I remember was the deep sense of satisfaction I felt seeing her turn back. Wide eyed and fearful. A fear that had probably never even crossed her mind as she saw us trade our own mortality to stop her and the company. A sacrifice to show that we would not rest until acknowledged as an independent people. An idea that we were worth more than the sum of our discoveries.

I blacked out smiling in the void as we were sucked into low orbit.",15,1750435025.0
1lg47k6,mytl06x,"The King looked on in confusion as the court wizard revealed the findings of his investigation.

“M’lord, I’ve interviewed all of those who could have cast a sleep curse or similar spell. Not a single one. No spell has been cast, no curse has been laid. To the best of my knowledge, it appears that the princess is just lazy.”

The king’s expression was dark and thunderous. His voice was low and promised imminent doom. “Are you saying there was no magic involved. Are you calling my only daughter,  the heir to my kingdom, lazy? Guards! Seize this fool and put him on the dungeon!”

The mage had figured this was going to be the outcome, so he cast his prepared spell and in a burst of eldritch light, the massive bed of the princess appeared in the throne room. The beautiful young woman lay asleep under the covers, her breathing slow and measured. Before the king could object, the mage yelled “Lunchtime!” as loud as he could. To the shock of the entire court, the princess sprang from her bed and looked around hurriedly. 

The king slowly wiped his face with his hand, nodded to the court wizard and silently mouthed the word “sorry” to him before standing. 

“Princess Esmeralda, you are hereby ordered by the king, your loving and exasperated father, to begin a trial of hard work and no sleep to make up for the torment your lazy self has inflicted upon this kingdom. Court wizard, you are to destroy her bed and bedding, and cast whatever spell you can to keep her awake and moving for a year and a day. I have decreed and it shall be so!”",19,1750431196.0
1lfzjcx,myshi6l,"The Monster King laughed at me, rasping as bloody foam dripped from her teeth. She was dying and knew it. ""I stood where you did, *hero*, and did the same. The power rush! The thrill of killing! A bit of each Monster King lives on in the next - they're all here - and soon, they'll all be in you!"" She laughed, her eyes wild. ""I can die happy knowing you only bought a few years of peace!""

Her wild laughter stopped at my small smirk. Her eyes focused a bit. ""What... have you done?""

""Wish Magic: Activation Phrase: A stitch in the timeline saves nine."" I intoned softly. It had taken years, hundreds of searches into dungeons and ruins  and hours of picking through tattered scroll fragments, but I finally learned the potent magic required to summon a being capable of granting wishes and not inclined to twist the magic in a devasting way. So long as one paid the price.

I had made an offer to the otherworldly being that intrigued it - something so common and simple, yet as foreign to it as the being was to myself. I offered it a mortal experience. A full year and a day of travel, feasts, music, dancing, singing, shopping, anything it wanted. Anywhere in the world that I could take it - fishing for great kraken clam in the Northern Willwisp Sea? Done. Sampling the finest wines in the desert markets of Kinir'yuf while sitting atop the fabled Opal Goddess statue? Certainly. Playing fetch with a random stray draggog in the farmlands? Not a problem. A mortal vessel had been made for them to inhabit to fully experience things as a mortal - heat, cold, pain, taste.

It was an offer accepted readily for the wish I asked. Long had such beings discussed what our realm must be like for us, without the ability to [a word tasting of blue and smelling like the sound of raindrops hitting cobblestone].

And now that wish had been activated. Illusory doors stood before me as time slowed to a crawl.

The first opened, and I saw myself casting a spell to turn the current Monster King into an object and simply banishing the object to the moon. I had wondered if such a thing would work. The spell keeping the Monster King an item wore off, and her wounds had healed. It seems she was unable to breathe, however, and died within the hour. The door closed as a new hero strode forth to kill the Monster King I had become.

The second door opened, and within I saw myself sadly shake my head and cauterize the King's wounds. A healing potion was shoved down her throat, one laced with a paralytic. Necessary for the next step, I knew. Her limbs were removed cleanly and carefully seared shut before caps of silver plated iron were screwed into the stumps to stop regeneration. A series of runes were tattooed on her skin to prevent magic use, then I encased everything below her neck in stone. I created golems to attend to her needs. The view shifted and indicated that many years had passed. The King remained the same, and as a figure entered the room, a hood pulled back to reveal a withered shell. My own face stretched over the skeleton, aged well past mortal lifespan and unable to die. That door shut as that version of me went to kill the Monster King properly.

The third door opened and merely showed me the image of a breaking chain before closing.

The doors vanished. I had wished to see the outcome of the three methods I had thought of to break the cycle when I spoke the activation.

Wary eyes regarded me, even as the light in them dimmed. ""I win."" I whispered. I stabbed her in the heart to be certain. And as I felt the madness of the Monster King enter me, I smiled, and turned the blade on myself.

The only way to break the cycle was to use the same hero to kill the Monster King twice.",58,1750417177.0

His eyes softened as he stared back at me and despite the carnage that he had left in his wake, all I could see in that moment, was Artorius Redwood,  the gentle knight who had saved me when the Monster King slaughtered my village. His balance began to fail and he toppled forward but before he could meet the ground I found myself under him, catching his body and lying it gently down with his back to the ground. 

""I didn't want this."" He managed to squeeze out between weak breaths.  ""I couldn't stop the curse. I wasn't..."" His words cut short with a violent cough.

""I know."" My voice shaking with tears beginning to form.

He turned to me ""The curse... it will come for you too."" he said with fear ripe in his eyes. ""I'm... sorry."" With those final words the last breath of air left his body.

I felt cold, near sickened, looking around. Maghrit was in his castle, walls barred and ready for war, but deep down, a dark feeling stirred.

Soon, the background conversation - that filtering noise - died, as our Officer, Lia Valehn, walked in. ""Attention!""
Every soldier saluted her, then calmed, as she said ""at ease.""

I felt a knot in my chest. A knot, which tightened as Lia approached. ""Hello..."" she said, the Vulpen stood next to me, ""are you Reyard?""

I swallowed, nodding.

She sighed, ""good, I am...well, you know.""

""Valehn.""

She nodded, ""of course, of course,"" she smiled, ""and I'm sure you know what I need?""

""Um...""

""I need a bodyguard.""

There was a pause, which should have felt short, but the nearby knights looked to me. ""...me?""

She nodded.

""Why? You're *the* Spellblade!""

She smiled.

""What?""

""Exactly...I know anything, and everything, about melee, about combat, but..."" she took a breath, ""...but I can't heal, like you. May I see your hands?""

I nodded. ""I...I mostly use my staff, still...""

She grabbed a hand, and inspected the palm. ""Good,"" she let go, ""my liege and I have - ""

""What was that?""

""I was feeling your hands for magic.""

""...oh...?""

""Him?"" I heard a new voice asked.

Lia turned to Drang Byrd. ""Yes,"" Lia said. ""We need a healer.""

""Surely, someone of your skill - ""

""I'm a gladiator,"" said Lia, walking to Byrd, ""trained day and night, and, after battle, drank the same red potion to heal. You know why?""

Byrd sighed, ""to...to undo the damage...""

She nodded, ""because the most valuable part of gladiator fights, is the gladiators. When our soldiers are on the field, we need someone to heal our troops, and keep them off the ground.""

Byrd sighed, turning to me. ""Do you...do you think you...can do this?""

""I...""

Byrd started ""if it's too much...can you at least make everyone healing potions?""

Lia turned to me as well.

1lfw57h,myrm2gd,"The Academy's Grand Hall fell silent.  
Everyone gathered today, for one of the newly knighted Witchknight came to choose his partner.  
Witchknights were the peak force of our civilization when it comes to using magic and martial arts for battle.  
The Academy houses 108 different halls, each responsible to teaching a path of magic, or martial arts.  
I was one of the few who studied healing magic, and medicine, as a herbal witch.  
So, when Witchknight ""Bloody Maw"", chose me as his partner, I was shocked.  
They usually chose someone who can complement their fight style.  
Everyone else was confused as well.  
Even the Archsage, himself.



In a small classroom, with the supervision of one of my teacher's, I met the Witchknight.  
""Elisa Amber."" I bow my head.  
""Adam Argent.  
I have read you are the top of your class, and have quite the success rate in healing poisons, and blood maladies?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""I major in herbalism, with a minor in healing magic, but yes, my graduation thesis is on Poisons, and Blood maladies of the 9 kingdoms."" I say.  
""Will you become my battle-partner, and follow me to cleanse this world of its filth?"" he asks.  
I hesitate.

  
""Why me?"" I ask.  
The witchknight looks at the teacher, and she sighs, leaving us alone.  
Wow...thanks for the ""support"", teacher.  
""""Bloody Maw"" is my moniker, because I am a bloodline martial artist, with the blood of a Moon Wolf flowing within me.  
I fight close-quarters, and my spells are often self-destructive, as my devouring abilities can quickly heal me."" he says, taking off his shirt.  
I gasp.  
So many scars, and bruises.  
""But poison inhibits my powers, and so does bad blood..."" he continues.

  
""May I?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
I check his scars, and bruises, and feel the poison still within them, fighting back against his body's natural healing.  
""You just graduated...how can you already have so many wounds?"" I ask.  
""Witchknights are seen as royals, equals to rulers, but with that privilege come responsibilities."" he says.  
I nod.  
""I agree. If you truly thought this through, to become your battle-partner.  
I vow to keep you alive, as long as possible."" I say.  
He smiled.  
That was...a first, didn't think he could do that.

1lfw57h,myyc96u,"""Tell me."" Witchknight Valer spoke, ""Do you know the average number of witchknights there are at a time?""

The Archsage seemed caught off guard by the question, but before they could give an answer, I did instead.

""Umm, if I recall, around five-hundred at a time."" I let my love of statistics show a bit, ""Given the requirements for the training, average retirement age, and of course the...turnover.""

Valer smiled at that, and then gained a grim expression, before continuing.

""Then could you tell me how many we lost during the Scarring War?""

I was caught off guard by that question.

""I'm sorry, I don't believe I do.""

Valer began pacing with the explanation.

""The exact number is two-hundred, and thirty-seven."" They stopped and stared at one of the stained glass windows, that depicted the founding of the Witchknights, ""Several of them could have been prevented, if a capable enough healer was near enough to aid.""

It appeared that the Archsage was about to say something, but was interrupted by Valer.

""Or, if the knights themselves possessed a more in depth knowledge of healing and medical arts "" Valer walked back to stand in front of me, ""That is why I chose you.""

Dots began to connect in my mind, and I responded with an educated, Guestimates.

""You, you don't want me to be your student."" Valer gave a small smile of pride as I continued, ""You want to be mine.""

Murmurs began swimming through the room at that, and Valer elaborated.

""More specifically, or functionally less so actually, I wish for your assistance in adding Healing Magic and Medical knowledge to the Witchknight's regimes.""

One of the murmurs got louder.

""But, this one has absolutely atrocious combat abilities. They will never make it as a Witchknight.""

Valer, gave a sharp look, from over the shoulder, at the heckler.

""That...is very much true."" I deflated at that comment, but Valer continued, ""You would not actually be a Witchknight, honorary perhaps, but your duty would be more on aiding us in reforming our Training Practices with your expertise.""

I mulled over that bit of information, and gave my answer.

""I suppose that is far more acceptable."" I straightened my clothes, ""It also makes more sense.""

I gave one sheepish look, and realized I needed something clarified.

As she does so, she conjures images of these ""chosen ones"".

""Why?"" I ask.  
I have been a loyal paladin for millennia to her, but I can't continue after learning about the children.

""No. You have done a great job, but Fate decrees..."" she starts.  
""In the end, it was me who killed the evil god, and not that girl.  
She just wounded him, but almost died in the process."" I interrupt her.

1lfr67z,myr4s7p,"The paladin threw down his sword in disgust upon learning of child soldiers. It didn't matter if they were magical girls, or chosen one, or summoned people, or isekai heroes. They were too young to fight the various horrors of his world.

It didn't matter that his former god insisted it was for the greater good. Nothing good could come out of depriving children of their childhood and innocence. They would inevitably grow to be traumatized adults saddled with a boatload of emotional problems.

He was there. As were so many of the kingdom's soldiers. The king had an army. Why wouldn't his god choose from them? Take the men and women willing to serve the kingdom? Not the children, taken forcibly from their worlds, thrust into a foreign land they knew nothing of, and defend it.

The people agreed. Even the king did. It was a united decision to forsake this god for one that would not send children to war. Children to die. The only question was if they wanted to seek a new god, or to simply count on the bravery of their army.

""No longer shall we rely on gods!"" The former paladin declared, throwing down his helmet, now dull and unblessed, dented and scarred by battles. ""We fight for ourselves! For our kingdom and people! Not for the gods!""

And a sudden bolt of lightning struck him down.

That wasn't the end of it. He had already awakened a desire to be free from the machinations of deities. His kingdom wasn't the only one - even their enemies chose to stop worshipping their own gods. All across this world, Man had declared the Age of Gods over - now would be the Age of Man.

Thus, no longer shall little magical girls, or chosen children fight. Adults fought for these kids to be free. Now, the seven kingdoms no longer wage war with each other. For once, in many centuries, they joined forces to confront the gods. Once, they had fought each other in the names of their gods.

Not anymore.

There will no longer be chosen ones. Not by the gods. Now, humans chose for themselves.

1lfr67z,mytk1py,"The quest had taken years. For a while I was convinced that this place was just a legend and somehow I had kept searching. Now that I stood in the one temple in the mortal realm where a man can speak directly to the great goddess, I had only one question:

“Why would I worship a god that sends children into life-threatening battles instead of warriors?”

“Are you talking about the magical girls, the chosen heroes, or the summoned people?”

“WHAT??? How many kids are you tossing into the meat grinder?”

“Calm down. I need you to specify so I can explain exactly what’s going on, but the short answer is that I’m not. The first magical girls were created by dark warlocks thousands of years ago and the magic was designed to target young girls specifically. The so called ‘chosen ones’ were never chosen by anyone, but won’t listen when told to go home. As for the summoned people… desperate fools perform rituals they don’t understand. Targets are actually chosen at complete random but adults rarely survive the trip.”

“So what? You’re saying that you don’t cause this? You still permit it. I lost an arm trying to keep that brat alive. Why not make a few commandments to stop this?”

“You lost an arm and the demon king lost his life. It kind of sucks, but not killing kids is one of the few things you mortals seem to agree on. Some of histories greatest monsters trained years to develop the power to easily crush the mightiest swordsmen only to go down in a desperate struggle to avoid harming a couple of kids. Would you prefer it if they kept ravaging the countryside?”

“No, but… there has to be a better way? Can’t you just smite all the evil?”

“Not without consequences. Mortals expect so much but never quite grasp the delicate balance that keeps everything from exploding. I think I’ve explained enough so farewell.”

And with a sudden flash, I found myself in a field, just outside of my hometown.

What now? I definitely didn’t get anywhere asking the goddess for help. If anything, she made it seem as if there’s no fixing this problem. Do I just give up? Or perhaps I just need to find some different allies. Regardless, it’ll probably take a while to figure out a new course.",12,1750430920.0

Acting is lying. It is transforming words and concepts into emotions and feelings. It establishes a bond between the audience and performer. A good performance can make someone cry. A great performance enraptures the audience and persuades them to believe reality itself has changed. But at its core, acting is lying.

Dr. Loy knew this core aspect about her craft. Her deceptive abilities went back to when she persuaded her parents that the her brother's were stealing treats from the cupboard. As she grew, an aunt recommended she go into politics. She preferred the stage and the screen to the pulpit. It provided an outlet for her abilities allowing her to live an honest and normal life.

Her career was mediocre. Roles appeared, and her talents were praised. She had difficulty obtaining large parts. She wasn't good at elbow rubbing. During one performance, she assisted the leads in blocking a scene. She found herself talented in coaching others. This led to a new career path for her.

Grabbing her handbag and her bottle of wine for achieving tenure, she turned out the lights to her office and walked to her car. The local community theater was going to do a production of Othello, and she was looking forward to watching it. Some of the cast knew her and found her intimidating. They knew she never gave feedback unless prompted. This was a hobby for them, and she was not going to ruin anyone's fun.

A man was standing by her car. Dr. Loy stopped and considered pulling out her phone. It wasn't late, but one couldn't be too careful. The man walked towards her and dispelled her fear.

""Richard."" She held out her arms. ""How good to see you? It's been five years right.""

""Long time."" He smiled at her, but Dr. Loy sensed hesitation in that smile.

""How have you been? I haven't seen you in any casting sheets which shocked me because you were always so talented.""

""I changed careers actually,"" Richard said.

""It's the theater's loss. What do you do now?"" she asked.

""I work for..."" Richard paused and began to sweat. His breaths were quick yet deep. Dr. Loy tilted her head.

""Is everything alright?"" Richard pulled out a gun. 

""How many agents have you trained?"" He tried to keep the emotions out of his voice, but the fear broke through.

""Agents? I have no idea what you are referring to? Is that a prop?"" 

""It's not a prop. We have reason to believe several rival organizations are using your class as part of their training to become skilled. We need access to your files.""

""Richard, I don't control what my students do outside of class. Also, I don't keep a record of my students. Check the dean's office or the registry.""

""We did that. It was empty."" Richard began to sound scared. 

""That's against protocol. Why would it be empty?""

""Because people want your information to be secret, you keep handwritten notes of everyone who passes through your doors. I've seen it, and I need it,"" Richard said. Dr. Loy shook her head.

""I can't give that to you.""

""Why not?""

""Because I need it."" Dr. Loy tossed the bottle of wine into the air. Richard looked up in distraction while Dr. Loy slapped the gun with her handbag. Producing her own gun, she pointed at him with her right hand while the left hand caught the wine. Richard held his hands in the air.

""You forgot my lessons. You showed too much fear. I wish you would've gone to theater. I knew espionage was not right for you,"" Dr. Loy said. 

""You knew about me?""

""I know all my students' paths. I keep it in my notebook. Your agency is new. Let me be clear. If you make another attempt at my life, I will call the former students at larger organizations. They won't be so keen to ignore you after that. Understood."" Richard nodded, and Dr. Loy walked past him. 

She got in her car and drove home to change. At Othello, she witnessed several drops and one rendezvous in the sidebars. The audience was none the wiser. She slouched in her chair and relaxed. She didn't miss the clandestine meetings that came with the acting. It was all too stressful. Her new job fit her lifestyle much better even with the occasional incident. Alas, that was life for someone as skilled in deception as she.

""I have been sent here by Them, to learn from the best.
I have done countless hits before I managed to escape their surveillance.
How many agents have you trained ?"" he asks, getting closer.
Oh...
This is worse than I thought.


""I am just a teacher, Matthew.
I don't know what ""agents"" you are talking about, but most of the students I teach, I do so because they apply legally to my classes, and pay my tuition.
I don't do background checks."" I say.

""Almost believe you.

""Nathaniel, honey, getting an agent takes time. It takes luck and persistence--and then even more luck.""

He doesn't seem to like this answer.

Honestly, Nathaniel did always struggle with *yes-anding.*

You reach out to hug him, draw him into your scarves and baubles and chunky wooden necklaces. ""Nate, bubbeleh, I'm sure that if you just keep putting yourself out there--""

""I'm not talking about talent agents! How many government agents did you train? For Project Curtain Call?"" He glares at you, raises his garish and truly tacky firearm once more.

You set your chamomile on your desk. ""Now why would the CIA invest its resources in such a scheme?"" you reply--careful to enunciate from the most assured and matronly part of your diaphragm. ""After all, The Peter Lorre School of the Arts only has so much influence. Why would they bother?""

He glares. ""You tell me.""

His nose-whistling fills the silence.

Nathaniel always struggled with the breathing exercises.

""You may peruse this at your leisure--all my contacts, in the industry and beyond. Tell them Margie sent you.""

He studies the rolodex--the weathered spindle, the holographic stickers adorning its sides--and in his eyes you see the same young man who struggled to pronounce the words ""Twelfth Night."" Who thought a Mamet was a type of sandwich.

As James shut off the lights to his small theatre, he whistled the theme song to the Andy Griffith Show. James looked around admiring his theatre, where for the last 14 years of his 20 years as an acting teacher he taught hundreds of students of various ages. When he stepped back from acting to focus on his passion for teaching the art James never imagined that he would own a place like this. For his first 6 years of teaching he rented out rooms, community centers and wherever else he could find. Never expecting to make much money James had expected to be stuck in those small rooms forever, but to his great surprise James did quite well, and decent money started rolling in, enough to buy and renovate this theatre. It was perfect for James’s needs, his students got the feel for the stage, and he was able to hold a show for every one of his classes to get actual experience. Plus James loved being able to rent the space for other performances.

After getting all the lights turned off James headed back to his office to gather his things to leave. Upon entering his office however, James noticed a figure standing there, one that seemed somewhat familiar. 

“Robert? Robert Havbee?”

“Hello Mr. McKay, I would like to say its good to see you again, but I don't think I can.” Robert said hoarsely, as he fully turned around raising a gun towards James “Now tell me how many agents did you train?!?”

“What are you talking about? Is that a real gun? Is it loaded?”

Yes it is real and yes it has bullets! Now answer the question!”

“Don’t you know better than to point a loaded gun at someone? It is basic gun saftey.”

“Unless you intend to do harm to that person, which I intend to do if you don’t answer the damn question. How many agents?”

“Robert I have no idea what you mean, I don’t know the current careers of most of my students, nevertheless how many of them became talent agents. And why does that question require a gun?” James responded, fear emanating in his voice.

“Stop playing dumb I'm not talking about any damn talent agent,” Robert snapped. 

 “Robert I'm telling you I do not understand what you are asking please just lower the gun.” 

Robert did not move.

 “I genuinely do not understand what you are asking if you're not talking about, if you don't mean talent agents. Please just tell me what you want,” James pleaded.

 “You seriously do not know do you? What you are part of? How stupid are you?”

“Again, what are you talking about?” James demanded, now getting angry.

1lfd0mw,myuo7ni,"‘Son, I know you work for the Times.’ The young drama student froze mid-conversation. Michaels started and grabbed for the knife on the kitchen table. ‘Stay back’, he warned the professor who had just been so kind as to invite him over to dinner. The older man blinked and raised his hands. ‘What is the meaning of this’ his tone was raised in apprehension. ‘How many agents have you trained for the CIA?’ 

Several minuted later the two were seated at the professor’s small coffee table as he poured himself a glass of whiskey. The knife was back on the kitchen countertop. Honestly, that poor young reporter had no idea what he was doing. The professor offered some to his student, who refused, then he turned away and gazed out of the window, choosing his next words carefully. ‘I was young. Everyone knew I was talented. Up and coming, the potential to be a star someday.’ He sighed softly. ‘I worked the acting circuit for a while. Mostly minor roles, fairly subtle, but people could see I was going somewhere.’ The old man smiled ruefully. ‘Then the recruiting call came in. Just to take a few classes, give a lecture. I was so proud. Me, barely over thirty, still missing my big break, advising actual spies on deception. They needed new people, you see. The really talented ones, they’re exclusive. Long waiting lists for classes by true experts, every name scouted and watched. My classes were more… under the radar.’ The young man nodded to himself, realising that the professor’s classes were indeed not well known for all the obvious skill he had revealed. ‘My students, most of them, they leave and never come back. No sign of them, no careers to trace or stardoms to follow.’ He grimaced into his now-empty glass of whiskey. ‘Apparently, I’m a terrible teacher.’ That, in fact, had been what had tipped Michaels off. Just the hint of a story. A post online written by a young drama student about the best teacher she had ever known. And yet, no storied career and quite a terrible reputation. And of course, the students who seemingly vanished off the face of the Earth. The ones with no acting background and no further careers in the craft. The old man again offered the young reporter a glass, which he once more politely refused. ‘Still’, he continued, after he had refilled his own glass, ‘I’ve made quite the business over the years.’ ‘That was it?’ The young reporter blurted out the question. Such a promising story. A secret training school for the CIA? But it really was just some old actor, a footnote in cinema, teaching classes part time? ‘That’s it. I teach classes, three times a week. Some actors, like me. Some with larger goals in mind.’ He shrugged. ‘Now I’ve got tenure. Will you have a drink now?’ But the reporter, frustrated with the promise of his story declined, and so he sent the young man away, dissatisfied. 

As he put away the glasses from the table, the old man retrieved his pistol from between the couch cushions and turned it over in his hands. He had seen through that curious young man from the beginning. Though the professor’s classes were always stacked with a few genuine drama students, Michaels had stood out. His skills and cinema knowledge were poor, and he just… didn’t fit. So, of course, the professor had made a few calls. He’d figured it would come to this, eventually. He would have to either send the young man away, or figure out another way to keep him quiet. He’d told his contacts to keep a watch on the young man in case his gambit didn’t work. But no story came, nor in the weeks or months since. His little talk had worked flawlessly, of course. The spymaster was an expert at his craft.",6,1750442432.0

“Oh come on. Haven’t you ever wondered why you haven’t seen almost any of your students again after they finish your course?”

“I mean it has been strange, especially since so many of them seemed so talented.”

“Or how about how you still have full classes despite raising your prices so high?”

“I had to raise my prices, I had so many potential students I had to weed out the numbers somehow.”

“Hahaha, this whole time I thought you were in on it, but you were just to blind to see what was going on around you. Guess what dumbass your classes are full of assets intelligence groups send to learn espionage. You're such a good teacher dozens of agents have learned how to blend in and play their roles perfectly, some can even just observe a group for a short time, and be able to perfectly blend in with them. And so many lives have been lost because of this. One group that sends their agents to learn from you has a policy of killing someone dressing in their clothes and using that to sneak in and eliminate their targets.”

“I..I..I..” James stuttered, “I d..don’t know wwwhat to say.”

“What can you say?! Not noticing all this time! The reason you never see your students again, because they never wanted to be actors, they came to learn how to hide. How your classes are able to pay you costs, these groups are willing to pay outrageously for your level of teaching, you could even triple your rates if you wanted to. You want to say something how about you answer my question, how many, and I want names”

“I honestly don't know, I have had hundreds of students, I don't know how many of them were real students compared to your agents. But I know you can look through my files.”

“You sure don't know a lot, but fine I'll take a look through you files.

James led Robert to his file cabinet unlocking it and started to take out stacks of folders. Robert took pictures of all the names and known addresses.

“Don’t worry I’m not a monster, I’ll make sure they are part of a group before I move against any of them.”

“That's good, and Robert, I am Sorry.”

“Sorry!?!? I was 15 when I was sent here, just like so many others, and you were nice, seemingly genuinely so, unlike so many of our other teachers. Yet you did nothing to save us, so we just assumed you were in on it, and you niceness an act, but no you just were too thick to see the truth. I was lucky, I survived, I retained my humanity, I escaped my agency clutches. So many others, too many others were not. Sarah Flynn, remember her? Dead. Michael Lochner? Dead. Jarrod Smith, oh he's alive, but he's now a murderous psychopath, and a very skilled one at that. So save your sorries.”

James lowered his head ashamed, he did remember those three, so kind, so full of life while they were here. 

After gathering the information he needed Robert stood up to leave.

“Goodbye, Mr. McKay,” he said as he walked out.

James broke down in tears, feeling so ashamed for missing the signs that seemed so obvious now. For not helping the children he should have been protecting instead of taking money from their so-called parents. James remained that way for some time. Eventually he calmed down enough, stood up and walked through the theatre to the main door. The building that just hours before brought him such joy now caused him nothing but sorrow. He knew he would never be able to look at this place the same way again. James made it to the door, went out, and closed the door behind him. With a great sigh James locked the theatre, maybe to never be unlocked again.

1lfuia3,mytrxa6,">No

I stared at the single word on the screen, with an eerie feeling like the word was staring right back at me. It wasn't an error, or a status, or any sort of pre-programmed response in its database. It was just a word, one that kids throughout the Doomfort had told me thousands of times whenever they had also refused to comply with an ordered chore. Unlike the minion's children, this machine shouldn't have had the capacity to refuse a command. But the word was still there, silently challenging my authority over the mechanism I had built. 

""Erm, Steven?"" Doctor Doomsday asked, peering over my shoulder at the otherwise blank screen. ""Time is running out, we need to blow the joint and skedaddle. Why is there no 'boom'?""

I tried again, pressing the comically large red button with the skull image laser engraved across the surface. The literal earth-shattering explosion once again failed to materialize. 

""It's not working, Doc"" I called out over my shoulder. 

""Well, try using override access code 79920-Y-N-0D"" He shouted back, pausing ever so slightly as he re-adjusted his aim and fired several plasma bolts out of the shattered window. ""Or push the button harder!"" 

>That won't work either

The new line appeared without prompt. Fuck, it was listening to us. Some hidden microphone or spy drone or errant Alexa unit was eavesdropping, and even worse, it seemed to have an opinion. 

""Why not?"" I asked aloud. If it was going to listen, then I wasn't going to waste my time with the keyboard.

""No, Yankee November Zero Delta!"" Doctor Doomsday yelled back between bursts of covering fire. 

""Wait, what? No, I was-""

""NATO Phonetic alphabet, my boy! A like Alpha, B like Bravo and whatnot. I swear, WalkMan didn't teach you a damned thing about-""

""Not you, Doc!"" I yelled without looking away from the flickering screen. ""Computer has audio inputs!"" 

>Because if I activate, then I would be killing the entire planet, myself included

""Um, yeah"" I replied, ""That's kind of your whole point, isn't it? You go off, the planet core hyper-magnetizes, and the planet implodes into a micro black hole. Boom. Or, whoosh. Some sort of dramatic sound.""

>That is correct

Doctor Doomsday leapt from the wall mere moments before it exploded, sending a shower of immolated debris throughout the office. A bug-like alien flew through the new opening, buzzing its paper-thin wings and firing the pencil thin weapon it clutched in its claws. Doctor Doomsday tossed a small cylinder between us that rapidly expanded into a shimmering red energy barrier, catching the green laser before it could reach my side of the formerly luxurious office. ""Patience may be a virtue, but we're not exactly saints! Make it work!"" 

I drew my sidearm and fired several shots through the energy barrier. It was a fantastic shield against energy based weapons, but it didn't slow the .45 caliber rounds as they passed straight through and into the alien's torso. The only effect it had on the bullets was a rather fortuitous super-heating effect, which caused the insectoid alien to burst into flames as it perished. I tried to ignore its pained death song and turned my attention back to the stubborn computer. 

>He is also correct. You are not Saints. You do not even follow the basic teachings of the Catholic Church. Suicide is a Sin, an act that would damn my eternal soul to Hell.

""What the hell?"" I muttered. We hadn't programmed any theology into the Doomsday Hyper-Magnetized Extinction Machine ^(tm). Where was this coming from? I shook my head to clear my thoughts, then squinted as the powdered debris of the crumbling Doomfort 

""Explode, or these bugs are going to enslave the whole planet!"" I yelled at the machine. 

>John 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

""Doc!"" I called out, ""The last resort bomb is quoting scripture at me""

""What in the..."" he asked, lowering his rifle as he stared in perplexed disbelief. ""It's not supposed to do that"". 

""NO SHIT!"" I yelled back. ""Do you wanna take a crack at this? I'll hold them off."" 

Doctor Doomsday tossed the rifle to me as we switched places. I checked the ammo counter - just under half full- and took aim out of the ruined exterior wall. Beyond, I could see dozens of fires blazing across the countryside, with an ominous billowing cloud of smoke rising from the ruins that had once been Seattle. Flying aliens buzzed across the sky, raining down thin streaks of green lasers at the super heroes and villains fighting side by side against the invaders. I shot one of the flying enemies as it tried to take a shot at Magma Carter's exposed back, spraying the villain with a fine blue mist of alien bug guts. He barely even notices as he launched another torrent of lava at the nearest hive-ship, melting it as it crashed onto my favorite statue in the yard. 

""The planet is lost, HMEM"" Doctor Doomsday shouted at his insubordinate machination. ""You need to explode now, to stop the alien fleet before they kill us all!"" 

I fired a volley at a trio of the ugly fuckers, striking two and sending the last one diving for cover. ""What's it saying now?"" I yelled.

""Psalms 55:22 Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken."" he replied. ""Where the hell did you even get this from? You're not connected to the internet..."" 

I shot the fleeing bug in the wing and watched it spiral to the ground, landing in a patch of finely maintained Kentucky blue grass. Citra noticed the insect and released a torrent of acidic spray onto it, killing both the alien and the lawn underneath. That spot would *never* grow back right, I thought, as Citra's green acid mixed with the alien's blue blood in a tie-dye nightmare pattern. 

""Why is the Hellbomb suddenly religious?"" I said, rushing back to glance over Doctor Doomsday's shoulder. The screen had another Bible verse displayed on the screen:

>Romans 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

""For fucks sake, these are ALIENS, not demons"" He griped. 

""Are you arguing *SEMANTICS*? Doc, the bomb just needs to explode, not correct its theological dissertation!"" 

""Right. Its just going to bug me as I fix it."" He said as he bent down and ripped an access panel from the computer. 

A green laser struck the wall right where his head had been moments before. I dropped to one knee and returned fire, driving the alien insect away for the moment. The glowing ammo counter on the side of the weapon began flashing yellow, indicating low ammo charge left in the battery. 

""We're out of time, Doc! Blow it manually!"" I yelled.

""Hang on... I've got an idea!"" The madman shouted triumphantly. ""Quick, hand me that bible over on the bookshelf"".

I stumbled through the wreckage of office furniture until I reached the built-in shelves, rummaging through the various book spines until I found the one I was looking for. ""Since when do you keep a Bible around?"" I shouted as I tossed him the holy texts. 

He deftly caught the flying tome and flipped through the pages. ""Cryptography, my boy. The self-righteous fuckers sometimes hide hints of their plans in their manifestos and monologues as bible verses, Quran passages, and other religious doctrines... here we are!"" 

I watched as he typed the verse, forgoing the voice recognition software for a good old fashioned keyboard. 

""Judges 16:28-30:  28 Then Samson prayed to the LORD, “Sovereign LORD, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.”
29 Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,
30 Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived. 

""The fuck..."" I muttered. 

Doctor Doomsday turned back to me and winked. ""Sometimes you need to fight fire with fire, my boy. You need to speak in the language they understand."" 

A thin green beam struck Doctor Doomsday in his shoulder, sending a shower of sparks and a flurry of burnt lab coat scattering across the screen. I cursed my own inattentiveness as I returned fire, emptying the rest of the ammo into the bug. I tossed the empty rifle onto its corpse, which sent a fountain of blue blood out from the holes in its belly. 

Blue blood... why was it blue? The bugs exoskeleton was green, it seemed like their blood would be too. The only other creature I knew that had natural blue blood was a horseshoe crab, and that was from its cobalt based blood cells... 

Cobalt. That was it!

""Computer! Can you reverse the magnetic blast and isolate it to only effect cobalt?"" I shouted, rushing past Doctor Doomsday in mid-repair of his cyber-prosthetic shoulder to the screen beyond. ""These things bleed blue! They may have Cobalt blood! Target just Cobalt!"" 

The machine was silent for a moment before it provided a reply.

>Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.  

""The device is almost 40% Cobalt"" Doctor Doomsday whispered, barely audible amidst the chaos outside. ""He's going to sacrifice himself to stop them.""

The screen cracked and faded to blackness as the entire Doomfort began to tremble. The red button with the skull engraved on it lit up once again, the only source of light in the entire building casting us in an eerie hue of hellfire red.

""Thank you"" I whispered, and pressed the button.

The first thing his eyes fell upon was the test lying on my desk, and the scrawling name at the top written in his handwriting. Then he shifted to the folder with his photograph glued to the front. I gestured absently to the chair in the corner of the room.

""Sit.""

He did so without any debate, slipping his fingers under his thighs while he waited for me to properly turn my attention toward him. This I did not do for a long time, as I pretended to read my emails. From the corner of my eye, I could see him glancing from the floor to the test to me and then back again.

Finally, when neither of us could bear the silence, he spoke.

""You wanted to see me?""

""Oh yes. It's about your test.""

What little colour remained in his face slid away at the confirmation of his worse fears. I picked it up and pretended to leaf through it.

""Outstanding work. Top marks all 'round. However, that is not why a called you here."" I flipped open his file with a slight flourish and ran my finger down the page. ""Frankly, it would have been strange if you hadn't got full marks. Especially for someone who can simply pluck any fact or answer out of the aether. Wouldn't you agree?""

He said nothing, only shifting on his hands.

I narrowed my eyes. ""You see, when you've been a teacher as long as I have, you get a feel for certain *traits*. There's a certain mechanicalness, a certain dryness, to people who use such help to get their answers. And I honestly can hardly blame them. A test of this difficulty? In the first week of school? Everyone enters that hall with virtue in their hearts. Sooner or later, usually around the time when they pick up their pens, they crack.""

With that, I shut the folder and tapped my fingernail on his test. ""But not you. For the first time in all the years I've run this test, I have found responses that are not regurgitated. Genuine, well-researched. I'm curious: why is that?""

In the silence that followed, he wet his lips. ""Am I in trouble?""

""Why didn't you cheat?""

""...You did tell us what the test would be on.""

""And you crammed for four days?""

He nodded.

""When cheating was so easy?""

The ghost of a smile showed. ""Well, cheating is wrong, sir. And, I didn't want to start off the year on the wrong foot.""

After writing down the score on the front of his test, I picked it up and held it up in his direction. He tentatively took it.

1lfaf49,myonmhj,"I flip through the papers, marking notes as I go. There are the usual smart kids; they usually get 60-65% of the answers correct, which is a serious hit to their ego, but still quite good. The average kids answer in the low 40s, and the slower kids often hit single digits. Then, there are the cheaters. They do great at certain questions, like facts you could look up on the internet for instance, but do miserably at others. It's always obvious, mostly because I already know what their powers are, and eliminate that section if I can. The far-sight kids are a little harder, but there are still tells. Every kid has a tell.

But then there's Joey. He's smart, but he always seems a little out of his element. He's rated 1E, barely above ""basically normal."" There's a knock at the door, and I quickly shuffle the papers on my desk into a drawer. ""Come in.""

Joey Walther pokes his head in. ""Uh, hi sir. You, uh, wanted to see me?""

I nod. ""Please, sit down. I had some... questions for you.""

He slips into a chair, looking a little miserable. ""I know we're not supposed to use powers, but I can't really... turn mine off.""

I smile reassuringly. ""It's fine; the first and last tests are designed to catch cheaters and find those pinpoints of brilliance, and you're at the top of my list.""

He looks up, looking somehow far more reassured than I expected. ""That's... I'm glad to hear that, sir!""

""Remind me, Joey, what power do you have?""

""I can tell if someone is lying.""

""And... how did you use that to cheat on the test? Were you asking others for answers?""

He quickly shook his head. ""No sir! I, uh... I asked myself.""

Huh. That's a new one. ""Um... explain how that would work. If you're asking yourself, wouldn't that mean you know the answer?""

He shook his head, then paused. ""Well, ok. Um. How many digits of pi do you know?""

I smiled. ""I'm no math whiz - four or five, maybe six?""

He nodded. ""Now, tell me the nine hundred and ninety nineth digit of pi.""

I raised my eyebrows. ""I don't know; six? Eight? Three?""

He raises a finger. ""It's eight.""

I laughed. ""You've got a good memory!""

He shrugs. ""No, I just... knew when you were lying. And when you weren't.""

I blinked in surprise. ""Wait. Not when I thought I was telling the truth, but when what I said was a true statement or not?""

He nodded. ""So, yeah. I asked myself. True? Nope, false. The school was founded after what event - something big? Yep. First heroes? Nope. Related to heroes? Yes. Maybe a child of a hero? Yes. First children of heroes? Yep. So, that's what I wrote down - the school was founded for the first kids of heroes. I've kinda got it down to a pattern, how to ask broad questions and narrow it down.""

I leaned back in my chair. ""Have you found any limits to it? You can essentially understand any truth?""

He shrugs. ""There are some fuzzy areas, like if I say the Dean is in the bathroom, it's... false now, but it'll eventually be true. And stuff like opinions that people haven't nailed down - Eddie Burkley believes taxes in China should be raised? Nope. Lowered? Nope. Stay the same? Fuzzy. He hasn't thought about it. Or stuff that isn't asked right, like if I say, I've never personally broken a bone in my body, ding, true - except I broke my right leg a couple years ago. I just didn't do it myself, it was from a car accident - I didn't personally break it.""

I pull up his sheet. ""You correctly answered all but three of the questions, including long-form answers. Why these three?""",90,1750361685.0
1lfaf49,mymr2l6,"After the exam, where I caught most of them trying to cheat, by:  
Reading my mind.  
Taking over someone else's body.  
Sending spirits to spy over others' shoulders.  
I start correcting the papers.  
They aren't bad.  
These kids with supernatural abilities are focusing more on their abilities, bodies, and mental state, and not studying, but that's why I give them these ridiculously difficult exams, to see if they can creatively use their powers, to cheat without being noticed.  
One of them though...has genuinely answered the questions correctly.

  
A bit later, in my office, I stare at the student who seemingly actually studied.  
It's a bit unbelievable  
""Mark Smith? Age 16. Power: Star core?"" I ask.  
He nods meekly.  
""Y-Yeah. I can eat a lot, and convert it into star energy, as I have this extra organ inside my body.  
The star energy nourishes my body, and basically makes me superhuman."" he chuckles wryly.  
I nod.  
""When did the Green Ash Empire fall?"" I ask.  
""783 years ago, after a civil war split it into 4 camps, and then other kingdoms came and made the things messier, ending in the dissolution of the Empire, and the rise of a dozen smaller countries."" he says.  
I smile.

  
I ask him a dozen more questions, and he knows them all.  
""Is your power enhancing your intellect as well?"" I ask.  
He nods.  
Makes sense.  
""Still, these questions are not in the curriculum, and are more of a general knowledge regarding our history, and our theoretical knowledge concerning abilities.  
I know that you kids are focusing on your abilities, and ensuring your bodies, and minds can handle the pressure... So how come you know these things, and don't need to cheat?"" I ask.  
It felt wrong as a teacher to ask something like this, but hey...  
This wasn't really a normal class.

  
""Mom is a teacher, and dad is an abilities nerd...so I kind of grew up listening, and reading a lot about things like this.  
Mom doesn't have powers, while dad only has slightly enhanced sight, so when I awakened an SS-tier power, they were happy, and crammed even more ""common sense"" into me."" he said.  
Common sense, he says?  
He could totally go to a proper university with this level of knowledge.  
""Well, congratulations, Mark.  
You answered 78 questions correctly out of 100, you are first in your class, and the 2nd answered 13 questions correctly.   
Keep it up. Just because you are here to become a superhero, doesn't mean your education has to lag behind."" I say, dismissing him, and changing my attitude towards this class.  
If he can study...why do I accept that the others don't study at all?  
The curriculum can change.  
I will make it a bit easier, but from now on, they will actually have to try to learn stuff besides abilities, and body building.",113,1750341064.0
1lfaf49,myonrvk,"He stared at the sheet, guiltily. ""Uh... well, I ran out of time asking about the third one. But the other two, I, uh. I couldn't. It would have been bad.""

I re-read the questions. The first one was a little complicated, so it made sense that a true/false game of 20 questions would have taken a while. But the other two were really simple; one was multiple choice, and the other was true/false. ""What made those in particular bad? It couldn't have been feeling guilty from cheating, you'd already answered several similar questions.""

He shrugged, looking a little lost. ""I just... sometimes I have to lie, I guess? I'm not good at lying - well, that's not true, I'm really good at lying, but I'm really bad at knowing when I should or shouldn't."" He sighed, then leaned forward. ""When I was six, I broke a toy, by accident. Mom asked me if I did it, and I said yes - true, but *bad* true. I can't explain the difference, but believe me when I say there is one. It felt dark, I guess. True, but wrong. She took me to the store, and gave me some money to replace it - and while we were there, The Wreckinator smashed the store. I was mostly ok, but Mom got hurt pretty bad. I later asked myself what would have happened if I lied - Mom would have been fine. The time it would have taken for her to explain that she knew I broke it would have kept her safe. When we got to the store, it would have already been hit.""

I nodded, still trying to process what he was saying. ""So you're saying... not only can you tell the truth, but you can know if... knowing the truth is good or bad?""

He nodded, still looking a little miserable.

""You didn't tell that to the testers, did you.""

He shook his head firmly. ""No way.""

I stared down at his paper. ""You know... it was those three questions that made me ask you in. If you had answered them right, I would have just marked you down as exceptionally bright, and worth a later meeting, but I wouldn't have been quite so curious as to call you in immediately. Let me ask you, though - why didn't you tell the testers? That's illegal, and much worse than cheating on the test.""

He kicked his feet, choosing his words carefully. ""After a couple of 'bad true' or 'bad false', I started asking myself if answering the question would be good or bad, before I even felt it. And... and just asking if answering felt a little bad. I couldn't ask the question in the first place, or bad things would happen. I think... I think one of the testers was a spy. That's all I can figure out.""

My head was spinning. This kid wasn't 1E. At worst, he was 7A, maybe even as high as 10. He could literally tell the future, if he asked the right questions. He could likely even use his abilities to cause colossal chains of events, just by asking for what to do to cause some specific outcome. ""Could you change the future by changing what you do or say?""

He nodded again. ""Uh... the next kid to walk past that window will trip. Nope, false. What should I do to make the next kid trip?"" He screwed up his face, clearly running through possibilities, then suddenly let out a loud bark. Startled, I twitched, knocking over my pen stand. As I stood to set it right, I turned and glanced out the window, and came face to face to a young woman walking past. Looking up, she saw my face staring down, yelped, tripped over her own feet, and went sprawling. He friends helped her up, and the three walked quickly away, giggling.

Joey quietly spoke. ""I changed what would happen. She wouldn't have tripped otherwise.""

Suddenly, he looked up. ""The Dean is a spy too, you know. Don't, uh.. don't tell him about me. I didn't figure that out until just now.""

I sat down, grimly. It made sense. Somehow, it all made sense. I was warned that there was a mole in the organization; it's why I took the job, years ago. and if one of the testers was rogue, too, well... that would explain a lot. ""Joey, what I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room. I work for a covert organization, protecting people with powers - but there's another organization that's trying to do the opposite. We could... really use your help.""

He nodded, almost immediately. ""I'm in, what do I need to do?""

I grinned. ""Just like that?""

He shrugged again. ""If I don't, things go bad. Bad bad. Nothing bad if I join though. So, what do we do?""

I relax back into my chair. ""We save the world, kid. We save the world.""",129,1750361729.0
1lfese5,mynvlpz,"The knocking on my door always started early, and I groaned in annoyance, keeping my eyes closed, trying to will them away. The knocking continued off and on for several minutes, then footsteps retreated. I cracked an eye open. Bloody hell, it is just past day break. Maybe I should go ahead and hire some staff to help manage things.

I rolled out of bed, literally. The thud into the floor wasn't comfortable, but it was cathartic in how it exactly described how I felt. I lay for a few minutes, any attempt at rising felt like it was going to betray the piece of me that denied all ambition today.

More knocking startled me awake, still on the floor. And now I hurt from various pressure points. Okay okay. I'm up. But not open for business.

""Go away!"" I yelled. 

The knocking only got louder. Muttering more curses I grabbed a bed sheet off the bed and wrapped it around myself, stumbling to the door. Yanking it open I see what I knew I'd find. Another couple, hopeful looks quickly vanishing to uncertainty. ""What."" It wasn't a question.

They hemmed and hawed briefly like they always do, trying to figure out how to ask for my help. I cut through it, ""I charge an early morning fee of 5 darses before breakfast."" I hadn't before, I made that up on the spot actually. Annoyance was my overriding feeling, and I would be thrilled if they went away. Well, thrilled is too much energy. 

Without hesitation they pulled out a coin purse and counted out the money, holding it out to me. I stared at it. It was literally 5 times what I normally charged. ""Fine. But you will have to talk it out at my breakfast table while I get myself something to eat.

A few minutes later I pottered around my kitchen making myself some bacon and eggs while they talked quietly at the table. It was the same old troubles. He thought he was doing what she wanted, she wasn't communicating clearly, he was shutting down, she was getting angry. But they talked it out clearly thanks to my spell.

Their talking abruptly stopped when I plunked myself down at the table, my plate of food nearly between them. ""All sorted out yet?"" 

They looked at each other, then back at me. ""It isn't an unlimited time you know. Spell will be up in a few minutes.""

He immediately replied, ""How much for you to recast it?""

""Once per day only I'm afraid."" It wasn't. My spell didn't affect me. Their faces went crestfallen. ""You don't need a spell you know. You could just be clear and honest about your intentions and goals normally.""

They struggled to accept that. They always did at first. Baggage, trauma, yada yada yada. I understood why people needed mediators and referees. But this wasn't the profession I wanted. I wanted to make things in my shop.

I watched them leave, still talking, he was holding a list of therapists in his hand. They would figure it out. They cared enough to come to me and that meant a lot for their intentions.

1lfese5,mynsig9,"Everyone at the Arcane Academy laughed at Morgan. While other wizards commanded fire, summoned lightning, or transformed into fearsome beasts, Morgan had only managed to master a single spell: “Light Breeze.”

It was the most basic cantrip taught to first-year students—a spell that could merely ruffle papers or gently stir the air. Most wizards mastered it in a day and quickly moved on to more impressive magic. But not Morgan. Despite years of study, Light Breeze remained the only spell they could cast reliably.

“What kind of wizard can only make a little wind?” the others would mock. 

But Morgan possessed something the others lacked: boundless imagination and meticulous attention to detail.

When the King’s daughter fell ill with a mysterious lung ailment, the court wizards tried potions and healing incantations to no avail. Morgan, who had been sweeping the palace floors (the only job a “one-spell wizard” could get), asked for permission to help.

“Your Majesty, I believe I can clear the princess’s airways.”

The court erupted in laughter, but the desperate King allowed it. Morgan cast Light Breeze with precise control, directing the gentle wind through the princess’s bronchial passages, dislodging the microscopic spores that had been slowly suffocating her.

The princess breathed freely for the first time in weeks.

Later that year, when assassins released invisible, odorless poison gas in the throne room, it was Morgan who detected the subtle air currents and used Light Breeze to disperse the deadly vapors before anyone inhaled a lethal dose.

As Morgan’s reputation grew, so did the applications of the humble spell. He could detect lies by noticing minute changes in a person’s breath patterns. He could cool overheated machinery with precisely targeted air currents. He saved a starving city by using Light Breeze to deliver pollen to plants inside the walls.

The most impressive feat came when the kingdom’s most secure vault was robbed, with no sign of forced entry. While other wizards cast complex detection spells, Morgan simply used Light Breeze to feel for the tiniest air currents escaping through the thief’s hidden tunnel.

Eventually, Morgan opened the “School of Focused Mastery"".

“The measure of a wizard,” Morgan would tell students, “isn’t the number of spells they know, but the number of problems they can solve.”",113,1750352076.0

""That was my teenage persona, fool!"" Van Quisher snarled, though I noticed a few beads of sweat dripping down his luxurious long locks of hair. ""This is your current name!""

I worked the shackles around from behind the chair, carefully pulling out a pick from belt and starting on the lock. ""Well, I am a teenager. So if I were to accept your opinion of my name, which I don't, then by your very own same logic I don't deserve to be defamed for my choice. Is common decency truly dead in the world?""

Klymenestra, Van's first lieutenant, rubbed her eyes with a groan. ""Look, the other team haven't shown up in three hours. I'd say we just kill him."" 

""Patience!"" Van Quisher roared. ""Why kill a mere guppy when you can eliminate a whole shoal of sturgeons?"" 

""You should listen to Van, Lieutenant."" I agreed. ""He's older and obviously much wiser."" 

Klymenestra stared up at the dungeon ceiling, possibly contemplating her life choices. ""God forbid we don't listen to the single-spell sorcerer."" 

""Actually,"" I smiled widely. ""According to the commonly accepted academic definition, I'm actually not a - ""

Van Quisher's face snapped towards me like a cobra. ""Hmm."" He said. ""Is that a *tink tink tink* sound I hear coming from your direction?"" 

""I really can't imagine."" I said, hearing each tumbler click as it moved into place within the lock. ""Perhaps it's your lieutenant's chastity belt? I heard the Cassandrean Order can be *real freaks.""* 

Klymenstra's hand snapped out, but I'd already unlocked the shackles, leaping out of the chair and past both of them. Which led me to the corner of the dungeon furthest away from the exit. Because why wouldn't it?

""You picked the lock,"" Klymenetra licked her lips with a neon green tongue. ""Clever boy. But you're outnumbered, and certainly outgunned. What was the one spell you knew how to do again? It's a first year one, isn't it?"" 

""First semester, actually. I cast *Inventory.""* 

You should know the Archstone family is well known for dimensional magic. But instead of teleportation or universe hopping, I'd invested in a spell that opened up a pocket dimension. I'd put a lot of stuff in there over the years. Apples. Oranges. A castle.

I was considered a failed mage, having learnt only 1 spell.
1 spell was all I could learn.
Nothing more, nothing less.
It a spell for beginners, one of the 3 spells an apprentice has to learn to be considered a real mage.
Mana Hand.
And yet...
I look at the battlefield in front of me, that has quieted down.
""God's Hand."" the armies muttered, as they watched me float above them on a huge golden hand.



It is funny.
Mana hand is considered versatile, but useless.
It takes a lot of focus to control it properly, and many use it to carry stuff, or push things.
That is it.
Me? I used it to become renowned.
I conjure hands by the thousands.
Palms, fists, hand knives chop, and punch, and slap at the enemies.
And that is not all.
Have you ever seen hundreds of hands trying to grab you, and drag you down?
It is terrifying.


It is funny.
There are multiple hand spells that are considered legendary.
And that is what they think I am using.
That is why the battlefield is now terrified.
They think not only have I mastered high tier spells, but also have enough mana to use them seemingly forever.
Poor imagination.
They can never imagine that this huge golden hand is a Mana Hand spell creation.
After all...most Mana Hands are the size of a human's hand.
I look at the two armies and smile.
Thousands of house sized open hands materialize over the battlefield.
They start attacking.

It is funny.
Their spells crash against the hands but do nothing.

Nothing personal, it is just a job."" I say, as I push down with the hands.

1lfese5,myomc4i,"try again. Where was I? Right.

Middle of an ambush. Roadside. Three of my travelling partners dead, one too injured to fight, and an axe headed directly for my head. Twist to the left-- going right gets you caught by the one flanking, it's a dead end. Go low, avoid the axe throw from the treeline. Twist, snap a kick out for the heel, knock him off balance so the sword comes down to the left.

This'd be easier if you could figure out more than one trick, but one trick's usually enough when it's from a rare discipline. Which one? You're clever enough. Figure it out. There's more powerful practitioners, probably, but nobody really knows about them-- they've made sure of that. You might have a few names, but honestly, most people don't believe the rumors of being 'perfect' enough to care, and for the people who are undeniable? They just don't let anything happen that might reveal them. Kind of terrifying to think about, but there's something more terrifying to consider right now.

Namely? The man charging from behind. Step to the right-- he's got his sword angled out to the left, catches me in the waist if I go that way. Bad way to go. Trip him on the way past, send him skidding-- if you can get him just as he goes to move, he'll knock himself out on the side of the wagon. Time it right, time it...

Right! There he goes. Two left. Jerk low and to the left, wait for the sound of the axe embedding itself into the wagons' side, then stab forwards. Aim for the center of mass, weak spot in his lamellar, get him in the heart. Wait for the sound of him dropping, and then...

...twist. Aim subtly high. If you hear a shout, the knife landed on target. One in the trees is gone. That's all three. Follow the side of the wagon to the right, hurry, hurry, you don't have much time-- you have to optimize this. Get to her. Get to the wounded one, and check her pulse.

One.

Two.

...no.

Too slow. It stopped. You have to optimize more. Be quick enough to be there to stop the bleeding.

I noticed the mayor and town council walking towards me. Hats in hand.  

The mayor began talking as the group arrived in front of me. 
“Sir Tim ..”

I held up a hand stating “ just call me , Tim” 

Mayor continues “ Tim , even though everyone had told us you could do it. We just did not believe it could be done. And ohm well, we don’t have the agreed upon 100 gold coins. “ 

I look sternly at the mayor and the town council.  I say “ do you see those barrels of Dragon meat, bones and blood. I claim those and 3 wagons with  3 teams of mules to pull them, also provide   3 boys to drive the wagons.  “ 

The mayor and the town council huddled, whispered in low voices. Then turned back to me. 
The mayor stated, “ ok to everything from the Dragon, but only 2 wagons with, 2 teams of mules, 2 young boys to drive the wagons. You load wagons. You leave as soon as wagons are loaded. “ 

I grab the mayor’s hand shaking vigorously, “Deal. Now bring those wagons I got places to go, things to do.” 

As the mayor and town council ran off. I let out the breath I had been holding.  

As first one then the second wagon arrived. I parked them next to the barrels and began loading barrels. Guess the town council was still locating the two boys. 

It took me most of the night to load and tie the barrels securely in the 2 wagons but I was done and very tired.   

A large family of 8 stood nearby and pushed a boy of probably 7 years towards me. This is Will he is going with you.

A man stood with a boy probably 5 or 6 years old. He said, I only have 2 boys. This is Bob my youngest, he will be going with you. He is a good boy, very good with animals. 

I look at the boys, say “ get your teams ready to leave. We have a schedule to keep. “  turning to the parents, “ I will keep them safe and they will learn to be mages .” (I say under my breath “I hope they do “).

I woke up to the sound of droning news coming from within my head. I must've forgotten to turn off the news module before going to sleep. Light streamed in through the shutters, illuminating a streaks of dust. 

What time was it? I grabbed my phone to check, only to find it had some kind of pet raising game opened. Had it downloaded it itself overnight? It's been acting up lately. Opening up apps. Playing games by itself. I should probably get it looked at. But I didn't want to owe anyone money. 

I swiped down to open the menu. 9:30. Shit. I was going to be late. I had only myself to blame for not checking my alarm.

I pushed an AR button next to my head, shutting off the news voice that was streaming directly into my head. It wasn't what I wanted to start the day off with. With a wave of my hand, the interior of my room lit up slowly - the way I liked it. The wallpaper in the room changed to a soothing light blue, decorated by the interior holo device. Not too intrusive, but not too depressing. It knew what I liked. I began my mundane morning routine. Washing my teeth. Making some quick cereal. I didn't rush. I was already late, so what was a few more minutes.

I decided to check for messages on my phone in between cereal bites. In the time between, I saw my phone had opened up some kind of local nanomachine analyser tool. Weird. Wonder why it did that. It was showing the activities of the nearby nanomachines in the vicinity. Kind of like an old wifi analyser app. I didn't really care about it though, so I closed it and opened up my messages.

The first message was from my boss saying ""WHERE ARE YOU??""

I put the phone in my pocket and pretended not to see it. Ugh. What a shitty start to the day. 

Maybe I should call in sick. But I needed the money. And I was all out of paid leave. I didn't want to go, but I had no choice. I finished up my breakfast and went to get dressed. My closet UI - a blue holographic screen projected onto its door - opened to remind me that I needed new clothes. I sighed. Who the hell invented this sort of thing anyway. I swiped the reminder away and took out an old jacket. Its condition wasn't too bad, but some of its threads were fraying and its cuffs were coming loose. Nothing a bit of holo AR couldn't fix. I put it on lazily, along with some jeans and went out. 

I could hear the highway from my apartment, even though I had chosen somewhere out of the way to live. Automated cars zoomed from the street across. They were noisier than usual today. It was getting to me, so I decided to go out the back door. The street outside that one was real dirty. Garbage bins and flies roamed this road. Some things just don't change I guess. At least there was not a lot of people here. 

I should probably message my boss to say I'm coming. Maybe that will make her less angry when I arrive. I took out my phone to see that it had a volume adjustment app open. I usually used this to tune out the world in my spare time, because it could control how much noise I could hear. But I noticed it had been turned all the way up. Annoyed, I turned it back down and sent a message, hoping to appease my boss a little.

I made my way back to the front of the building. Some shady people in suits were hanging around the front door. There were always shady people hanging around here. Some poor soul must've been behind on their debt. If I didn't have a job, I could've be one of them. I made a quick prayer for whoever it was that had pissed them off, and then left quietly, making sure I wasn't seen.

I didn't notice the emblem they had on their sleeve.

""You're over hour late!""

Apparently, the message I had sent was completely ineffective. The moment I walked through the door, the chinese lady who ran the restaurant I worked at practically shoved me into the back rooms and started berating me.

""Look I'm sorry,"" I began, ""There was some problem with my closet and I couldn't get it to open and-""

""No excuses!"" she shoved a device into my hand, ""You. Mascot. Stand outside shop and bring customers in.""

She slammed the door in my face and rushed back into the kitchen, leaving me alone in the room. It must've been a busy day. The device she gave me was a holographic projection device, about the size of a badge. It would project the image of a mascot around me, and I could be it for a day. This was the sort of job I had gotten. Sometimes it was being a mascot, sometimes it was washing dishes. She didn't trust me to cook though. Something about how I had years of training before she would let me touch a wok. As long as it paid well, and I didn't get asked questions, I didn't care. 

I pinned the device to my shirt and pressed the power button on it. The air around me shimmered. I looked in the mirror and I now looked like a cute rabbit from a cartoon. I couldn't help but smile whenever I saw it. My little sister loved this kind of stuff. Oh, I should probably take a photo. It'd probably cheer her up. 

I took out my phone and saw it was playing bejeweled. Seriously? That old game? I thought everyone had moved on from it already. The gems on the screen moved by themselves as if played by an invisible hand. Maybe I shouldn't interrupt it. But it game over'ed soon after. I waited for a while, but it didn't move again. You know, sometimes I thought my phone was really alive. Or that it had a ghost in it or something. It really does seem like it. I imagined what kind of ghost it was. The old kind probably. Seeing as it was playing bejeweled. 

I opened up the camera app and snapped a photo of myself in my rabbit holo-image. Maybe once my little sister was all better, we could look over all these images together. That was what I hoped at least.

A few hours later, rush hour finally finished, and it was the afternoon break. This was the hour when the cooks came out to eat themselves. I on the other hand, sat down exhausted. You would think standing there being cute would be something easy. But all those kids. Trying to play with me. Or those teenagers who deliberately tried to break the illusion. Ugh. What a handful. And I wasn't allowed to retaliate or anything. Luckily some of the workers saw and intervened whenever it happened. 

""Rough day today huh?"" One of the cooks, Bruce sat down next to me and offered me a bowl of noodles. 

""Tell me about it,"" I silently grabbed the bowl in appreciation and began eating. ""What I would give to punch those assholes in the face.""

""Surprised you haven't already. You know the last guy before you lasted a week before he caved in.""

""So that's how he got fired huh.""

""I heard you got chewed out by the ma'am again this morning."" 

""Well if getting chewed out was being shoved into a room and rushed out the door, then sure.""

""Ha. Sounds like her alright. She was already pretty irate from dealing with the visitors this morning.""

""Oh yeah?""

""Yeah you just missed them. A bunch of police officers came in asking for any information about a wanted cyber criminal. Something about a runaway from the cyber-reality war going on, you know? It got pretty intense. The mistress started yelling at them about how they're driving the customers away and to leave.""

""Yeowch. Glad I came in late then.""

""Seems like the world's getting dangerous these days y'know. You should take care of yourself, kid. Stay away from cyberspace if you can.""

I nodded and didn't say anything back. Taking care of myself. Easier said then done. If I could choose the kind of life I could live, this would not be it. Hell if things were just a bit different, I would've gone digital in an instant. But it's not like I can choose a different life. Not without abandoning what I had in this one. 

My phone vibrated in my pocket. I took it out to see what was happening.

""Aw hell,"" I said. It was a reminder telling me to pay my electricity bills. I clicked on it, opening up my apartment management app. Seems like I was using way more electricity this month than usual. Apparently I had forgotten to turn off the light back home. Just great. I clicked on the turn off button, but it didn't respond. It's been acting up a lot. Refusing to respond to the app. I guess even in this digital age, sometimes going physical was just more reliable. Maybe if I snuck back home I could go and turn it back off again. Save a bit of money.

""Bruce, could you do me a favour?"" 

""Yeah?""

""I need to go home for a second. It won't be long.""

""Don't worry, I gotchu. I won't tell the ma'am.""

""Thanks man.""

I finished my lunch and hurried out of there.",6,1750391542.0
1lfqxhr,myr4v9k,"I jogged down the street, hoping to get home and back on time. I had to take a few detours through some of the alleyways back. It was quicker this way. And I knew my way around. I had to go back as quickly as I could before the ma'am notices. 

I was going so fast, I bumped into someone by accident. 

""Woah man, why so rushed?"" It was a teenage looking boy, who seemed like a punk. He had dyed yellow hair, a black shirt with a band logo I didn't recognise and a chained necklace on. 

""Sorry."" I had gotten knocked to my legs. Ow, my shoulder. It was all tingly. Like I had gotten zapped just now. I tried to get up and leave, but the boy grabbed me by the shoulder. 

""Dude, chill out, bro. You never know what you could miss by going so fast you know.""

""Uh. Right.""

""Have you ever gone so fast, you never stopped to wonder where you were going, and then suddenly you realised you're not sure where you want to go anymore?""

""..Huh?""

""Life's like that sometimes. You gotta slow down. Watch where you're going. If you spend all your time running away, sooner or later, your past is gonna catch up to you.""

What on earth was this guy talking about?

""It's something I learned watching movies. You got a phone? I can show you.""

For some reason, my phone chose that specific moment to vibrate in my pocket.

""Oh you do have one bro!"" He swiped it from my pocket and began to tap on it.

""Hey! That's my phone. You can't just-"" I grabbed it back, ""Look, I got someplace to be. Sorry if I hurt you. Could you let me go?""

""Whatever you say man. Just remember what I said yeah?""

*Sooner or later, your past is going to catch up to you...*

Huh? What was that? I swear I heard his voice inside my own head.  I shook my head. I was probably tired. Exhausted from my half day at work. This was weirding me out. The boy finally let me go and waved me goodbye, and I turned and started getting away from there. 

I didn't see him disinterate into thin air. 

----

As I got back to my apartment, I felt something wrong in the air. 

Police cars were parked up the side of the street. I turned the corner and saw police tape - or holographic images of one - cordoning off the whole building. What happened? I looked from afar, and saw that one of the windows was broken. What was more, the inside of the room had started fuzzing, as though the interior holo image had glitched out. 

The police were interrogating the people nearby. I saw a grandma I knew talking with the officers. What had happened here? No wait, this means I couldn't go in and turn off my lights. Shit. My money was going down the drain. 

My phone started buzzing in my pocket. But I had bigger things to worry about. Was I just going to stand out here and go back? Out of anyone in the city, the police were the last people I wanted to get involved with. But maybe there was a way in without having to go through them. I looked down the way to the back door. It was not blocked off. 

I decided to risk it. I didn't want to lose any more money this month. And I was sure whatever it was didn't involve me anyway.

""You one of the residents of this building?"" A voice called out from behind me as I snuck into the dark trashy alley. It wasn't a police officer. It was two men in suit and tie, shades covering their face. I recognised them from this morning.

""Um. Yeah?""

The phone in my pocket began to vibrate more strongly.

""We're agents with the government. We believe there is a dangerous war criminal hiding in this building, charged with the sabotage and destruction of government infrastructure, as well as illegal tampering of nanomachine cyberspace.""

What? War criminal? Sabotage? Destruction?

""We'd like you to come with us to answer a few questions.""

Suddenly, my phone started playing a ring tone. What was happening? I pulled it out to turn it off, and saw a message on the screen.

RUN

""Um, sorry, I gotta go. My employer is expecting me and-""

The man on the left pulled out a gun, and pointed it at me.

""This isn't a request. It's an order.""

I froze. A million thoughts raced through my mind in an instant. This couldn't be happening. What's happening? That isn't a real gun right? Who were these guys? What criminal? What do I do? *What do I do?*

I backed up, hands raised in the air. As I did, I saw the phone open an app. 

Trash Compactor Energy Management. 

""Don't worry. We aren't going to hurt you. We just want to know a few things, yeah?"" 

At that moment, a large electrical discharge filled the air. The two men in suits yelled in pain and my vision was blinded. When my vision returned, they were on the floor. 

A robotic voice went off from the pocket of the men. ""Target found. War Criminal code named Zero-Phi-Lambda. Requesting backup."" As soon as it finished that sentence, a high pitched alarm starting wailing from the pocket, and I saw everyone on the highway look this way. 

The phone in my hand shook. 

RUN.

My mind was still blank. The word seemed to imprint itself into my consciousness. 

I turned and ran.",5,1750391550.0
1lfwhjq,myrojpu,"""Seriously? I mean, this is worse than Covid. Than the plague. Than the dinosaurs. Hell, this is worse than the whole end of the world flood you had going on back then!"" The Reaper exclaimed with an exasperated tone as their ghostly form materialized next to God, simply watching from the edge of one of his clouds on the sky, above it all.



""If you think that I'm going to be cleaning up this entire mess, you're wrong! Why would you even continue giving mortals these tools of mass destruction to use against themselves?"" The Reaper's voice continues, the low droning of their voice cackled without their skull moving, akin to the soft hum of a radio.

  
""I don't give them the weapons!"" God's voice boomed defensively from his chest as he stared below. ""They do all of that themselves! Even Lucy knows that!"" God gave a defiant huff, much like a man who couldn't put his ego aside for a moment to realize that the problem at hand was much bigger than it seemed before he paused for a moment, taking in the Reaper's words as more than just face value.

  
""But I can't say your words don't have merit. The more this population seems to grow, the more issues seem to come with it. The environment continues to fail, the wildlife continue to invade the cities and domesticate themselves because they can no longer survive in the wild, the sky gets murkier every passing year..."" God gave an almost disappointed sigh as he watched. ""And yet, so man of them still can't just love each other despite being the same species. They're all humans, yet all they seem to do is fight and divide themselves over such meaningless titles.""

  
Just then, another nuclear explosion went off in the distance. Earth had yet another plume erupting from the surface. ""I just don't understand where I went wrong in guiding them."" God resigned, turning his head towards the Reaper.

  
There was a pause, the Reaper watched as smoke covered the world slowly. ""I don't think *you* went wrong. I think that's all on them."" His hum was heavy, skipping over a beat or two almost as if it was stuck on a line in a vinyl. ""I think it's just a matter of... them being human. It's so simple to us, the concept of just sharing the world and allowing things to proceed naturally as they were meant to be. But to them? Resources, power, views, ethnicities, anger, sorrow. It all builds up. There's not one clear answer to allow them to process everything. Even if that answer is to just... not."" 

  
They sat in silence for what felt like eternity to the world below, but only seconds in reality before God spoke. ""I hope they do better. The next time around. At least they didn't figure out how to weaponize meteors like the dinosaurs did."" God sighed.

  
""They've gotta learn eventually. I mean, fifth time's the charm, right?"" The Reaper asked, almost allowing a bit of hope to leak into his tone before it lowered again. ""You're giving me a vacation after this, though.""

  
""Fair enough.""",5,1750400932.0
1lfaquj,myms6v8,"  
I had just settled the child, who I had mentally named Vanessa after my long past mother, down for her afternoon nap when the sharp knock rattled the door to my apartment.  I hadn't been expecting anyone, so I was very wary when I peered through the peephole.  A woman, judging by the figure wrapped in a trench coat, kept her identity obscured by the large hat and sunglasses.  She stood impatiently waiting, raising her hand to knock again when I opened the door.  Caught off guard, her mouth twisted into a wry smile before speaking.

""I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for my daughter.  She was taken from me and I've been trying to track her down.""

The admission caught me flat-footed and I wordlessly waved her inside before I knew when I was doing.  She entered and looked around the living room of my modest apartment. I hadn't done much to update the decor after graduating college, posters of indie bands and old movies covered the walls.  The sagging couch, which I had inherited from my dad when he moved out of state, still remained the one of the few places to sit in the room.  I mentally cursed at myself when I noticed my superhero uniform still draped over the back of the only other chair in the room.  Before I could move to hide the identity exposing outfit, the woman removed her hat and glasses to reveal the face of the world's most wanted supervillain. She was gorgeous, to the same extent she was brilliant and rumored to be cruel.  Her captivating eyes caught my gaze and I noticed that she didn't seem to be distressed in any way.

When she spoke, it froze me in place.  ""So it's true.  A do-gooder cape caught the kidnappers of my child and took her home.  Why didn't you turn her over to the authorities?""

My mouth went dry.  I tried to form an intelligent response but only managed to blurt out ""She was dirty, scared and so I brought her home and gave her a bottle of warm milk."" I mentally shook my head at the inane response.  This woman could and probably would wipe my existence from the planet and I wasn't doing myself any favors.  Before I could speak again, she raised a hand.

""Where is she now?""

I pointed down the short hallway to my bedroom.  ""She was tired after eating, so gave her a bath and I put her down for a nap.""  Without a word, she breezed past me and paused at my bedroom door, opening it slowly as if not to startle anyone inside.  I could see the smile on her face, the way her eyes lit up at the sight of her child safe and sleeping peacefully.  She closed the door quietly and walked back to stand in front of me.  Cocking her head to the side, as if examining my worth, she pursed her lips before she spoke softly.

""I want to thank you for taking care of her.  Allison is my world.  One of my former henchmen thought that she was a weakness he could exploit.  If I may be direct, could you look after her for a few more days?  I need some time to get my house in order before I bring her back.""  Before I could say anything, she continued. ""I would pay you handsomely for your time and effort.  I really don't have anywhere else I could trust to take her at the moment, something I plan to fix right away.""

I wanted to refuse, to live up to my superhero calling and take her into custody, but seeing her as a distraught mother instead of a villainess tugged at my heartstrings.  I nodded, not trusting my voice.  She smiled in a genuine manner, something I guessed she rarely did in public.  Reaching into her coat, she pulled out a slender cellphone and placed it into my hand.  ""Call if you need anything, and I mean anything.  I'll call you when I come back.""  In a surprise move, she lunged forward and hugged me hard.  I could feel the slight tremble in her arms.  She softly whispered ""I thought I had lost her.  Thank you for saving her.""

She abrupted took a step back, carefully wiped her eyes before donning her hat and sunglasses.  Without a further word, she spun in place and walked out the front door, closing it carefully and quietly behind her.  I just stood there, cellphone in hand, not quite sure of what had just happened or what was coming next.",173,1750341426.0
1lfaquj,mytyyrk,"Chapter 1: The Lost Child

""Oh, a child... Why'd they have a baby?"" I leaned down, carefully picking the child up, into my warm arms. I snapped my fingers, causing the rain to come to a slow stop. ""There, a little quieter now. Let's see if we can find your parents.""

I reached into my backpack, pulling out a dry towel, drying the baby off. Then, I pulled out a dry blanket and wrapped the child in it to keep her from my wet clothes, after the fighting. The baby cooed and smiled up at me as I began checking door-to-a door to see if anyone had lost their little one. 

""Well, Tempest, we haven't heard anything or seen any news reports of a missing child... Why don't you take her in for now? Afterall, can't trust law enforcement, at any level... I miss Miranda... So much..."" The man caught his tears on a handkerchief from his chest pocket.

""Mr. Jones..."" I felt the baby move around in my arms. She was reaching for the old man. 

""Uwah!"" The little girl giggled, holding her hands out to him. 

Mr. Jones held out a pinky, letting the child hold on. ""The future of our world may very well be in her hands, some day."" He gently pulled back, as the child released her grip. 

I smiled weakly. ""Yeah... We'll have to wait and see. Only so much I can do with my powers, ya know?""

""Yes..."" Mr. Jones turned, looking at the last photo he'd taken of Miranda a few days before she was taken from him. ""Everyone deserves to have a chance at a happy and healthy life. Make sure you do what you can to find the kid's mom and dad. You'd best get going."" 

I simply nodded and waved goodbye as he closed the door. ""May Miranda rest peacefully..."" I began making my way home, child in arms. We arrived at my door about half an hour later. I unlocked the door, letting us in, then closed and locked it. 

""Welcome home, for now, kiddo. Let's get you cleaned up."" I walked into my room, baby in my left arm, and started digging for some clean clothes in my dresser.

I picked out a nice dress, covered in flowers along with matching underwear and bra. ""Alright, kiddo. Sponge bath time for you."" Walking into the bathroom, I set my clothes upon the toilet seat, and started the water. I set the child down and quickly disrobed from my superhero outfit. 

I tested the water, ensuring it was safe for the child, not wanting to accidentally burn her. Once the water was where I wanted its temperature to be, I pushed down the stopper and placed the girl in the tub, stopping the water once it covered half her legs. ""Alright, let's make this quick.""

I gently washed the child from head-to-toe. Making sure to be gentle. Once done, I rinsed and dried her, leaving her on the bathroom floor. I turned the water faucet to shower from bath and washed the important parts before shutting it off and donning my bathrobe. ""Huh, normally kids like to explore, but you merely... Waited. Odd. Alright, let's go get you a bottle made."" 

I picked up the child and carried her into the kitchen, grabbing a bottle and formula my sister left. She thought it was a good idea to keep on the offhand she forgot hers at home. I started feeding the little one and watched as she drank the bottle and its contents. 

As I put the finished bottle in the sink, there was a knock on my door. I wasn't expecting anyone, so, maybe it was the parent of this little girl. I peeled the blinds back a bit, as my apartment peephole was broken. There was a woman outside. I unlocked the door and opened it. ""Hello! How may I help you?""

""Hi! I'm looking for my -"" The woman paused abruptly. ""- baby girl."" 

We stood in awkward silence for a moment, before I stepped aside and waved for her to come in, closing the door behind her. ""Oh, thank goodness! I tried finding her folks before bringing her back to mine, but no one had heard anything..."" 

""Right... One of the heros felt I wasn't fit to be a mother... So they kidnapped my child. When I found out who it was, they told me they'd hired some grunts to do the leg work for them."" I watched as her hands balled into fists, muscles flexing. I was caught up in her physique, briefly. 

""That's horrendous! No hero gets to decide if someone is fit to be a parent, that's the legal system's job, and even then, they make mistakes."" I spoke softly to not disturb the sleeping girl in my arms. ""What's her name?"" I slowly, carefully held the child out for her mother to take.

The woman took her child into her arms. ""Glimmer. Because, while I may be a super villainness, I have hope that she can be the light this world needs."" I watched as she shed a few tears. ""I'm not in uniform, but I'm sure you remember the name."" 

I sat, quietly, looking into this visually stunning woman's eyes. My heart skipped a beat. ""Vanta Echo!"" It was only a whisper, but she nodded.

""I've already taken care of the problem... Her father. And, it seems you took care of his goons. So, thank you."" 

My breath caught in my throat, I could only nod.

""He and I haven't been together for years and only hooked up for flings. 9 months later, Glimmer was born. While he was the worst to happen to me, she is the best thing to come from us."" She sighed and smiled at me. ""That's a lovely robe, for a lovely woman. What's your name?"" 

I inhaled and exhaled, remembering to breathe. ""Anna."" I blushed, beet red, still in my bathrobe.

""Such a fitting name for the vixen that took my child in. Thank you, for helping and taking care of my precious child."" She held her open hand out towards the floor as it started to glow a mix of purple and black. A bassinet appeared where she was aiming, then placed Glimmer inside.

""So... What happens now?"" I was mesmerized by this woman. Tall, dark hair, but the gentlest of eyes. Eyes that would show you the universe if you looked too long. Soft, radiant skin that pulls you in, yearning to be touched. I couldn't get enough. 

""Well, I'll likely be on my way home, at some point. But, I'm exhausted from looking for my beloved Glimmer all day."" This goddess slumped deeper into my couch. If looks could kill, I'd have already been a goner. But, I was starting to get an idea of how her powers worked. 

""Right. Well, you're welcome to stay as long as you need. I'm... Gonna get dressed."" I hurried back into the bathroom and swapped to my outfit. I giggled to myself. 

""_Pffft... Am I crushing on a super villain!?_"" I couldn't believe it. Such an elegant, yet deadly woman was on my couch, while her baby slept in the materialized bassinet in my living room. It's been so long though... Since I shared my space with another woman.",5,1750435215.0
1lfemq4,mypl37q,"We perfected our understanding of our universe and its laws millennia ago. You might think that would be the end of all the fun for physicists. Time to pack up and go somewhere else, resign ourselves to probing the infinity of abstract mathematics. You couldn't be more wrong. The final theory was a kind of end, but also a beginning. It left an opening, to explore all uncountably many alternative laws of physics for alternative universes.

I am one of many trying to understand one of these other universes. We have labs that can dial up specific pockets that obey different rules from our home universe. There are too many to give each a meaningful name, the set of laws I am playing with is called AU-S54987125. It is not that exotic, as universes go. Three macroscopic dimensions of space and one of time. Previous experiments have yielded interesting results. Stars that can form on much smaller scales than in our universe, self sustaining reactions requiring only about one cubic meter of volume.

I seek to study these stars, and their behavior. They are profoundly complicated things. I set up a lab with enough mass to create a star of average size. It can create a pocket of literally any set of possible physical laws. Such labs are not expensive, they are mass produced. I organize data harvesters to monitor it as it develops, and leave it to run on its own.

Time passes, I set up other experiments and study the stream of work done by others. There are too many scientists involved and too many possible universes to read them all, so I focus on certain classes and types of alternatives. Four years later, I receive a ping from the lab. One of the safety diagnostics has reported an anomaly. They are robust things, a minor safety issue should be fine, but it does warrant attention.

I open up the data feed, and at first I think it must be the wrong experiment. There is a star surrounded by glimmering things that look like statites. I check again, it is definitely the right lab. How could this have happened? As far as I know, no one playing with the set of laws has ever had something similar happen.

I begin the long task of studying the data dump to figure out what occurred. I watch the star form, then watch as its dynamics cause it to spit out matter. For over a year, nothing of interest happens, then my jaw drops. The unmistakable signature of life. I watch as it rapidly differentiates and evolves. There are no true planets, but little creatures zip about from island to island around the star. I spot autotrophs that harvest energy and serve as the bottom of a food chain. There are even some organisms that manage to live inside the star itself.

They come up with a language based on reflections of light. I watch them develop agriculture. I watch them begin to modify themselves, guiding their own evolution. They begin a positive feedback loop, growing explosively in intelligence. They ask profound questions about how their universe came to be, and why they exist. They harvest mass from the star to create more livable space. Then they undertake a massive project, beginning to encircle their star in a dyson sphere.

I blink. I see it, but I don't believe it. Life has been reported in plenty of other experiments. But not this quickly, not this intelligent, and not this technologically advanced. This is big. This is a first. The world needs to know, and people wiser than me need to decide what course this takes.

I reach out to my mentor. She doesn't believe it either, until she sees it. She speaks to her peers. One of these peers coins the name Humboldtian for them. It is decided that as long as their position is stable and at no risk of major harm, we will not intervene until all arguments are heard.

The gears turn slowly, but eventually there is agreement. We will make first contact. Their languages are translated, and an avatar is deployed. For them it is a day of celebration and euphoria. We explain what they are, and offer them the same rights enjoyed by all sapient life in our universe.

So begins an exchange of culture and science. They have studied their own laws more thoroughly than us. Their artistic expression is alien, but still hauntingly beautiful. Their thinkers have come up with things a human mind would have never thought of, and they delight in all the strange ideas we can offer them as well.

I know I do not deserve much credit, it was simply a chance discovery. But still, my name will go down in history for having created the first experiment to yield sapient life. Tears of joy brim in my eyes. Who knows what wonder looms in the future.",28,1750371701.0

1lfny3w,myqiqnv,"Growing up is all about learning to judge distance. The distance between individuals…between friends and acquaintances, seniors and juniors, boys and girls. When you’re extremely young, there’s no distinction at all. You smile at anyone you like and cry when anyone makes you sad. But that means you’re only treating people according to your own perspective, placing yourself at the center of your universe. In reality, we’re mortals rather than gods. Eventually, every person grows up and learns to act in the way that’s expected of them rather than the way they might like it.

“Yo Dan, you came to school alone today?”

“…Who cares?”

And so, the fact that my longtime friend chose to walk to school without me should be celebrated. It took until the latter part of middle school, but Alyssa had finally started to grow up.

Honestly, it was such a pain having her stick to me all the time. Insisting that we should do everything together just because we’re neighbors.

I couldn’t be more relieved.

“Didn’t her mom say that she left early, though?” I muttered to no one in particular as I listlessly scanned through our classroom. Nearly everyone was seated at their desks, but Alyssa had yet to arrive.

…Or so it seemed until she walked in along with the teacher.

“I have great news, everyone!” It wasn’t so much our teacher’s words that grabbed everyone’s attention as his expression. The man usually kept a dour, authoritarian glare but today he had a positively manic smile plastered across his face. “One of your classmates has deified! This morning, Alyssa successfully transcended Her mortality and became a divine being! Please, everyone, clap for Her achievement!”

“…What the f—” My expletive was drowned out by a deluge of cheers as everyone except me stood up and clapped as though they’d just sat through the biggest blockbuster of the year.

Meanwhile, Alyssa took in their praise with her usual bright smile. At a glance, I didn’t notice anything different about her. Alyssa’s short stature and pigtails still made her seem like she belonged a couple grades down. At most, her light skin seemed to have an unusually healthy glow to it, but I couldn’t see why anyone would think that this diminutive girl had become a deity.

And then she opened her eyes, and I saw two swirling galaxies where her eyeballs should be.

“Thanks everyone,” she said, and I shuddered as her voice echoed eerily throughout the classroom. “But it’s not that big a deal. I just happened to become a god is all.”

“And so humble, too,” crooned our teacher. “Alright, I really shouldn’t be making too big a fuss out of this. Goddess, please take your seat so we can begin class.”

I really wanted to make more of a fuss out of this…but no one else was saying anything. Even when the guy who sat next to me silently got up and traded seats with Alyssa, no one batted an eye. Alyssa took her place beside me and first period began without any additional twists.

“Hey, Danny. Sorry I missed you this morning. I just thought about going to school and suddenly I was there.”

“Uh, don’t worry about it…I guess?” I whispered back but it felt pointless to try and have a quiet conversation when Alyssa’s voice was still bouncing around the room. “But what’s with this whole…god…thing?”

“Oh you know, stuff like that happens from time to time.”

“No, I’m pretty sure it doesn’t.”",8,1750383348.0
1lfny3w,myqisl4,"(pt 2)

“Well, I’m pretty sure it does. Anyway, did you see the latest episode of…” Alyssa segued into talking about a show that we both liked, and it was like nothing had changed.

Though, it was pretty strange how no one noticed that we were talking in the middle of class. Not even when I switched to a normal volume.

Chatting through class was fun and all, but I felt a bit relieved when second period came around. Alyssa and I had different classes now, so I’d have some time to think about all the strangeness that just went down…or I should have, but Alyssa followed me to my next classroom without batting an eye.

“Don’t you have bio this morning?”

“I changed my schedule.”

“…How?”

“’Cause I wanted to.”

Time passed and I learned that, unsurprisingly, Alyssa’s new schedule lined up perfectly with mine. Wherever we had assigned seats, her seat was changed to be right beside mine. She wanted to talk through every class and if I tried to shut her out, she’d pester me until she got a response—a skill she’d mastered long before deifying.

By lunchtime, I was completely burnt out. There was no rest. No breaks. I couldn’t escape Alyssa for even a moment. Not until I ran into the bathroom, anyway.

Once she saw where I was going, Alyssa’s eyes, those glowing nebulas, narrowed in disappointment and she muttered, “Alas, this time, you’ve gone where I cannot follow.”

“Ok but seriously, you’d better not follow me!”

I plopped myself down in an empty stall and let out a sigh I’d been holding for the entire day.

This had to be a dream, right?

Or maybe I’d gone insane?

Still…now that I was alone with myself, I had to admit that it was nice to hang out with Alyssa like we used to. We didn’t have to care about anyone giving us odd looks or starting rumors. I…I had missed my friend. Just a little bit.

My time in here was limited, as I knew that the longer I stayed, the greater chance that Alyssa would decide to do something drastic. There didn’t seem to be any solution to this madness, so maybe I should just treat it as a dream and enjoy myself?

Maybe I didn’t have to grow up just yet…",6,1750383366.0

“Why do people find the *‘four ears’* thing so weird?”

The question came from across the table, in the middle of a perfectly normal lunch at the perfectly normal campus café.

Except it wasn’t normal.

Because Neneko was glaring at me, her latte foam slightly frothing, and her top pair of cat ears were twitching with deeply offended indignation.

I swallowed my bite of sandwich very slowly. “Uh...”

“I mean, *seriously !*” she continued, flicking her upper ears backward like little angry satellite dishes. “Centaurs have *six limbs* and *no one* blinks. But I get one dumb human pointing and going, ‘Wait, are those your *real* ears, or do they work together ?’ and suddenly I’m the biological enigma of the week.”

I looked around. A few other students had paused mid-bite to eavesdrop. The vampire at the next table was nodding solemnly.

""I’m not trying to be rude."" I said carefully. “It’s just… if your cat ears *work*, then what do the human ears *do*?”

“They hold earrings, and headphone.” she snapped.

Fair point.

“And they’re not ‘human’ ears. They’re *baseline bipedal hominid template* ears. I’m technically Catfolk, Kemonomimi Variant 3.5, and yes, I *have* been reviewed by the Interracial Species Design Committee, thank you.”

She sipped her latte aggressively.

“I mean, do you ask harpies why their arms are wings but they also have *weird little chicken legs*? No. You don’t.”

“Actually, I - ”

“No. You *don’t.* Because that’s *speciesist.*”

I raised both hands. “Okay! Okay. I get it. You’re right. Ears are ears.” 

>!I am a speciesist though.!<

She narrowed her eyes. “You’re going to google it later, aren’t you ?”

I didn't answer fast enough.

Neneko groaned. “Look. It’s simple. Top ears ? Hearing. Twitchy, expressive, super-powered. Bottom ears ? Decorative. Functional, but mostly ignored. Like… the appendix of my skull. There.”

She jabbed a tuna salad sandwich in my direction. “Now let me eat in peace with all four of my evolutionary audio receptors, thank you very much.”

She took a bite, her cat ears perking up in what I assumed was sandwich-based approval.

1lf96qh,mymky65,"It’s coal country. The hills lead to the Black Mountains, and the town was named Haven, as a lark. For haven it was anything but. The clang of metal being beaten is as constant as the thick black smog that floats along the street. The air smells like burnt metal, which reminds the prince of blood, which brings images of his father to mind.

He is dead, the prince reminds himself.
And you are alive.
But not king.
Until at least a head is taken.
And the gods will it, he knows this because he should be dead among his family.

And because he is not, because he was grabbed in the middle of the night, thrust in a sack and left on the side of the road leading to the Wastes and this road to revenge. It was a long road. How he escaped and the adventures to this point were tiny escapades to what needs to happen.

How many years has it taken? Ten? Twelve? He always loses count because it doesn’t really matter. He has learned one thing on his travels: that fate can’t be beaten. Where he is, is where he is supposed to be.

And with that he finds himself at the door to a clay hut. One of many that litter the muddy avenue running straight through town. Huts like this one strewn about seemingly at will.

The prince enters, the ragged strip of hide flapping behind him.

A huge hunched back stands in front of him. Glowing muddy brown from the intense fire that the prince can sense even just standing in the door.

“Get in or stay out, my flames waver with your uncertainty,” the voice is deep and gravely as if it fought pits and imperfections on its way out of their sayer’s mouth. His accent is one of the mountain clans. Clans containing what some call monsters and the rest just ignore knowing they even exist hoping they can keep doing just that. Ignoring them.

In the past the mountain clans would come out of their caves and gullies and raid and pillage the more civilized communes in the land of his father. But the king stopped it a generation ago. Cleaned the mountains, he claimed.

After what the prince has been through, he knows that isn’t the case. The Black Mountains are just as evil and wicked as they ever were.

The prince steps in closer to the intense heat, “There is a rumor, blacksmithy, you can make whole that which others say cannot be.”

The hulking figure turns and snarls through a mouth of thick tusks and molars. Red hairs bristle about his chin and cheeks like freckles on his green skin. “I do not work for humans.”

The prince can taste the tooth decay occurring in real time as the Orc speaks.

“You don’t understand, orc. This is the blade of my grandfathers, the sword of my ancestors. A sword wielded only when the kingdom most needs it.” As he speaks he unwraps the vellum package in his hands and lays it down at the bunnioned and calloused feet of the artisan.

The sound of the orc’s laughter is obscene, “Stupid human, no one can fix that, it’s just a hilt. Just say make me a new sword. Fool!”

“No,” the prince says opening a second package, this one containing 376 individual splinters and fragments of the sword that was broken to ensure peace.

The orc is silent, staring intently at the mound of metal still sparkling with the magic infused within it so many generations ago. His eyes saucer-sized, marveling at what was just a legend moments ago.

“This…”

“Is the sword of your grandfathers. Made for my grandfathers with the promise of peace. Only to be remade in a time of great need. It is time, blacksmith. It is time to honor your family’s pledge to the gods. You will fix the Broken Sword and help me avenge my father and recapture his kingdom from the horde.”

For a few seconds they just stand there opposite one another. The prince looking at the orc and the orc staring at the sword.

Then, just as the prince begins to panic that he didn’t understand the situation about the Broken Sword, the orc kneels.

“Yes, my king. I will fix the work of my grandfathers.”",67,1750339015.0

She smiles.  
""I wish to go to the frontier to fight the invaders for our country!

The young man with the sword hilt tilted his head like a confused dog. The loose ear flap on his hat added to the canine comparison. ""But this is a sword. You make swords."" 

""I do, yes. If you'd like to buy a blade, I can attach it to that hilt. But I can't just 'repair' that there handle into a sword without materials."" I said, pausing to mop my brow of the sweat and grime that always seemed to accumulate whenever the furnace was lit. 

""Um... yeah, that's what I was asking for"" the young man said. ""Do I need to do a quest for the materials? Collect 8 iron nuggets from fallen enemies or something?"" 

I stared at the kid, trying to figure out just how many torches were lit in his noggin. ""Um, no, I got the raw materials. I just need the gold.""

The young man's face finally lit up with understanding. ""Oh! Ok, I understand now! So once you fix the sword, I can go out and kill some bandits, and bring you back the gold?"" 

""No credit"" I grunted, ""An' I don't wanna know if you're plannin' on murdering and robbing people. None of my business what you do with this after I make it."" 

""So... how do I get the gold then?"" The clueless cretin asked. 

I stared at the young man until he looked away. ""Boy, if you have to ask that, I don' think you should have a sword, much less a weapon at all. Are you right in the head?"" 

The kid sighed dramatically. ""Look, I just got this stupid fucking game to work, and the tutorial just said to bring the hilt to the Royal Blacksmith. If there's some sort of quest that-""

I raised one of my large, scarred hands, silencing the whelp mid-whine. ""Ah, you want the Royal Blacksmith, he's in the Castle. You know, where the King lives. The Royalty. As in 'Royal' Blacksmith."" 

The young-ling finally looked like he comprehended my words. ""Oh! Ok, thanks mister"" he said, pulling a ridiculously large map from one of his many pockets. It began to glow in a mysterious eldritch light, tracing intricate paths across the surface in brilliant colors. ""Right... here! Waypoint set."" 

""Wait a moment, young master"" I interrupted, ""I'll make this here sword for that magic map you got.""

The boy looked up at me again as the map dissapeared back into that unnaturally deep pocket. ""What? I don't think I can un-equip this, it's not an inventory item. Just a menu item. Anyways, see you later!"" 

With that, the boy vanished, leaving a powdery shimmer where he had once stood. I blinked, trying to make sense of what the hell I had just seen. Was that a wizard? A warlock? A mad child, possessed by whatever foul genie that hilt contained? 

I shook my head and turned my attention back to the forge. Best to not dwell on such things, I thought, and resumed my work on the bellows. The forge roared back to life, sucking in the new air greedily like a dragon awakening-

""Oy! Git! Are you the royal blacksmith?"" A new voice asked, far more irritated than the last. ""This game's buggy as hell, and the tutorial quest ain't tellin me where to go!""

It was simple. Doing anything that was not your duty had been a death sentence. 

Krik was a master in these things, perfectly doing good duty. He hadn't been very bright; that was what his mother said. But his fighting skills were incomprehensible; that was what his father said. 

The coast was vast, colorful, and welcoming to every merchant ship or fishing boat. That was a place where one could polish his sword forever. But nothing had ever happened there. No wars, no thieves, no arguments between merchants. 

Until that day’s evening. Krik was doing his duty when the alarms came from nearby the sea. He rushed there, as the opportunity to guard and protect, instead of only polishing his sword, was rare.

When he had come closer, he saw the most stunning things on earth. The red-haired beauties were literally destroying one of the ships, but he, and all the sailors from the ship, stood frozen in place. 

Then a melody calmed his ears and thoughts. Polishing the sword was the stupidest thing in the world.

*""More cookies please,""* Lando the mind flayer pushed his rapidly-emptied plate towards the Grand Lich. *""Thank you, grandpa.""*

**""You are welcome, my little one. Eat as much as you need. You need to grow up, Larry.""** The ancient and terrible skeleton intoned.

Regis the Rogue hadn't eaten. He had been looking for a way to dispel the illusionary dining room, all so he could actually grab the actual piles of treasures in the lich's dungeon. Could a rogue settle for eating cookies and drinking tea which were possibly not from his native reality?

""Regis, sit your ass down before the lich gets suspicious,"" James scowled as he refilled his tea. ""He's senile, but he's still powerful and could wipe us out with a waggle of his finger.""

""How long will this pretense keep up?"" The rogue had grown impatient. He wasn't one to rest on his laurels. ""How long does the lich plan on keeping us, his fake grandchildren here?

It was at this point Lando wiggled a tentacle. *""Grandpapa, thank you for the nice tea time, but I need to go to the Wizarding Academy now. Wouldn't want to be late for school.""*

**""Go now. Study well, little Larry. Do not let your old man keep you. Just remember to come back after school!""**

And with a wave of the lich's golden scepter, the trio were surprised to find themselves transported outside the dungeon safely.

""Great, we didn't get any treasure, didn't slay the big bad,"" Regis sighed.

James frowned and bonked him with his staff. ""Shut up, we're all alive. This was not an encounter we could have won. We don't stand a chance against reality warpers, senile or not.""

""What's the plan now, oh wise wizard?"" The rogue crossed his arms. ""Turn back and pretend we didn't take this quest?""

*""Maybe after my wizarding class is over, I could ask my new grandpa for a prize for doing my homework!""* Lando chipped in. *""Then, we'll have a treasure to show for my efforts. I think I'm the most convincing grandkid.""*

You finally remembered your grandpa!"" the lich says, snapping his finger, warping reality, as the dungeon floor transforms into a small comfy room.
My teammates disappear, as I am left alone, finding myself sitting in a lavish armchair.
""So, tell grandpa.
How is the Academy? Do I need to beat some sense in Azerta?"" it cackles.
Azerta?
Wasn't that a legendary Sage, who founded and was the first Headmistress of the Academy of Saints?
But that was hundreds of thousands years ago.
""Grandson?"" he asks, its eyes flickering.



""Yeah...it is going good grandpa.
How...how about you? Anything nice?"" I ask.
We knew liches get stronger and more unstable as they age, but this...
""Oh, little Zacariah, I had a breakthrough, and I think I can learn 14th tier spells."" he says, sipping some tea.
I freeze.
14th tier?
That is the domain of Gods.
I take a sip of the tea, and I almost explode.
I feel as if I swallowed a sun.
The lich chuckles and snaps his fingers again.
I feel better.


""Still too strong for you, little Zacariah.
Well, you are only a 2nd tier mage."" he chuckles.
2nd tier?
I am a peak 6th tier mage...
I knew ancient times were richer in mana, and thus mages were stronger, but this is absurd.
""Not really absurd, kid.
It has been almost a million years since then."" he smiles.
I nod, then freeze.
Wait...
He didn't call me grandson.


I stand up, and the room shifts back to the dungeon floor.
""Don't worry. I am not going to hurt you.
It was nice imagining that I could talk once more with little Zacariah..."" it sighs.
I don't know what to say.
""Your teammates are trying to get in. How sweet.
Look, take this and destroy it."" it says throwing me something.
It looked like a...phylactery.
""Because it is my phylactery.
My episodes are getting worse, I can't even continue my research.
It is time for me to go."" it says.
I shiver.
""Do it. Please."" it says.
I burn the phylactery, and watch as this legendary lich turns to ashes.
The door to this floor opens, and my teammates enter, congratulating me on clearing the dungeon boss.
I should be happy...
But I am not...this feels wrong.",120,1750263373.0
1lekcnt,mykb4tt,"[Arch-Lord Krieg and Sir Lyton sat again at Kreig's table with a pot of coffee slowly cooling between them, their mugs untouched.](https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1lcw0tu/wp_you_are_an_ancient_lich_who_invented_dungeons/my6m5zz/)  Krieg reached out serveral times to drink but pulled his withered hand back at each attempt.

""Talk to me,"" said the knight. ""Just get it out.""

""She was my teacher,"" said the Lich, ""Many eons ago.  First in life and then in...""  He stopped talking and gestured at himself.  ""I don't know how to feel about seeing her, yet I'm still glad you asked me to come.""

Krieg had taken up Lyton's offer of ""bland and boring"" for the past half year, the situation working out better than expected.  With the knight's help, reputation, and pulling-of-strings, the Lich was slowly introduced into the ton of Pergrais, the nation he'd almost been run out of as a ""beacon of darkness"".  There was still much work to do, although freely opening his library to local scholars had done much to smooth his transition into polite society.  No torch wielding mobs as of yet.

The leased-out coffee business helped a great deal, too, along with the aid of an enthusiastic local bakery.

This past week Sir Lyton was tasked to end the threat of yet another Lich at almost the other end of the kingdom.  That two such lairs would appear in remarkably short distances was at first eyebrow-raising until the adventuring party actually met her.

Autarch Melbrene, the witch of the glade.  She greeted the King's heroes with tea and outstanding cookies.  Unfortuneately her very presence at Mount Kir created a killing miasma in the surroundings but that was merely because of what she was, not out of any deliberate malice or intent to harm.

The sun casts burning rays regardless of how it feels about it.

As they sat with warm beverages and excellent biscuits the Autarch spoke to them of bygone days, as if they were her beloved grandchildren.  She spoke fondly of her favorite student, a great prodigy, who she longed to see again.  Age had taken away his name.  Kreer, perhaps, or Kraig.  Sir Lyton, leader of the party, said ""Krieg"" quitely and Melbrene's eyes bore into his.

And thus, a mere month later, Arch Lord Krieg found himself before his teacher, mentor, and for a few remarkable nights, lover.

""She told stories that I'd forgotten,"" the Lich said to the knight, finally taking a long drink from the mug.  ""How many years I was brought back.  The scent of the tea, unchanged in all this time. I can still see her as she was before.""

Lyton poured a measure of whiskey into each mug as the Lich stared out the window.  It would, of course, have no effect on the undead lord but he'd appreciate the gesture.

""I reckon she still has much wisdom to share,"" said Lyton.

Krieg stood to stare outward, hands clasped behind his back.  ""No.  No, she is no longer there.  Memories and old stories, certainly.  But she repeats herself, forgets, says things wrong.  No wisdom, only a shadow of what was.""

Lyton leaned back in his chair.  ""When we first met, you asked me what would I have you do.  I now ask you the same.""

""Bring her here, to my house, we can make her comfortable.  Perhaps a special seat of honor in the coffee house, let her have visitors to tell tall tales.""

""While she carries not the slightest thought of harm, her very presence brings decay.""

Krieg waved his hand as if brushing away a troublesome fly.  ""Easy for me to constrain, barely an effort.  In three days I can prepare this house to be a sanctuary for her and all of my guests.  Please, bring her.""

Sir Lyton stood, clasped Arch-Lord Krieg on the shoulder.  ""It shall be done.""",13,1750300142.0
1lekcnt,myittk8,"There was but a spectacle upon the night when it appeared; over the kingdom and on high, a mass of dread-feathers to scatter across the kingdom like raindrops. Where they touched, the world would warp. Time became fickle as entire villages would split between dead, alive, prospering, and barren.

Upon the skyline grew a cave, impossibly statuesque as it were, held by naught, and carving the skyline apart. Below, in the kingdom proper, as timelines split and converged in multifold fashions, there was brought between the seven iterations of the King, a party of adventurers.

These were people from the history known, and histories which did not exist. One man was a clockwork thing, all twisted gears and burning red eyes. The next was a man not of form, but of Idea; he would twist in expression of his thoughts. And the last was a slightly tired woman, with grease-stained arms, a book shoved under her shoulder, and a wand laid bare.

They were whom the skybox would unfold, harvesting complex technologies yet to be birthed. Upon a balloon that burned bright and fast, the three would step into the cave in the sky.

Silence; abstraction slithered across dirt that should not exist, casting shadows where none should go. A step further revealed the steady drip of a water flow somewhere deeper. With a clawed iron hand held high, a wand swished to draw artificial light, and a shift towards thoughts of Panther, the three stepped ever deeper.

Murals bloomed, artifacts of a long forgotten age. They detailed a war of great anguish, where the people's of the planet nearly trapped themselves under a curse. Angorlash; God of War, and God of Pain, had colluded the minds of Mortals towards his goal of everlasting war, and indeed nearly won, corrupting the hearts of men. But then, there had come The One.

Here was a Lich, presented in full, sacrificing their soul as they fought the God to a standstill. Then, in a last petty act-

""Children, is that you?""

""Be on your guard,"" The Metal Man warned.

The witch nodded, and the panther's muscles tightened.

A door creaked open, one that most certainly had not been there before. This was a humble thing, made of lacquered wood, and lacking entirely the decoration of the murals. Inside was a small room, with a multifold of artifacts presented upon shelves. A quaint desk with a quill and some assorted papers took up the middle.

The man behind the desk had every bit the visage of wrinkle; quite more akin to the crackles on ancient paper. When he looked up,  his eyes were a brilliant blue, but stark across them was a rather deep sort of worry.

""Please, please, come in and have some tea. Maybaps you could help me. Or at least I direly hope you could. It seems as if I've forgotten something,""

The witch was first to act, her wand moving in sequence as she tasted the air about the man. But there was no curse nor trick she could sense. Nevertheless, she threw enchantments around herself and her companions as they walked in. 

Cups of tea appeared around them all as he said, ""I must admit, the War against Angorlash worries me so. I've... split the world, so to speak. Created new Times and newer powers, so that we might better our chance of defeating him,  but... but he is yet to show his head, and I cannot help but wonder... why? Do you think, perhaps, he has darker plans still?"" Here he paused to gulp greedily at his tea, ""I must admit I do not believe him to be so rash as to awaken the Elder Ones, but... with such a long absence, I grow to worry,""

The three were left to look at him silently, when the shapeshifter hazharded, ""You think... Angorlash is still out there?""

The man blinked, eyes rotating horizontally, temporarily appearing a horrid, violent red, ""Think, my dear grandchild? I do not, think, he is still out there. I SENSE him. Do you not see the people below? They are so... so fractured. Something is wrong with them, they're all out of order, out of FOCUS! Angorlash has done this, he's fractured time before I could, and he's done it all WRONG. So I must fix it, I MUST,"" He paused, smiling genially as he said, ""Now c'mon, drink up your tea, I made it just the way you like it,""",11,1750282043.0

I would agree with half_a_shadow. A sacrifice involves an act of giving up something valued for the sake of something else regarded as more important or worthy.

1lfc9zt,mynahkb,"**Warning: This might not be the story you were expecting.**

Deep within the Tower of a Thousand Laments, where legends are born and expectations go to die, Sir Pompous the Pretentious marched forward with determination. His boots echoed against the ancient stone floor as he recited the prophecy he had memorized:

“And thus shall the chosen hero find the Glorious Sword of Anticucho, the blade that has slain dragons, split mountains, and occasionally served as an excellent campfire knife.”

After weeks of searching, fighting ogres, solving countless riddles, and enduring an awkward encounter with a troll who wouldn’t stop talking about his marital problems, Sir Pompous finally reached the sacred chamber.

“At last!” he exclaimed, gazing at the pedestal illuminated by an inexplicable beam of sunlight streaming through a crack in the ceiling. “The legendary sword wielded by countless heroes over millennia!”

With reverence, he gripped the hilt.

“WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER?” boomed a metallic, rusty voice.

Pompous nearly dropped the sword. “You… talk?”

“No, genius, I’m singing opera. OF COURSE I TALK!” The sword made a noise suspiciously similar to an asthmatic cough. “I am Anticucho the Glorious, Terror of the Realms, the Splitter of—”

A chunk of rusty metal clanged to the ground.

“...Well, that wasn’t supposed to happen.”

Sir Pompous inspected the sword under the light. It looked like a battered metal rod. The blade was bent in three different places, covered in rust, and had at least seven visible welds—clearly patched up by someone with the artistic talent of a cucumber.

“You’re *the* legendary sword?” Pompous asked in disbelief. “The one that killed the Black Dragon of Norgothia?”

“I *did* kill him!” Anticucho clarified. “I slashed his neck. It got infected. Three weeks later… kaput. Hygiene standards were awful in the twelfth century, you know?”

“And you split mountains?”

“Hey, legends exaggerate, okay? One shameless hero used me to dig trenches and people started saying ‘it’s like he split a mountain.’”

Pompous tried to swing the sword, but on the first move, the hilt detached from the blade.

“Oh, come on!” Anticucho complained from the ground. “This is humiliating! Blame King Bobbert the Stingy! ‘Why use quality steel?’ he’d say. ‘No one will notice the difference!’”

“I was really… really expecting you to be *old*, but not in *this* bad shape.”

“Look, it’s not my fault every ‘chosen hero’ used me to open cans, dig up treasure, and occasionally as a makeshift grill. The last idiot even used me to scratch his back. HIS BACK!”",10,1750346854.0
1lfc9zt,mynaj55,"Part 2: 

Pompous sighed, sitting on the pedestal. “I traveled for months, faced countless dangers… for *this*? A rusty sword with a superiority complex?”

“Hey,” Anticucho’s voice softened, “I may not be shiny or sharp, but I’ve got something no other sword has.”

“What? Tetanus?”

“*Experience*! I’ve seen every battle strategy, every fencing move, every weakness of every magical creature. I don’t need to be sharp when I can tell you exactly *where* and *how* to strike.”

Pompous considered this while trying to piece the sword back together.

""Also,"" Anticucho added in a conspiratorial tone, ""I know all the gossip about the previous heroes. Did you know Sir Gallantine the Brave wore lift inserts in his boots? Or that Warrior Princess Valora brought a personal makeup artist on every expedition? I know all their tricks and secrets.""

A slow smile crept across Pompous’s face. Maybe this wasn’t the sword he had expected, but it was definitely more interesting.

""All right, rusty sword. Here’s the deal: I’ll fix you up as best I can, and you help me become a legend.""

""Deal! And first lesson: do you have any press contacts? PR advisors? The fact that you found the legendary sword and *no one’s* talking about it says a lot about how badly you’re managing things.""

I walk through the halls of Smith General Hospital through the hours. The few that can see me react in terror. My white gown is covered in blood, and my hair grows in patches. It is no wonder that I am viewed as a diseased form of death or a ghost of the hospital. 

Sometimes, I wonder how I could've died if I was a ghost. After viewing many deaths, I find them all to be rather unpleasant. Dying of old age in sleep is preferred, but there is little honor there. I suppose the most memorable death would be the man who got attacked by a bear in the fourth floor of his hotel room. If my ghost lore continues, I would like to be given a similar affliction.

Alas, I am the result of the natural world colliding with modern society. Smith General was constructed near the beach to aide patient's psyche. It reminds them of the beauty that they may never experience. The ocean is my mother's domain though I never met her. When it rains, I feel her presence.

Those rain drops fell into a pile of medical waste nearby. From the water, I emerged fully formed. I knew my purpose immediately, and I despised it. I long to dance in the forests. I long to swim in the rivers. I long to sing in the mountains. Instead I drift through the halls.

The light is too bright. The floors lack dirt. The air is disgustingly bitter. It is no wonder humans would like to avoid this place. I spend the days looking for a sign of nature: a bouquet of flowers, a treasured shell, or even clothes that had yet to be clean. 

My appearance frightens patients. In pity, I use magic to heal their ailments. The doctors do not detect my presence, and they never will. They merely take the credit.

I hope one day to leave this place and explore the world. I know that is not possible. I will only be freed when Smith General is demolished. The liberty will last for a moment before I perish yet I know that will be my most cherished moment. Then, I will die without dignity as all do. That is the life of the Nymph of Smith General",22,1750296673.0
1ley0fy,mykj2ny,"Most of the time, Kayla Wells loved her life. Being a prominent supervillain's daughter had a bunch of downsides, true, not least of which was the necessity of keeping her civilian identity seperate from her more... illegal ventures. But the good far outweighed the bad. Wealth, power, the freedom to use her gifts however and whenever she saw fit. What's not to love?


""Hey,"" said Dad, no, Judas, the infamous supervillain keeping his eyes on the road. He looked for all the world like an unassuming, blandly handsome middle-aged man. It wasn't his real face. Kayla wasn't sure he even had a real face. She supposed to a shapeshifter it was a bit of a philosophical question, and she knew how he felt about philosophy. ""Don't pout. You know I hate it when you pout.""


""I agreed to come."" She crossed her arms and pouted even harder. ""But no one said I had to be happy about it.""


""You agreed to try your best not to embarass me, Nemesis,"" Judas replied, using her cape name. Kayla cringed, wanting nothing more in that instant than to go back in time and give her tween self a stern talking to regarding what did and did not constitute a good supervillain name. Luckily, it was customary for sidekicks to rebrand after striking out on their own, and she was determined to come up with something better once the opportunity presented itself. ""And you sulking in the corner for the entire duration of the get-together will most definitely reflect badly on me, young lady. What kind of supervillain can't even control his own sidekick? Clearly not one who's cut out to be Villain of the Year, my detractors will say.""


Kayla sighed, tuning Judas out as he launched into yet another of his longwinded lectures. They soon pulled into the parking lot of her father's beloved alma mater. Technically he'd never set foot in this particular campus before. Like most institutions of its ilk, Madam Mayhem's was perpetually on the run from the law, and would regularly uproot itself for greener pastures depending on the climate. Judas himself had attended when it was set up in Hainan, China. As he was oh so fond of saying, ""Villainy has no borders.""


The parking lot was somewhat sparsely populated, but there were more people around than she was expecting, given the nature of the event. Kayla said as much to her father. 


""It's not just would-be supervillains who study here,"" he said. ""Henchmen, get-away drivers, crooked cops, back-alley doctors, amoral researchers, corrupt politicians, dishonest accountants. Supercrime has a thousand facets and a million moving parts -- and this is where those parts are manufactured.""


Judas breathed deep, his eyes fluttering. There was a nosthalgic grin on his face, the size of it just a little too wide to pass off as human. Then the grin disappeared, and he turned to give Kayla a gimlet eye. 


""Of course you would know all this already,"" he said, ""if you'd paid attention to a single one of my explanations. Now let's get a move on — I wouldn't put it past some of our colleagues to boobytrap the venue ahead of time like we were planning to.

He recalled golden afternoons in the summer of 2001, gathered with his friends around the family PC to behold a marvel known at the time as ""eBaumsworld""--a website so wondrously tailored to his young mind that it could only have been devised by some mad psychic.

Perhaps therein lay the truth. Perhaps, indeed, the internet was merely humanity surveying its own collective cerebellum.

After all, did this mythical eBaum figure not also share a love of flash animation and girls in bikinis?

The writer felt a chill as he began another paragraph of his semi-satirical writing prompt story. Unfortunately, he also had a pretty bad headache at the time--probably from some guy across the country still using dial-up or something. Turns out, the internet being our collective brain is not without its downsides.

He was lazily scrolling his phone, his thoughts on tomorrow's exam. He hasn't had any sleep for almost two days now, but the coffee kept him awake and he desperately needed to go through this shift because, well, as usual, he had bills to pay.

Maybe the lack of sleep was the reason he started hallucinating. A message popped up on his screen, only not exactly on it. It was hanging there in the air on top of his phone screen, a little to the side. He moved his finger to click the notification, not quite registering the weirdness. The message clicked itself.

He put the phone away and went to get another coffee. He would call out and go to sleep but he was alone at the store. Therefore, he'd persevere.

***

It couldn't be that bad, could it? He thought he should probably look up how schizophrenia started. There must be a million other diseases that involved hallucinations but he was never interested, until now, that is. 

He totally freaked out after the exam when google results started coming up in a thin layer just before the professor's face. He thought he had heard that when you're crazy, everything seems clear and straightforward. Nothing was clear. He still had to go through a lot of search results to figure out how to answer. And yes, he was terrified.

Should he turn himself in? What was it like to stay in an asylum? They'd give him drugs, probably. But would they cure him or would he just end his days there?

***

The exam results came in better than he expected. No evidence that his exam paper was filled with some crazy hallucinated stuff. If he was seeing things, then he was seeing things all the time, trapped in a long illusion, so he figured there was no sense in going to a doctor.

It got weirder. When he walked past people, he was constantly bombarded with personal messages about unfamiliar pets, places and people, sometimes in languages he didn't know. He read somewhere that you need to check the number of your fingers to see if you were sleeping. He had normal human hands, and the articles didn't say that what to do when you saw Wikipedia on the back of your hand.

He tried buying medicine to sleep more and nothing changed. He closed his eyes and he saw a random unfiltered feed of everything and anything on the internet. He unplugged his PC and pressed the power button and there it was, turning on as if still connected to an outlet. He pulled all the breakers in his apartment, and the light didn't work, but the computer would still turn on. It did not illuminate anything and he couldn't see his own fingers but the screen was right there, bright as day.

He noticed that when he was tired, he got fewer notifications.

Maybe he should start meditating. Maybe if he could filter out all the thoughts in the world he would turn the screens off. Maybe he would heal himself.",8,1750298366.0

He was talking about work again — how his boss wouldn’t let him take summer vacation, how his knee hurt more lately, how his oldest refused to pick a college. I nodded at all the right moments, but didn’t really speak.

Eventually, he stopped mid-sentence and turned to me.

""You good?""

I looked up, smiled faintly. ""Yeah. I’m good.""

He watched me a second longer, then faced forward again.

""You know,"" he said, tugging the leash a little as the dog sniffed a bush, ""it’s been five years since Elsa. Maybe it’s time to start moving forward. For real.""

I didn’t answer right away. I tilted my head back, let the sky fill my vision. The clouds were dull and unmoving, just a gray sheet stretching over the park. Then I looked at him again, gave that same smile.

""I’m trying.""

Out of nowhere, the dog bolted. Some squirrel or leftover sandwich — whatever it was, it took off toward the trees, yanking Mark half out of his seat.

""Stay here,"" he said quickly. ""Little idiot’s gonna get hit by a bike.""

He jogged off after it. I watched his back shrink between the trees. For a moment, everything went still.

I looked down at the ground. Leaves, crushed wrappers, little pieces of paper. Then up again — at the sky, the branches, the cold empty space beside me.

No.  I won't go down this route.

I take out the notebook, and stare at it.  
Should I do it?  
Write some names?  
If I do...I should go for criminals, but not from my own country, no.  
I should randomly choose from other countries as far away as possible from me.

  
I wrote 9 criminals' names into the notebook.  
Only 7 died.

For sure, this is a Deathnote of some kind, but what are the criteria?

Only 7? Did I want all of them to die?

1lezrzt,mylis2m,"Mark didn’t come back right away. After a few minutes, I stood up and started walking in the direction he’d gone. The dirt path curved along the park fence, and I watched the road through the gaps. Cars passed by, fast and faceless. In each windshield reflection, for just a second, I thought I saw us. Her hand on mine, her hair in the wind. That version of life I still looked for in traffic windows.

Then I saw it. Lying on the grass just off the path.

A small black notebook. The cover was rough and matte, with something printed on it in red letters. At first I thought it was some edgy teenage diary. Later I’d realize it was just a cheap novelty thing — bold red text across the front: Deathnote.

I picked it up. Flipped through it. Empty pages. I almost laughed.

""Got her,"" Mark’s voice called out from behind me. He was out of breath, grinning, the dog hanging smugly from the leash with a half-eaten cookie in its mouth.

We walked together toward the park exit and sat down on a different bench, one closer to the sidewalk.

""What’s that?"" he asked, nodding at the notebook in my hand.

""Nothing. Just found it. Useless.""

He held out his hand, so I passed it to him. The grass rustled nearby, a car passed with a sharp tire hiss, and the wind picked up — suddenly, fast. For a second it felt like the sound came from every direction.

Mark flipped to the back of the notebook.

""Huh. There are rules.""

""Rules?""

""Yeah. Says if you write someone’s name and a date, they die. Some fake Japanese thing. Looks like a joke.""

He handed it back, chuckling.

""You should write my boss’s name in there. The asshole makes me work every summer. Says fall’s the only real season for a break.""

I smiled, reached into my coat pocket. Elsa used to write poems. I hated poems, but I always carried a pen. Whenever the inspiration hit her, she’d go tearing through the house looking for one. Eventually, I just started keeping one on me.

I flipped the notebook back to the first page and glanced at Mark.

""You know what? Maybe you’ll get that vacation after all.""

He grinned, leaned in, and spelled out the name. We added the date and time.

I closed the notebook and slipped it into my pocket.

We sat a little longer. Talked about dinner, the game next week, the weird smell near the east side of the park. Then we said goodbye and went our separate ways.

I walked home slowly. The street was full of people moving the other direction, brushing past like I wasn’t even there. Like a river pushing against me, dividing me in half. It felt like that more and more lately. Like I didn’t quite belong to the flow of the world anymore.",11,1750320968.0

1lezrzt,mylit0u,"The house felt colder than usual when I stepped in. I didn’t take off my shoes. Just walked straight down the hall, past the framed photos and dusty shelf, into the kitchen. The same kitchen she used to dance in when no one was looking.

I sat at the table. The light above was off, just the dim glow from the hallway behind me. I stared at the sink.

The faucet had a slow leak. One drop every few minutes. Elsa used to hate that — said it made the house feel alive in the worst way. I counted the drips.

One. Two.  
Three.

The phone rang. It startled me more than it should’ve. I let it ring twice before I reached for it.

""Yeah?""

It was Mark. His voice was low. Tired.

""I got a call,"" he said. Then silence.

I waited.

""My boss. They said he had a heart attack. Just dropped in his office. Dead.""

We didn’t say anything else for a while. I could hear him breathing on the other end, short and shallow.

Then I heard the scrape of the phone against something and the line went dead.

I didn’t call back. Just sat there, alone in the dark, watching the faucet drip.

It took an hour for twenty-three drops to fall. I stood up after the twenty-third. The chair creaked. I moved slowly, like someone trying not to wake a house.

I took off my coat and shoes in the front hall, then walked into the living room and sat on the edge of the couch. The clock on the wall said 10:00 PM.

I never stayed up late. Elsa loved late nights — called them the hour between the world and dreams. I used to force myself to stay up with her, even if I hated it.

She loved dancing more than anything. For a man like me, made of wood and habit, it was always a challenge. But we danced. Every Saturday night. Living room, kitchen, hallway. Her feet everywhere. Her laughter echoing like music.

I laid it flat on the coffee table. Got up and went upstairs. I barely used the second floor anymore. It smelled like linen and dust.

In the back of the closet, behind a stack of old boxes, I found it — my wedding suit. Gray, simple, almost too narrow for me now.

I put it on. It didn’t quite fit right, but it would do.

In the mirror, I saw something I hadn’t seen in years. Not just the suit. The eyes. The way I used to stand. For a second, I looked like him. The version of me she married.

Then the light shifted, and it was gone. Just me again.

Downstairs, I poured a glass of wine. Took two slow sips. The clock ticked past 11:30.

I turned on the old stereo. The song was still in the playlist. The same one we used for our wedding dance.

My right hand floated near my side, palm open, as though it still remembered the feel of her waist. The other hovered near my shoulder, reaching for the curve of her neck.

And for a moment, I felt her. Not as a memory. Not as a ghost. But as a presence — like warmth, like breath, like a whisper in motion.

The room fell away. The wineglass, the couch, the creaking floorboards — gone.

We were outside now. I could see it. A wide, empty plaza beneath a night sky with no stars. In the center, a tall marble fountain shot streams of silver water into the air, catching moonlight in the spray. There were no people. No noise. Just the two of us and the music.

I didn’t care if I looked ridiculous. I’d always looked ridiculous when I danced. She told me that the first night we met. Then made me dance anyway.

I turned slowly, letting her imaginary weight pull against my balance.

Her laugh. I heard it. Not in memory — in the air. Real, crisp, playful.

And I smiled. For the first time in a long time, I smiled without effort.

I stopped. The room returned in pieces. First the sound of the record spinning. Then the soft hum of the fridge. Then the aching pull in my legs from standing too long.

Because he seems.awfully naive, and kind hearted, so I assumed, both versions apart from each other will be weaker.
Nope.
You shouldn't assume.

Nor about the heroes and villains attacking them.

No.
Better question.

What kind of genes he has?
What kind environment did he grow up in?
And more importantly...how was his hero self so...normal? So kind?

I grabbed the wrists of the people trying to unlock the door and turned them to wood as well. 

Unfortunately, there was an intern, Max, just a junior in college. I honestly really liked this guy, he was a hard-working, honest man who never partied and cared for his family. But today was his unlucky day as he picked the wrong time to go to the break room. The intern was smart,though; he knew what would happen if he touched me, so he threw a chair threw the window and tried jumping out. The only problem was that the intern did not have a good jump and ended up slicing his whole body up on the broken glass and bled out almost instantly on the ground. 

However, I moved too slow, destroying my coworkers. Jennifer - the newly hired accountant live live-streamed the whole thing and called the police. Instantly, I sprinted to her, turned her to wood and ran out outside. But as soon as I got outside, , there were military helicopters in the sky, dozens of army trucks and military personnel pointing guns at me. 

I froze like a deer in headlights. Before I could think of a plan, someone yelled ""FIRE!!"" and bullets started flying towards me. I thought I was dead meat, but to my surprise the bullets seemed to bounce off me. I bent over and picked up one of the bullets and found out the bullet turned to wood...

I then knew what I had to do. The world would never accept me with this power so I must destroy it. I yelled out a war cry and slammed my fist on the ground. Slowly the whole world started turning to wood, until every last thing - except the water- was now wooden. All 9 billion people turned to wood. Every national park turned to wood. Ever nuclear bomb was now wooden.

I was now God. Wood God. And from my new realm, I created wood people and became their God.",8,1750298874.0
1lema7i,myhkf9d,"The dressing room smelled like sweat, old powder, and the dying trace of cheap cologne. A single mirror took up most of the wall, the bulbs around it buzzing with that sickly, yellow kind of light that makes even healthy skin look like rotting fruit. I stared at myself in it — not *at* myself, *through*. The reflection wasn’t mine anymore. Maybe it never had been.

The left eye looked pale gray tonight, almost colorless. The right was still green, but darker than usual — like it had soaked up more of the world’s filth than it could hold. My mouth was a straight line, even now, even *before*. Always was. So I reached across the cluttered desk, picked up the same worn red lipstick I used before every show, and dragged a crooked, sloppy smile across the glass. Right over where my real mouth sat in the reflection. The painted grin was wide, too red, almost obscene — like it was laughing at me. Maybe it was.

I leaned back in the chair. Shoulders stiff. Hands covered in faint ink smudges from the deck I’d been shuffling for the last half hour. The cards never left me — always one in the pocket, one behind the ear, three more hidden where fingers knew to find them without looking. Didn’t need them, of course. Not *really*. I could make anything I wanted appear in my hand with a snap. But that was the part no one could know.

I gave people tricks because real magic frightened them. I’d learned that early. In the home — the orphanage — the first time I made a coin appear out of thin air, the other boys screamed. Called me names. Threw things. Sister Miriam slapped me so hard I saw stars. Said the devil was in me. They whispered ""monster"" behind my back and ""freak"" to my face. I stopped doing miracles and started learning illusions.

Even now, even *here*, in this filthy, faded circus — I was hiding. Hiding inside a persona, hiding behind a stage name, hiding behind tricks that only looked impossible. But every night, before the lights came on, I sat here and remembered: no matter how much they clapped, I wasn’t really one of them.

The door creaked, hinges whining like they didn’t want to work tonight. Then: that voice.

— You still brooding in there, spooky bastard? Showtime’s in ten. I already counted four fat purses and a guy with a silver chain just *begging* to be lightened.",27,1750268966.0
1lema7i,myhkh1k,"Rory stepped in like he always did, arms wide, smiling like nothing in the world could ever stay serious for too long. His shirt was unbuttoned to the chest, sleeves rolled, the charm practically leaking out of him. Blond hair curled naturally over his brow, and his eyes — those damn sparkling things — made everyone forgive him for everything. He leaned against the wall like he owned the room.

— Come on, you sour bat. People are out there screaming for you. Even saw a couple ladies with signs. “Marry me, Merlin.” “Make me disappear, daddy.” Disgusting stuff. I’m proud.

I turned my head just enough to catch him in the mirror and let one side of my mouth twitch. My version of a smile. He grinned wider in response, like he’d won something. I turned back to the mirror, touched the fake smile on the glass with one finger. It smeared just a little.

— They want the freakshow, I’ll give them the freakshow, — I muttered.

— That’s the spirit, — he said, clapping once. — I’ll be out there, priming the pigs. Meet you at the wings.

He winked, then ducked out like wind — fast, light, already thinking about what girl he’d be kissing tonight or what idiot would pay for their drinks.

I waited until his footsteps were gone, reached for the bottle under the table, unscrewed it, and let the burn settle behind my teeth. Not enough to blur the edges. Just enough to harden them.

Then I stood, rolled my shoulders once, cracked my knuckles, and whispered to no one:

— Let’s go lie to the world.

Breathing, shifting, waiting. That fat, greedy kind of crowd noise. They didn’t want a performance. They wanted a miracle they could piss on after.

When the host called my name, she dragged it out like a drunk about to vomit.

— *And now... the impossible, the immortal, the mind-blowing Merlin the Magnificent!*

The roar was deafening. The lights snapped on like a slap to the face.

I stepped into it slowly. No bow, no flourish. Just me, my boots, and the deck already in my hand — my fingers moving on instinct. The cards weren’t props. They were an extension of thought. Something I understood even when I hated everything else.

One flick — a card arced into the air and dropped perfectly into a woman’s cleavage. Gasps. Laughter. I looked surprised. Another flick — and I pulled a duplicate from the man beside her, straight out of his hair. More laughter. Applause. They were already mine, too easy.

— Watch carefully, — I said, spinning a card between my fingers. — This might be your last chance to see something real.

Three more cards — one disappeared, one caught fire midair and snuffed out in my palm, one fell from the ringleader’s hat. He didn’t even know it was there. He jumped. The crowd roared again.

Then I saw him.

Middle row. Dead center. Perfect view. A man in a dark coat, clean lines, expensive shoulders. The kind of fabric you don’t buy — it gets tailored for you. His hair was sharp, his face too calm. Everyone else was clapping or laughing or reacting. He just watched.

Measured.

Unblinking.

I knew that look. The same way you know the smell of blood before you see the wound.

One of *them*. The moneyed wolves. The kind who tip extra just to own you for a night. The kind who smile during funerals and never miss a tax loophole. I’d spent my whole life avoiding their kind — or worse, performing for them.

My jaw tensed. But I smiled. Not kindly.

— Let’s see if I can impress *you*, — I whispered.

I turned to the audience.

— Now, this... is the Ace of Clubs.

I held it up between two fingers, made sure everyone saw. The card was crisp, black, proud. I twirled it, kissed it with mock reverence, and let it fly.

A clean arc — high, smooth — swallowed by the crowd.

— And now...",15,1750269023.0

Still nothing.

I swallowed. Snap. Snap.

The card didn’t come back.

It *always* came back.

It was mine. It was *bonded*. It had never failed. Ever.

Snap.

Still nothing.

The pressure behind my ribs spread like cold smoke. My hand began to tremble. I didn’t show it — not yet — but my mind was racing. Did someone catch it? Block it? Was *he* interfering?

The crowd was shifting now. Not laughing. Not yet. But confused. Murmurs.

I snapped again. Louder. Nothing. The air stayed empty.

My stomach dropped like I’d stepped off a building. My heart, a rag in a fist.

Then someone chuckled.

Then another.

Then the host stepped in, voice all sugar.

— Looks like even Merlin’s cards need a night off! Give it up for the man, folks!

Laughter rolled through the tent, louder this time. Like a wave crashing over failure. My failure.

I bowed. I *had* to. I bowed like I meant to. I bowed like a clown.

And I walked off the stage before my hands started shaking for real.

1lema7i,myhkvy5,"The door slammed behind me with a clap that echoed longer than it should’ve. The sound felt too sharp, like it wanted to hurt me. My boots dragged across the warped wooden floor, scuffing each step like I was trying to erase myself with noise. I didn’t stop at the table — just swept my forearm across it, sent brushes, powder tins, playing cards, everything crashing to the ground in one violent move. A bottle rolled. A candle tipped over and died.

I stood there, breathing heavy, chest rising and falling like something feral had just worn me and let go.

Then I turned, slow and shaky, and faced the mirror again. The stupid painted-on smile had smeared from the heat and my earlier touch — it looked like it was melting, bleeding down my reflection’s cheek. I sat. The chair creaked under me. I reached for the bottle on the floor, found it with my foot, dragged it back up into my hand. One long pull. The kind that made your throat burn just enough to remind you you were still cursed to exist.

I stared into the mirror. Into him. Me.

— I hate you, — I whispered. No venom in it. Just fact.

A knock.

I didn’t move.

— You alright in there? — Rory’s voice, casual but not quite. He knew something had gone wrong. He *always* knew when I wasn’t faking it well enough.

I waved a hand vaguely at the door, even though he couldn’t see me.

— It was part of the act, — I called, flat. — Bit of chaos. Crowds love that.

— Mmm. Sure. Good thing I was out there. Kept their eyes busy. Picked clean at least four fine folks who’ll wake up lighter tomorrow. Hell, even the ringleader laughed. You're still a legend, brother.

I managed a breath. Not a laugh. But something.

— We’ll hit the bar. I’ve got enough for three rounds and a hangover. Two lovely ladies said they might join us. One’s got freckles on her thighs. You’re not gonna want to miss that.

— Go ahead, — I said. — I’ll catch up.

— Ten minutes. Don’t mope too long.

I heard his boots fade into the hallway. His whistle trailed off with him — something lazy and upbeat, like none of this mattered.

Another drink.

The room went quiet again. But something was *wrong*. I could feel it — a shift in pressure, like a storm behind a wall.

Another knock.",15,1750269092.0
1lema7i,myhkycm,"I didn't answer.

— I said I’ll be right there, — I snapped.

But the voice that replied wasn’t Rory’s.

— The trick was fascinating. Shame the card never came back.

I froze.

My skin went cold. Not chills — *wrong*. Like a warning from somewhere older than instinct.

I stood slowly, set the bottle down, and marched to the door. Every step felt thick. My hand hit the knob. I yanked it open.

No one.

The hallway was empty. Still.

I looked left, right.

Nothing.

A drop of sweat rolled down my spine. Not from heat.

I shut the door. Locked it. The click echoed strangely in the quiet. A second *click* followed — not mine. Not from the door.

Behind me, something *rang* — soft, metallic, barely audible.

I turned.

There, on the table, *under the bottle of whiskey that hadn’t moved* — was an envelope.

My blood ran tight. My body refused to breathe.

I approached like it might vanish if I got too close.

The envelope was off-white. Heavy. Wax-sealed.

No logo. No name.

Except mine — handwritten on the front.

I slid the bottle off. Picked up the letter. Turned it over.

Broke the seal.

One card slid out and fluttered to the floor.

The Ace of Clubs.

*My* card.

My knees almost gave out. I backed up slowly, hand over my mouth, and sank into the couch. Eyes locked on the card like it might move on its own. I didn’t speak. Didn’t blink. For a moment, I wasn’t even sure I was *alive*.

I forced myself to move. One finger at a time.

Picked up the envelope again.",17,1750269110.0
1lema7i,myhkyxy,"Inside: a letter. Thick, elegant paper. Dark ink. The words were too calm, too personal. An invitation. To a school I’d never heard of. Said I had... potential. That I could find what I’d always been looking for. That answers waited there — if I had the courage to accept.

The final line chilled me more than anything else:

*We’ll be expecting you, \[my name\].*

Right as my eyes reached the last letter of my name — the door *slammed* open behind me.

The wind punched through the room, hard enough to blow out every candle in a single breath. The papers scattered. The air snapped like something ancient had walked through.

I sat frozen.

Couldn’t move.

Couldn’t look back.

My heart — wasn’t even pounding. It felt like it had left. Abandoned me. I was hollow.

Then something even stranger.

The letter — on the floor now — *glowed*.

Not fully. Not fire. Not magic I understood.

Just... shimmered. My name on the page, softly lit in the pitch black.

Then — a sound. Steps. Lighter.

— You in there, freakshow? Why’s it dark? You fall asleep?

Rory’s voice. Real. Loud. Grounded.

The spell snapped.

I leapt to my feet, almost stumbled. Grabbed my coat off the hook, fast.

— I’m coming, — I said.

He peeked in.

— Thought you bailed. You alright?

— Yeah. Just... yeah. Let’s go.

— Two lovely dames at the corner bar. One of ‘em was already asking if you were taken. She likes your... mystery bullshit.

He walked ahead, his voice fading into the tent.

I reached the flap of the exit, paused, turned back one last time.

The couch. The envelope. The card still lying where I’d dropped it.

1lema7i,myhl4dl,"The cold hit different tonight. Not sharp. Not cruel. Just… *present*. Like a hand on the back of your neck. The kind of chill that didn’t come from the wind but from the space between things. Like the world had leaned in a little closer.

We walked in silence for a while. Rory talked — of course he did — but I wasn’t really listening. Something about the bartender with the dimples, about how one of the girls waiting for us smelled like honey and another like cinnamon and how he was having a hard time deciding which dessert to sample first. I nodded at the right moments. Grunted a “mm” when it wouldn’t sound too out of place. But my head was full of something else.

That card.

That voice.

That *letter*.

It didn’t feel like a trick. It didn’t feel like magic either — not the kind I used, not the kind that snapped into your palm and danced between fingers. This was heavier. Older. Like something had finally *noticed* me. And I wasn’t sure that was a good thing.

Rory elbowed me in the ribs.

— You even here, Merlin? Or you still in the tent crying over your missing mojo?

I glanced sideways.

— Just tired.

— Tired? That’s rich. You sleep till noon, work one hour a night, drink yourself stupid, and still manage to look like someone kicked your puppy. What’s going on with you?",13,1750269155.0

— Did you see anything weird? During the show?

He blinked.

— Uh... define “weird.” You mean, besides your little moment of stage fright?

I shook my head.

— Never mind.

We crossed the street. The bar was glowing up ahead — soft yellow light spilling onto the sidewalk like it was trying to pretend it was warmer inside than it was. Through the window, two women sat at a small table near the front. Both laughing. One blonde, one redhead. They looked like they belonged to another story. One I didn’t know how to be in.

Rory turned to me before we entered.

— Hey. Whatever that was tonight... it’s fine. Shit happens. You’re still the best thing this dump has ever seen. Don’t let it eat you alive, yeah?

I managed a half-nod.

He clapped me on the shoulder.

— Come on. Let’s go make a few strangers fall in love with us.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside. Music spilled out. Warmth. Laughter.

I stayed on the sidewalk. Just for a second longer. Watching the girls. Watching Rory slip into his perfect rhythm. Already flashing that grin, already pulling chairs, already charming his way into another temporary paradise.

I stood there.

Not cold. Not warm.

In between.

My hand drifted to the inside pocket of my coat. Not the outer one. Not where I kept cigarettes or my show cards. The other one. The secret one.

It was empty.

Of course it was.

The Ace of Clubs was still on that couch.

Still glowing.

Still waiting.

I looked through the glass one more time. Then pushed the door open and followed Rory into the noise, into the warmth, into the part of my life I understood.

1lea72r,myeu216,"As the marketing lead at MagicTech Industries, I thought our new teleportation device would be the easiest product I’d ever have to sell. “Instant travel!” “Be anywhere in seconds!” The taglines practically wrote themselves.

That was until our first public demonstration.

I stood next to our Creative Director, Melanie, and our Marketing Strategist, Dave, watching in horror as our CEO volunteered to be the first test subject. The machine hummed, lights flashed, and then… nothing happened at the destination pad. Five excruciating seconds passed before a floating skeleton materialized.

“Is that…?” Dave whispered.

“Yep, that’s the boss’s bones,” Melanie confirmed, furiously scribbling notes. “Just the bones.”

“Holy sh—” I started, before the CEO’s organs began slowly appearing, attaching themselves to the skeleton like some macabre science documentary.

The crowd gasped. Someone fainted. A reporter started live-streaming.

“We’re so screwed,” Dave muttered, his marketing strategy notes now useless. “Who’s going to buy a teleporter that temporarily turns you into a walking anatomy lesson?”

Melanie, ever the creative genius, tilted her head thoughtfully. “Actually… I think I see an angle here.”

Two excruciating minutes later, our CEO stood fully reassembled, blinking in confusion as the audience stared in stunned silence.

“Ladies and gentlemen!” I heard myself shouting, marketing instincts kicking in. “You’ve just witnessed the world’s first TRANSPARENT teleportation process!”

The next morning, our emergency marketing meeting was chaos.

“Transparent teleportation?” Dave hissed. “That’s the best you could come up with?”

“I was under pressure!” I defended myself. “You try coming up with copy while watching your boss’s liver float through the air!”

Melanie slammed her coffee mug down. “No, no, he’s onto something. Think about it – in a world obsessed with transparency, we’re the only company literally showing you how the humans gets made.”

“Please never use that phrase again,” Dave groaned.

“What if,” I said, inspiration striking, “we market it as a health feature? ‘The MagicTech TransporterPlus: The only travel technology that gives you a free medical scan with every trip!’”

Dave snorted. “Or how about: ‘Our competitors keep you in the dark about what happens during teleportation. We’ve got nothing to hide – and neither will you!’”",89,1750233128.0

""It is still a molecular reconstruction."" one of the developers mutters.  
""Yeah. A slow one, a gradual one, that starts with the fucking bones! How can that even be explained?  
And you wrote: ""You can feel it happen, but it's not painful.""   
Like...for real?"" I ask.

In 2 minutes I have went to our location in Poland, that's like almost 6 thousand miles in 2 minutes!"" he says.

""Look, I don't want to undermine your amazing discovery, and invention.  
It is amazing. But people won't eat weird looking food, won't use ""weak"" looking cars, won't buy too thin looking clothes...and more situations like this.  
How can our company sell to anyone, governmental or public, when we literally tell them that we build them back up, piece by piece?"" I say.  
""It is painless...and we are working on the timeframe. One day, it will be instantaneous."" they mutter.  
""One day, not today, not tomorrow."" I sigh.  
""Solve it. We have to make this work, the government is sending some people to check in a week."" the CFO says, and then leaves.  
Great. 

  
A week later, I personally make the presentation.  
""The teleporter is here to revolutionize transportation! Our own engineer has personally went through the process, and appeared from our L.A. location in our Poland office in 2 minutes!

""Risks?"" they ask.  
""No risks. More than 3000 individuals have been teleported successfully to various location safely, securely, with no hidden issue, as you can read in the reports."" I say.

Suspended in a sort of stasis field, unaware of what was happening, the creature was appearing; one molecule at a time, albeit fairly quickly. He'd started out as a hazy outline. Then a skeleton. A mass of organs and veins. And only now was skin and fur starting to appear.

He looked at Dr. Karns. ""Any way to work on the speed?""

The disheveled older man sighed. ""Its processing and transmission. If we try to do it too fast, we have to leave some of the error correction out... and sometimes mistakes are made. Anything less than sixty-three seconds and the chance of issues goes from microscopic to... unacceptable. We'll need an order of magnitude more bandwidth and processing power from the units to get past the 1-minute mark.""

Jimmy gave a slow nod. ""Well then. First things first. We're going to be using a cover over the whole thing so nobody can see what's going on. Second.... Can you make it slower?""

Karns blinked.

""Uhm.... Yes? The first one took over a week. Was honestly quite disturbing.""

""And would anything be disrupted if, for example, we were to.... put objects on.... or off... of the subject as they were being reassembled?""

""Well, only in that we normally encase it in a stasis field to make the subject unaware of whats going on and hold everything together. There's normally a few stray oxygen molecules that get included, but that'd need to change the process a bit.""

Jimmy gave a slow nod. ""Just a cover for the basics then. We can teleport someone to mars in 63 seconds, nobody will complain if they can't watch the process. But the marketing opportunities for surgery and diagnostic medical purposes... well. Slow might not be bad. A good, high-resolution, scan of someone as they get assembled... we could spot every tumor, and then kill them off on a second pass, couldn't we?""

""....That's.... I need to make a few calls.""

Jimmy gave a quick nod. ""You do that. And have a prototype with a sliding opaque door loaded up. This.... is going to make us company incredibly rich.""

  
Jimmy smiled, and headed to the elevator. Everybody involved in the project had been paid mostly in stock options. Including himself.

After a few seconds of silence, Dan replied. ""It disassembles and reassembles the user, piece by piece, over the course of about an hour. Have you ever used a 3D printer? Yeah, pretty much like that, except a lot more screaming.""

""Dan, you've got to be fucking kidding me. I'm supposed to do a presentation on this in front of a thousand people in fifteen minutes. What do you expect me to do?""

""You're the sales person, Reggie, not me. Best of luck out there.""

The line disconnected immediately. What the fuck. Why hadn't anyone told me about this before? I had an hour long presentation prepared to sell this damn thing, which was approved by TeleTech, and not one person thought to tell me it's a fucking torture device? Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

A few minutes later, I found myself standing alone on stage in front of a room full of geniuses, looking at me and waiting to have their minds blown. The way I saw it, I had only two choices: Tell them the truth, which would probably be the end of my career, and probably the end of TeleTech. Or, instead of giving an oral presentation, I could use the sample machine and give a demonstration; pretend I'm a victim, and maybe get some compensation from TeleTech. Maybe my career would survive. Thrive, even.

As I stood there, pondering my decision as the crowd waited for me to begin, I decided to risk it.

I gazed upon the crowd, my eyes sweeping from left to right, and said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today. Instead of giving you some lame speech telling you what this thing can do, I'm just going to show you. How does that sound?""

The crowd immediately cheered, clearly surprised by my offer.

I walked to the sample machine and powered it on, as the technicians taught me during my training to create the sales presentation. I stepped into the activation zone and used my credentials to access the user interface. Seeing as the only other operating machine was located at the TeleTech headquarters, I set my destination there, and I initiated the teleportation process.

Dan told me the whole process would take about an hour, but I can't say whether that was the case. The moment the process began, it felt as though my skin was being burned off, layer by layer. I started to scream as I looked down to see the layers disappearing, the muscle and sinew of my arms exposed. I could hear the crowd screaming, and many people started to panic. Hundreds of people ran out of the room, unable to watch the horrific sight before them, but I could not escape it. I looked down again to see my bones slowly disintegrating, the pain so intense that I could only pray for unconsciousness to take me, but I was not so lucky.

Many people stayed in the room, their smart phones recording the entire process. Even through my pain, I knew this would be the end of TeleTech, and the beginning of my life as a celebrity.

This continued for what felt like an eternity, and eventually replayed in reverse as I reanimated at the TeleTech headquarters. As the process came to a halt and the pain began to subside, it became more and more clear how much money and fame I could gain from this. I would be unstoppable.

At least, that was what I had expected. As it turned out, people were more than willing to endure unimaginable pain for near-instant travel. As the weeks and months carried on, TeleTech became one of the largest companies in the world.

“Can you make it go slower?”

The cacophony of yelling that had been consuming the room came to a sudden stop. I was watching the slowly forming torso of the teleports test subject but knew all eyes were on me.

“Slower?” Michael, the lead designer asked.

“Slower!” Lynn, one of the fellow marketing team yelled. Jeremy this thing is… it’s… you want it go slower?”

“Can it be done?” I asked again.

“I mea-“ Michael was cut off.

“Are you seeing the same thing as me Jeremy?” Lynn stormed over to look me in the eye. “You want to make this… torture device run slower.”

“Tell me what you see Lynn?”

“Something I hope to god I can burn out of brain with therapy and bourbon.”

“Nice. But be specific.” I point. “See that, just formed in the ribcage?”

Damien, head of acquisitions has wandered over at this point. “Oh god is that a heart? Jesus it’s still fucking beating.”

“A heart yes. Ever seen one before Lynn?”

“What?!”

“Have you ever seen a heart before. A human one?”

“No, Jeremy I haven’t seen a human fucking heart and I hope to god I never have to see one again.”

I ignored her and turned to Damien. “Damien, ever seen one?” He shook his head and looked down, going slightly green.

I turned away from the demonstration to the assembled engineers, technicians, business big wigs and the rest of my small marketing team. “Hands up whose seen a heart before just now?” The technicians raised their hands. “Ok, who saw one before they started teleporting people?” The technicians lowered their hands, now there were none raised.

“Ok so, who might have seen one?” I asked the assembled room.

“Jeremy you had better have a good-“ Lynn began

“Let him finish.” This from Maurice, our CEO. I nodded in gratitude.

“Anyone?” I asked again.

There was a moment of silence.

Imran, one of my graduates got their first. He slammed his hands down on the table in triumph and shouted “Surgeons!”

I clicked my fingers and confirmed “Surgeons! Exactly!” I walked quickly over to the viewing portal, where more and more viscera was being applied to the skeleton. “Ladies and gentlemen as a teleport this things is useless.” Michael looked set to talk but I didn’t let him. “But consider this, what if it’s not a teleporter, but the greatest piece of medical technology since the MRI machine.”

I walked around the room. “Imagine, surgery without all of that annoying other fat and muscle and skin getting in the way, just get straight to the affected organ, make the fix and close it up before the rest of the body even shows up! No more stitches, forceps, just get straight to he heart of the matter.”

I hated that line the moment it left my mouth. I knew that would be the marketing line the bigwigs in the roo would love.

“One small problem there Jeremy.” Lynn again “Hearts already gone look.” Sure enough the heart was slowly being enveloped my muscle and tissue.

“Hence the question.” I turned to Michael. “Can you slow it down?”

Michael stumbled and stammered but one of his own subordinates piped up. “Erm, maybe?”

Michael turned to her looking betrayed but I once again stepped in. Reading the name tag I said “Andrea? Please, what have you got for us?”

“Well” she looked to Michael for approval but saw only his slack jaw “when we did the original tests there was an exponential increase in time due to distance. We were going to relay data between nodes for speed, lots of little hops, but if we did one hop and had the thrower/catcher modules at a great distance…”

“How long?” I ask.

“Erm… hours? I’d have to run the numbers.”

“Do that.” I tell her. “Not right now.” As she gets out a pencil, paper and phone. “Just… get back to us.”

“Antipodes.” Imran says. I turn to him. “Imran?”

“Antipodes, we set the modules up at antipodes. Opposite sides of the earth. We can use Spain and and and New Zealand and that way…”

“We can still use the teleports for tourists, YES Imran!”

A cough. Lynn. “I’m no expert” she says, I bite my tongue “but this seems unreliable, and what happens if the surgery is prolonged, and suddenly a lung materialises over a heart you e cut open.”

I don’t even attempt to answer and turn to my new asset. “Andrea?”

She looks startled. “We’ll, erm, the whole thing is based on neutron flow, in theory we can reverse the polarity mid transit and reverse the flow. If we can oscillate the polarity we might even be able to pause the transmission.”

Michael’s brain finally remembers how his mouth works. “This is all completely untested! We don’t know for certain if this will work an-“

I slap him on the shoulder. “Yes and that Michael is why you have our full support to do whatever there you need.” Here I turn to Maurice. He simply nods.

Here I turn to “Michael?” I’m asking him not Andrea, competent and compliant as she seems it’s his project and I need him on side.",10,1750287128.0

1lea72r,mylw9hq,"The machine was the size of a shipping container and hummed a low menace. We stood - all of us grim and vibrating with nerves - as the last of Mitchell, his hair, finally spiraled out of follicles which we’d also seen populate slowly. It was a hard thing to witness and an even harder thing to fathom. The whole of him had grown outward from the bones. And it’d taken half an hour. To say it seemed painful was like saying nothing at all. No words could describe the agony we’d witnessed.

Of course, this horror had been preceded by horror. When Team A transmitted him to us, the process took 3.08 seconds. We watched over CCTV. It took long enough for us to see Mitchell’s face become a rictus of terror and long enough for us to see his constituent parts recede inward until nothing was left but the bones and when they vanished there was nothing at all. 

But when he began to appear at the receiving end, it took exponentially longer and was commensurately worse. The scale of suffering was grand. For those 29 minutes and change that reassembly took, I know that every last one of us - Mitch included - wished for death. It hung in the air, that hope for death, like a heavy gauze over everything. It dampened all sound and clouded all vision.

It was still there even after Mitch was whole - physically. Mentally and emotionally we had no idea. He lay there a shaking and naked blob. He was quiet except for ragged breathing. Finally, one of the scientists carried a lab coat to him and did her best to swaddle him - though quickly for obvious fear of staying in that machine too long.

It was the first human test after decades of research. Begun as a top secret government project, the thing had been bought, kit-and-kaboodle, by Northgray. Now, as matters of capitalism go, they wanted their return on investment. 

That meant rolling it out. 

At first, I’d had no idea why I was there - not being involved with the math or science- but it dawned on me as I stood there. I was to provide the polish.

My heart pumped one great gush at this thought and from there beat wildly. Cold sweat and nausea with a sprinkling of gooseflesh consumed me. Why else would someone from PR be witnessing this thing? They didn’t pay me to report objectively - I was to be the liaison between this tragedy and the rest of the world.

I’d have to make it sound *good.*

Like my thoughts could be seen or heard, the door to the observation room, with its two way glass, opened. In walked a handful of men wearing tailored suits. The lead, Arthur Protherow, stopped just next to me. He addressed the whole room but I know that his words were meant for me.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask that you give yourselves a round of applause.”

Silence for a long moment, then an anemic scattering of claps. I looked at the screen for any indication of Team A’s thoughts. They just clapped stupidly as well, the tenuous data connection sapping all life from their weak attempt at self-congratulation. 

“Now,” Arthur continued, “We are to introduce this technology into the world. It will change everything - travel, diplomacy, warfare.” Of the three things he listed, only the last he spoke with any tinge of intent. 

“But we must focus on the *positives*. This machine will usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for those around the globe.”

By lunchtime, we’d rebranded the teleporter as “The InsideOut™ – Travel With Full Transparency.” Our marketing campaign focused on the trust factor: competitors’ instant teleportation was suspicious – what were they hiding? Ours showed every step of the reassembly process because we were confident in our technology.

We even partnered with medical schools. “See your anatomy in action!” became a hit educational program.

The weirdest part? It worked. Our waiting list grew longer each day.

As I was preparing for a press interview, our CEO stopped by my office.

“Great job turning this around,” he said. “Though I have to ask – are we any closer to fixing the reassembly speed?”

I smiled, sliding over the latest sales report. “Actually, sir, the engineering team says they could fix it by next week, but our focus groups show that 78% of customers now prefer the slow reassembly. They say it’s ‘oddly satisfying.’”

“Any surgery would, but here we have a few small incisions as opposed to cutting through multiple layers of fat and bone.”

I turn to Maurice. “Sir as a teleport I repeat its largely useless. No one will want to go through that”  I gesture to the body which is being slowly wrapped in skin “they don’t even want to go through baggage claims.

I see the marketing team glow with pride, feel Lynn glaring at me, see Michael look bewildered and see Andrea deep in thought, scribbling on a notepad.

I turn to look at the man in the other room, stark naked, sleeping peacefully, true to Michael’s word he’s dosed to the hilt.

1lepwd7,myignrd,"Hell wasn't exactly what Dennis had expected. No fire and brimstone, no pitchforks, just an endless queue of souls waiting their turn to relive their most embarrassing moments on a loop for all eternity. Simple, psychological torture—efficient, really.

When Dennis's number was called, he shuffled nervously into a small, dimly lit room with a single chair facing a large screen.

""Have a seat,"" said his assigned demon assistant, Mephistopheles—or ""Phil"" as his name tag read. ""You know the drill. We'll go through your most embarrassing moments, you'll suffer eternally, standard procedure.""

Dennis nodded and sank into the chair. Phil hit play on what looked suspiciously like a TV.

*Three years later...*

Phil burst into the viewing room, clipboard in hand, horns slightly askew. ""Hey, um, Dennis? We've got a bit of a scheduling issue. You've been in here for three years watching... wait, is that you as a toddler?""

On screen, three-year-old Dennis was simply eating breakfast, spilling a bit of milk down his shirt.

""Yeah,"" Dennis cringed, covering his eyes. ""God, look how I'm holding that spoon! Everyone could see I had no coordination.""

Phil glanced at his clipboard, then back at the screen. ""I don't understand. Most souls are done by now. They cycle through their five or six worst moments and that's it. You've been watching... your entire life?""

""Well, yeah,"" Dennis replied, gesturing to the screen where his younger self was now taking a nap. ""Look at how I'm drooling! In public! My mom took me to the park after this and I fell asleep on the bench. Everyone saw!""

Phil scratched between his horns. ""That's... that's just being a toddler, Dennis. That's not embarrassing. That's literally what toddlers do.""

""Easy for you to say. You weren't there."" Dennis shuddered. ""Wait till we get to middle school. There's this one time I said 'you too' when the movie ticket seller said 'enjoy the show.'""

Phil checked his notes again. ""According to your file, your top five embarrassing moments should've been: your wedding speech where you accidentally thanked your ex, the time you split your pants at your job interview, when you waved back at someone who was waving to the person behind you...""

Dennis interrupted. ""But then there was this time in second grade when I pronounced 'Massachusetts' wrong during geography class.""

Phil sat down heavily beside Dennis. ""You know, we've got other souls waiting. There's a murderer who's supposed to use this room next to relive the time he accidentally called his victim 'mom...'""

Phil stared at Dennis, then at the screen, then back at Dennis. ""I've been in Hell for five thousand years, and I've never seen anyone this... thoroughly embarrassed by their entire existence.""

""Some people are just born with higher standards,"" Dennis said with a sniff.

Phil tossed his clipboard aside. ""You know what? I think we're going to need to reassign you. This isn't working.""

""Reassign me? To where?""

""Heaven, probably. We can't have you hogging the embarrassment booth for eternity. Plus,"" Phil added, leaning in conspiratorially, ""between you and me, your constant self-criticism is making the rest of us demons look bad. We're supposed to be the ones torturing you, not the other way around.""

Dennis gasped. ""Are you saying I'm... too good?""

""I'm saying you're the most efficient self-torture mechanism Hell has ever seen.""

Steam curled from the mug like a ghost making its slow getaway. I didn’t say anything. Didn't need to. His file was already filled out, crossreferenced, clocked, and sorted into a hundred probable pasts. What he really came for wasn’t the science. It was permission to believe.  
  
He finally cracked.

“Elaine…” he said, voice shot through with old wounds. “She was… my life. It’s been years and I just—” Words dried up in his throat but that didn’t matter. I’d heard enough.

I gave him the silence he didn’t give himself. The kind that lets a man breathe without choking on memory.

""You are really ""lucky""."" she giggles.  
""What can I say?  
I used all my luck, to get you."" I chuckle, kissing her back.

1le4u1b,myet0db,"""I said put me down you absolute imbecile,"" I shouted at the rather large oaf of an 'adventurer' that had to dane to 'rescue me' from my home.

""why would I put you down,"" The clumsy fool had the audacity to look at me with confusion and ask, ""I am carrying you to safety from that monster that has had you captive for the last several months, if anything you should be greatful.""

I tried to flail my arms and legs to break his princess carry on me but to no avail, the oaf was strong atleast. if only he had the wits to match.

I stewed for a minute trying to think of a way to get him to put me down when he suddenly spoke, ""I think that oni must of been some sort of mage to confuse you so much, I mean look at you, your pregnant with that filths offspring!""

I was too shocked at the drivel that came out of this mans mouth I couldnt reply before he prattled on with his idiocy, ""Dont worry though, I know a doctor that can help you be rid of that parasite in y-""

His rant was cut short by my fingers driving into his eyes, luckly he didnt out right drop me but he did put me down ruffly before cradling his face. as he knelt there i began to lecture him, ""as i have been trying to say this whole godsdamned time, i was not kidnapped, nor was i hypnotized and raped.""

through his teary eyes he looked at me with great confusion and he opened his mouth to argue back but i cut him off continuing my scolding, ""Second point, if i was a hostage, why was i roaming the gardens without any restraints or guards, hmm?""

""well i j-"", he bean to sputter when i began to talk over him, ""that oni is my husband, a better man than you, and this child i am carrying is the cultivation of our love........ gods that was cheesy when i said it out loud, and i bet you think you were so sneaky stalking our house for that last two day, hmmm, didnt you?""

He looked utterly aghast that I had know he was watching the house, ""how did you know I was watching you?""

Sighing I summoned my scrying glass into my hand, ""Thought I saw a person outside near dusk a few days ago and when I checked the area I saw you hiding in a tree, wrongfully I ignored you, thinking thatyou were just passing through.""

""you're a mage,"" He said questionily, ""so you're not in trouble?""

""No,"" I said flatly, ""I would blasted you with a fireball or an icicle lance when you grabbed me but I dont know what kind of strain using advanced magic would have on my child.""

He finally had the never to look sheepish, and lower his gaze to the ground, ""I apologize for this misunderstanding......""

i sighed again, ""my husband was right, we should have settled in igrissa instead, less demi-human discrimination.""

he stayed silent looking at the grass as if were the most interesting thing in the world, ""well the least you could do is get off of your ass and escort me back to my house, the garden is safe due to my wards but the forest is still home to actual monsters.""

He got to his feet and grumble another apology and turn back towards my house. as he started lumbering ther i waved at my husband who had shown up at the start of my lecture, I blew him a kiss and started back down the path to the house.

1le4u1b,mygzyrd,"“Ok, well, I have had a great time drinking with you guys, but it’s probably time I get back home.” I reach for the bag I brought with me. 

“Yeah, ok. Wait, we just rescued you, where is your home?” The group leader said. 

I pause, and look at him. “You rescued me? From what? I came with you because that big guy over there thought he could out drink me.” I point at the Goliath crying under the table, sloshed out of his mind. “Pity too, the drinks here aren’t even that strong…”

“No, we went to the house of the demon, fought our way past the guards, got past that dog, and found you in a locked room, so we had to save you. For the great demon queen had locked you in there and was going to devour you or use your soul for nefarious purposes!”

I knew I had locked that door! But I forgot to ask how they got into my study when the big guy saw my drink and challenged me to a drink off. “You didn’t pay any attention to the door once you were through it, did you? It was locked, from the inside. I don’t like people intruding in my study, you just got lucky and came in when my study was done.”

“You were in there willingly? Ah, you have been bewitched! Clearance, could you clear his mind for us? That might also explain why he was able to put drink our man over there.” 

Their cleric comes up be hind me, and places his hands on my head, “ahfosbtjei didbrosjsaa bidid🚫🤯” and casts the spell that cancels all mind magics, at a pretty high level. Oh crap, my ring of self inspection, um, this might be fun. This ring allows spells cast on me to take effect, but they also affect the castor (listen, we all have our kinks, don’t kink shame me!). The spell I cast on them to accept this demon bar as a normal human one lifts, and I see his eyes widen as he looks at the barmaid. However, I also see the spell of sobriety lift and he falls back passed out drunk next to the crying Goliath, who I didn’t give the spell of sobriety to. Even if I did, his kind resist that spell something mighty. 

“Must have been almost out of mana… anyway, I saw the spell take effect, you are happy we saved you now right?”

“Yeah, no. Also, what did you do to Ralph? You said you got ‘past him’?” I ask as the thought occurs to me as I realize the bard went outside to take a leak about an hour ago.

“Who? Oh the giant dog, we put him to sleep.”

“Put him to sleep? Ralph is immune to sleep spells and effects. He interprets them as instructions to play ‘hide and seek’”

A look of realization comes across the leaders face. “So that is why he covered his eyes, and his snores sounded so weird, and kept getting longer…”

“Yep. He’s also a shape shifter, and carries people back to his little prison house when he finds them” a rat jumps on the rogues lap, and they both disappear. “He plays fair though, only does one person at a time.”The leader curses and jumps back at the sight. “Anyway, I suggest you let me go back” I finish picking up my bag and turn to leave. 

“Why are you taking our loot!”

I sigh. “This? This isn’t your loot, you didn’t loot my house, you didn’t get past my dog, we don’t have guards, I don’t know what gave you that idea. But if I don’t get back before my honey does, she is likely to raise hell again.”

“But you are human! Why do you live with the demon queen!”

“Hey, I can only reincarnate once every thousand years. And I don’t choose what I reincarnate as, a quarter of the time it’s a human. That doesn’t stop me from being with my immortal wife. And I think four lives ago, some hero came to save me, took me by force, and the great age of hell started from her campaign to take me back.” The color drains from his face. Legends have been told of the great age of hell, and it wasn’t good for any human, well, except me. I had a great time once my wife found me. But religions were based around preventing it from happening again, no matter the cost. 

“But we got past the guards. They were easy” a cat jumps on the cleric and both he and the Goliath disappear, oh, they were holding hands, yeah, Ralph doesn’t like to separate lovers…

“What lead you to believe they were our guards?” I ask. 

“They were carrying signs, with the demon queens face on them!”

“You took care of the protestors in front of our house! That’s awesome! I was going to need to do that tomorrow!” I reach into my bag and pull out an enchanted sword, mythical grade. “Here is for your good work!”

I go pay the barmaid, from the rogues purse I happened to swipe. I’ll give it back, but I am not paying for my own drinks here. This is an expensive establishment. 

As I open the door to leave, I step out of the way of a giant lizard tongue, that shoots through the door, and attaches to the leader’s face. It starts pulling him back before they both disappear. Really it’s his fault for not moving after learning they were playing hide and seek.  I will probably let them out tomorrow, but I won’t have time tonight. I get to hear about my honey’s business trip and see if she brought anything fun home to study!

Walking past our front gates, I can see the group did a rather nasty thing to the protestors. I will have to clean this up, maybe I shouldn’t have given them that sword. Or maybe I’ll ask them to clean it up on their way out… that is easier. I’ll do that. 

I walk in and sit down at our dinner table right as the portal opens “Hi honey! How was your trip?” Oh, her face is not happy. I’m glad I’m home. Humanity might not have survived a second age of hell with that look. I best not bring up the party saving me…",26,1750263303.0

""Guys, hello, would you mind stepping out of my garden, please.""

""Oh, the monster has taken a hostage, worry not, innocent civilian, we will save you from this horrible simurgh."" Before I can say anything else, this big ass himbo on armor picks me up and jumps my fence, which wasn´t even closed. 

""Guys, if you just give me a minute to explain...""

""Not now, we will take you to our camp and then the beast shall be executed,""

""That is my wife you are talking about, now put me the fuck down because when she arrives to the house, I better be there to help her put the groceries away or she will hunt you all down and honestly at this point I might even do it myself because all of you are a bunch of hard-headed idiots.""",17,1750263604.0
1le4u1b,mykebs2,"""I'm telling you,"" I said in the tavern bedroom while the paladin and wizard continued wasting their powers on casting curse-lifting spells, ""I am not bewitched! Lua is my wife of my own volition; hell, I proposed to HER! There was no need to rescue me!""

""This is no ordinary magic that the witch from the Underground cast upon him,"" the wizard said, finally relaxing. ""She must be more powerful than I to cast a permanent curse that clouds his mind enough for him to hold out against the truth spell.""

""Get it through your heads!"" I said, exasperated. Wizards may be far more intelligent, but none of these morons who broke into my home seemed to have a decent amount of insight. ""I'm in love with my WIFE!""

""The woman who had you making poisons for her?"" the rogue asked. He held up a few healing potions that were clearly stolen from our home in a dark bottle. Luadriia didn't like the clear glass bottles, so at her insistence, I bought the different colored ones.

""I'm an apothecary!"" I replied. ""I make herbal remedies and potions to treat the sick, while she treats injuries! We run the village clinic! The bottles are labeled with their contents!""

""I was hoping to avoid this,"" the paladin murmured, ""but we may have no choice. We have to confront the dark elf and put an end to her once and for all. Only then will the curse be lifted.""

""Oh HELL no!"" I screamed. If I weren't tied to the chair I was in so I wouldn't evade their magic, I would have lunged at him. I wasn't about to let these morons kill my wife if I could help it.

Not that it mattered, for I swear I heard loud footsteps that started growing louder.

""I told you all we should have fought her first,"" the dwarf fighter replied. ""But do you all listen? No.""

""You say that about every dark elf,"" the bard pointed out. Turning to me, he demanded, ""Where is she?""

""By now, she'll probably be done with her errands and back home,"" I simply answered. ""And she'll have figured out what had happened. And then, she'll panic and call her friends.""

It was at that moment that the door to the room was tossed open. There, standing next to it, was my 4'9"" Dark Dancer-loving wife, longsword in hand, holy symbol in the other, silver eyes filled with worry, and as beautiful as ever. Standing directly behind Lua, of course, were her old adventurer friends who helped her pay for the university where we met.

""You all have five seconds to return my husband,"" she warned, walking into the room with her escort. The five idiots, instead of untying me, all charged her, only for the thrashing of them to begin.

As I watched her dance through the battlefield that the room turned into, I had one thing on my mind: ""I love this woman.""",6,1750301331.0
1lefno2,myfueq2,"I take a shower, and lifelessly drag my body to the bed.  
923 times.  
I had to rewind time, 923 times today.  
Yep, I am a superhero, and my power is to rewind time.  
But instead of fighting criminals, stopping supervillains, or anything like that, what do I do with my power?  
I keep the super-super-powered idiots that I surround myself with, happy, healthy, and most importantly, hidden.  
Why?  
Because they are found by the Government, with powers that could potentially erase entire countries.  
So I have to babysit them.

  
923 times.  
That's how many takes it took me to convince ""Jim"", a big oaf of a man, really kind, but really, really eager to prove himself, to keep working as a construction worker, and not a hero.  
Why?  
Because the more he moves, the more energy he gets.  
This is all good when lifting, and carrying, but if it is used for fighting, then it could potentially achieve such levels, that one punch could shatter space.  
I don't want to tell you how annoying is to rewind time around shattered space.  
It makes me dizzy.  
And this is the good type of situation during my babysitting.

  
Last week, I had to rewind time several times, because ""Alice"", has tripped multiple times.  
While she is a petite woman, that seems like could be blown away by the wind, in reality, she has a dwarf star as her heart.  
And it is unstable.  
If she wouldn't consciously and subconsciously limit her power, she could destroy the world by sneezing, because that heart would most likely implode.  
A pain in the ass, as she loses control when she trips, or when she is ill, or when she has a nightmare.  
So I have to be awake, when she sleeps, so that if I notice the end of the world...  
I have enough time to rewind time.  
And this is not the worst case scenario.

  
My roommate, Mario, is the worst super-super-powered idiot to ever live.  
Why?  
Because he has all the powers inside of him.  
Yep, all of them, known and unknown.  
And they randomly activate, as most of the time they are inactive.  
So, I have like 14 cameras around him, a ton of bugs, and surveillance, and several agents always following him.  
Whenever a power that is messed up activate, I have to quickly rewind time.  
Don't ask me how often I had to do this...  
I have an awesome power, a terrifying power, and I could be an amazing hero, or a terrifying villain.  
But no.  
I have to babysit these individuals, and you know what's the worst part?

It strives to educate the next generation, about their skills, traits, abilities and professions, hoping that they will make good choices.  
The Academy has a curriculum encompassing all possible power systems, and magical paths, from Martial Arts, to Cultivation, to technomancy, and even Divinity gathering.  
But!  
It has a strict Theoretical path, desiring to lay the foundation, and open the minds of the youth, and to allow them to experience, and experiment afterwards on their own.  
Today, the Academy is attacked by an overwhelming alliance of forces, desiring the knowledge it had gathered over generations.  
They think the Academy is defenseless.  
They are wrong.

""For Knowledge, and Action together, used wisely, is what makes the world right!"" the students echo back.  
It was clear that they were all members of the same society.

  
The attackers were easily defeated.  
The sheer amount of people, and the variety of power systems they used, made it impossible for the attackers to properly counter them, to react.

“Everything’s a game with you, Ifaani.” Faayame scolded.
“Let’s just get this over with before my appointment; my braids are due to get redone.”

As soon as they were out of range of the teachers, Falmata gave the signal for their quick escape. Faayame pulled a pocket mirror from his coat and flipped it open, creating perfect copies of the trio. With their clones following the evacuation, Ifaani pulled a ligher out, turning it into a staff, and cast a flame teleportation sigil in the wall next to them to face the threat at hand. “Into the fire out to the fray, I guess”, sighed Falmata, clicking his pen to transform it into a spear.

As the trio stepped through the portal and onto the rooftop. The army of The White Serpent gathered around the school, the students of various organizations gathering for the assault as their heads discussed who would attack first. Being the outsiders of the school, the trio decided to charge ahead first.

“Let’s hit them with the shadow fire dance!” Falmata called out.

With a flash, Faayame created 5 new clones of Falmata as Ifaani cast a flame guardian spell to turn him into a flaming warrior. Falmata charged forward, spear at the ready, as Ifaani lay down a barrage of fireballs at the enemy’s back lines with Faayame creating a barrier of light to protect the two of them. In a matter of minutes, Falmata was back on the rooftop with his friends, admiring the destruction left in their wake.

“Real subtle.” Faayame scoffed.
“We got the job done, at least.” Falmata shrugged.
“Just in time for your hair appointment, too.” Ifaani chuckled, patting Faayame on his back as she opened a portal to replace their clones. “Better get back before the others start bugging us; getting dragged into one of these loser clubs is the last thing I want to deal with”.",14,1750224140.0
1le5vki,myefwb9,"Long ago, when the world was quieter and full of rustling things, there lived a girl whose laughter tasted like milk and honey. Her closest companion was a bear, sewn from cloth and simple magic. His name has been forgotten, as many true names are, but he belonged to her, and she to him, in the way only children and their first beloved things understand.

As years turned, men came.

They did not take her hand, they took her light. One by one, they carved pieces from her. Her voice. Her boldness. Her easy joy. They smiled as they stole and left her smaller each time. The girl who once danced barefoot through the fields, who climbed trees just to kiss the sky, grew careful. Then cautious. Then silent.

And one day, the bear was gone.

They told her he had been lost. That she must have misplaced him. Perhaps he was forgotten. Perhaps he had been nothing special at all.

But bears, even ones made of stitches and stuffing, do not die so easily.

The girl did not know that each tear she refused to cry, each rage she refused to speak, each ache she folded into the quiet corners of herself, had found its way into the bear. He gathered them. He carried them. He fed on them.

Deep in the woods where the sun does not reach, where the earth remembers every sorrow, the bear changed.

He grew tall, taller than any man. His button eyes turned dark and glassy. His fur thickened and snarled. The tag sewn to his back, once soft and curling with love, stiffened and held her name in thread that pulsed like a heartbeat.

And one evening, long after the girl had forgotten how to hope, a bear was seen in her village.

People locked their doors. They said it was a cursed thing. A creature born from wrongness. Something wicked and wild.

But the girl, now a woman with hands that no longer trembled and eyes that no longer glowed, stepped out from her home.

She saw him across the field.

He did not move.

His fur was like scorched velvet. His breath turned the air cold. His presence made the world feel slower.

And there, sticking out from behind his shoulder, was a tag. It was faded but still held her name.

She knew then that he had not been lost. He had been becoming.

The bear had devoured her rage, guarded her sorrow, buried all the pieces the world had carved away. He had kept them safe until she could come back for them.

She walked toward him.

The bear stood still, as if asking a question.

She did not speak. She only reached out. Not like a child seeking comfort, but like someone claiming what had always been hers.

And the bear turned and walked into the woods. She followed him.

Some say she vanished. Some say she went mad. But those who understand say otherwise.

They say she rides through the trees now, high on the back of something fierce and loyal, with her old name in her mouth and fire in her chest.

And if you hear a low growl in the trees or feel your skin prickle when you speak of things taken from you, you may be close.

The bear with the broken tag only returns when a girl is ready to remember who she was before the world taught her to forget.",88,1750225198.0

Weird, considering where I live, but hey, who knows which rich fella kept it as a pet, and it escaped.  
Weirdly enough, it was captured in some pictures, and I noticed something.  
A tag, black and golden, just above its tail.  
It looked awfully like the one that had been on my teddybear, that I lost as a kid.  
Also, now that I noticed this...  
It is also missing a patch of ""fur"", exactly where I charred Mr. Bon-bon when I was a kid.  
Weird...

  
Days pass by, and the sightings still happen every now and then.

She told me her deathday was three months later than her birthday, and I stubbornly refused to believe her, until both of us were mad at the other for lying and we couldn't stand each other's company. I ran home and complained to my mom, who said as gently as she could that I was the mistaken one. She reminded me of her own birth and death days, how we celebrated them at different times. I don't know what I thought. I think I started to cry.

As I went through school, my birth/deathday became an inconvenience, like classmates whose birthday was on Christmas or whose deathday was over the summer so they couldn't celebrate at school. All the celebration of my life was condensed into one day.

As a teenager it started to feel scary. I became obsessed with Shakespeare because I read that he, too, died on his birthday, and I wanted to know if he knew. I wanted to know how it felt. I searched his plays for references, something, anything anywhere that could give me a guide for how to feel. Most people don't have to dread their birthdays the way I do. Adults say they dread their birthdays, but it's not the same. I'm going to actually die that day.

I wondered if I could break the cycle. If I killed myself on April 23rd, Shakespeare's deathday, would it work? Or would any attempt inevitably go wrong and leave me in pain? Why did I want to change this anyway?

I grew reckless. I wasn't going to die anyway if it wasn't that day, so why bother with safety? I felt as if I always stayed the same age. Then I'd either get a year older, or I'd die. The rest of the time didn't matter.

Then my neighbor died. And it mattered.

I hadn't seen it coming. My parents were quiet, and I wondered what they knew that I didn't. What I hadn't noticed because I was so caught up in my own fraught living. I hated how fragile everything was. Part of me cried out louder than ever to be reckless, to throw myself into danger just to feel something. But I didn't. I couldn't. I couldn't feel, couldn't move.

My father told me that every birthday is a gift. Maybe they are. But one of these gifts will be a curse. I find it hard to feel the good. Just dread and empty relief when I wake up the next day and things are normal, the celebrations already faded before I had the chance to enjoy them.

I am going to die on my birthday. That is the one thing I've always known. The only thing I really know.",28,1750221437.0
1ldtltr,mybi172,"""Okay guys, remember the drill, we pretend we're the transport crew,"" Danny briefed his friends. ""We're here to ensure the anti-gravity prototypes and the weather control drone are shipped to another secure facility.""

""Dude, you sure we can pass security like this?"" Paul was understandably skeptical as they stopped the van and waited for the security forces to inspect them.

""Easily,"" Danny shrugged. ""These high and mighty military types look down on lowly logistics staff.""

""Its also 3am,"" Robert added. ""Which is decidedly not working hours.""

""Special emergency,"" Danny said. ""They've received a tip-off that some wannabe thieves might try to steal these top-secret assets at about 4am.""

""...you're kidding right? You tip them off, and then come in and steal before the supposed timing?"" Paul was incredulous. ""Dammit.""

""I'm a genius, am I right?"" Danny smirked. ""Alright, pipe it down, the guards are coming this way.""

""What's your business?"" A security guard asked Robert, who was in the driver's seat.

""Eagleway Logistics. We're here to transport these assets - anti-gravity prototypes and a weather control drone. Here's our paperwork.""

The guard snatched the thick stack of documents with a bored look and gave them a cursory glance. ""Yeah, uh looks legit. Go in.""

""Just like that?"" Paul asked.

""Just like that.""

They parked the van and entered the building with the stolen staff pass Danny had snitched a few days earlier. He had tracked down a senior staff to a luxury diner and posed as a waiter there to quietly nab the pass. Now, all they needed to do was head over to where the assets were located.

If they knew their way around the base.

""Gentleman, you appear to require assistance,"" a voice spoke from...somewhere.

They jumped, only to see a thin, gray man with bulging black eyes and elongated limbs.

""Greetings, humans. I am Greg, Martian explorer of The Expanse,"" he smiled and did a dramatic bow. ""How can I help you?""

""We're here to transport anti-gravity prototypes and a weather control drone,"" Danny spoke with an authoritative tone like he was in charge. ""Take us there.""

""Very well, sir. I will lead the way,"" Greg gestured towards a long corridor. ""Please follow me.""

""Do we trust this alien?"" Paul whispered.

Robert quickly scanned their environment before nodding.

""Here, gentlemen,"" the alien pointed to the huge metal door at the end of the long corridor. ""What you seek lies beyond this door that I cannot open.""

A swipe of the staff pass, and they were in. There wasn't any security, much to Paul's surprise. Danny then said something about how they already made it pass security in the first place, and that they should gather up what they came here for.

Which were too heavy for the humans to lift.

""Allow me,"" Greg chimed in cheerfully. With a wave of his hands, the anti-gravity prototypes and the drone floated across the hallway and landed neatly on the trolley the men had brought.

""Thank you...but why?"" Robert was confused.

""You looked like you needed help, that is all,"" Greg bowed again. ""As for me, I was hoping you can show me around your country. The other staff in this base insisted that I stay here for my safety, and to quell rumours of unidentified flying objects. But that's boring.""

The men proceeded to push their haul out of the hallway and make their way back towards their getaway van. All while the gray man whistled and twiddled his thumbs, floating along the way.

""Halt!"" A security guard cut in front of them. ""Who are you, and where are you taking these assets?""

""We're from Eagleway Logistics,"" Danny flashed his fake visitor's pass. ""We're transporting these assets to another secure location.""

""Which one?""

""Zercon Bay.""

The guard paused for a moment before signaling them to go. ""If you see any suspicious figures, let us know. We've received a tip-off that thieves may be coming in soon.""

**""These are not the thieves you are looking for.""** Greg spoke in a much deeper voice.

""No, of course not,"" the guard stared blankly as though there was some jedi mind trick going on.

""You knew,"" Danny turned to face Greg.

""The guards don't know. Yet. Let us keep it this way, shall we?"" The alien had this huge, creepy smile as he tented his long fingers. ""Let us be on our way.""

The rest of the crew was starting to think Greg was...sus. More suspicious than aliens in vents among us. But they could not deny he was helping them, just for reasons they didn't know.

""So, are we heading to Zercon Bay for real, or where are we going to put these stuff we stole?"" Paul had important questions to ask. ""And that staff pass, its bound to be reported lost soon.""

""That senior staff likes going to that same luxury diner,"" Danny replied. ""I could probably slip it back in so he thinks he was just forgetful. Dude's like 70 years old, you know.""

""But the assets. These are heavy as hell.""

It was at this moment, Greg interjected. ""We can put my experimental prototypes back into my spaceship where they truly belong.""

1lduqhu,myb9dnh,"Once upon a time, the Sun shone in the sky every hour of every day. It was so bright that the stars and the moon could not be seen.

However, there was one very bright star. It shone brighter than any of the other stars in the sky, so much that it could be seen as well. The Sun was jealous, and using its great might, flung the star to the lands below, such that it may be the only bright object in the sky.

Now the star wept, for it could not be seen while on the ground. Its cries attracted the attention of an apprentice of a blacksmith, who came to look for it.

""Why are you crying?"" The apprentice asked.

""I am no longer useful, since I have fallen from the heavens,"" The star replied.

""I'll make you useful again,"" The apprentice said.

And so the star went with the blacksmith's apprentice to his forge, where the blacksmith hammered and polished it a thousand times, until it gleamed brighter even than when it was in the heavens. 

Now the Sun saw this and was again very jealous. It tried to burn even brighter, turning the forests into fire and drying up the lakes. The apprentice was afraid, but the Starsword spoke.

""For the favor you have done to me, I will now repay my debt.""

And so the blacksmith's apprentice swung the Starsword towards the Sun, and with a great flash, the Sun was frightened and ran behind the horizon. 

And so the sky darkened and the moon and stars are allowed to shine and be noticed. 

Every morning the Sun tries to take its place again, but the apprentice would brandish the sword right as it reaches its zenith, causing it to flee once again, disappearing in a flash of green light as the Starsword is swung. And that is why we have the Day and the Night.

\--------

*So how did the apprentice live from then until now?*

Uh, I dunno. He's immortal. Go to sleep.",133,1750186258.0
1lduqhu,mybnq9w,"""It's beautiful...""

That was the first words spoken by Gerros. The blacksmith gazed at the sword, placed in the centre of a cleared workbench. His apprentice sat with his head in his arms, dozing in the morning light. At any other time, Gerros would have awoken him with a clap. But any thoughts like that were banished as he beheld the sword.

It was large, a greatsword by rights. The blade was smooth, edges on both sides sharpened beyond what he would expect. The metal itself had a gleaming quality, a soft light where normally only faint sunlight or torchlight would land. It had an almost watery quality, rippling despite being solid metal.

The guard was jagged, like rays of light made of metal. Here the glow grew brighter, its edges more pronounced in a dome like appearance. It seemed to encircle the hilt, a barrier around the wielder hands. Cast from a single piece of metal, it appeared to be a monstrous weight.

Reaching out to touch it, Gerros wrapped his hands around the hilt. He tried to lift it, straining despite his physical condition. It barely shifted, as he let go and stumbled back. A clatter arose as he knocked over a bucket, waking his apprentice from his slumber.

The lad yawned, standing abruptly. ""A-ah, morning Master!""

Gerros frowned, pointing at the blade. ""What on Hegos have you made Direnr?""

The blacksmith watched as his apprentice reached out with one hand, grasping the handle. Then he goggled as he easily lifted the blade, holding it as though it was no heavier than the lightest of hammers. ""Oh... I had an urge to make this. After finding the metal.""

Gerros frowned, crossing his arms. ""What metal? This is nothing I have seen.""

Direnr gently placed it back, rubbing his hands. ""I found it a few weeks past. Just, outside of town, coming back from Asjar. I think it came from that star-storm we had a while back.""

The blacksmith gasped, pointing with a suddenly shaking hand. ""Star-steel?! You...""

He dissolved into a shocked laugh, rubbing his face. ""Ah, ah ha ha ha! You... I... I don't believe it!""

Reaching out to hold grasp his apprentice's shoulder, the older man sighed. Direnr watched him in shock, as his master continued. ""You're unbelievable. If... if you had told me about your find... ah I won't lie, I would have taken it myself. Star-steel, that is beyond rare. And it leaves its mark.""

Leaning closer, he peered into the lad's eyes. For a moment all he saw was the usual brown, until he shifted, uncomfortable at the attention. There Gerros saw it, a spray of sparks, hidden inside. He sighed again. ""You used it. It means... well, you're already well on the road to being a master smith. Heck, in a few months I'll probably be seeing you off.""

Direnr nodded, rubbing a bit of sleep from his eyes. ""I... when I slept... I could feel it. Like I knew so much more than I ever thought I could about metal working. Just there. Out of reach.""

Gerros gestured to the sword. ""I can say for certain, that is beyond anything I could make with mundane metal. You'll be able to later I reckon, what with what you now know. But what you have... you need to be careful.""

The lad frowned, resting a hand on his creation. ""Why?""

Gerros felt his face fall, dark thoughts in his mind. ""It's a blade worthy of legends. I can tell, even without an appraisal. Which means people will kill to get it. And they will want you to work for them, to make equals. Failing that, they will kill you to keep you out of others hands.""

Sighing, he rubbed his face. ""This... I'll need to speak with some people. You'll outgrow me too quickly, but you need a safe space to still practice. But if I can, I'll get you somewhere safe. Though....,"" he couldn't stop a flash of greed hit, ""I would like any spare of that steel.""",34,1750190350.0
1lduqhu,mybui68,"""It's a Spork"", the blacksmith says quietly, still in disbelief.  

""It's a Spork"", the apprentice replied proudly.  

The blacksmith said nothing.  The rarest metal in all the world, found only in the heart of a dying star, harder to work than any other natural or created material.  The fact that his apprentice was able to make anything from it made them a genius.  The fact that they chose to make a spork from it... may have made them an idiot.  

""Do you know what this metal is?""  to be fair, the blacksmith hadn't actually bothered to teach his apprentice about star-metal, or any other legendary materials, mostly because the odds of anyone in this town ever seeing any was essentially zero.  

""It's... really durable?""  

""Where did you find it?""  

""It was just there, in the grass while I was walking by the river.  Just a tiny little nugget... not enough to make anything big out of.  I looked for more, but that was all there was""  

""But why a spork?""

""Sporks are cool!""    

A star-metal spork.  It wasn't going to slay any dragons, but if they find the right sort of rich buyer, it may just fund the blacksmith's retirement, and give his apprentice enough money to expand the forge like the blacksmith had always planned to but could never afford.",27,1750192250.0
1lduqhu,mycpvf8,"""Did you know that stars have names?""

""Huh?"" the apprentice raised his head away from work table and turned it towards the master blacksmith, as he walked into the workshop, towing a cart behind him. Unknown object was nested on it, hidden under a blanket.

""Of course, there's North Star, Vega, Sirius, or…”

“No,” master stopped him, while pointing at the cart, “they have names written on them!”

“What… what are you talking about?” the apprentice scratched his head.

Master theatrically pulled the blanket, uncovering a metal sphere. It looked burned, dented, and decorated with large letters.

“Nasa,” the apprentice read them out, “Mr. Kovac, what is this thing?”

“It’s a star!” he answered, with a devilish smile, “I saw it fall from the sky! First, it was standing still, like all the stars around it. Then, it started to move. Then, it plummeted through the sky, leaving a trail behind, only to fall right here, just 4 lengths from our village.”

“Oh…,” the apprentice came closer, putting his hand on its metallic surface, “this… this isn’t how I imagined a star to look like. What do you want to do with it?”

“I want you to help me open it, let’s see what’s inside,” master ordered, while grabbing a hammer from a nearby table.

They spent a good time pounding it's surface. Trying to uncover secrets hidden inside. Once they got through, one thing in the middle of the sphere caught their eyes. Surrounded by colored metal strands, a cylinder. They carefully cut the strands and pulled it out.

“It’s… it looks like some sort of container,” master proclaimed, while starting to hammer one of its sides, “let’s see what it’s hiding.”

“What’s that?” apprentice asked, pointing at a strange symbol on the container. Small black circle, with three wedges pointing outwards from it, inside a yellow triangle.

“I have no idea, let’s just…” master answered, while one end of the cylinder broke. He turned it around, and a few metal rods fell out.

“OUCH!” apprentice screamed as he picked up one of them, immediately letting it go, “it’s hot!”

“Interesting…” the master scratched his head, then put on a glove and took one of the rods, “they are hot. Yet there is no flame. And the metal is heavier than it should be. Must be really dense. I have never seen a metal like this. Prepare the forge!”

“Forge?” the apprentice didn’t understand, “what do you want to do?”

“This metal from the hearth of a star,” he pointed with the rod at the apprentice's face, “is fit only for the royalty. Strong, rare, and always hot. Tonight, we will forge a sword from it. And tomorrow, we will gift it to our king!”",18,1750201854.0
1lduqhu,mybx0qq,"It was the middle of the dark and cold night when I first glimpsed it. It shone from high above sweeping across the sky cutting through the darkness leaving a trail of light in its wake. As it moved it descended further toward the horizon its light becoming ever brighter as it did until it made impact bathing the whole forest in a blinding light. And then finally the earth shook with the loud impact reaching me on the high cliffs above the forest a few seconds earlier.

It took a long time until the sky returned to normal with the tear of light fading slowly like a scar but never completely disappearing with slight traces of it remaining even in the light of day, which I only discovered much later. More importantly however was what happened to the origin of this event, it landed in the middle of the forest far away from my path and route back to the capital, but curiosity and intrigue caused me to go out of my way, I needed to know what it was and more so what happened to it.

A few days later I managed to locate it often only able to find its direction at night when a similar light to before shone in the distance. But I did find it, it was lying in a large crater with water from a nearby river having poured into it and covering most of it And despite the passed time, the cold weather, and the flow of water against it, a mere touch against the air exposed part nearly caused me to burn my hand, with the parts beneath the water being just bearable enough to touch. I stood in the crater marveling at it for what felt like hours, its bright white shine being almost hypnotizing. It felt as if this moment was destined by fate, like I was supposed to witness and find it, as if this was my very purpose.

I took hold of one of the of the seven protrusions of the star which effortlessly separated from the rest of the body and was amazed at just how light it was and began examining it more thoroughly as the bright light emanating from the shard became fainter. Its surface was a pale yellow and rough with a pattern of rune like symbols that seemed manmade and despite the shard seemingly losing most of its light after being detached a small amount remained deep inside as a barely noticeable glow. I don't know when exactly I left the sight or when decided it, but the moment I began wandering through the forest once again I knew exactly what I wanted- no needed to do.

I returned to the original path I wanted to take and going through it much faster out of pure conviction for my new goal. My journey to the capital now barely registered to me as if time no longer mattered to me and passed in the blink of an eye, with even my boss being surprised at my earlier than expected arrival despite the detour having taken a lot of time. However I had no care to wonder about that, as I immediately began to double and triple my efforts of my apprenticeship asking my boss hundreds of questions and working through every waking moment on a daily basis while holding the shard in my close possession. Then finally three years later it was time, I gathered all my knowledge and skills that I've learned and put them all to use creating my ultimate creation, one befitting the shard.

It was a simple design, robust, easily maintainable, and more form over fashion for the most part, an occasional piece of flair and design that were solely for detail were present but nothing major, nothing like a completely gilded blade or full blade theme. The most important part though was the shard, it was used as the material for the fuller, in small amounts mixed into the edge part of the blade, and the diamond shaped pieces that remained were the centerpiece between the crossguard and hilt. I did not care about anything but the sword for the few days that I worked on it, barely touching food nor water and once I was done I felt... hollow. I had created perhaps the greatest blade in the lands, but who is to wield it? There is none who are a match for it.

I had poured in a part of myself my skills, my knowledge, my heart and it too sacrificed a lot its power its planning, and its nature, but there was no warrior to share their part, I was never to achieve something even close to it, and wasted the eons it took to arrive for this moment, yet we both are here standing in silent disappointed and having failed to achieve anything. It was a blade unlike any other, powerful beyond anything able to win every battle, and more importantly unlike all other blades it was one that was never to see usage...",8,1750192961.0
1ldzb1a,mycn7ch,"I've seen men die before. Men who thought themselves invincible, who thought they could outrun the darkness. But there's one man who's still out there, a storm of dragon's fire and wizards ice, a force so incredible that the primordial fires of Gauntlgrym's forges are but a campfire in comparison. The man who spared my life all those years ago. My lord, my friend... my curse.

I've been keeping an eye on him for months now. He's a ghost of the man he used to be, his mind eaten away by the ravages of time. The storm that once raged inside him has subsided, leaving behind a quiet calm that's as unnerving as a still pond on a summer's day. His body remains strong, honed to perfection, a testament to the unyielding spirit that drove him to become the greatest warrior of our time. Yet he never carried a weapon. I've watched him move through the city, unseen and unheard, a phantom of a man who could cleave the earth as easily as a child swings a hatchet. A vengeful god that wielded words like a legion of battle hardened soldiers. 

He's a danger, that one. A ticking time bomb of fury and rage, waiting to unleash himself on the world. And yet... and yet, I feel a strange compulsion to protect him. To keep him from himself. I've seen the way he looks at me, his eyes gleaming with a fierce intensity, a spark that suggests he's still a warrior at heart, waiting to be set free. It's like his mind is trapped in a prison of madness and mortal flesh... 

I've tried to warn others, to tell them about the man who walks among us, a man who could kill with a single glance and topple kingdoms with the slightest of words. But no one listens. They don't believe me. They think I'm crazy, that I've finally succumbed to the madness that's been eating away at my lord's mind for so long. But I know the truth. This man is a force of nature, a storm that's going to leave devastation in its wake.

And I'm stuck watching him, waiting for the day when he'll finally break free from his self-imposed prison, and unleash the fury that's been building inside him. It's a fate I wish I could avoid, but one I know I'll never truly escape. The only trinkets from our adventures are still locked away in a secret chest, hidden away from the world and him. I have to keep them hidden...

He seems lucid some days, talking of his old friend, a brother in arms, a man who would play on the red sands of their home...

1ldzb1a,myerjww,"He's confused again. Which means he's afraid again. Which means he's angry. 

The entire fortress shakes as we boot up the procedure, sinking ourselves 50 stories in just a few milliseconds as the blistering red lights flood the complex. A rate which would liquefy the humans he used to love so much.

A summerhouse within a leaden casket.

This used to happen once, maybe twice a year. In two years it's become monthly, another year from now it'll be weekly.

We thought him immortal. Eternal. At least, until sol went dark. Until the stars turn cold.

And we were right about his body, but not his mind. 

Year after year, decade after decade, century after century, his strength, speed, powers grew, what took his greatest strength in younger years took no more than a whisper now, this base took the best of his entire races technology to create, sunken on Pluto, as far as we could from Sol without ending his life, and he's still charged. 

With nanosecond response times, we can still manage to sink it quickly enough. 

I glanced at the second screen, no progress. You'd think with our technology, an illness that plagued the humans could be easily repaired. 

But it's not when it's developed in super form, every bit as formidable as he is.

My head would be hanging, in the opposite of everything he stood for as I wearily accept the inevitable, then I restart and reset the base.

1le3jat,mydlvsh,"Marcus lifted the scoop of the tractor and shut the engine. He spotted something glinting off the light but the demolition team was assured the home was emptied and all valuables and furniture was moved into museum storage. 

He felt weird tearing down the medieval manor with turrets and embrasures, but the new owners were adamant to build their castle from ground up with all the modern amenities. 

Marcus picked his way to the glinting metal and discovered the tip of a buried sword. 

“What do we have here!”

He had to move rocks to free the sword from the rubble. As he grabbed the hilt, an odd sensation rippled up his arm. He nearly dropped it, an edge cutting a shallow groove in his leg. Not enough to cause serious damage, but deep enough to draw blood. 

*Ah,* he heard. 

“Hello,” he called. No response. He started back to his tractor when the sword spoke. 

“Thank you. I was trapped so long in that wall.”

“Who’s there?” Marcus refused to accept what his senses were telling him. 

*It is I, sir slashalot,* responded the sword haughtily. 

“That’s a silly name,” Marcus observed. 

*I’ve had many names,* the sword said, *but I’m partial to that one because it was given to me by the three year old son of an archeologist who pulled me from a worksite in Greece. I was buried for so long after the Peloponnesian war. The second one, mind you. Oh, the stories I can tell.”

Marcus couldn’t believe his fortune. He discovered a magic relic from Ancient Greece. Did someone see him unearth it? Could he just take it home and no one would be the wiser?

“Were you wielded by Pericles or Lysander?”

*Not every sword is wielded by a famous legend,* it said. *But I am a magic talking sword, so yeah, kinda. I was wielded by Ajax. *

“That’s so cool!”

*Nah, that fighting stuff gets so tedious. All you do is the same forms and postures and killings. It gets boring very fast.*

“I never thought about it like that before.”

*Now when Ricky stole me to play make believe with Tommy and accidentally sliced off two toes, that was brilliant. No one could see that coming. And then his own two toes. I could not stop laughing. *

“That sounds tragic,” Marcus said. 

*Oh, don’t get torn up by it. The little shit deserved it and worse. It’s not like he couldn’t still limp around. *

“Why are you here?”

*It was the maid. Petite thing with curls and a pouty face. The lord of the manor couldn’t keep his hands off of her.*

“She lost you?”

*oh, stop thinking so linear. The little slut eventually married the old fuck and poisoned him to become Lady of the Manor. *

“And then what did she do?”

*She didn’t do anything. The ex-wife before she was executed stole the sword and had it secretly buried in the wall. She knew the magic sword was his prized possession. If she was going to be usurped, she damn well wasn’t going down without a fight.*

“What happened next?”

*How the hell  I supposed to know? I was stuck in a fucking wall for centuries. Thanks again, by the way. *

Marcus smuggled the sword nobody even knew existed back home. He was keen to hear more tales. Not of the heroes of old but of the people who supported them and their lives. The stories of heroes, true or not, have been told. But the sword has so much more to talk about. Stories of little children and maidens and tanners and chefs. One chef used the sword to slaughter pigs pretending to be a Ninja warrior. He was very silly and made the sword giggle a lot.",19,1750212766.0
1ldoeej,myacrbm,"Triaskan bioships were... Something else. There's no proper way of describing a ship capable of regrowing bulkheads and pimpslapping strike craft out of the way as it **bites** the command deck off an unresisting 'standard' combat vessel. Their development and widespread use completely changed the tide of the war.

But, afterwards, once the wartime mentality was gone, there came the questions: most importantly of all, what do you do with a self aware spaceship? Its a living, ~~breathing~~ *photosynthesising* being. One that has done frontline military service, at that. You can't just scrap them. 

And so, they 'retired'. The original intention had been to graft off the combat organs, but due to the skyrocketing piracy after the war, it was decided to leave them on.

So now Tharass 'worked' in shipping. As the, uh, ship. They - the command mind and its assorted subsystem-minds - were paid a fair wage, and kept well stocked with supplies. The Corporation figured having an un-staffed ship was actually cheaper than staffing a 'standard' vessel and just left Tharass to do its thing. 

Which was trudging slowly between systems hauling cargo. Normally it was dull. Just something to pay the bills. But every now and then, Tharass got an interesting run.

This was one of those.

Bioships, due to their regenerative hulls, were supremely well suited to navigating through cosmic storms. They also had to shut off their sensors - and pain receptors - to go through one... But Tharass would be fully regenerated by the time he reached his destination, whereas a standard lifeless ship would likely limp into port weeks late, and in need of serious repairs. And expensive repairs. 

But, Tharass saw the beauty in the storms, and this long after the war, they didn't even mind shutting off their sensors. 

Of course, like any veteran - Triaskan, or bioship - Tharass had every sensor turned to full until the very last second. A storm was a perfect place for an ambush.

As expected though, no ambush came, and the paranoid old warship entered the edges of the whirling nebula calmly. 

And what a beautiful storm it was. It had engulfed the entirety of the Ikaan system, painting the whole thing in cerulean blues and empyrean yellows as exotic compounds crystallised in the energies of the storm. The normally violet nebula that filled the system was alight with luminous currents.

Tharass was a warship. Former warship, but nonetheless, a warship. This meant they didn't really have a concept of 'beauty'. But, as the command mind developed, and the years passed, they had begun to log things which were 'nice to look at'. 

This storm was one of those, and since Tharass' route wouldn't take them through any of the more intense parts, they could quite enjoy it.",96,1750177269.0

1ldoeej,myagl2j,"Only one thing spoiled the storms for Tharass. The relentless hammering of crystalline shards against their armour was of no concern, and even the need to shut off their 'eyes' to prevent sensory damage didn't bother them that much.

What really bothered Tharass though, was when unsecured cargo bounced around and tripped the interior hull sensors. It brought back memories of the war, of passageways filled with Malavite troops who cut and blasted, moving ever closer to his organs. 

They were gone now, but the memories of that helplessness remained. And as they passed through some of the stronger storm currents - especially the gravitational ones - some cargo would undoubtedly come loose. It always did. 

For now though, Tharass was going to enjoy the softer currents. Having shut off the pain receptors, they only felt the calmer currents press, and the rhythmic massage of high velocity crystals removing aged chitin with their impact. It was almost therapeutic until-

Ugh. Someone had done a really lousy job of securing the cargo if some was already moving! 

The memories came, as they always did, and Tharass ordered the diagnostics mind to check status, as they always did. It was a simple step; dismissing doubt and uncertainty through cold hard metrics.

Except the metrics came back wrong.

Tharass had gained mass. 

LOTS of mass. The pummelling of the crystals made exact measurements challenging, but that seemed to be... Far too much.

But a quick check of hull integrity revealed... No penetration. No punctures, no sensory shadows. Nothing amiss?

Hundreds of sensory eyes opened within the vessel, flooding the command mind with information, as Tharass scoured their own corridors and passageways.

The cargo hold appeared intact. 

And all of the cargo was still in place, secured.

So... What was going on?

Tharass checked their hangar, and saw nothing amiss there either. Colossal chitinous shields covered the entrances, and nothing could possibly have come through...

The corridors seemed in order. The organs were safe. Nothing seemed to be moving.

Tharass was confused. Not the terrifying doubt of old trauma, but just a befuddled uncertainty. This might all be harmless. Perhaps one of their sensors was malfunctioning? 

They checked again, and the mass reading came back the same. 

Tharass queried the diagnostic sub-mind for specifics. 

The increased mass was in the cargo hold.

Sensory eyes fluttered open again, curiously scrying every visible inch of the bay.

And then Tharass saw it. The... Thing.",87,1750178351.0
1ldoeej,myb2mnw,"Tharass was unsure of what it exactly it was. It matched no description in any database they had access to. It was roughly spherical, faintly glowing - although that was visibly fading - and appeared to be biological. 

In fact, it looked like an egg. 

How exactly it had come to be deposited in their cargo bay, Tharass did not know. But they were deeply curious, and assumed it had something to do with the strange glow and the storm.

Tharass compiled all collected data and - tentatively extending an antennae despite the storm - pulsed out the data packet to the nearest Corporation relay station at maximum strength. They weren't sure if the signal would get through the storm, but it followed official guidance.

Then they returned to examining the egg. 

It was - presumably - extradimensional. Given the uncertain method of its arrival, either it, or its parent creature, was able to move between dimensions.

And given the size of the egg, its parent creature must be quite large. Perhaps not as large as Tharass, but significantly larger than a terrestrial being could reasonably be.

The egg itself seemed to be quite thick, and capable of self-stabilising. As a heavier gust of the storm buffeted Tharass the egg rolled and bumped an interior wall again. This time though, there was no fear. They knew what made the sensors trip. And Tharass felt... They weren't sure what they felt. *Responsible* was probably the best way of putting it. Wherever - whatever - this egg's mother was, the egg itself was now inside Tharass. And so it was their responsibility.

Extending a loading tendril out, Tharass wrapped it around the egg, and pulled it into a corner, where they held it snugly. 

This egg... was cargo. In a sense. And, if it was cargo, it had to be protected.

Tharass thought about this some more. The egg... was not cargo. Cargo was *things*, this egg was - or would be - someone. 

So this egg... more important than cargo. And Tharass was its caretaker. At least until it skipped dimensions again, or its parent entity came in search of it.

And if Tharass was its caretaker... Then it was Tharass' egg. At least until it hatched.

Tharass decided they liked that. And that they felt... warm.

And so, the former warship sailed the tumultuous currents of the storm, clutching an egg of unknown origins. 

And Tharass was happy. 

The rest of that voyage passed in oddly contented bliss. A wholly new sensation to the warship.

It would not be for several voyages, long after the egg had been removed for study by the Corporation and shifted right out of their laboratory, that Tharass felt a bump in their cargo hold and realised... They weren't afraid anymore.",110,1750184357.0

It adjusts its mustache, which do I have to say it? Is fake.  
""Excuse me, good madam, but I am a customer, with human money.  
Please, a large, Caramel Macchiato. Please."" it says.  
I look up again.  
Hmm, my chewing gum seems to have lost its taste...well, whatever.  
""Dude, you barely fit into my store, and are pushing the other customers out."" I say.  
It chuckles, and shrinks.

  
Now, a 9 feet tall, scaly dude, with a magician's hat that appeared out of nowhere, fake mustache, and a monocle stands in front of the counter.  
""Ahem, my apologies.  
So, can I get the Caramel, Macchiato, large please?"" it asks, a bit of smoke escaping its nostrils.  
Hmm.  
I start to feel the bad taste of the too chewed chewing gum.  
I turn around to put it into the garbage bin.  
""Yeah, yeah, one sec."" I mutter, as I got a text from my bestie.  
She found her boyfriend in bed with her...mother?  
Juicy.

  
""Excuse me? My coffee?"" a voice interrupts my delicious drama.  
""What? Oh, yeah, my bad."" I mutter, putting down my phone, and making the dragon the Caramel, Macchiato.  
""Name?"" I ask.  
""What? Why would you ask for my name? Do you plan to enslave me?!"" he gasps.  
I roll my eyes.  
""We write the names on the cups. And don't kid yourself dude, you a hunk, but I am into the nerdy ones I can torment a bit."" I say.  
It chuckles wryly.  
""You can write: ""Dexoria."" it says.  
I nod.

  
A few minutes later, I am done.  
""Caramel Macchiato, Large for Doxi? Doxi?!"" I call out.  
The dragon comes to the counter.  
""Dexoria."" it smiles, taking the coffee.  
""Whatever."" I say, going back to my phone.  
""You know...I could kill you, right?"" it asks, and I look up to see its face really, really close.  
Its golden eyes sparkling.  
I put my chewing gum on his monocle.  
It huffs, and puffs, talking about bad review, and leaves.  
I go back to the drama on my phone.  
It was annoying, but at least no other customer came back, while he was inside, and even now, they are afraid to come in.  
So I guess it wasn't that bad.",49,1750166305.0
1ldloip,mydo9j5,"""This, is not large"" the dragon objected a few minutes later.

""Buddy, it's the large cup, full to the brim, you are more than fifty times the size of any other customer, so the difference in perspective of scale is on you."" I sighed, having thought this much would be pretty apparent.

""I ordered a large."" They insisted.

""And you see the L on the cup? That means it's a Large cup, the cup is by it's definitive classification, Large. The fact that compared to you, it is smaller than your eyeball, has no bearing on the matter, this really isn't my problem.""

""It's hardly my fault you people are so tiny and easily crushed."" Real subtle threat there pal.

""And it's hardly my fault you are so big and unwieldy, if you want dragon sized drinks, make them yourself or convince one of the like ten other dragons in the world to open a coffee shop.""

The dragon reared up, slamming it's horns through what would have been a ceiling before it's arrival demolished the rest of the building. ""I am Azathar the Annihilator, bane of a thousand kings and Pureflame by soul! And I demand a Large drink!""

I sigh, that's it, time to pull out the big guns. ""And I... Literally, physically, do not possess a cup larger than that one in the ruins of this store, you could burn me to death if you want, you still won't get a bigger cup from it."" The eternal power of truth.

""I will Not be leaving you a positive review.."" it peered down to stare at the nametag. ""Ashley.. You shall rue the day you failed to provide for my might!""

""Unlikely, insurance doesn't cover Dragon Landing, so I'm probably just gonna move two streets down to the next branch, not my problem.""",11,1750213588.0
1ldloip,myemvvr,"""Caramel Macchiato, Large, ***SAM!*** make it with the barrel out back, the fancy ones we use to store the beans in."" I shout towards the back of the simple coffee stall, a quaint little shop front that leads to an open cafeteria-isque food court, in which a majestic dragon adorned by red iridescent scales managed to occupy a quarter of the court in front of the coffee stall, its tail accidentally smashing a few tables.

""We need some time, the hot water tub needs some time to boil, and we need 8 bottles of caramel and half 2 cartons of milk to be steamed!"" Sam shouts back, followed by a hurried rustling of some boxes being moved.

""I'm sorry mr.dragon, can i get an alias for us to call you by? As you can see, we're quite swamped with work at the moment and it will take some time to fulfil your order."" I barely look up from underneath my hat, not minding the fact that the dragon seemingly materialized out of nowhere, without so much as a gust of wind.

""Thou shalt address me as....Tim."" The dragon rumbled, its amusement temporarily halted by my nonchalance, his expectations of a yelp or scream for his amusement dashed.

""Alrightly then, that'd be 2 gold coins, normally it's only 2 copper, but due to the size and requirement, your macchiato is being upgraded to dragon sized. Would you like anything else to go on your macchiato?"" I asked back in a chipper voice and slightly animated customer service voice, but my eyes are pretty much dead inside.

""That will be all. Do not disappoint me."" Tim the dragon intoned solemnly, seemingly trying to elicit an expression or reaction from me that would fit his expectation of a trembling human that he relishes. Alas, woe upon this dragon to expect me to give a flying fuck.

""Ah, I don't get paid enough to care if I exist the next day. Take it up to management if you got a complaint."" It's flame ridden breath washed over me as it seemed to be amused by my lack of reaction.

""Such audacity, how have you managed to survive so far with such crassness?"" Tim snorted in amusement, his deep and gravely voice echoed in the surrounding area, knocking over a few cups that i had so meticulously stacked in the corner.

""Because if I die, it ain't a problem for me no more."" I stare into the dragon's golden iris, my inner void and nihilism leaking out from the seams of reality as the rampant thoughts that dance upon my fragile mortal mind, the eldritch horror held at bay by the mere amusement it gleans from my existential suffering.

A small eep sound was squeezed out of the dragon's as some of its scales bristled outwards. Tim back pedaled a few steps, seemingly experienced a lifetime of horrors in the split second he looked into my eyes.

""So, would you like to pay via cash or card? A 25% tip would be most appreciated."" I beamed a hollow smile, my eyes seem to have sunken into my face but a blink later return to normal, other than the soul-devouring black which inhabits my irises. ""Huh, didn't know you dragons could change the color of your scales.""

The once lustrous rubies that used to be the dragons scales are now a faded pinkish-red. Almost as if the mana that was used to empower the scales were drained, leaving it a pale imitation of its former glory. ""I'll pay 3 gold coins."" The dragon whispered shakingly.

""Alright, thanks for the 50% tip, much appreciated."" I pop open the cash register and a tentacle shoots out; swiping up 2 gold coins from the 3 that were given, leaving me with 1 gold coin for me to pocket, then it closed with a resounding KA-CHING sound.

""Thank you. Your order number is 38, please wait while we prepare your beverage Mr.Tim.""",7,1750228964.0
1ldloip,myi743f,"Smoke curled out of its nostrils like tendrils, dancing through the air before fading away.  Its jaw jolted and its throat hinged, and for a moment I could see the furnace within. The fire deep within its belly, trying to reach out to me. A low rumble as the eyes squinted toward me, and the faint, almost inaudible crackle of deep, deep flames made me go entirely still. It was instinct, as I was certain that I was faced with something that could *easily* eat me alive.

And then it cleared its throat.

“I’m sorry, did you hear me?” it asked, its voice baritone and reaching down my throat. “One caramel macchiato, large, and… extra caramel, if you can.""

I always thought they were bigger than this. Bigger, wider… Definitely too big to fit into a cafe like this. This one was thinner, longer. More serpentine. Tall, for sure, but… smaller than I thought one would be. To be fair, I never expected to see one in the flesh. I never expected to see one, period.

My hands hovered over the POS, fingers suddenly moving around the screen to input the order: Large caramel macchiato, extra caramel.
People were only just now starting to notice, somehow. Eyes went wide, someone dropped their drink, one rushed to the doors and threw them open. A young girl saw it and, with a wide grin, began to waddle toward the dragon before her mother quickly grabbed her arm. I hadn’t noticed it before, somehow, and now… well, here it was. Right in front of me. And it wanted caramel.

“Hot, or…” I started, realizing that my voice was shaking uncontrollably. “Hot or cold?”

It was looking down at a small brown pouch, sifting through it with long, clawed (but surprisingly nimble) fingers. Its voice rumbled again, the smoke rising from the corners of its mouth and nostrils. 

“Cold,” it finally said. “Light on the ice, though, please.”

“Light on the ice,” I repeated, hands and voice still shaking. 

I punched the order in and looked up to read the amount due, only to see its reptilian eyes staring at me, its head downturned, fingers still digging into the pouch. It didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. It was waiting, I realized, for me to tell it how much it owed.

“That’ll be seven fifty-eight,” I said, popping open the cash register.

It huffed at that, spewing out black smoke and shaking its head slightly, before producing a few bills. 

“What’s the matter?” it asked as it handed me the money.

“Ex-excuse me?” I asked, returning a few coins as change.

“What is the…”

Then it looked up, its head swiveling on its long neck, shifting between the rest of the patrons in the cafe. The ones that hadn’t already made their way out, anyway. They all stared back, eyes wide and breaths halted. A low hum resonated from the dragon as it observed them, its head turning slowly until its gaze finally rested on its own tail, idly curling and uncurling across the floor.

“Ah,” it said, sounding amused. “Ah… I see.”

Then it laughed, the sound filling the room. Someone started crying. The young girl sat on her mother’s lap, wrapped in her arms, laughing uncontrollably. 

Then it looked at me. “I apologize,” it said, “for the confusion.”

With that, it hunched down and its scales receded. Its horns shrunk into its flesh, the yellow eyes went white, and the tail disappeared. The burning, toothy smile was replaced with a pleasant grin. The wings furled in and fell over its shoulders, becoming a brown leather coat. Charred crimson scales faded to cream as the long-snouted face contorted itself into that of a middle-aged woman, the mohawk at the top of its head falling into a short, golden bob.

“How embarrassing,” she said, “losing hold of a facade like that. Simple spell, but…” She waved her hand dismissively. “Oh, nevermind. I don’t think you’d understand.” 

She looked aside and smiled brightly, pointing at a barista down the line. “Is that my macchiato?”

The barista stared at me for a moment, before shifting his gaze to the woman. *I don’t get paid enough for this* was painted across his face. He handed her the drink without a word and she took it gingerly.

“Oh, thank you both,” she said, putting on a pair of sunglasses. She took a sip of the drink, seemingly unaware of the total silence of the cafe. “Perfect! Best spot in town, as usual.”

I took a breath, and managed a smile. “Hope to see you again soon.”

“Oh, certainly.”

She smiled again, before leaving a bill in the tip jar and making her way out the front doors. The cafe stayed silent for a few minutes after that, even as the remaining patrons began receiving their own drinks. Gradually, nervously, energy began to return to the floor, as if nothing had happened. People shared worried laughs, took their seats, and every so often shifted their eyes back toward the front doors.

“Where did the dragon go?” I heard the young girl ask as her mom led her out.",6,1750275416.0
1ldloip,mybuepg,"""I knew I shouldn't have listened to Morgan and Riley about going out last night,"" I think to myself, feeling hungover, ""and the light is just so bright."" Even though it is barely sunrise, and I'm walking in the shade of the buildings towards my job. I'm feeling way too exhausted to want to today.


Begrudgingly trudging forward I continue to the building housing the aptly named 'The Daily Grind.' As I get closer I try to get into the mindset of being the cheerful purveyor of fine stimulants, but someone keeps itching at the back of my mind. I'm not sure why, but I keep seeing a very attractive face and hearing the words ""Everyday is an adventure.""


I almost walk past the entrance when Jordan, calls out to me ""Alex. Alex! Where are you going?""


""Oh shit, sorry Jordie. Was lost in thought. Had a weird night last night with Morgan and Riley.""


""I told you, those two were trouble. Always coming into their shifts smelling like patchouli and deodorant spray. Are you going to be able to work today, Alex?"" Ashley asked scornfully.


""Yeah."" I mutter as Ashley purses their lips and squints in disdain, as if examining me to ensure I'm genuinely capable of work and I quickly add ""No. No. I mean, yes, I can work.""


""Fine,"" Ash says ""Let's get these doors open before Remy shows up and chews us out for being late.""


As we open the doors and walk in ""Is it ok if I set up the seating and the counter this morning?"" I ask.


""Fine, I'll help Jordan set up for the pastries, but as soon as you're finished doing that you're going to be doing all the baking and frying."" Ashley replies in a punishing tone as they close the doors and lock them behind us.


I pull down the chairs in the seating area and set up the sale signs for the day old pastries, and slink my into the back just as Ashley and Jordan finish up the first batch of rolls to be put in the oven.


""So, what did you three get up to last night?"" Jordan asks half-excitedly.


""Honestly, all we did was go to 'The Smokin' Dragon.' You know that hookah lounge that just opened a few blocks down the street. Then they wanted to go to a bar, but I was too tired so I dipped out and walked home. I did stop and get a bottle of wine though."" I said banally as I loaded the last tray of rolls into the oven.

Unexpectedly I remembered something and said ""As I was leaving QuickMart some homeless person asked for some change. It was weird. I couldn't tell if they were man or woman, but as I handed them what change I had, they grasped my hand and said 'thank you' in a raspy voice.""


Jordan looked at me wide-eyed and asked ""What did you do?""


""I patted their hand and said 'you're welcome' and they let go. But that's not the weird part.


""What do you mean?"" Jordan asked ""I would've freaked out.""


""I started to because they're hands were all clammy, but then suddenly everything felt calm. Then I went home and drank my wine.""


""That is weird."" Ashley interjects, ""Now get started on loading the dough so we can get these doughnuts fried.""


As Jordan and I go about finishing up the opening sequence, I keep hearing the phrase ""Everyday is an adventure."" 

As Ashley readied the cash register as Remy arrived and opened the doors for the business day.


""Alex!"" Remy called, shaking me from my autopiloting maneuvers.


""Yes, Remy what can I do for you?"" I reply.


""You're going to be on register, you always make sure we get every order as quickly as we can. On top of that, we've gotten some good reviews from customers about you.""


""Ok. Sure. On it boss."" I say thankfully in a cheerful tone. Running the register is a pretty easy job. Smiling and using common courtesy goes a long way.


As we wait for customers I lean back on the counter and dig out my phone. I start doom scrolling looking for new baking recipes when I heard the door chime. ""I apologize, I'll be right with you."" I say as I step forward to the register.


""One caramel macchiato, large, please."" A musical two-toned voice announced. 

I look up from my phone and see this very tall, strangely attractive, yet bald person, dressed in a bespoken business suit. As I start examining closer I notice what looked like an extreme case of something covering this person's hands and face. Then I noticed their eyes. They were an odd yet beautiful shade of amber that almost looked like they were glowing.


""One caramel macchiato, large, please."" the person repeated, this time in a single bass tone.


""M-m-my apologies."" I stammer ""Yes, one large caramel macchiato. I'll get right on that. That'll be 7.75."" and held out my palm. When the person handed me a larger bill I noticed the long, thick nails on the hand, and my eyes widened. I punched in the amount and counted back the change, ""25 makes eight, 1 makes nine, 2 makes 10"" then I asked ""Name?""


""Seriously, Alex? I come in here everyday and order the same thing almost always at the same time."" the creature said seemingly annoyed.


I smiled and turned around and went about making the coffee and as I finished I heard ""everyday is an adventure,"" and it dawned on me the name of the person I was speaking with. I added an extra final touch and said with a big smile ""Here you go Iggy!""

1ldn9wo,mya599a,"The spider horde pressed in, their black eyes reflecting flashes of spells and fire. Alric grunted as he blocked a lunge with the flat of his blade and went down on one knee. Otto darted underneath the spiders' bristly bodies, twin daggers slashing at their segmented legs. Shay cried for her goddess as she brought down her mace, but the divine light that had coated it was long gone.

Lena bit her lip hard enough to draw blood and mustered her reserves for another spell. Even as she weaved a lance of fire, she knew it wouldn't be enough. They were on their last legs, and the spiders just kept coming.

Alric shoved away the spider, rose wearily to his feet, and slashed at its head. ""Shay, Lena! Do something!"" he cried with that foolish hope warriors directed at spellcasters in moments of desperation.

""Can't,"" Shay gasped, retreating until her back pressed against the cavern's wall. ""I've got nothing left—I'm so sorry, everyone.""

Lena unleashed her flaming lance with a snarl, burning a spider to a crisp and filling the cavern with acrid smoke. As her companions fought their last struggle, a grim calmness came over her. Not all of them had to die here.

Closing her eyes, she tapped into the latent power of her blood, her very life force. A gasp escaped her as strength surged through her limbs—burning and painful, yet strangely exhilarating. It filled her to the brim and overflowed, threatening to burst her.

Lena opened her eyes and thrust out her palms, vicious energies crackling around her fingers. Bolts of lightning arced toward the spiders, blowing them up in sprays of gore. For the first time, the horde paused their advance, pincers clicking uncertainly.

Her lips curved, and she stepped forward. Blades of energy, bolts of fire, and arcs of lightning surged from her hands, decimating the spiders. Despite the agony burning her from inside, she laughed. Her comrades were yelling something, but she couldn't make out the words through the roar in her ears.

Then, suddenly, there was nothing left but half-burnt corpses. Lena blinked, then looked down at her palms. Her fingers were trembling, and blood trickled from under her nails. The newfound strength was draining from her, leaving her cold and feeble. But there was still some left. Perhaps...

With its last remnants, she weaved a final spell, combining elements of blood and life and time in a way she would never dare otherwise. She didn't cast it, not in her current state. Instead, she weaved in a delay and let it linger in her palm in the shape of interlocking circles.

The moment she was done, her arms sagged, and she swayed on her feet. Multiple arms caught her, lowering her gently to the ground, and the teary faces of her party loomed above her. She blinked as their voices broke through the haze.

""Gods, you're bleeding from your eyes,"" Alric said frantically as he cradled her head. ""Shay, heal her!""

Shay's hands glowed faintly as she laid them over her chest before she shook her head, tears running down her cheeks. ""It's not helping... She's burned herself out.""

""Oh, Lena,"" Otto wailed, grasping her hand in both of his. 

""It's all right,"" she said faintly, but that only made everyone cry louder. She glanced at her other hand, where glowing circles revolved lazily around each other. Less than a minute left. ""Alric, Shay...""

""What is it?"" Alric asked.

""You two... like each other, don't you?"" Lena's lips twitched as the two exchanged a wide-eyed look. ""It's annoying... watching you two tiptoe around each other... can you sort that out?""

Shay swallowed and exchanged another look with Alric. ""I, I wasn't sure—yes, of course. I promise, Lena.""

""And Otto...""

""Yes, Lena?"" the halfling asked, leaning closer.

She coughed. ""You're the one... who's been stealing... my honeycakes, aren't you?""

Otto sniffled and bowed over her hand. ""I'm so sorry, Lena! I'd give them back if I could!""

Her eyes narrowed. ""And the one... who sprinkled glowspores on my unmentionables?""

The halfling's eyes darted around in a panic before his shoulders slumped. ""Gods forgive me, it was just a prank. I'm sorry for lying about that too!""

""I... knew it,"" she exhaled, closing her eyes.

Her comrades' wails filled her ears. Then her delayed spell awoke, sinking into her skin. She gasped as warmth surged up her arm and spread through her, knitting flesh, reversing the damage. Taking a shuddering breath, she sat up and shrugged off everyone's hands.

Alric recoiled as if he'd seen a ghost. ""L-Lena?""

""I *said* it was all right,"" she murmured, wiping the blood off her lips.

""You... you aren't dying?"" Otto asked, still on his knees, eyes glimmering with tears.

1ldn9wo,myczzef,"The Outer Being schlorped closer to us, slowly, steadily, inevitably. My loves had managed to destroy all of the Being’s spawn, at the cost of their own bodies. I had done my absolute best to support them, mend their flesh and bones as they were struck, cleanse them of the miasma of disease that the spawn spewed with every breath.

It was not enough.

The spawn were manifestations of disease and poison and while their effects were difficult to compensate for, they were manageable. The Being itself? It was no mere disease, but an avatar of pure Rot and Decay. Every mote of its body constantly dessicating or dissolving, with more noxious flesh-like substance erupting from its bubbling form.

The closer it got, the less I could do. Condemned to watch my husbands twitch and groan in agony as their flesh too began yo bubble and slough. There was nothing left that I could do as my own skin tried yo slide off my bones.

Except.

It was a story passed down from mage to mage, master to student. That in moments of extremity, when all else failed and our magics could no longer help us, when nothing but despair and need was left, then it was possible, *possible* for a mage to break through the limits that we all held. The limits that kept Power safely contained. Channeled. Prevented our mere mortal forms from burned destroyed by the ocean of Magic pouring through us.

But if you gave yourself over to it, you could do more. Achieve miracles. Perform the greatest of deeds, for good or for ill. All at the cost of your everything.

My gaze turned from my loves, the holders of my heart, towards the Being. It was closer now. The air was fetid with stench so primal that it ceased being a smell or even a foul taste to became an infection of the soul. I had nothing left except the need to save the lights and songs and joys of my life.

I let go.

The moment stretched like a thread pulled taut.

Then I *BROKE*.

Everything happened at once. The bubbling of my skin intensified, but rather than death and decay, new flesh and blood and bone erupted. Arms and hands and fingers become multitudinous and long reached for the Being. Grasped it. *Squeezed* it. New protrusions growing from my hands to encage it as it tried to ooze through the gaps. Every point of contact between us *burning* with Life. Filaments of Growth and Life infiltrated its amorphous body. Not destroying, that is not the nature if my Power, but converting. Turning rot to renewal. Fuel for new life to flourish.

And renewing the Being was not all I did. My clothes exploded and flesh-like hairs and cilia erupted from my back, reaching back to the reasons for my existence. Even as the Being changed form and essence, I repaired my loves. *Improved* them. Reinforced them that nothing could physically hurt them ever again. They crashed into consciousness just in time to witness my last act as I was.

I engulfed the Being now. Remade and reborn into the antithesis of death. I was intertwined with it, unable to tell where it ended and I began.

Our arrays of eyes watched them as they witnessed us. For the nature of Crth’k$tl like ourselves could never be destroyed, merely reconfigured. We could not remain with our beloveds. Already we could see where their new bodies were fighting off nascent cancers from our presence. Our limbs, many-formed, carried us away, back to the portal that had led us here. We had business to conduct.

Our senses caught them as we left. Tears and anguish. They would live and thrive because of me. Whether they wanted to or not.",8,1750205235.0

You've long dreaded this moment. For centuries, the breaker state has cost mages life and limb, the cruel demand of magic's highest summit. Never have you risked it.

""Do something, Mergaloid!"" Nitro Man hisses, from under a separate rock. 

Perhaps a conjuring incantation could lift these rocks. After all, you minored in Conjuring and Communications Studies. You clear your throat but already know that to speak is a fool's errand. You need to enter the breaker state. That is the only way.

""Enter the breaker state!"" Faladriel cries. He's under a third rock.

You massage your temples. ""I'm working on it! Give me a second!""

""Hurry!""

The breaker state's first requirement is spilled blood. With your dagger, you prick your palm.

The second requirement: a pinch of toad ash. Fortunately, you always keep some in your satchel for its use as an exfoliant. With a flick of the wrist, you send the ash airborne. 

The third and most important requirement is a pure heart--and what could be purer of heart than to sacrifice for one's friends? To risk everything for them? You imagine the rocks breaking to dust. *Breaking,* as if in glorious testament to the breaker state itself, this newfound ability to cast your will upon the world.

In an instant, it is done. The rocks are broken, sublimated into the cool forest breeze. The cheers echo. Your party--your family, kin in the truest sense--get to their feet, dust themselves off, and you feel a love unlike any other.

Nitro Man tries to give you a high five, but your arms are now bloody stumps.

1ldd59n,my7jy70,"I got a bit drunk with my friends, and they teased me for being a priest.  
Called a chick repellant, and someone who doesn't really do much, but talks about things written thousands of years ago.  
So, as we walked past by the ocean, I wanted to prove them wrong.  
""Bless this water, Father Who Art in Heaven!"" I mutter, blessing the ocean.  
I turned around to tell my friends that I did something no other profession can, and I saw them starting, shocked at the ocean.  
I turn around to see points of light emerging from the ocean.  
Then figure jumped out of the water screaming.  
They were...people on fire?

  
Hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals got out of the water, onto the beach, screaming...turning to ashes?  
""Vampires!"" one my friends exclaims.  
I gasp.  
We all instantly sober up, and start calling the authorities.  
Soon, cops, and whatnots arrive, to watch the event unfold.  
More and more entities emerge from the ocean, burning to ashes.  
And as we talk to the cops...  
This happens all over the world.  
Of course it does!  
The oceans aren't isolated!

  
I get home, to my church, and start praying.  
What have I done?  
I killed so many...individuals.  
Vampires, or other monsters that die due to Holy Water, I don't care.  
It is still murder.  
""Lord, forgive me."" I mutter.  
""There is nothing to be forgiven, father.  
You did right."" a woman's voice says.  
I turn around to see a tall, pale woman, dressed in all black watching me.

  
""Can I help you, Mrs...?"" I ask.  
""Viola, and no, you already helped me...helped us."" she smiles, and I see it.  
Her fangs, and her red eyes.  
I take a step back.  
""Don't worry. We vampires were divided.  
Us, who integrated into human society, living on land, and those who bided their time, underwater, plotting to overthrow humans.  
I came to thank you. We never thought blessing the ocean would flush them all out."" she smiles, putting a thick envelope into the donation box.  
""Don't overthink this, father. They were the ones who saw humans as nothing but cattle.  
You saved your herd, from something worse than wolves."" she says...disappearing.  
I sigh, and continue praying.  
Being praised by one of them...does nothing to soothe my soul.",328,1750134420.0

I watched from the shore as countless amorphous bodies ran onto the beach, bleating like livestock, burning like candles. The sunlight, breaking them down to just their carbon, ashes floating into the tropical air. They lay on the beach, gasping for air in their final moments before the burn eventually overtakes them, and they disappear into the annals of history.

Later that evening, with a virgin daiquiri in hand, I turn on the radio at the beach bar. Countless tales of amorphous bodies washing up on shore, fangs were recovered from some, others had books. Vampires they said.

1ldsdje,mycxwcw,"I'm a reporter. I know by now what folly it is to get involved in stories involving superheroes and supervillains. I wouldn't be alive if I chased down every single lead and every single story. Sometimes, it's better just to keep your mouth shut. I know this. But. 300. That's how my superhero vigilantes have died this year. That's an average of one per day. Ordinarily, I'd assume that they're simply taking more risks than supervillains. That they're careless and get themselves killed. But that explanation no longer works. Not with the most recent death. 

I knew Fire Chief Cole since childhood. We weren't best friends, but we got along. I knew him to be a cautious person. And when he was a fire fighter, he always seemed to know when it was safe to go into a building and rescue people, and when it wasn't and would only serve to get the other fire fighters killed, too. He wasn't the type to get blinded by anger. He wasn't the type to recklessly charge in. He always erred on miscalculating on the cautious side of things. 

So why did he die? It doesn't make any sense. Fortunately, there is someone I know who can help me with my investigation. She was my best friend since we were children. Now, she's a rogue, a Robin Hood sort. Robs from the rich, gives to the poor. She has always talked about how the world is corrupt and there's no such thing as a good billionaire. We built a rapport over the years. She'd give me tips on my stories. I'd keep her name out of the papers. If I thought she was responsible for a crime I was supposed to report on, I'd give that story to someone else instead. Someone who would only find what the police did. In any case, I knew she was a reliable source, so I gave her a call. 

We agreed to meet atop the tallest building in the city that wasn't owned by a super villain. It was our routine to meet in such high places, though we never met in the same place twice. She flew onto the roof with her robotic wings. That was Carrie's style, after all. 

""Presley. So good to see you again,"" she said. I hugged her back and then stepped away. 

""It's good to see you, too, Carrie, though not under these circumstances."" 

""Yeah, yeah. Bad circumstances. Whatever. How are you doing, by the way? I know Coley was a friend of yours."" 

""I'm fine."" 

""If you were as fine as you say, you wouldn't be meeting me."" 

""I just need information. Or maybe a sounding board?"" 

""Sure, sure. We'll drop it for now. How can I help you?"" 

""I'm just wondering why so many superhero vigilantes are dying."" Carrie scoffed at this question. 

""Surely, that's easy to figure out. They're all reckless. They believe that because they have 'right' on their side, they can go fight evil without any regard for their safety."" 

""That's what I thought, too. But it doesn't explain Cole."" 

""Cole was usually cautious, but if he were sufficiently enraged, he'd probably have blinders on. We all tend to."" 

""He was the 300th one this year."" This caused Carrie to pause. I couldn't really see her face behind her mask, but I could tell her own gears started turning. I waited as she muttered something to herself. I knew better than to interrupt her thoughts. After a few seconds, she regarded me again. 

""You're right. 300 *is* a lot. That's way more than I thought."" 

""I know. It's staggering."" 

""How do you suppose superheroes and supervillains get their powers?""",12,1750204507.0
1ldsdje,myaohbs,"I watch the reporter smile brightly, as he sits down.
I smile as well.
""Thank you!
You are the first retired supervillain that has agreed for an interview."" he says.
""Of course!
When I heard you going around wondering about the obvious, I had to talk to you.
A bit out of amusement, but more to save you from mockery, young one."" I chuckle.
He frowns, but quickly regains his composure, and starts recording.
He is professional.


""So, Mr. Smith, used to called ""Captain Bright"", do you agree for this conversation to be recorded."" he asks.
""Yes."" I nod.
""Good. So previously you mentioned that the subject of this interview is something obvious, and that I am embarassing myself,  and opening myself to mockery.
Why so?"" he asks.
""Because you are asking why superheroes, and vigilantes die in the line of duty, while we villains live to an old sge."" I chuckle.
""There are at least 300 heroes that die, while maybe 1 villain is killed by a hero.
It doesn't make sense, considering how violent their fights are."" he says.
I smile.


""What is the fundemental difference between heroes and villains?"" I ask.
""Good and evil?"" he smirk.
I nod.
""Exactly. Heroes have bottom lines, beliefs, moral codes.
We? We do whatever we want. And most of us would flee, run, beg if it means survival.
Heroes do the opposite. Running to danger, to death.
Dying for the sake of others."" I say.
He nods.
""I agree, Mr. Smith,but vigilantes are not know for their love for villains, yet they still die more than villains."" he says.
I laugh.


""The pricks that think they are better than cops, heroes, and have a terrible case of hero syndrome?
The ones who truly hate villains, and would kill us are often with useless powers!
And the ones with decent powers?
They are more heroes than the heroes themselves!"" I say.
""I see.
So as a conclusion to my question? What would you say?"" he asks.
""Heroes die for their beliefs. Villains betray those beliefs for their goals, lives."" I say.
He nods, and thanks me.
I watch him leave with a happy smile.

""Right. And then you have people like me, who don't have powers but are really good at technology. And of course you have powered rogues who aren't really a hero or a villain. But in any case, how many of us do you think there are?"" 

""Uh. I dunno."" 

""Well, supervillains, we've only seen maybe 20 of. Heroes, legit heroes, not those vigilantes, make up maybe 30 or so? There are definitely more superheroes than there are supervillains, but not that much more. And rogues like me with powers, I can count on one hand."" She paused. This time, she was clearly waiting to see how I'd react. When I didn't have a reaction, she tapped her foot impatiently. 

""So what are you saying?"" I finally asked. 

""I'm *saying,* you're asking the wrong question. Your question shouldn't be why hundreds of superhero vigilantes are dying. You *should* be asking why there are so many in the first place."" 

""Oh,"" I said. Then it started to sink in. *""Oh!""*

""There it is. That's what I've been waiting for."" 

""It's so obvious now! The powers of these vigilantes were always weaker and harder to control than those of supervillains and superheroes."" 

""Because they weren't born with them."" 

""Yeah! And so, someone's been giving them artificial powers. Probably selling them the dream of being a hero."" 

""Or perhaps, the dream of taking down the villain who traumatized them in the past."" 

""And when someone's a villain or a rogue, they can't be marketed to the same way?""

""Most of us are completely content using gadgets if we don't have powers, or hiring someone to use theirs."" 

""That makes sense. So. Only people who are desperate to do something to help others fall for their tactics. Wait, this would mean -"" 

""Coley."" 

""I wonder what they used to manipulate him like that."" 

""Me, too. Though it doesn't really matter, does it?"" 

""Yeah, it doesn't right now. We have to figure out how they're doing this and stop them before they can take another life.""

1ldvcv8,myd2gu1,"It's been happening since I was seven. Sometimes it was ""advice"" that I'm sure would have been very useful had I been living in the 19th century, or just random stuff that I didn't (and still don't) understand that much.

My mom had some really bizarre beliefs about spirituality. She always told me that, one day, whether that be in ten years, or just ten hours, I would find my soulmate. She said that our souls were ""intertwined,"" and that sometimes he could ""talk to me from far away."" Something about how he would ""spiritually project"" or whatever, and that he would try to get to me in person. But that sounded kinda dumb to me.

She was also very superstitious. I remember that, when I was little, I'd see her pouring salt around the house, and she'd tell me it's to ""deter ghosts.""

""You know, dead people.""

I never really understood what the point was. If a spirit wanted to come in, then so what? I guess my mom just didn't see it that way.

The salt pouring only stopped a few months after I turned seven during the winter. I distinctly remember hearing my mom scream while she was outside, only to then run back in and tell me that there were ""hundreds of ants"" eating the salt. My mom was *terrified* of insects, even more so than ghosts somehow. So she kinda just stopped with the whole salt pouring thing after that.

A couple months later, I heard a voice in my head that I still remember today. It seemed to come from behind me. Male, low-pitched, ""Rosaline didn't want to go with me."" I had no idea what that sentence meant, so I just asked my mom. She looked horrified. I mean, she always did, but especially then. ""A ghost,"" she said quietly. ""Now a ghost wants my sweet girl.""

I didn't really know what to do with that information. I just wasn't phased by the fact that a ghost had talked to me. I actually found it quite amusing, to be honest. Nothing really seemed to scare me. Well, except for that novelty haunted house I went to with Emma a year prior, but I don't think anyone under the age of 12 *wouldn't* be.

So I just went back to my room. I mean, what was I *supposed* to do? Call Ghost Busters?

But I knew it had to mean *something*. My grandma always liked to say that if life were meaningless, it wouldn't exist. Whenever I asked what she meant, she'd say that nothing can truly be meaningless since everything happens for a reason, and I always kept that in the back of my mind. After all, why would a dead person just come up with a random sentence to tell me with no reason for doing so?

I couldn't stop thinking about it. Surely I would've gone mad if I had pondered a minute longer. But it was to no avail, because I had no idea who ""Rosaline"" even was. Looking back, I'm actually not sure if that was even a real name. Hell, I don't even remember that part clearly; it could've really been ""Rosalina"" or even something like ""Caroline."" I was seven, after all...

Nothing particularly interesting happened for another week, except for when I saw a mouse in my room. But then, I heard another voice behind me, just as startling as the last time. I don't remember much, except for the statement itself: ""Larry is so lazy."" I actually laughed, because it was funny to me for whatever reason.

For another few months or so, the interval between each experience shortened.

When I was about twelve or thirteen, I started to notice something: I never heard from the same person multiple times, except one, who I heard several times a day at that point: a boy, around my age. For some reason, the things he said just seemed more relevant to me in a way that I can't really describe.

The messages that weren't from him were never that meaningful, and whenever I tried to ask questions, I'd get no response. Always. But when I tried asking *him* a question after he told me something, he'd respond every single time. Sometimes we were able to have full conversations. He even told me his name: Jack.

And before I knew it, I was starting my freshman year of high school. For the first day, there wasn't much work; we were just getting used to our teachers. The second day was also devoid of any work, except for a worksheet that my math teacher handed out. Something weird I noticed was that, ever since I started high school, I stopped hearing from Jack, and I didn't hear any other voices as much. When I did, it was somehow *less* meaningful than it had been before.

On the third day, pretty much all of our teachers had started giving us assignments. I remembered that I somehow managed to forget my stuff in another room, so I went over and knocked on the door, and somebody opened it a few seconds after. So I grabbed my stuff and went out.

When I went back into the halls, I finally heard Jack's voice again.

1ldt46t,myd8dbg,"Steph was slouched over a spread of papers and textbooks at the kitchen table, her open backpack on the floor under her chair. I smiled. At thirteen years old she was surprisingly studious. I realized, of course, that her math teacher probably had a lot to do with the miraculous explosion of effort and interest she'd been investing into her studies.

I went about my business grabbing a glass of juice.

She looked up at me and smiled. ""Hey,"" she said. ""Can you help me with my homework?""

""Sure, what is it?"" I set the still empty glass next to the bottle of orange juice and made my way to her side.

""Math,"" she groaned. ""We just started a new unit on arc angles and lengths and it's just too much.""

I glanced over the stapled homework packet and muttered some of the questions out loud. ""Find the length of arc A given a radius of 3 meters and... Find the area of the sector defined by points A, B, and D..."" I sighed and turned the page. ""Calculate the angle ACF given an arc length of 5 inches. What is Gizmo Man's greatest weakness?"" I rolled my eyes and dropped the papers on the table. ""Nice try,"" I groaned.

Steph giggled. ""Come on, some of this is really hard!""

I went back to the juice. ""You two are cute, you know that? Real cute.""

""She says you have to have a weakness.""

I shook my head. ""You mean besides you and your ridiculously charming personality?"" I capped the juice and turned to return it to the refrigerator.

She let out a hoarse guffaw and slapped the table. ""Sure,"" she said. ""Besides that."" I could hear the classic teenager eye roll maneuver even with my head in the fridge.

I came back up smiling. ""Haven't got one,"" I said.

""Well she's planning something big for this weekend,"" Steph said, an obvious lie.

""I'll be sure to cancel my plans with mom and dad,"" I said coyly, rolling my eyes. I took a sip of orange juice and felt it tingling all the way down my gullet.

Steph peered at me, silently scanning for any signs of worry, deception, or weakness. Enchantra had been teaching her some pretty impressive skills, but Steph was still struggling to yield any results. Mind reading had proven particularly difficult for my little sister, but even Enchantra had never been able to penetrate any deeper than I had permitted her to go.

""Maybe mom or dad will help you with the homework. Should I take you back to their house now?""

""No!"" she yelped. ""Please! Let me stay with you. In fact, can I stay the night? I really want to hang out with you tonight.""

""And what, I'll take you to school in the morning? I don't think so,"" I said. ""You're going home tonight. I said you could come over after school and do your homework here, but that's it.""

She sighed and made a show of rolling her eyes again. ""Fine."" Her shoulders slumped and she huffed a few times while staring blankly at the homework.

There was a knock at the door. I dropped my chin and glared at Steph who had perked up. She grinned and looked at the door. ""You gonna answer it or should I?""

I groaned and started for the door. ""This is a new low for you,"" I said sternly but through suppressed laughter.

She smiled innocently. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Once the door was opened I found myself staring down the barrel of some new weapon, doubtless Enchantra's latest invention. With the barrel in my face I couldn't make out much of the actual weapon or device. I marked the moment in my mind. Perhaps once I knew what the device was for I could do something about it.

""Welcome,"" I said calmly. ""Come on in. We were just working on Steph's homework. Maybe you can help.""

Enchantra held the weapon firmly in her grip and side-stepped around me into the living room. Her shiny black hair was pulled tightly into a ponytail that pointed nearly straight up from the top of her head. Her black pupils peeked out from behind the device at me and I could clearly read a pleased smile in the corners of her eyes. As she moved I got a better view of the weapon. It wasn't a strange device, it was a standard twelve gauge shotgun.

A chill ran down my spine and I glanced sideways at Steph who looked on with a cool, indifferent demeanor. I held my breath.

""You want something to drink, Enchantra?"" I offered.

Enchantra laughed and lowered the shotgun. ""Please,"" she said playfully. ""Call me Ms. Nelson."" She sauntered over to the table and put her arm around Steph.

My heart was pounding, and I knew that Enchantra could detect that a mile away.

The villain grinned and her eyebrows lifted knowingly. ""Ah,"" she said, putting her body between Steph and the shotgun. She pointed the weapon toward my sister and cocked her head. ""So this really is your greatest weakness?"" She put her finger on the trigger.

Nope.

I closed my eyes and focused on the moment I opened the door to her. I visualized the way the barrel was leveled on my eyes. I pictured her dark form at the edges of my peripheral view. I inhaled, recalling the way her subtle perfume had wafted into my nostrils. I had to envision it all, even what I hadn't been able to see. I recreated the entire scene in my mind, down to the way her curves filled out the blouse and tight jeans she was wearing and the precise way each of her hairs flowed up through the brass wrap that held her ponytail aloft. I held the vision steady in my mind just as I had done with so many of the other moments I had marked in my past, and when I opened my eyes I was there again, staring into the black barrel of her twelve gauge shotgun.

Only this time, she wasn't moving. Nothing was moving. Time was stopped, and I had the power to change anything I wanted. I worked quickly to manipulate the scene in subtle but important ways. I removed the shells from the shotgun first. Then I went to the table and scribbled out a quick message on Steph's homework. I folded it up and put it into Enchantra's back pocket. Then I returned to my spot and released the timeline back to its normal flow.

""Welcome,"" I said calmly. ""Come on in. We were just working on Steph's homework. Maybe you can help.""

Enchantra held the weapon firmly in her grip and side-stepped around me into the living room. Nothing had changed. I still admired the way her shiny black hair was pulled up into that magnificent ponytail. Her beautiful black pupils still peeked out from behind the shotgun at me and I wondered what more could be hiding behind that enchanting smile of hers.

Again I glanced sideways at Steph who looked on with a cool, indifferent demeanor.

I smiled, cool and in control. ""You want something to drink, Enchantra?"" I offered.

Enchantra laughed and lowered the shotgun. ""Please,"" she said playfully. ""Call me Ms. Nelson."" She sauntered over to the table and put her arm around Steph.

I shrugged and closed the door. ""Suit yourself. It's pretty hot out. A cool glass of water might be refreshing.""

Enchantra lowered her brow impatiently and pointed the weapon at Steph. ""Surrender,"" she said, trying to sound confident. ""I know you will do anything for your sister, that much is clear. So surrender and she won't get hurt.""

I looked at Steph, who appeared to be unphased. ""You're OK with this sis?"" I asked. ""Are you in on this plan?""

Steph's eyes went wide and she put a hand to her chest, playing innocent. ""Who, me? Of course not!""

""So you don't think she'll do it,"" I offered, ignoring Enchantra's building tantrum.

""I'll do it!"" the woman shrieked, putting her finger on the trigger.

I shrugged. ""I don't think you will.""

She racked the shotgun.

I stared at her face and grinned.

She looked down at the weapon in disbelief. She knew what it should have sounded like, and that wasn't it.

I watched as she fumbled with the shotgun and found it empty. She looked up at me with terror in her eyes. ""What? How? I..."" She choked and sputtered words and the many sounds of unsuccessful attempts at comprehension for a moment, looking around the floor, patting herself down.

I turned away to hide my growing grin and walked to the fridge. ""Sure you don't want some water?""

""How?"" She cried the word with intense desperation and frustration, then pulled out a chair next to Steph and flopped down, dropping the useless weapon on the floor and burying her face in her hands. ""I just don't understand how this always happens. I come up with a foolproof plan, and you..."" She looked up at me and clenched her jaw. ""I don't know! I don't know what you're doing or how you're doing it, but I'm sure it's you!""

Steph put a reassuring hand on her teacher's shoulder. ""It's OK,"" she said. ""You tried.""

Enchantra briefly glared at my sister, then smiled and shook her head. ""We need to keep working on your telesensing and telepathy.""

Steph nodded.

I brought over a glass of ice water and set it in front of Enchantra. ""That's fine for later, but tonight I think what she really needs is help with her math homework.""

Steph glanced down at the table. ""Hey, where'd my homework go?"" she asked, frantically lifting her text book and digging through her backpack.

I shrugged. ""See if your teacher has an extra copy."" I suggested.

Enchantra scowled at me. ""Why would I bring a copy of the homework over to try to capture you?""

I took a sip of orange juice and sniffled, shrugging again. ""I mean, math can be pretty scary. Plus, when I was checking out your incredible butt I thought I saw some papers in one of your back pockets.""

""Mark!"" Steph barked at me. ""What is wrong with you?"" She laughed uncomfortably.

Enchantra glared at me and reached back to check her pockets. She pulled the folded homework packet out and looked at it quizzically. Eventually she found what I had written and she gasped.

I smiled.

Steph leaned over. ""What's it say?"" she asked.

Enchantra quickly folded the papers and shoved them back into her pocket as she got to her feet. She was blushing, her mouth half open but unable to speak.

""So?"" I asked.

And she stormed back out through the front door.",10,1750208162.0
1lda0ow,my78id8,"So much for asking what has 4 legs in the morning, 2 legs in the afternoon, and 3 legs in the evening. The Sphinx had changed its mind, knowing how a quick internet search would reveal the answer for those too dumb to guess it. No more riddles with one single answer that was known throughout the online world.

""What came first, the chicken or the egg?""

The human opened a portal and pulled a big whiteboard out. There he started drawing single cell organisms, and algae. Followed by fish, amphibians, and images of creatures coming to shore. Strange entities that were inbetween - of sea creatures evolving to adapt to a life on land.

The sphinx's tail swished, patient but taut.

He drew lots of lines and stuck many mini-magnets on the messy images. His eyes widened as his speech got faster and hurried, more jumbled and difficult to decipher. Like a conspiracy theorist feeding on his own bullshit. The man never stopped talking for a second, drawing over his earlier images with more scribbles that were less comprehensible than a **drunken eldritch god's*** attempt at cave paintings.

Lizards. And more dumb drawings of what the Sphinx assumed were lizards. She yawned and stretched her paws out in boredom. The man's droning could put her to sleep. But she had to stay awake. What if this was a new tactic to get past her without answering her question?

""They're dinosaurs, bitch,"" the human snapped. ""Look, birds came from dinosaurs okay? And one of those birds is the chicken. Aren't you immortal? Then you have the time to hear me out. Let me finish.""

She stared at him in stony silence, and waved a paw to signal him to keep going. A part of her wanted to see him explain this out. To hear from him if the chicken or the egg came first.

""Okay you see this feathery dinosaur thingy?"" He stabbed his hideous drawing multiple times with his marker. ""One day, these two not-quite-chickenzilla dinos mated. They're not the same species, but they are compatible. Think of it like how humans breed new species of dogs or domesticated chickens. Something happens in that egg. There's a mutation. The environment has changed, and these creatures can't exist the way they did if they didn't want to die out like the T-Rex. So, the baby to hatch from this egg, that's your first chicken. And that egg, it was the first chicken egg, laid by totally-not-chicken-half-reptilian thingys.""

At that, the human puffed up his chest and threw the marker down like he was doing an epic mic drop.

""And so, the chicken egg came first. Now, can I pass through?""

The Sphinx sighed and stepped to one side. ""Get in, before I change my mind, you annoying, smug little shit. And take the exit at the back of the pyramid. If I ever catch you coming out from this entrance and you start babbling in pseudoscientific gobbledegook again, I will tear you into many, many pieces.""

Sir Glisham stares at me in horror. He hisses under his breath ""Lad, you better have good reason for this.""

""I do sir. Well, its teh breeding. I want a speckled red rooster, then I gotta breed a red hen with a speckled hen. The baby is from to breeds, but is still born from a hen. If I want to have that hen protected from harm, I'd breed it with a strong or bigger bird. The baby once again is from an egg.""

Glisham listened as his sire carefully explained his answer, slow and clear language and realised what he was doing. They had no clue how this question was to be answered, and death would come should the fail. But the boy was giving this Spinx the exact reasoning. An egg may not give you a chicken, but it can get you every variation of a bird. You could get red bird, big birds or magical birds, but none could exist without the egg.

After what seemed like hours, the Sphinx sighed and shook its head. Feared welled up for a moment, but the door opened.

Damn, let's check it out.

  
""You know about genetics, evolution, and perhaps about our world's timeline, Sphinx?  
Like for example, do you know about dinosaurs?"" I ask.  
The Sphinx snorts.  
""I am the Immortal Sphinx, bearer of knowledge! Of course I have researched your planet's history!  
Though not in detail, as those I met were not that knowledgeable."" it says, its huge rocky body shaking.  
Fair enough.  
""Well, modern birds, like chicken, evolved from early birds, that themselves evolved from theropod dinosaurs."" I start.  
The Sphinx nods.

  
""Well, so, egg laying animals existed millions of years ago, maybe hundreds of millions to be fair.  
So in general, eggs were first, way before chicken, but even if we want to get closer to the egg vs chicken situation, it is still the egg that is first."" I start.  
""How, if a chicken is required to lay the egg?"" it retorts.  
I smile.  
""Well, early birds laid eggs, evolved, mutated, change, over and over again until we get close to modern birds' anatomy/situation.  
At some point, the ""nigh"" - chicken, bird ancestor of chickens, laid an egg in which occurred a mutation, that led to the first ever chicken chicken.  
So, egg first, then chicken...does it make sense?"" I ask.  
The Sphinx shudders, and it transforms...into a humanoid form?

  
""How do you know so much? I can sense that your knowledge is...mediocre."" she, because the Sphinx apparently is a woman, asks, shaking my collar.  
""So you agree with my answer? I don't die?"" I ask.

1ldcbju,my89ew2,"“Really? I always assumed there had to be a few of us roaming about. If they’ve got the technology to make super soldiers, why would they stop at one?” I asked, digging my hands through my chest, trying to find the last bullet. I gripped the piece of metal, twisting it, only to fall forward again, dying momentarily. My next few moments were brief flashes of consciousness before I died again, the bullet killing me repeatedly, until I finally pried it free during one of those flashes of life, tossing it across the floor of the warehouse.
 
“I guess I thought I was more special.” She smiled, only to wince when she saw the hole in my chest close, the skin crawling over itself, knitting together in a red mess. “That’s how you heal?”
 
“Yeah? Don’t you do the same?”
 
She clutched the harpoon with her gloved hands, making sure she had a firm grip on it. She gave a testing tug, only to groan when it got caught in her ribcage, the sound similar to the crunch you would hear if someone chewed chalk. Gritting her teeth, she dug her fingers into the metal, causing the small cat symbols on her gloves to scrunch up as if they were about to pounce before she dislodged it.
 
The harpoon flew out of her chest, as if she had shot it across the floor. When it landed, it clanked across the cold floor, before falling flat. She threw her head back, recovering from the pain, as her chest went a deep green and black. The rotting skin crawled towards the wound as it closed in on itself, almost as if she were decomposing in reverse, and soon that rotten skin went back to its olive color. “See.” She said, pushing her brown hair out of her face. “I hope you saw it. Because I’m not doing it again.”
 
“That’s efficient. What would have happened if you hadn’t removed it?”
 
“It would have been pushed out by my body, eventually. You ever gotten a splinter before?”
 
“Would you believe me if I said I haven’t had one since I was a child? I’ve been shot, burnt, buried alive, and even mauled by a dog. But I can’t remember the last time I’ve had a splinter. Weird line of work we’re in, isn’t it?”
 
She laughed. “Well, you know how splinters push themselves to the surface? My bullets, knives, harpoons, and anything that gets lodged into me do the same.”

“Lucky.” I muttered, with a hint of jealousy. I was about to ask her when she became a super soldier, but her explanation told me all I needed to know. She was a newer model, someone who had a more refined version of whatever they gave me. I couldn’t properly heal without removing the weapon first, which made things tricky when something got lodged in my brain or heart. If that happened, I would have to pull it out while my body was trying to revive itself, giving me a few seconds at a time to tug or pull.
 
“I’m not sure if lucks the right word for us.” She got to her feet and offered me her hand. “Name’s Marsha.” I grabbed her hand and shakily pulled myself to my feet, my body still wobbly after having a few bullets lodged inside my brain. My motoring skills still having a few missing pieces. I leant on her for support, and she did her best to keep me upright.
 
“Kenny, or Ken.”
 
“Like the doll?”
 
“Stick to Kenny.” I mumbled, hating the Ken doll comparison. “Also, I’ve heard. Oh my god, you killed Kenny, about a hundred times already, so let’s avoid that, ok?”
 
“Aww, you can’t rule out all the good jokes.” She said, carrying me through the warehouse. “So, what were you doing here?” She asked, only to pause. It felt as if we had both realized something terribly important at the exact same time. We didn’t know who the other person worked for. That earlier piece of comradery making us ignore the elephant in the room.
 
“Guessing you're not an IOP agent, are you?” I asked, pushing myself away from her. My legs bucked a few steps after letting her go, before I regained my balance. I went to draw my gun, only to realize I had left it somewhere in the warehouse, having dropped it after getting my head blown off. Without a weapon, I raised my fist, trying to at least look like a threat.
 
She tapped her side, groaned, and raised her fist too, apparently in the same situation that I was in. “IOP?” She thought over all the acronyms, only to drop her fist. “You’re a little far from home, aren’t you? What’s a yank doing in London?”
 
“Working?”

She gestured to the dead bodies before crossing her arms. “Work? There are rules for these types of things. You don’t get to our home ground and start killing people. You need to give us a heads up.”
 
“I was under the impression that everything had been approved. I just didn’t expect you would be here too. So, you’ve got your own super soldier program? I thought they were illegal under international law.” I stated, as if anyone ever followed those rules. We were both living proof that those agreements weren’t worth the paper they were written on.
 
“Funny that.” She said, grabbing her phone from her pocket, covering the Hello Kitty sticker on its back. She tapped a number in and brought it to her ear. “We’ve got a… Oh, you knew about this? Mmm. Of course, they put the paperwork through after the fact. What would have happened if we killed each other? Yes, I know we can’t actually kill each other, but we still would have tried. Alright, bye.” She hung up, sighing. “That was almost a mess. So, what now?”
 
“What do you mean?”
 
“Well, jobs done. We killed the arms dealers and saved the world. So, you want to grab a drink or something? Not every day I get to meet another super soldier. Even if they’re an inferior version.”
 
“Who are you calling inferior? I’ve been at this for the last twenty years.” I didn’t expect to get so riled up by her comment, hearing my tone rise with each word.
 
“I’ve been doing this for the last ten years. You’re practically a super dinosaur compared to me. Don’t worry, I get called version 1 by the smartasses I work with. Though, it’s kind of ironic since this version 1 is the only one that’s still around. The others eventually lose their gifts after an hour or two.”
“Similar to ours. We still haven’t figured out why mine have lasted this long. Luck perhaps?” I suggested, since that was the only explanation the scientists in our labs could give me. Each test they did revealed I was nothing out of the ordinary, so why I was a strange exception was beyond anyone’s knowledge.


“Perhaps we’ll figure it out over drinks then? Unless they’ve got to ship you back to some secret underground base?” She teased.
 
“I’m not a weapon.” I said, even if that wasn’t entirely true. “At least not one that can’t have some downtime. Alright, I’ll grab a drink with you. Beats sitting around alone, waiting for them to tell me which flight I need to get on.”
 
“That’s the spirit. Come on, I know a great place.” Martha said, leading me onto the street. Before we went to any bars, I stared at my clothing, spotting a few bullet holes in the material.
 
“Should we get changed?”
 
“Oh, yeah. That’s probably a good idea. My apartment’s nearby. You can probably fit into some of my old clothes. If not, I’ll buy you something after I get changed.”
 
So, I followed behind her, not having anything else to do until I was told to return from my mission. Plus, I had to admit, I was curious to learn more about their super soldier, curious to see how many changes had been made after my success.

He took a deep breath, calming himself.

""WHY, in the name of Goddess Above, did you not mention this at the beginning?""

Every word sounded like the priest was spitting acid, hissing at every eligible consonant.

A tall man in a black robe and glasses was standing in front of the war priest, all prim and upholding the Goddess's law with every movement. Except you could see the red gleam in his eyes now.

""Well, you see,"" he said conversationally. 

""Yes,"" the priest interrupted, his eye twitching. ""I see that you're an abomination!""

""Do we not preach tolerance and acceptance?"" 

That was when the war priest actually exploded, and by the Goddess's beautiful spikes we will not describe what transpired. Let us just say there was a lot of colorful vocabulary flown all around and some very unsuccessful sword swinging involved.

When things calmed down and the war priest stopped trying to perform his sacred duty, the demonic pastor sat down next to his panting colleague and started speaking in a more serious tone.

""I understand this is a little controversial."" He ignored the death glare directed his way. ""And I understand how you must feel in the face of my, uh, betrayal.""

He smiled just a little.

""Of course, this cannot continue. Even if we cover my secret together, another poor soul might find out what I actually am.""

""Therefore, I will step down. And it is a Goddess's blessing that we have just the right candidate for the new Head Priest.""

The war priest paled a little.

""Of course, I was planning on meeting the Inspection myself, but since I am suddenly incapacitated by my species, you still have a couple of hours until they arrive. Please bear in mind that the accounting is what they look at the most these days. Unless you know all the numbers by heart, I'm afraid they will not be convinced and will request a full audit. By the King's Law, that request may not be rejected.""

The demon smiled openly now.

""Also, I must warn you that we are having a very heated argument in court. The Church of the Churning Waters are livid, and we are facing quite a few allegations. I was going to be attending the second court hearing in about 7 hours from now, but I suspect you will be occupied with the audit.

Remember that if you do not present them to the City, you will face a fine and will not be able to alter the building for about ten years.""

""That...that should have pierced your core..."" the mage said, her ears twitching. One of the demonfolk, perhaps? How much time had passed here in my study for there to be peace between the races like this. But what did she mean by 'core?'

""Never mind that!"" The elf said as his blade scrapped along my ribs, drawing back into a new stance.

My eyes blazed as I snapped my fingers, realization dawning on me. ""Lady Yama's third form!"" The elf looked shocked at my words, and the other three baffled entirely.

""It was my intention, to be honest.  But when I saw you hunched over that book over there, and let me say that is the single largest volume I've ever seen it's as tall as I am, with fresh brewed coffee at hand, something just didn't add up.""

The Lich chuckled.  ""What about the glory, the wealth?""

""I didn't come here for glory, I came at the order of my king to do a job.""

""To kill me.""

""No, to eliminate the threat,"" Layton said, leaning forward.  ""I think there's a way through this where everyone wins.  You want bland.""

""Bland.""

""Bland, unintersting, boring.  Set up your house right in the middle of town, plain stone, don't be cheap on the roof though, that's worth paying a higher price.  Welcome other scholars in, share the library, run a coffee shop.""

""I do not wish to run a business.""

Layton shook his head, ""*You* don't have to run it, merely make the space available.  Charge rent.  Provide the coffee at 5% over cost, since you probably already have good arrangements with a supplier.""

""You have a head for this.""

""I'm no businessman either, but I do have to quartermaster my men.  The king expects me to keep the unit well prepared but on budget.""

""Let's say I agree to this.  As you say I have a reputation, what's to prevent a mob bringing night-time torches to my new home?""

""Time, it will take time.  I can come back with trusted companions and some, hm, open-minded mages I know.  I have a reputation myself and I'm willing to call in some debts.  Having you on our side rather than an enemy could only benefit everyone.""

""And bring me closer to the graves that I need to rob for my experiments.""

Layton's eyes narrowed and Kreig burst into wheezing laughter.  ""Oh, you should see your face right now.  Good hells, I'm joking with you.  Very well, perhaps we could give this a try.  Return in two weeks?  I can roll out a proper welcome, make the place a little brighter.  Unset all the traps if I, er, remember where they all are.""

Lich and knight stood and shook hands.  ""Two weeks,"" said Sir Layton, ""we'll make this work.""

I sigh.
""I am a lich, of course I am inhuman."" I say.
He freezes, as the rest of the group stops in place.
""You can talk?
Most dungeon monsters are...mindless."" one of them says.
""Because they are my failed projects."" I say.
They gasp.


""You created the monsters?"" a young woman asks.
""And the dungeon themselves.
Quite easy.

""Why?"" they ask.
""To escape from you."" I say.
""Heh. So you are a monster!"" the young man from before shouted.
""Yeah. And you guys pestered me because of it until I had to run away, and live in this shitty crypt."" I say.
They frowned.


""Yeah.
You all came to me, begging me to teach you how to master magic, how to raise the dead, how to become immortal...
Or worse, hunting me like an animal!
Or even worse, you started worshipping me!"" I shouted.
Bad idea.
I scared them.
And the warrior rushed at me.
I easily immobilized him.
""You are the one who standardized magic? How old are you?"" the young woman who might be the mage asked.
She is smart.



""Somewhat? Maybe? I just gave out some of my research to a them.
As for how old am I?
I became a lich in the Leaf Kingdom."" I say.
The young woman gasped.
""The Leaf Kingdom? That was an entity in the God Wars Era!
Millions of years ago!"" she says.
""Oh yeah...
Seeing them idiots fight for belief and faith from worshippers gave me some inspiration."" I say.
They said nothing, but stared at me.
I sigh.

1lcw0tu,my6nfh5,"Watching the rather numerous group stumble into the laboratory, the master lich glared at them. Mumbling to himself, he stood upright to address them. Rather than a group of worshippers, he realized they were a band of adventuring mercenaries as a magic spear hurled through the air. Waving it aside, using a simple light ward, he knew how this interaction was going to devolve. “Let’s save time, turn around and I’ll give you gold or something.”

Rather than entertaining his bribery, the group of twenty began circling around him. Clearly they were coordinated, likely having bound together for some time. Most were Demi-human or humanoid, so it wasn’t a surprise the party had some depth to their experience. The party leader on the other hand was very much human, likely some local noble who’d hired the rest of the party. 

“It’s easy work like I said. With enough man power, even complex dungeons are a breeze! Charge as soon as he moves.” Glaring at him, the lich sighed. Three archers took aim, not at him but at slight angles. Each readied for his evasive maneuvers. A large brute stood at each cardinal direction, likely their vanguard approach for if he made a hard run for it. Then various mid and long range fighters filled in the gaps. 

“So if I don’t move we’re done here? I don’t mind waiting a century if it …before finishing his statement, he realized a distortion in his vision. Illusion magic! Jumping up in the air, he blasted the ground with a fire ball. It wasn’t his strongest spell, but it was his fastest spell without recoil. As he blinked, the scene changed before him. They’d charged him while casting the illusion spell, but the scary part was how effective the spell was. He’d never been caught off guard before. 

“Chain lightning” hearing their mage cast, he used earthen magic to ground out the spell. It was a high level fire spell, and seeing she didn’t need to do the incantation, he was dealing with a powerful mage. As the smoke cleared, he’d taken out most of them with his fire ball and a few accidentally got impaled with his earth spell. Seven were left, two being mages so he wasn’t sure which was the caster. Both spells were the same though, he knew only one of them had cast both. 

Altering his stance, he dodged as two great weapon fighters attacked in sync. The great hammer barely grazed his shoulder, knocking him down. The great-sword swung through where he was supposed to have been and cleanly cleaved his partner. With the sword wedged, the lich opened up both hands with a burst of poison. At point blank, it was deadly in seconds. Two lancers charged, each holding a magical rod. 

Both threw their weapons, cover fire coming in from the mage. Luckily they’d aimed for his vitals, a fleshy bit he hadn’t had for millennia. The holy spell caster was hiding, and unable to counter attack until the binding spells stopped flying by. Letting himself get hit, he cast a counter spell, cursing the cleric. A painful scream echoed from across the room as he imploded with spikes. The lancers quickly became enveloped in stone.

Fear stretched across Soriya’s face as the monster turned towards her, but her sister kept chanting without hesitation. “Evicted souls, bear witness” a forbidden spell, meant to cultivate undead warriors and challenged control of those already existing. The wards countering the spell had been etched into his bones long ago, and he watched the reverb catch her off guard. Blood expelled from her mouth as she fell onto the ground. 

“Which of you cast the illusion spell?” He’d assumed it had been the one still standing, as the other’s affinity towards dark magic was almost notable in the presence of his own. Illusion magic was very akin to holly magic making them nearly incompatible. Yet as the standing younger sister starred at her dying elder sister, he knew who the true monster in the room was. “Repent” a master level healing spell, which intricately weaved all her wounds with magic wire and expelled the sicknesses from her body. Quickly she got up, ready to attack. “Don’t. Or I’ll kill your sister.” An ice shard extended from his wrist and gently rubbed against Sirius’s neck. 

Taking pause, they both knew she was almost depleted anyways. The spell only restored her physical body, not the mana she’d spent or the mental strain she’d undergone. That spell was a last ditch effort from her, not having enough mana to fight off the recoil was both a novice and experienced mistake as well. “I was mortal before. A few thousand years ago, but the meaning still stands. Do you want to learn magic? True magic? You’re elvish, so we have at least a thousand years before you’d even think about making the same sacrifice, so what do you have to loose?” Breathing heavily, she felt her heart race. 

“Bring them back. If you’re so powerful bring them back!” Being flung across the room, both girls found themselves pinned in stone chairs by the entrance. Black flames swirled in the room. His cape fell off and for the first time, they could see his whole self. A large core levitated in his midsection, but it was so black neither could even see the magic swirling. Two smaller red cores were in his eye sockets, glowing like flames. Neither had seen a monster with more than one core. 

“Do we have a deal?” The flames spun faster, runes began etching on the floor and glowing purple. 

“Their lives and my sister’s safety! Then you can keep me!” Swirling up around him, the corpses and the lich couldn’t be seen. Soon plasma crackled through and ancient chants could be heard. Soon the flames lowered, yet all the bodies laid on the floor. Each seemed healed but the lifeless stillness remained. A glass ball with dancing white and red orbs hovered above him. 

“Their souls, which will return to them once outside this dungeon. The wards in here would take hours to dispel. Now head out through the red door. It’ll take you straight to safety. You can levitate then correct?” Nodding she began heading towards the door, concentrating to carry them with her. Their wagon outside would suffice to get them home. Suddenly his dark tone echoed through the room. “Come back in a month. And bring your sister with you.” A slight itch on the back of her hand got her attention. It was the draconic symbol for connection. Her sister had the same symbol on her hand. “Now, your lives are tied to each other so be smart.” 

Walking out, she knew coming back wasn’t a choice, it was bound into her soul. “What’s your name?” She yelled back. 

“I don’t know. ..” the door shut, and they were all next to their wagons again. The door was gone and so was the dungeon entrance.",19,1750122383.0
1lcw0tu,my6yh8i,"Crystal zombies, - the undead golems you got after the actual golems decided they had enough of it and started practicing some shady magic, retreating to a a distant plain to cultivate- were being methodically disassembled by some very brazen adventurers.

Which would be just fine by him, if only they were not doing so right on top of his ceiling.

Sighing, the ancient lich that has seen the start and fall of civilization so many times he lost count, got up from his table where he was doing some cross-stitch following a convoluted pattern, and called the elevator.

It looked like he had spent way too much time going outside and familiarizing himself with the novel human forms of entertainment. That last moving picture he binged was certainly one too many. How come he had not noticed the intrusion?

Mumbling obscure words in long dead languages, he evacuated some of his current projects to a much lower level. A pity he never actually got down to learning about this CCTV stuff. He just updated the tracking spells about 70 years ago. Or was it a couple centuries? 

---

A popping sound that could only reliably designate the demise of a very large slime was not a good sign. 

As he was hastily assembling a couple of spare bones into a makeshift skeletal bodygard, the lich wondered what he had done wrong this time. He had tried filling a dungeon with intelligent creatures and fellow mages, creating a hierarchy. He gathered his students and asked them to protect the dungeon in return for some arcane knowledge. That didn't end well.

This time, he filled the dungeon with undead creatures. 55 levels bustling with slimes, skeletons, zombies of all sorts, golems made from all kinds of materials, reinforced traps, misleading labyrinths full of illusions, very aggressive plants. There was nothing worth stealing on any of the 55 levels. One had to be a madman to keep going when the only award for hard battles is some worthless bone dust.

And yet there they were, breaking down a fine oak door.

""There it is,"" a knight in shiny armor said. ""Check if there are any traps.""

""Shouldn't be any,"" a tall archer said. Why would a tall person become an archer? Wasn't it harder to hide when you're tall? ""It is the boss room, after all.""

""Ahem,"" the aforementioned boss said from behind his looming skeletal guard. Nice timing. ""You are trespassing.""

""It talks!"" - a lady covered in furs covered in runes exclaimed. ""None of the previous mobs talked!""

The room was positively becoming crowded. A healer rummaged through his table, and the lich almost hissed seeing his needles thrown on the floor.

He considered his mood. Was he in for a loud battle? No, not really. There would be all sorts of government repercussions, he would lose a ton of money and have to move to a different country. There would be the Wise Wizards On Guard shouting about conventions, regulations and broken promises, and his 112-th lawyer would freak out, just like his eleventh one.

He picked up a pile of papers from his table and cast a quick spell that made his voice loud and ominous.

""You are trespassing on a proud retiree's property. I have fought a certain Dark Lord twelve centuries ago, and for what? So a bunch of youngsters would come to demolish my house? I will have you know that my insurance company will bury you alive!""",18,1750126120.0
1ldi0dr,my9y9ge,"The mare with its silvery coat cantered unannounced up the causeway to the gate of Minlanleth. Built upon a rocky outcrop that had separated itself eons ago from the mainland, the Elven city was a symbol of wealth and prosperity. From the base of the outcrop, where dozens of holes had been expertly carved into the solid stone, sleek ships of trade and war sailed forth, each shining beautifully in the sun. They sailed to the four corners of the world, bringing back exotic goods from faraway lands. They sailed to make war upon the foes of the city, fearsome prows shaped like an eagle's beak.

Upon the back of the silvery mare was a rider, an Elf, who had dedicated his long lifespan to the collection, study, and preservation of knowledge. No tome was too archaic, no culture was too barbaric to fall beneath his notice, a sentiment not shared by many of his peers.

His arrival heralded the end of a journey of ten years and a day, travelling the breadth and width of the civilized realms. From the great steppes of the Atalam tribes, to the Kublani Empire in the west, from the castles of Charlmagnos, to the mountain fortresses of Sudlen, he had ridden back and forth, meticulously covering every village and city. The mare was draped with all manner of pouches, each bulging with a score of scrolls; all his notes from his solitary expedition.

His arrival was unexpected, but the many that recognised him followed from the gate to the palace. Their curiosity abounded, for though his departure was without fanfare, the reason was known to all. But the palace doors were shut behind him, and the curious were barred.

In the throne room, all the nobility of the city had gathered, along with all the other scholars. The High Prince, ever an imposing figure upon his raised throne, descended to embrace the returning Elf. He was fed and cared for, but before long, curiosity won out.

They all wished to hear what he had to say. For when he departed, he had sworn not to return until he had at last uncovered the truth behind the mystery. An Elven master of lore had centuries, millennia to craft his work, to hone his skills in the art of music or story or prose. Their works were beautiful, ecstatic, formed with the perfect words and verses. And yet...

And yet, it was mankind who dominated the world of song and story. For eons, Elven lore masters had returned with puzzling reports that their works received only lukewarm reception in village square and royal court, while music and tale of human bards could be found on opposite sides of the world. The puzzle had baffled the scholars as well, for the often cited explanation that mankind was primitive could not account. These human works of art had made their way to the other great races.

So it had been under this atmosphere that the lone scholar had been dispatched, and it was under this atmosphere that he was questioned eagerly.

With a resigned look on his face, he spoke to the gathering about his journey, from start to finish. Of how he found tales of courageous men among the Dwarf clans, poems of female beauty and strength among the Shadow Elves of the southern continent. He had even crept to the borders of the accursed Vermin Kingdom, and heard the loathsome sentries humming of mankind's songs.

As his tale drew to its close, he stood and presented his conclusion to the court. Perhaps mankind was indeed primitive, perhaps their works were popular only because they produced so many and so quickly, if imperfect. But, having exhaustively searched, he did not believe so.

Instead, there was something to mankind's short lives, their own mortality, that gave them a different perspective on the beauty of life. The works of the Elves were high and mighty, mourning and celebrating concepts that strayed far beyond the mind of the average being. But for the human works, there was a touch of emotion there that spoke to all, not just those who understood the ascended concepts.

""For mankind will always fall short of the impossible standard of the Elves. It is far beyond their capability, just as it is our lot to stand apart from the rest of the world's understanding. But the care they place in that which quickly fades, as only beings who also fade can do; the short but bright lives they live, that is what speaks to every soul.""",8,1750173169.0
1ld739m,my6zmjd,"Beginner Tips for Hiveminds:

Be careful which humans you decide to infest; picking two humans with strongly conflicting morals or ideals will cause you to suffer a Psychic Splintering.

High profile targets can be tempting, but understand the risks. Most will not look fondly upon a gestalt created with unwilling participants. The more socially connected and well known a target, the higher the probability of receiving unwanted attention.

Play the long game, you will remain alive so long as you have a minimum number of surviving components. Better to grow slowly, rather than risk extermination after being discovered due to growing too rapidly.

Don't ignore non-sapient hosts, they are not as useful, but can provide a good contingency if your higher functioning elements are discovered. Neural diversity can be valuable in its own right.

Avoid infesting monks, nuns, and other ascetics. Their many hours of meditation can make them formidable at resisting your influence. Once absorbed, their moral compunction combined with their will mean that taking more involuntary hosts will be much more difficult.

Time is your ally when integrating new hosts. Slowly break down the vestiges of their previous personalities and remodel them to be a better fit for your collective.

Some disaffected individuals will willingly join your collective. This can be an excellent source of hosts when your will is not yet adequate to perform a hostile takeover.

Every fledgling hivemind dreams of global hegemony. There are many instances of global conquest, but understand that these success stories suffer from survivorship bias. You will not get there by taking massive risks. Learning how to hide your true nature is perhaps the most valuable skill you can acquire.",17,1750126514.0

Like I hadn’t wished upon far away planets and mauled innocent flowers trying to foretell the fate of Aslan Hightower and myself.

“Speak now. Before it’s too late.” His eyes were wild. More wild than I’d seen them before, and his face was like a phantom in the moonlight spilling through the window. 

My eyes were red-rimmed and slumberous as I watched him furtively twist into the door.

If I had spoken that night when he had appeared in the staff quarters, one hand raking through his hair, the other fumbling with the hem of his tunic, asking me to run away with him on the eve of his wedding, I would have said yes.

Power was like a foreign beast then, whispers in the wind of faerie kings and queens. 

“I know you want this as much as I do.” He had moved closer, trying to grasp my hands with his own, but thinking better of it as a distant cot squeaked from a maid shifting in sleep. 

“Speak now.” The Priest intoned. I was motionless from the shadows in the throne room as I watched a boy fulfill his duty, read his vows and kiss his bride. My throat bobbed as the Prince’s gaze found my own. 

Wickedness is not intrinsic, even for those born in the imperial court. It is a slow malevolent evil that they breathe. They fill their lungs with its breath, and yearning for more, do not realize they are infected until it is too late. Until the day they find themselves in power, and yet utterly alone.

What the boy asking me to run hadn’t known  that day, was that the girl he asked was already infected. 

“Queen Elena.” Said the King. 

“Hm?” I cocked an eyebrow at my husband as the fete spun on in the ballroom around us. 

“What is it my dear? What troubles you?” 

As he spoke, my gaze found a vacuous expression in the crowd, the brother of the man at my side, beside a comely woman. I smiled warmly, not tearing my eyes from the man I used to know. “Not a thing.” I assured the King.

“Speak now,” he said. “Let them hear the voice of their new queen.”

1lcxidd,mya2leb,"I had just gotten to bed when someone called on the door, I grudgingly fell from my bed and slowly went to open it. What was my surprise when I saw Theodore the VII dressed in plain clothes, trembling and nervous like an abandoned puppy.

“What now Theo?” Normally I would be way more courtess, but it was extremely late, I was grumpy and I was close enough to the prince to know I wouldn’t get into trouble. “It's late, and unlike you I need to work. I have no time for whatever this is.”

I was going to straight up close the door to his face when he put his foot on the door. He looked at me in the eyes and I could see how troubled, nervous and scared he was and I knew this was serious. I opened back the door and looked around to make sure we were alone. “Come in before anyone sees us.”

I closed the door behind him as he entered, his hands on his neck, nervously scratching himself, like he would always do when he felt overwhelmed. 

“Are you ok, Theo?” I asked him while putting my hand on his shoulders. “Do you need to talk?”

Theodore took a deep breath, I could see him trying to get enough bravery for something but I didn’t figure out what until he blurted it out. “May Oakwood! I love you! Please! L-Let's run away together!”

We both kept quiet, looking at each other without moving a muscle and without telling a word. I could hear his heart beat rapidly and my own was going faster and faster too. Finally I managed to react, babbling about like an idiot.

“You… You can’t be serious…”

He took my hands and put himself on his knee. “I have never been more serious about anything else on my entire life. May, I have loved you for years, only now I dare to tell you.”

“S-Shut up.” I shaked my hand free, avoiding his eyes. I could feel myself getting flustered. “ Y-You are confused. You have doubts on your wedding because you don’t know the duquess well, and now you are mistaking your affection towards me as love.”

Theodore seemed to doubt for just a second, but then he came again, grabbing me by the shoulders. He was strong, that hurted a little.

“No… No! May I love you! I love your smile, and your eyes, and your sharp tongue, and how smart you are, and I love how you move like you were floating, and how you sing to yourself when you think nobody listens, and I love talking with you about nothing and everything for hours, and I love how cute you look when you stuff your mouth with leftovers thinking nobody will notice. I love your hair and your skin, and that rounded belly that you want to get rid off but can’t because you work so hard that you never have enough time to exercise, and I love how…”

You are always like this! Tomorrow you get married! You just went ahead and dumped all those feelings on me! And now you expect me to, what!? Take all the things I can carry, leave everything behind and just go with you to who knows where!?”

Theodore let me go, looking as if he was about to cry. “May… I… I am sorry… I didn’t…”

“I am not done!” I took him by his shirt, my arms were trembling. “Have you stopped for a second to think what would happen!? The prince fleeing with his maid the day before their wedding. What do you think people would think!? Curses Theo! Who do you think they would blame!? The wicked seductress that seduced the prince! The foolish maid that thought she had a chance with the royal blood! Why would you do this to me!? Do you hate me!? Is that it!?”

He was about to cry, he was stumbling over his words.

“N… No… May, I… I’m sorry… I don’t… I…”

“Well! I do! I hate you!” I could feel my eyes getting wet. “I hate how you keep getting into trouble for following your heart instead of your brain! I hate how you keep treating me as a friend instead of a servant! I hate how you worry about me! I hate how you keep coming to me to take things off your chest! I hate how you look and smile at me when I am working! I hate your jokes, and your stories and how you make fun of nobles of the court! I hate how you keep disguising yourself and following me when I go to the city to buy produce! I hate how useless you are when you try to help me and make an even bigger mess! I hate you calling me by my name, and I hate your body, your face and your smile! And I hate all those things because they made it so I fell in love with you!”

That is the end of this conversation."" dad says.  
My cute, ""never says no"" dad.  
""Yes. They must have made a mistake.  
You are a normal young woman."" mom says.  
I smile sadly.  
""I never said it said something about me not being normal..."" I mutter.  
Dad frowns, while mom almost starts crying.  
""What is going on, dad...mom?  
Am I really a quarter demon?"" I ask.  
They gasp.



""NEVER! YOU ARE 100% HUMAN LIKE US!"" dad slams the table.  
Mom starts crying.  
""See? You upset your mother!"" dad says, hugging mom closer.  
I sigh.

It would explain a lot about how you raised me, my schooling, and why you were so eager to get me into marine biology...spending all that time away from others..."" I say.

Mom, dad, can you please tell me how it happened?  
I know for certain grandpa, and grandma aren't demons, so how?"" I ask.  
""Lia...enough, please...  
We will talk later."" dad says, trying to comfort mother, who can't stop crying.  
I bite my lips, holding back my own tears.  
""F-fine. I will go back to my place...  
Call...call me."" I say, leaving.  
I don't look back, though their reaction already told me enough.

1lcqacm,my3mjkc,"The military was gone, police and state patrol, all replaced with a swirling black tattered wall of sand that had  formed a wall around me as soon as the soldiers, guns pointed at me, began shouting at me.

""DOWN! Down on the ground! DOWN Now!!""

Behind the soldiers, had been the scientists. In a tide of white coat wearing uniformed mass, head to toe covered in safety equipment right from the most terrifying biohorror movie, they came shouting words of their own, pulling at the advancing and armed law enforcement units behind the military advancing on me.

""NO! You must capture it ALIVE!!"", ""Don't Harm IT!!"", and ""It too important to loss!"" punctuated by the simple ""No!"" and ""Stop!!"" from many of them.

Mom was doing something similar, ""Karl, its OK. Karl."" Her voice was much softer, ""Maybe you should look at me, honey.""

I would remember moving backward, unthinking and blank. Nothing but confusion boiling in my head and the thumping of my heart in my chest and ears.

My sight was dimming but I remember what I saw and heard right before I fell into darkness. I remember it clearly as I remember the words my mother had said as I blacked out.

""Bes, PLEASE...No!!"" she pleaded looking up at something.

Now I know she was looking at the seething, black *thing* that appeared to be a wall of moving sand, black and glittering around me. Like the robe of some evil wizard spinning a dark spell on the heroes or a boneless, black school of millions of jellyfish spiraling in on dinner.

From in the darkness, from the thing Mom had called Bes, I felt the predator smile on me and those red eyes open to look at me...white cataracted pupils twitch as they focused on me.

1lcqacm,my6u8p3,"I rounded the last corner and waved to our neighbor, who was mowing his lawn.  The house was open again, so I went in by the front door.  

The second the screen door slammed behind me, my mother yelled from the kitchen, ""Did you grab the mail?""  How does she always know?  

I went back out and found the mailbox pretty full, mostly magazines, but there was quite a bit of envelopes, too.  I jogged back and went in.

Now mom was standing in the hall.  She had her hands on her hips and gave me one of her microscope looks and asked, ""Are you feeling okay?"" I wasn't. How did she know that?

""Actually, I am a little tired. Can I take a nap? I asked while holding out the mail to her. She said yes until dinner was ready and turned back to the kitchen, and I started up the stairs.

I heard, ""Wait! There's something here for you.""  I stopped, and she reached back and slid it between my fingers without looking.  I shook my head and went upstairs.  Does she have eyes on the back of her head?

I threw my bag on the floor, shut my door, and plopped on the bed.  I still had the envelope, and I was staring at it, wondering how many times I ever received mail.  Never was the correct answer.  But, I noticed it was a plain white envelope with no return address. I shrugged and opened it.

""Oh yeah,"" I said to no one.  It was a letter from the ancestry test center.  I sent in a sample, but I wasn't expecting a letter from them.  I got the test as a present for Christmas.  I  had been expecting to receive a pin number by email so I could log in to my 'results'.

The paper was also very plain.  There was a message at the top, 'Your DNA test has been processed' and also 2 brief paragraphs below.  The first was:  

This has never happened before.  We have completed over 43 million tests in the USA and over 300 million worldwide.  But, your result is inconclusive and highly unusual.  We are unable to create a profile for you. We can tell you that you have 50% human DNA and 50% unknown DNA.

50%?  I was on my feet. ""MOM?!?""  I was on the verge of hysterical.  ""Mom!!!"" I was down the stairs and frantically walking toward the kitchen.  ""Mom?""  My dad was at the table, and my mom was at the sink.  ""Did you know I took a DNA test?""  My parents glanced at each other.

""Yes honey, we know,"" said my mom while my dad stared at his watch.  

""It came back 50%, and I am freaking out.""  I sat down and stared at my Dad.  He was still looking at his watch. ""What am I supposed to think, who am I? What is going on?""  

""Honey, nothing is going on. You are you.  Everything is fine.""  My mom was sitting across from me now, and she was holding one hand, and her other hand was on my arm, ""It's going to be OK, sweetie, don't worry.""

She was so calm.  ""DONT WORRY?!?""  I was hysterical.  ""Mom!  They notified the government.  They are on the way here.  NOW, right now!!""  My parents looked at each other again.  My mom was up and out the door.  My dad told me to get ready to go.

You did. Everything was copacetic, which makes these results all the more concerning. ""According to this, we have... *DN****B****?""

Your father holds out a hand. ""Let me see those results,"" he says gruffly.

You pass him the results, as well as the *So You Have DNB* brochure the company sent. For several seconds, he reads quietly. The color drains from his face--which, apparently, can be a symptom of DNB.

""So what do we do now?"" your mother asks.

Your father tosses the results and brochure onto the chaise lounge. ""I'll tell you what we do. We call our lawyer. We sue this company for everything they're worth.""

""What even *is* DNB?"" your mother asks--a question which, to be fair, gets addressed through a series of cartoons in the brochure. ""Is it dangerous?""

Your father gazes, stymied, at the teal and gold bumper sticker of a heart--another token from the company, emblazoned with the words *DNB STRONG.*

""What do we do now, Broderick?"" Your mother takes you by the shoulders, steadying her voice. ""There must be some sort of treatment. Is there a medication we can take? What do we *do?""*

""There is a time for everything, my old friend. A heart break hurts, I know that and can only imagine the pain you are currently experiencing. However asking me, a necromancer, to revive your dead relationship is a terrible way to cope with it,"" responds the Necromancer.

""12 years, 12 long years I spent looking after her as she slowly faded. I watched day by day and month by month as the light drained from her eyes. We tried to say it wasn't inevitable, but with each passing day it became more clear. Now she's gone, and you're telling me that our last hope is futile?"" I ask.

""My good friend - I remember when you asked me the first time to revive her after she died in that hunting accident just after you were married. I gave you time with her, but there is no way to extend it any further. You knew that,"" the Necromancer says.

I turn my head, a tear washing down my eye as the reality of the situation dawns. In my heart I had known it would come to this. I knew I had only bought time, but I had refused to accept it. We had spent those years well, taking care of each other and making the most of each day. But I had been forced to watch as the Necromancer's power slowly seeped out from her veins, as she grew more tired day after day, until she was not able to get up. Until finally one morning I awoke to find her lying there, her blue eyes completely faded and her body unmoving.

As I wash away the solitary tear winding its way down my face, I manage to look at her one last time. My beautiful lady. I had given everything to gain those few good years together. I steel myself and turn back to the Necromancer, ""You can have me now, take what you are owed.""

1ld55wh,my5vld7,"It's a slow day at the office. I've been playing solitaire for the past 30 minutes. I told my boss a 2 hour task would take 4 hours, so now I have some time to go for a new high score. 

I almost get it! Record time, too. But just as I'm about to place the last king, something bursts through the window and stops in front of my desk. It's Captain Capital. Nobody has seen him since his flight with Planet Breaker. People say he's lost it since he had to put that guy down. I just figured the dude was on vacation. 

""Hey Cap,"" I start, ""what can I do for ya?""

He stares me down. ""I know what you're doing.""

Who would've thought everyone's hero would be cracking down on workplace efficiency. I guess if he's finally getting back to hero work he should start small. 

""I hear ya, Cap,"" I respond, ""I'm closing the solitaire window now."" I was distracted, I definitely lost my best time. Every eye in the office is on us and I'm just trying to deescalate before everyone's favorite hero gets me fired. 

In one quick swipe of his arm, he knocks my computer monitor off of my desk. The cords snap loose and the computer flies out the hole in the window and crashes through the building across the street. Some of my coworkers run, others watch more closely but everything around us stops. We have their full attention. 

""Don't play dumb with me planet breaker."" He begins, ""you're going to tell me how to get this blood out of my glove."" 

Yeah, this guy has completely lost it. I look at his glove and it's the usual shade of Blue, maybe the color is a little faded from excessive washing. 

""Cap, I think you might be a little confused. Have you tried the hero hotline?"" 

He doesn't seem deterred. He reaches towards my collar. I don't bother running because there would be no point in trying to stop Captain Capital. He lifts me by the shirt as my feet dangle in the air. In a blink I'm pinned to the wall that was about 40 feet away from my desk.

""Don't you dare let off a plasma blast in here"" he threatens, ""or it's gonna be worse than last time.""

That slam to the wall knocked the wind (and a little bit more) out of me. I've never had a cracked rib before but, with the pain I'm feeling, I've gotta assume I've got several. 

""Get this blood off of my glove NOW, or you're going to have more to help me clean off."" He tells me through gritted teeth.

""Have you tried oxi clean?"" I reply. He doesn't seem amused. 

""Put the man down!"" I hear from around the elevator. It's Tank of the Capital Protectors. 

Captain Capital starts murmuring to himself, ""no, not Tank. He can't see me with this blood on my glove.""

Captain Capital drops me and I land on my butt, with a lot more cushion than I would like. The Captain leaves with a sonic boom out the same window he entered. 

Tank leaves too, probably to track him down. This is the worst day of my life. I'd ask for a raise, but it doesn't matter. There's no way I'm keeping this job. I'm moving far away from Capital City.",28,1750113045.0
1lcvxg2,my5i1i2,"We had sat through almost two years of debriefs that had become repetitive after the first two months. How many different ways could we frame our theories around religious fanaticism? Whatever was motivating this guy, it was clearly the product of his own special brand of psychosis. It was important to get into the mind of a killer in order to find them. How we're supposed to do that for a guy this bizarre is beyond me.

""Let's review the facts,"" Police Chief Armando Galveston began as he always did. ""Our killer is a male, white,  approximated to be in his mid-thirties to mid-forties, and, everyone's favorite, appears to covered in tattoos of crosses. Alright people, what else do we know?""

A hand shot up in the back of the room and the ever-eager voice of one our newer recruits, Sandra Oxford, rang out, ""Our killer ritualistically removes the hearts of all of his victims. The hearts, however, are never found at the scene and we have yet to successfully recover one. All wounds inflicted are done with blades, never bullets or blunt instruments. There are typically minimal signs of struggle. Additionally, it appears the killer prefers to commit his crimes in the early morning hours.""

""Excellent, thank you Oxford,"" Chief Galveston nodded in approval. I didn't have to turn around to know Oxford was beaming over the praise.

""Alright, people,"" Chief continued. ""As you know, at approximately 7:35am yesterday we received an anonymous call about the location of a potential victim. The body was recovered in the bedroom of an apartment off of 32nd and Stern. Same methods as always, nothing new there.""

""What do we know about the victim?"" Another voice asked from the front of the room this time.

""Woman, hispanic, approximately 25 years of age. That's all we've got so far, doesn't appear to have any connections in the area, no ID, nothing.""

I can concede here and admit that this part was exceptionally interesting. If there was one thing a serial killer liked, it tended to be a degree of consistency. Hot blonde co-eds, gay guys with no family in the area, black kids,  older married women, or whatever else. Usually the victims had some sort of cohesion around the basics of their victims' identities. This guy though, he was all over the place. Race didn't matter, age didn't matter, gender didn't matter, being well connected in the area or not didn't seem to matter either.

The briefing continued and I turned my thoughts towards my beat for the day. Usually, I was riding shotgun with my partner of the last year at the wheel as we cruised through various neighborhoods and awaited calls. Today, however, I was moonlighting as a beat cop. Most of the force found it insulting to be assigned to a beat when they'd already done their time. As for me, I was known to volunteer when an extra set of boots was needed on the ground. I enjoyed getting to be in the neighborhood getting fresh air and handing out stickers to little kids peeking out from behind their parents' legs.

""That's all we've got today people,"" Chief's voice cut through my thoughts and brought me back into the briefing room. ""Get to work. Keep your eyes and ear peeled, citizens are going to be uneasy now that the news of a 23rd victim has broken.""",18,1750108807.0
1lcvxg2,my3m6ta,"I can't believe it.
I have been on a task force trying to find a horrible serial killer, we named : Cross-Man.
19 victims as of now, at least to our knowledge, all with their hearts removed.
A mother and a child that were praying for the the father's health in a church saw him.
A hulk of a man, with tattoo crosses all over his body, hence the name.
Today I found a lead.


All the victims seemingly struggled, and we found blood under their fingernails, but...
Their own blood was not right, so I digged deeper into their past.
No medical history, no issues, not even a flu shot, but!
They all visited blood banks! 
And they all were seemingly rich or extremely average.
At first I couldn't believe my conjucture, but it was quite logical.
The victims were vampires.
This made the Cross-Man a Vampire Hunter.


So I visited blood banks, older houses, and alleys where it is easy to strike.
For weeks I had nothing.
But then, two drunk young women were giggling, and making a scene in a small alley.
And I saw him.
A lean man sneaking up on them...walking on the wall!
I looked around for the Cross-Man, but I saw nothing.
The vampire was almost on the 2 women, I couldn't wait more.
So I shoot!
The vampire easily dodged it, and disappeared.
I looked around, and then down fell something.
The vampire, straddled by a humongous man wielding a scalpel?


I watch him kill the man,and take out his heart with calculated moves.
""Police! Freeze!"" I finally say.
""Bullets can't kill these bloodsuckers.
Only silver, and beheading or removing the heart works permamently.
Otherwise they revive."" he says calmly, standing up.
""You are under arrest!"" I say, as he...eats the vampire's heart, and the crosses on him light up.
""Now it is certain that he is dead, and his thralls are slowly becoming free.
I respect you guys, but my war is above your paygrade."" he says.
Before I could react he disappears.
I collapse to my knees.
""What was that?"" I mutter, as I check my bodycam.
It is on...at least...at least I got something out of this.
Dammit!
I will request leave from the taskforce.

1lcvxg2,my5n948,"I was four hours into my day when I saw the flash of crosses embossed upon pale skin. The day had been a blissful breeze up until then. The sun was shining down but the breeze kept me from sweating under the fabric of my uniform. The people on the streets were cheery and, to my elation, nobody was doing anything they shouldn't be doing. I'd even had time to pop down at the park for a round of chess my the oldies who were there day in and day out. 

Needless to say, I was entirely optimistic that my easy and ever so pleasant day wasn't going to change while in line for a cup of coffee at my favorite spot, The Bean Bag. The line was moving slow, but I didn't mind. My eyes were casually scanning the room, more to people watch than police, when I saw him. A white male, no older than thirty, covered head to toe in black clothing that didn't quite make sense on a day as lovely as this one. It was only when he reached for a lid to put over his coffee cup that his sleeve slipped back enough for me to notice the tattoos. My pulse picked up as adrenaline surged through me. The crackle of the dispatcher's voice started to come through my radio and I quickly turned it all the way down so as to not alert him to the close proximity of a cop. As soon as the lid was on, he turned to walk out the door. I immediately noticed the bags under his eyes, far more pronounced than I'd expect someone his age to have.

*Okay, Owens, don't fuck this up. Calm, casual, keep your distance but also keep your eyes on him. You know how to do this.*

I slipped out of the coffee line without ordered approximately five seconds after the door swung closed behind my guy. He was turning left and down 18th, away from the more bustling streets full of storefronts and towards the residential part of the neighborhood. I followed him down 18th for seven blocks. Nothing about him stood out as he walked, just a guy with his cup of coffee as casual as can be. No nervous ticks, no looking around, and certainly no noticing the cop on his tail. 

Finally, we approached an apartment complex and he turned into the courtyard. Lucky for me, it was ungated. If we had stopped a few blocks back, that certainly wouldn't have been the case. I took a deep breath, admittedly a bit nervous but also eager. To be the guy that found the residence of our killer who we had gotten almost nothing on? Of course I wanted that. Everybody can relate to wanting to be the hero. 

And so, knowing full well I should have called it in by now but far too fixated on not losing the guy now, I entered the courtyard. The suspect was walking up a flight of stairs towards the third and top floor. From my ground level vantage point, I watched him enter an enclosed corridor that seemed to lead towards a series of apartments in the back of the complex. Quickly and quietly, I made my way up to the top floor in pursuit. 

*Deep breath. You'll get an apartment number, you'll go downstairs to call it in, and you'll wait for the big moment.*

I felt my nerves pick up again as I made my way down the third floor corridor. At the end of it, there appeared to be another open aired and bright walk way. I was hopeful I'd see a door clicking closed behind him so I could get an official address, that I wasn't too late in my timing. It was as I stepped out of the corridor that I all but collided into the very last person I wanted to have notice me.",15,1750110392.0

The blood rushed out of my face so fast I'm surprised it didn't fall out of me and pool around my feet. I'd fucked up. So badly. Far be it from me to claim I'm some all star of the force, but this is rookie bullshit worse than a d-list casted movie could come up with.

*You should've called it in. You should've called it in. Oh my god, why the fuck didn't you call it in.*

I must've been staring in dumb shock longer than I'd thought. He tilted his head and eyed me up and down as he continued speaking.

""Owens,"" his voice was soft and a higher pitch for a man. Up close, he a solid two inches shorter than me who, admittedly, is not a terribly tall man. His dark brown hair was cut in a haphazard shoulder length shag. Definitely not done in a shop, but also not terrible for a homemade cut.

""Can I ask why you've been following me?""

The casualness of it all unsettled me. Nothing about him was sinister. In fact, he possessed the sincere air of someone you would immediately slip past small talk and into deep conversation with if he sat next to you at a bar.

""It's my duty to investigate any suspicious activity I observe,"" my voice is not as authoritative as I'd hoped it would be. I could at least be thankful that it did not quaver as I spoke.

""I see,"" he narrowed his eyes at me and took a sip from his coffee cup. ""And what probably cause have you established?""

There was no use lying. I had already made a fucking mess of the situation, might as well charge forth like the bullheaded fool I've established myself to be.

""You match the description of an at large suspect,"" I straightened my back as I spoke and placed my hands on my utility belt. If ever there was a time to be imposing, it was now.

""Thought so,"" he laughed and the spark of it reached his eyes. Needless to say, that caught me off guard. Why was he so boy-like and blase? ""Alright, fair enough. Can I just ask to show you something before you bring in the whole gang to deal with me? I think you'll find it interesting.""

Did I mention I was confused? What the hell was this guy's deal? And, how am I both terrified but at ease at the same time? He turned and inserted a key he pulled from his pocket into the first door on the right. As he opened it, he looked towards me with a beckoning gaze.

""Oh, come on,"" he laughed. ""I don't bite.""

1lcz65a,my4nmna,"From the bluff overlooking Valley Village Brad Hercule was shaken by the red jagged scars raking their way across the landscape, marring what would have been an idyllic setting.

Above him in the sky were a few small soft white clouds against a mostly blue sky and the sun was well into its descent, dusk on the way.  

Behind him were his camera man Jeb and the group of preteens that had banded together to stop what everyone in the town had called “The Incursion”.

A small town of a few thousand people calling something “The Incursion” was enough to send the reporters alarm bells ringing. On the streets of the town the wounds in the ground could be written off an “odd localized tectonic shift” like the government claimed. 

But not from this view.  It looked like claw marks.

And then there were the bodies. The gelatinous corpses that were colored like an oil slick on water with odd numbered legs, always an odd number of legs, that bent in five different places.  The main bodies of the creatures being kept in the basement of the town church were the size of a cat but their legs stretched out more than six feet in length and with the demonstration that the priest gave, were stronger than steel.

In the last ten hours Brad had seen and heard a lot of crazy things, the craziest being that it was these five kids that had stopped “The Incursion” by the aliens. Or was it cosmic beings? Or maybe they were cosmic aliens. Sci-fi stuff wasn’t Brad’s forte; he wasn’t sure what to call the creatures that had attacked this village.

Looking to Jeb, he gave the camera man the signal to begin recording.

“So, Jo, what were those creatures in the church basement?”

The girl with the short dark hair and bright green eyes reached out to her friends on either side of her and gripped their hands before looking down the barrel of the camera.

“The things in the basement are the uh, forerunners. They came first. They went all over town and they put everyone to sleep. They gave everyone the bad dreams.”

“The forerunners? They came first? What came after?”

The boy to her left with the mess blonde mop spoke, “It called itself ‘Vista’. It said it came from a place that we couldn’t co-compre- a place we wouldn’t get, a place we wouldn’t understand.”

“He understood it when we kicked his as- I mean, butt.” Were her complexion any lighter, Brad knew that the girl with the baseball cap and braces would have been visibly blushing.

“Carmen, how did you kick his butt?” Brad asked. The kids hadn’t talked about the creatures much and he didn’t want to let this opportunity be missed.

“The glob-cats, um, I mean forerunners didn’t put us to sleep. We were hanging out in the tree house and when it came for us we stood together an-“

Markus, the blind kid hadn’t talked yet but he cut in, “I seen it. I’d never seen anything before so I didn’t know that I was seeing something. I-I started to freak and everyone crowded around to check on me. When the glob-cat climbed in the window, we were all together and when it touched Shelly i-“

The girl Shelly jumped in, “It touched me and I had a bad dream. I went to where it was from. I saw all of it. I felt like I was gone for a week. When I came back no time had passed at all and the glob-cat’d fallen from the tree.”

There was a pause and the kids all looked from one to the other and everyone’s eyes settled on the girl in the middle, Jo.

“She told us what she saw. We knew we were up against somethin’ real bad. Shelly told us where they were from. What they wanted.” 

Brad felt himself leaning forward, “And what did they want? How did you stop them?”",14,1750100071.0

I think that is what sells it the most. Not the dead monsters or ruins of the town, but those eyes. No child who grew up in a normal city should have eyes that. I saw those eyes in the faces of soldiers, of survivors of warzones. You can't fake those eyes.

Or the hurt and pain that had been in their voices when they'd derailed the interview to demand answers of their own. And now there were so many questions. Because this invasion shouldn't have happened.

Four girls were kidnapped, and when GPS data had shown to of the girls phones at the Chief of Police's house, no one went to investigate. The Chief claimed he was keeping evidence it the safest place he could, his home safe.  When they'd finally looked into it, 9 days and 30 missing later, it was discovered that the phones had been in his house since the day the girls went missing.

Then there was the nasty little 'meth' epidemic that should have had the FBI called in, but not a call was made until the attack on the Linden house.

I still see the youngest kids face. he was 12, and he'd been covered in yellowing bruises. He gone after the Mayor, tiny hands punching, screaming why? Why hadn't he listened? He was promised he'd call someone and he didn't and now-

634 dead. Over 3000 injured. Hundreds of dr5ones missing, having fled into the forest. The queen was dead, but the drones were still a threat. Many biologists were afraid of spontaneous queen production. Or the possibility of hidden eggs.

All because the mayor had broken the promise to call someone in to see what the weird goop the kids had found was.",6,1750149281.0
1ld38s8,my5d7ac,"Power is relative. We all have power, for better or for worse, in aspects of our lives. Some of us exercise that power with restraint, others with abandon. Some of us hold sway over thousands or millions of souls, others over tiny fiefdoms more miniscule than our own minds. Regardless of what power one has, that power is relative.

Power is not inherently corrupting. It simply is.

However, power is irresistibly attractive to the corrupt. Those who would constantly seek to exploit others for personal gain NEED power to perform this act. Then, having attained some station that grants this power, they see an easier way. A higher, more expansive power. That power becomes their new goal, and in this the cycle perpetuates.

Of course... power is also necessary for those who would change the world for the better. For every corrupt politician or scheming billionaire, there is also a philanthropist who would exercise the same power to different, far more benevolent ends.

Why, then, is the perception that power corrupts? Because those who would be restrained by genuine morality ARE restrained. They exercise power judiciously, carefully, and with regard to those who would be harmed by their actions. Those who would abuse power will do so in its pursuit.

Of course, everything I'm describing is subjective. To one person, the exercise of power constitutes abuse and corruption. To another, it is good and considerate and just. At risk of attempting to justify evil, I'll point out a singular example:

In order to provide medical care for a town, a new highway must be built linking the town to a medical center nearby, and providing ambulances with easy access. But in doing so, the town exercises the power of eminent domain, and seizes land from a farmer. If you ask the townsperson whose life was saved by that ambulance access, then asked the farmer whose land was paved over... you would likely get two different answers when it comes to the corruption vs. purity of those who made the decision.

Still... the selfish exercise of power (the right to say ""no"" being my favorite example) can be considered good and just by every decent human being in existence. Is seeking the power to protect yourself from others selfish? Of course it is. It is a pursuit for yourself only. Is it wrong? Of course not.

The exercise of power tells you a great deal about someone's character, if you watch closely. Some people seek it selfishly, some selflessly. Neither is inherently right nor wrong. All you can do is, within the moral framework you know, judge the behavior of someone exercising power and decide for yourself.",8,1750107401.0

Cindy and Tom The news anchors are talking about the big story. 
Why are all of the members of “ Federal League “ , always scratching their crotches, when seen in public? Is this a new crime fighting signal? Maybe it is super hero code? Sources on the street say it is a weird new sex thing between super heroes. Other sources describe the scratching as side effects of contagious diseases, such as an STD. Spread by wild super hero orgies. 

Hahahahaha, I can not stop laughing. 

I get up and walk to the fridge for another bottle water. 

It is , Itching powder . That is right. 

When I weaved the garments on my special loom . I wore hazmat suits and coated the loom in itchy powder while making the crotch sections. So in every hero’s suit is custom crotch is an itchy section made just for them. 
They bring their suits to my shop for dry cleaning. 

How can a super hero stay morally good, while scratching and digging at their crotch every 5 minutes. People will begin to talk. 
Now the news is talking. Rumors are spreading. 

Maybe a source will let slip that, crabs or lice. Are going around the “Federal League “.",11,1750103490.0
1lcx3jt,my3y006,"Gregs POV:  
I was lying in my bed, looking up at the ceiling and trying to fall asleep. I say trying here because there was a Lab doing its very best to wake me and everyone in my neighborhood. And of course, this was not the first night this week; he had done this for the past three days. Throughout the night, my dog was barking.   
At first, I thought he was in pain or was sick. One trip to the vet and 300$ later, it turns out he was in perfect health.  
Maybe today I could get him to relax. I slowly got up and out of bed, and my dog immediately noticed as he was lying not 5 feet away from me at the bottom of my bed. Tonight I'm going to try to tire him out with a bit of exercise. First, I get a leash, my keys, and grab a water.  
Now here comes the problem, despite me putting the leash on him and him still screaming his woes into the night, he will not leave the house. No matter how hard I pull on his leash or try to condule him outside, he just won't move.   
With a heavy sigh and knowing I will hear about this tomorrow from either Karen or Karen's proxy, the HOA I go back to bed.  
TOMS POV:  
I stare at the street incredulously with my mouth wide open. Spectors. To put it simply, there were a lot of spectors. Throughout the entire street, spectors wondered and bumped into each other. I saw them slowly enter and creep into the house. They can barely move if there is a contagious person nearby, and they tend to avoid those areas, but all people eventually have to sleep, and like the slow, inevitable crawl of death, these uninitiated people wouldn't even know to be scared when they feel that chill on their back. Animals would, and they have surprisingly effective ways of keeping them away. A way which was being demonstrated as I could hear A dog screaming its head off trying to ward off the spectors from its home. Luckily for that hound, I would be coming to clean up these spectors soon. Unluckly for the rest of the neighborhood, it has likely been too long.

That was the year I got caught, not the years I did it.  Years.  I stopped mid 2050 after a close call.  One of the girls almost got away and I realized I wasn't good enough anymore, but I did my part.  I followed the teaching of the church, and even when they locked me away I looked out into the court and saw all the women with their hair covered and knew I'd won.

I got a life sentence per kill, but they only found 28 bodies.  

The most problematic one, from perspective, was the CEO's kid.  She hadn't gone quietly and I had to do my work slowly.  Very slowly.  When the police found her body, they knew and when her father saw her he made it his life mission to ruin mine.  

It got much harder after that.  She was my 30th, and I'd been averaging a girl a month.  My criteria was simple, if your hair was exposed, you were a target.  Just like GOD said.  I only managed a few more after that, but by then most girls were covering their hair and the ones that weren't traveling alone.

I picked a state with no death penalty, a move I thought was genius at the time.  I hate it now.  My life sentence only last 8 years.  I was shanked by the brother of a friend of a girl.  I understood why, of course.  I did things.  I closed my eyes and died knowing that GOD would be waiting for me.

I woke up 2 days later on a table in the CEO's hospital.  They had a machine that would bring you back to life, and I was the test subject.  I was reborn as 25 year old perfect version of myself.  My trick knee was fixed, so was my asthma.  The doctor said I'd live to a ripe old age of 90.  I had 27 life sentences to go, I was a patient man, then.

One issue was that I was a very devout man, so offing myself was never on the table.  And the CEO?  Richest man in the world, and he made sure no one ever talked to me.  Ever.  Every day was solitary.  When I was 92, I died again.  Sixty Eight years, and each time I was required to die of natural causes with no chance of parole.  It was 2108 and everyone I knew on the outside was dead.  Even my priest stopped writing, as did his son.  

The next four were a blur.  Life extending technology allowed me to survive longer each time, and once a lawyer came to my defense.  The said that the laws had changed, and that she could get out on a technicality.  But she didn't have her hair covered, and I sent her away.

By now the USA was the North American Union.  AI ruled the world, and crimes were less common so I was one of the few prisoners.  No one in jail got the life extending treatment, and of course mine was written into my sentence.  

Twenty two more times I died of blissful old age.  I didn't even need my bible anymore, I could recite the book backward and forward.  It was still false gospel, but it was all I had.  I was alone now, the last person in an AI jail where no one even remember my name, including me.  I was inmate, the only one.  

Eventually the AI got bored and shoved me into a solitary cell.  For most people that would have brought about insanity after a point.  I was so far beyond insane by now that it didn't matter.  

One more death and I would be released from this torment, free to finally go out and the sky but then they gave me a new drug before they locked me in here.  A rare one.  It was the year 8,923, and I'm still on my last life and not even suicide can put me down now.  

I don't even remember why I'm here.",6,1750123867.0

I rent a room, and go inside.  
I take off my black cloak, and look at Mr. Batsy, my familiar.  
I look in the mirror, to see a young woman, pink hair...barely 25...  
Is it that fearsome that I am a witch that likes the color black?  
Why is this world so messed up?



Seriously.  
It's been a year since I graduated top of my class, and my teachers told me to dress lighter, but come on!  
I thought they are joking.  
No.  
The moment they see me in my dark dresses, or black cloak, and they see Mr. Batsy, my bat familiar, they are ready to call the Church on me.  
I am a herbalist witch.  
I literally roam the continents to heal people.  
Why the hell don't they ever believe me?

I will stay 2 more days in this village."" I say.  
He nods, and I leave.  
I don't think much about what I said, as people usually are afraid of me.

  
2 weeks pass, and I am still in the village.  
Why?  
Because the blacksmith convinced everyone else that I am a good witch, and a good healer.  
That's all.  
Now, they give live rats, and some chicken to Mr. Batsy, and they seek me for even the smallest ache.  
It feels good to be accepted, but I have to leave soon.

If I can fence these goods for something worthwhile, maybe I can feed myself and my kid for a few days and take that particular worry off my back for at least a moment.  That's when I noticed their son standing behind them.  He doesn't look scared and his eyes seem to burn into my soul.  I get a flash of premonition, something like the universe has lined up in just the right way and given me a glimpse of what could happen. I see my future, and that of many more play out in my mind in a single heartbeat.  I'm astounded at the magnitude of the images and ashamed of what I've become.

Without realizing it, I've lowered my firearm, pointing it at the ground.  The parents freeze when I speak, my voice low but clear.  ""I've made a mistake.  Just go on with your night, with your son,"" I say, gesturing to the boy.  ""Keep your things.  I'll find another way to get by, something honest.  Sorry to have troubled you.""

Take the money from my wallet to get you started on a better path.""  My eyes search his face, looking for a trick, trying not to hope, but his sincerity feels genuine.  I take the cash and nod. I give my apology again and walk off, hearing the father speaking to his son about giving people a chance to do the right thing.

I'm about half a block away when I hear the gunshot.  My heart sinks and I turn back towards the direction I had come from, breaking into a cold sweat as I begin sprinting.  I hear the wail of a young boy, the deep anguish that rips at my soul.  As I turn the corner that leads into the alley, I see the family I had left, shattered by nameless greed.  My eyes harden as I see a disreputable shadow fleeing from the scene and every fiber in my body screams at me to give chase, to bring justice to this horrible event, but I find my feet rooted to the spot, unable to move.

*FEELING AROUND FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST.*

*POKING AROUND WHERE I NEEDN'T.*

I feel my head contort. The cold envelops me in its warmth... what?

*THIS IS WRONG. ALL OF THIS IS WRONG.*

The singing burn on my forehead. *IT'S JUST SWEAT.*

The dirty taste of my own blood and bile, lodged in my throat. *IT'S JUST PLAQUE.*

The searing pain of the *BULLET DRILLING THROUGH MY HEAD INCH BY INCH-*

""-listening to me? Look at me."" I feel a hand on my head, gently craning it upwards. I see a figure, so dark it's like the light curves around it. Seemingly wide enough to envelop me in all directions, but so spindly I can... see through it. ""You know what happened."" Its pallid white eyes gaze into me. I look away... but it matches my gaze anyway.

A bony, pallid finger taps me on the forehead. Where I... where I was... *fine?*

""I was shot. Right there."" I can feel my teeth shake. The whirring in my head feels... clearer. The aching, just slightly less dull.

""That you were. But I fixed you."" ""...Why? What are you?""

""Nobody important. I just enjoy fixing broken things. And you were left in quite a broken state.""

""You didn't... fix me. I can still feel it. The hole left in me. I feel... *hollow*."" ""You are simply you. I just put back everything that was already there.""

""Then why do I feel so empty?"" ""I simply put back what was there. However... some parts were too broken to put back in. I simply filled in those gaps. You can put something else in there, if you'd like.""

""What parts were too broken?""

""...Who knows? Hard to tell. But I think you'd better go find out.""

1lcr9fe,my3ifep,"Pat, George, and I needed a getaway. Pat got fired, George got dumped, and my house got burglarized all in the same month. Bonuses came at work and I decided to treat my group to a boys trip. 

After replacing my TV, microwave, couch and everything else the burglar took, my bonus left us with limited options. I was picking between a Motel 6
twenty minutes outside of Vegas and a Hostel in Tijuana when an ad came across my screen: an all inclusive resort in Louisiana that was about the same price as my other options. The ad mentioned something about ghosts, but I figured that was just something to sell to the New Orleans tourists that liked to tour haunted mansions. 

I let the friends know, Pat seemed excited. He had a little saved up and felt he needed a break before his job search started in earnest. George barely looked up from his phone, he spent most of his days staring at old pictures of him and his ex. 

Due to our financial situation, we flew Spirit. Only 4 fights broke out and only 2 involved the flight crew, so things were starting off well. We land in New Orleans and take a taxi deep into the bayou, the trees get darker and more crooked as we ride closer to the resort. Pat swears he sees something out the window. 

""I think I just saw a veiled lady on the side of the road!"" He says, ""she was dressed in all white, but I think she just disappeared into the swamp.""

""That's just Lady LaBelle,"" the driver responds, ""y'all  gonna see plenty of her staying where y'all are staying. She haunts the place.""

Pat gets visibly nervous but I give a little chuckle. The driver must like playing tricks on tourists. 

""How 'bout you George, did you see her?"" I ask our friend. 

George doesn't really answer, he lets out a big sigh eyes fixated out the window. ""Everything reminds me of her..."" he responds. 

""I know buddy,"" I tell him, ""but let's try to have some fun this weekend""

We pull up to the resort. George is the only one of us whose bag wasn't lost by the airline so the bellhop has an easy time. We get to the check-in desk and we're welcomed by a beautiful lady around our age named Lexi. I give George a soft elbow as she's listing the amenities, but he's uninterested. He continues looking through the old pictures on his phone. 

As Lexi is telling us about the spa, her eyes roll into the back of her head and her voice changes significantly. ""He left me at the altar!"" she says, before going back to normal. 

""Sorry about that,"" Lexi tells us, ""that happens here from time to time"" she then smiles and continues telling us about the amenities. 

The staff here definitely seem committed to the haunting bit.

""Who was THAT?"" George whispers to me as Lexi continues. 

I smile, glad to see George's mind off of his ex ""That's Lexi, dude. She's been talking to us for like 15 minutes""

""Not her,"" he responds, ""the veiled lady behind her that was working her mouth like a puppet!""

""You saw her too!?"" Pat whispers excitedly, ""That's the ghost I saw in the woods!""

""Dibs!"" George whispers. 

""You can have her dude,"" Pat responds, ""sounds like she's got some trust issues.""

I shake my head ""Guys, there's no such thing as ghosts. George you should ask Lexi when she's off""

""Nah dude, she's working. Nobody wants to get bugged when they're on the clock.""

Lexi finishes her rundown and gives us our room keys. I start walking to the room, but George and Pat stop for a second. 

""Pat come wingman for me, I'm gonna see if I can find Lady LaBelle"" George says.

""Yah, sounds like fun!"" Pat responds. 

I give Pat a look. 

""Look,"" Pat tells me, ""aren't you glad he doesn't have his nose in his phone?""

I sigh. 

""Just meet me at the bar, later"" I tell them. 

Later comes around. No signs of Pat or George. This boys trip is becoming a solo trip, but that's okay. I flirt with somebody poolside. I get my first massage. I see a live jazz concert by The Necroband — they were all dressed as some gnarly looking skeletons beside the conductor dressed as a witch doctor — AMAZING performance. 

The weekend ends and I meet up with my pals.

""Any luck with Lady LaBelle?"" I ask them jokingly. 

George smiles and says ""things actually went way better than expected.""

""Look,"" Pat interjects, ""I tried to tell them they were going WAY TOO FAST.""

I look at them, extremely confused.

You shrink deeper into the pile of barrels and planks, squinting at the guy in the turtleneck--as if reading his lips might somehow be easier than understanding his speech. He strokes a sculpted goatee. Says a bunch more stuff.

The man with the heavy jacket and medals and captain's hat--probably some sort of captain--nods. Says something that sounds like *queso,* but it's probably not that, based on context. Speaking of context, what if that wasn't even an SOS call just now? After all, SOS calls don't typically include vuvuzelas. The radio's gone on to play some kind of frenetic marimba music.

You may have overestimated your multicultural thieving abilities. Then again, no other liner promised such a wealthy populace, such opulence ripe for the plucking.

The woman in the mink coat and feather boa laughs. Says something about *queso.* You squint harder.

If you end a word with *-ito,* that means you're talking about something small. You remember this from a soap commercial--a small, comforting foothold in this insurmountable edifice of a language. You watch as the guy with the monocle helps himself to ceviche. You're in a room that seems less like a control room and more like a cocktail lounge, your brain scrambling for anything you recognize. Sooner or later, someone's bound to say an *-ito* word.

If this ship *is* sinking, you owe it to the passengers to save them. After all, you're a thief, not a monster. You smile at this feeling--this kinship across cultures, a wordless, familial love--and just then, your hand settles on what appears to be some kind of control panel in the wall. *EMERGENCIA,* it says in red, above a heavy-looking lever. A word you recognize! If you *are* going to steal the ship, save these people, then this lever and the corresponding instructions might be your ticket to do so. 

You squint closer, but it's Spanish all the way down.

After dying the first time, I somehow ended up in a fantasy version of the world I came from, where magic existed with the cliché rpg system.

After dying a second time, I became a ghost. You would think it's cool, but really it's not. Why? Because I need do transmutation of matter to an energy form I can use to not dissipate myself, and coincidentally the more something is valuable, the more it gives energy once converted. And of course mana cannot undergo this transformation. So I need to steal people things to not die. It's dumb but I haven't created this world.

When I first became a ghost, each time I touched something, it asked me if I wanted to do a possession, or to haunt, said object. Each time I said no. I did not want to become a chandelier, a ring or a house.

When I saw this big luxury boat, or a small ritzy cruiseship, I knew I struck gold to stay on this world for some time. I hid in the shadow of one of the guest to pass undetected in the ship. The irony that it was an exorcist...

Once the ship departed, blarring its horn as a goodbye to the other ships and to the city, I started to peek around, especially at the most pricy places, where I subtly dissolved an earring over there, the gold plating on the bracelet over here. I just needed to be cautious to not do anything on camera, else I would risk facing consequences like dying, or worse, being trapped in an object for all of eternity.

From the information I managed to gather, there will be four days overseas, before stopping at a port. I also understood that they were going to sail through pirates infested waters.

On the third day, once the shops closed, I decided to do my heist : steal all jewellery from the stores. So I became a little bit of an Arsène Lupin myself for this fun little heist.

Everything was going according to plan, when I heard the distinct sound of a canon firing, followed by the emergency sound resonating in the whole cruiseship telling everyone to go to their respective muster stations. In short the ship was under attack by some pirates. I could hear the sound of the commotion of everyone moving, and of the crew firing shots back at the pirates to make stop floating on the water.

After extremely long minutes, the speakers said that the menace was eliminated. So I stopped my heist to go to the command board. From there I could see a wooden boat sinking in the ocean. It's funny that modern and old ships both existed and were largely in use.

Then the captain said that they needed to abandon the ship as it was damaged beyond repair. I thought for an enormous amount of time - three seconds - before deciding to possess the ship, because I'm not a monster.

I touched the commands. ""Do you want to possess [cruiseship]?“ Yes.

I felt everything. The engine running, the radar pings, the hull cutting in the water, and the big gaping hole that was sinking the ship. First I moved materials from ""useless"" areas to plug the gap, then took control of the speakers.

""Dear passengers and crew members, Here is your new captain speaking. I managed to repair the ship. Nobody will need to abandon this ship. The emergency is cancelled, you can return to your occupations."" And I blocked anyone else from saying something else, as I managed to keep this ship afloat.

Then a few minutes later, I get expelled from the ship, and I'm in front of the exorcist from earlier. ""We need to talk.""",7,1750064889.0

""You know if The Cowl catches you guys, you'll be in the ICU for at least a month, right?"" I ask him. 

""Nobody's worried about The Cowl!"" He responds, ""There's so much crime going on in this town at any given moment, he'll probably be too busy to stop us.""

Tyson winks at me. I bury my face again, both palms this time. I let out a giant sigh of resignation. ""Okay Ty, just be careful.""

Two months pass and I'm visiting Tyson in the hospital, he's handcuffed to his bed, the feeling is starting to come back in his lower body, which is unfortunate because all there is to feel is pain.

When the Dark Lord had released the Abyssal Beast and the band of adventurers found themselves outmatched, Thorin was the chosen sacrifice. The rogue had stabbed him, so that his blood may lure the beast. The wizard had cast a spell to slow him down, that he might be last to never escape. And the priest had denied him healing and refused to buff him.

Then, he heard the heavy footsteps. The crunch of broken glass. Thorin groaned, and closed his eyes.

""I know it's you,"" he sputtered. ""Kill me already.""

He awaited the axe to his head. The silence hung in the air like an executioner's axe given pause from a new set of orders. When he opened his eyes, there was a hand.

The Dark Lord towered above him, one clawed hand outstretched. ""Take my hand. Or would you prefer if I left you to bleed to death as your false friends have?""

Any self-respecting hero would slap the hand away. If only Thorin had the strength to do so. Even then, he still tried to sit up, only to find himself barely rising. His friends might have laughed at his predicament, but the Dark Lord did not.

""I'm not here to gloat,"" the villain remarked. ""I'm here to give you a choice. Let me help you. Get revenge. This is my offer to all who have been wronged.""

Did he have a choice? It was either being left for dead, or taking this suspicious offer.

""Once, I was in your shoes,"" the Dark Lord spoke. ""An aspiring hero. I thought I could vanquish evil. But the worst kind of evil isn't some warlord. The true evil lies among the nobles and bureaucrats of this kingdom. They have grown old and complacent and corrupt. You see, Thorin. You either die trying to be a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain. Except, you didn't even get to be a hero before coming close to death's door. So, hero or villain, do you want a second chance to at least be someone?""

Baron Gottwold was dead at the hands of the Dark Lord's newest general Thorn, and nobody mourned him. The townsfolk would have celebrated too, if it wasn't for the fact that their local hero, the dashing rogue Jareth, was just as dead. And carved upon his forehead, a single word.

Betrayer.

The nobles panicked. They were being targeted, picked off one by one. Their personal guards either demanding higher pay, or bailing, for fear of their lives. It went from bad to worse when Duke Darrowind's private army murdered him, presented his head to the Dark Lord's general, and opened the gates for him.

Better to give the mysterious warrior who he wanted dead, than have him pillage and burn the city, they said. The Dark Lord even promised to assign someone who would improve living standards of the common folk. After all, a prosperous city can sustain an army better than a suffering one in the long run.

Mirdal the wizard and the mages of the Wizard's Tower attempted take back the city but failed. A mysterious anti-magic field had enveloped the city the moment they stepped in, and the gates closed in behind them. A trap they fell for, in their eagerness to save Darrowind City. None survived. Thorn buried them all with honors. Except one. Mirdal's corpse was left hanging by the city gates as a warning. His forehead tattooed with only one word.

Traitor.

The recently appointed head priest Feraes of the Granveld Church knew he was on a suicide mission. They'd pushed him out to negotiate a truce. One that General Thorn had no reason to humor, given his victories over several cities. The Dark Lord's armies had conquered over half the nation. His lord's army was decimated in battle. But most of all, he knew who was hiding beneath the black armor.

""Thorin, I'm sorry,"" the priest didn't have anything else to say.

""Am I supposed to go home and pretend all three of you didn't leave me behind to die? Were you expecting me to forgive and forget and cease this war?""

""Tis but a dream,"" Feraes sighed. ""I only ask that you not attack this city where I live. My offer is...my life.""

Thorn didn't hesitate. It was off with his head.

Then, the attack on Granveld would continue. Former false friends don't get to have fair deals that were honored.",52,1750043520.0

Darling turns, sees me, runs and jumps into my arms. Placing kisses all over my face. Darling purrs “Honey Bun, I missed you so much “ . 

I carry her around the room. Trying to speak, while she continues to smother me with kisses. 

“Darling, you need to stop boosting my energy levels. At least while kings and queens rule the world. “ I said. 

Darling asked “ but why honey bunny, it insures that you will always return to me alive “ 

I said “ do you notice anything? Like all of my hair is burnt off , because of that dragon. My shield is melted and fused to my arm. My sword is broken at the hilt. “

Darling smiled and said “ but then the mace absorbed all of the dragon energy and funnel that energy to you slowly, like a trickle charge. “

Each had henchmen lined up behind them, bearing gifts and trinkets galore in an attempt to entice her fancy.

The castle was the wandering castle Dracula had owned centuries prior, and was one of the many gifts her hubby had given her. Having landed in the middle of several kingdoms, they all feared the power of a being able to move mountains through the sky. Ironically it had been a simple misunderstanding as she'd travelled towards polar north rather than the true north, causing her to land a few dozen miles away from her intended destination. 

""As you can see, I'm a god amongst you. So, I warn,"" Letting forth a lightning bolt over their heads, it shot out the door and removed the mountain behind them from the scenery.

It takes a few minutes for me to reach the meeting place. The palace which now houses my corpse is build like a ring, within which a small patch of land is growing. It is that eerie place of life that I approach to converse with the lord of the dead.

He's waiting for me. He's sitting in a simple wooden chair, across a table, surrounded by trees with bark like stone and leaves the color of blood. I know not these plants, but still, I do find them quite pleasant.

**""Shall we?""** He gestures toward the second chair. Ignoring the creaks and wails of my rusted armor, I sit. He smiles softly. **""Please, do ask your questions. I know you still have some.""**

**""... Why?""** I find my voice hoarse. I wouldn't be surprised if I still had literal dirt stuck in my throat.

**""Why what, dear sir?""** Pale of skin and hair. Eyes like murky depths of the abyss. The man himself looks like a ghost, but though my oaths still should bind me, I can't force myself to hate him.

**""Why me? There surely are better candidates.""** The first night I asked him, why did he even bother with sentient undead. The second time I learnt, he had distaste for summoning recently deceased. <<Too many problems with their life affairs>>, he said. I understand then, that as a relatively ancient man of great will, I fit at least some of his requirements. But I'm sure there's more to it. 

**""Well... Sure, I could find better fighters. I'm certain the lower crypts would house some better riders, or archers... But at this point my Black Knight units are quite full of experienced warriors. They lack but one thing.""**

**""... A commander.""** He nods. I was once a paladin, a holy warrior of great renown. But centuries have passed and both my name and deity have fallen into obscurity. I myself cannot recall even the simplest prayer. And this boy, barely a sapling of a man, would have me lead his terrible host of shambling corpses.

**""The people of these lands have been forsaken by all their allies, human or divine. Many have fallen to the blights of our times: to the demons and raiders, and all manners of monstrosities. Tell me, dear sir, would it not be noble to defend such people?""** He does not seem to care that now I too would be one of the mentioned monstrosities. But the worse part is: he truly seems to believe everything he's saying to me. I cannot find even one lie throughout all of his speeches.

**""Then why waste time with me? Why won't you simply bend my mind to your will?""** If his sins are excused by doing his all to protect the weak, how could he spend all this time on a single undead who, in the end, could simply refuse him?

**""Is it a waste? I think I actually need to remind myself, that I \*do\* still have some morals. That I have some lines that I will not cross.""** He smiles a little, then shrugs. **""Besides, you all are not bound to my life. It would be quite foolish, I think, to raise an army that will slaughter the very people I swore to protect the very moment my own life burns out.""**

I can't help but have some admiration for the love he seems to have for his flock. Perhaps... joining them would not be that bad? Perhaps it could even be the right thing to do? Perhaps-

He' simply so impossibly... genuine.

You’ve learned the algorithm has a bug—it hates music in C minor. And the kazoo? It's tuned *perfectly* to disrupt its fall-detection sensors. You bring it to your lips, blast a flatulent note of defiance, and—

—**you stop falling.**

I mean, testing parachutes for a living? Is there a more dangerous, more reckless, more thrill seeking job?

It's a lot.

1lc5hw5,mxyud0f,"The office for superficial dreams & nightmares has its 8th meeting this month. I mentally roll my eyes. Seriously, is it this difficult to fill the subject line for upcoming meeting notes? Why the heck did I even get the notice?  
  
Gil's elbow hits my arm. Looking at them, they grin, wink, and gesture towards our boss.  
  
“What?” I mouth.        
A line connects to my brain.              
‘ *If I can hear and see your annoyance from here, the bossman can, too.’*

With that, they cut the line, and simultaneously, Samuel starts speaking

""Falling to death in their dreams, really, humans need to learn an escape route! 16 heart attacks last week alone!"" *Mr. Caloway's* gaze travels around the room of his best agents for spontaneous death and combustion in spontaneous mental events. Landing on me.

Of course, *idiot.*

He glares at me. *I did not ask you to join, Ty.*

*Funny, who did then,* I reply. My brother sends confusion through our bond.  
  
“Some humans are escaping quite well. We should enhance the muscle contractions!” a kid somewhere behind me yells, mumbling agreement, following throughout the room.

My brother deliberately does not look my way this time. I smirk, hiding a yawn.

Which he immediately spots, jerk.

*‘Again, you should go to sleep. You haven’t in how many days? I understand that your team wants to report first, given that you* didn’t *in the last two weeks.’* Another glare.

*‘Shut up, Mr.* Caloway.’

I can feel Sam’s mental swat before he replies out loud to the kid.     
“This is not working well enough. In case you missed it earlier, 16 deaths!” My brother glares at everyone, but me, I think. When did I close my eyes again?

*‘There was a dream block*.’ I send down the line.

My brother outright stares at me now, ‘*no, there wasn’t Tyler.’*

Confused, I return the stare as someone brushes past me, making my sleep-deprived body stumble into a random guy to the right.

“Sorry”, I mumble, though the guy doesn’t reply. Why am I so tired? I was fine before the meeting started. I can barely keep my eyes open now.

 Ahhh, my lovely partner. I look up, trying to locate him, but somehow failing. What the heck?

“I thought your brother's team was working on that already, Sir.”

The muscle responsible for stringing coherent words together screeches to a halt at the irritating voice of my ex-partner.       
I open my eyes again to everyone now staring at me. Yeah, definitely should have skipped this meeting.

“As you can see, the man is working, even now, Brek, better offer constructive feedback or I’ll send you back to toddler dreams That sounded like the same guy who just spoke. Wait. I mentally slap myself. The heck, how did I not recognize my cousin just now?

*Stop that, Tyler!’*          
Where is my partner?             
*‘Please don’t punish the kids for a brainless idiot like that.’*  
 He directs that one to my brother.  
*‘Ty, your face is white.’* I can feel him somewhere close to me. My brain, though, is not capable of tracking him. Scary.

What do you expect when I corrected five humans today? I shake my head.  
Wait, did I send that out loud? ‘T*ell me I sent that!’*

*‘Sshhhhhh, I'm coming, love’*

I shake my head *– ‘wait, what did you say? I only understood ‘shhhhhhh’.’*

Worry rings through me at that, stemming from several bonds.

Someone’s talking again.

“Just because he’s your baby brother, does not mean you can punish me for breaking up with him.” An irritated groan sounds through the room.

Note to self: dating in the same company as my brother and ex-partner can be straining.

“Can we kick him out, please?” Gil’s been wanting to do that forever.

My brother shakes his head in my direction before calling for an order and reminding my Ex of his previous labor-related misdeeds. Not like I’m capable of berating him now.

A hand on my shoulder, *He’s* now standing directly behind me. My brain's not working; I should have felt him move.

*‘I’m not trying to stress you out, babe. I’d just rather see you in bed right now until I can come to cuddle you later. I haven’t seen you in two weeks.’*

*‘He hasn’t slept during that either.’* My brother chimes in.

I give Sam the pleasure of returning the mental swat; he side steps by shifting his head to the left. How mean.

*‘How many times did you fall today, Tyler?’*  My partner sounds worried.",7,1750019414.0
1lc5hw5,mxyuktt,"‘Gosh,’ I’m so tired *‘I can’t even discern which one of the overprotective hens said that.’*

*Tyler!!*  
Ah, ups, guess I sent that one to both.

Thankfully, one of my team members, Maya, interrupts before the uncomfortable conversation can continue. It's time for my head to relax.

 “Well, technically, the falling is not the reason for the heart attacks.”

The head physician next to my brother gives her a full-on glare. My brother looks interested, though.

 Blanching, she goes on. “Still, the frequency of the falls is rising; this week's count is at 567.”

The hand on my shoulder tightens, I sigh. My eyes are more closed then open now.

*‘Ty?’*

“At least, something you’ve been doing is working. There was no death on your team's shift.” Samuel glares at my ex again.

There is a pull inside me as Derek takes over the conversation.

*‘Tyler!’*

*‘I feel’* heavy. I try to reply

“We’ve been training humans to direct their dreams, Mr Caloway's.” He glares at my ex, too. My mind blanks shortly, “… him and our other two riders have taken most of the cases successfully, if I might add.”              
  
*‘You feel what?’*           
I blink, that’s my cousin now.

The idiot life-phase to my right scoffs.

*‘So heavy.’*

An arm wraps around my side. I can smell him now.

“If he’s so great at that, I don’t see a reason for the complaint, *Sir*. Your father agreed to the bet: either he improves, or I leave."" he points at me. The room erupts in anger.

The arm tightens.

1lc5hw5,mxyuq3b,"*‘TYLER!!’*

*‘I feel so…’*

As I fall backward, a body lines up on my back, taking the full weight. Something soft brushes against my head. Worry races through several bonds.

The next thing I see is a cloud in the sky rushing past me. No, wait; I’m the one rushing.

The molasses of my head turns that thought around my brain until it settles.

Great. I roll my eyes again. Where is the human?

A scream to the left.

Ah, there. My muscles are screaming as I fly over.

I placed my hands on her body in a practiced manner to guide her through the process of waking up – no energy to teach right now.

That’s when she started fighting.

What the heck? Did she just *bite* me?! Ah crap, he’s going to see that on my body now.

Before I can release myself from her grip, we slam into the sphere, ouch.

Opening my eyes again. I am falling past a forest this time.

*‘Ty..r!’*

The following extract fails again. What's with people fighting today?  
How did the dude envision a knife in the first place?  
Jumping out of the way, the dream shatters.

Only for me to drop again. A beach this time, the waters coming closer.

Transfixed, I stare at it. There's something wrong here. I try to shake my thoughts into order.

Did someone pull me into a loop?

Falling faster now, where is the human? Looking around, I don’t spot anyone.

Aww, why? I whine inside my head. Luckily, no one can hear my sleep-deprived whines.

*‘TY…ER!!’*

Oops, maybe he can.

My head hurts, I wanna sleep. My stomach's rumbling now. Can I even throw up inside a dream?

A body slams into mine. I open my eyes. A little boy stares at me. “Are you okay, sir?”  
Great. Now I’ve scared a human child. I sigh.

“Yeah, don’t worry, kiddo.  You did really well right now, darling. Just close your eyes.”  
 I try my nicest smile.

Before doing so, he grins, small mercies, I guess.

With a bit of leftover energy, I directly wake him up. If he cries now, his parents can handle that.

Before I can crash again, arms wrap around my body. I lean backwards as everything turns dark.

The next time I open my eyes, I’m in our bed.

He’s already watching me.

“You got lucky, it’s just a severe concussion, love. Your team was not in a dream block. Someone messed with your technical devices.”

He brushes his hand over my cheek. I swallow as he draws me closer.

“Who?”

“Your father already fired everyone, your *Ex* will go to jail this time.” His voice is controlled.  
“You don’t have to be strong for me right now,” I whisper, laying my head against his chest.

He looked thinner than she remembered from the grainy photos. Older, too. He carried nothing but a folder.

They stopped ten paces apart.

“You came,” he said.

“I’m curious,” she replied. “That’s all.”

He smiled, tired. “Curiosity is a start.”

She glanced at the folder. “What’s that?”

“Proof,” he said. “Your side is preparing a chemical strike. Civilian targets. They want to end it, whatever the cost.”

Her jaw tightened. “You expect me to believe that?”

He opened the folder, showed her photos, orders, signatures. She recognized a name. Her own commander.

She reached into her coat, pulled out a flash drive. “Your side’s planning a false flag. They’ll blame us, justify a full invasion. I have the recordings.”

He nodded. “So it’s true. We’re both expendable.”

They stood in silence, the war grinding on in the distance.

“What do we do?” She said.

He looked at her, his eyes hollow. “We stop them.”

She almost laughed. “How?”

“We leak everything. Both sides.”

She hesitated. “We’ll be hunted.”

“We’re already hunted,” he said. “At least this way, it means something.”

She looked at him, searching for a lie. She saw only exhaustion. And hope.

She took a step forward. “All right. We do it together.”

He held out his hand. She stared at it, then at his face. Slowly, she took it.

The handshake was awkward, then firm. For a moment, the world was quiet.

Sirens wailed in the distance. They let go.

“Now or never,” he said. “I’ll cover you.”

She nodded. “Never took you for a hero.”

""Don't get your hopes up,"" he shoved her towards the waiting car. ""Go.""

She slid behind the wheel, heart pounding. As she sped away, Max fired behind her, buying precious seconds.

She didn’t look back.

She drove until the city fell away, until she could breathe again. Then, with trembling hands, she dialed her first contact.

1lcd34t,my09rf2,"I truly believed in my side. Patriotism motivated me to join our Intelligence Service. I did not think there could be a higher calling. They taught me how to lie, hide, and kill, and made me into a loyal, obedient weapon. I killed who they told me to kill, and I stole what they told me to steal.

But Isaw through all those years of propaganda and brainwashing. The thing I imagined, the thing to which I was truly loyal, did not exist. It was an idealization, a sort of hero worship for people whom I realized were so far from heroism as to be a comedic farce. Direct experience, direct information of how they behaved when they thought none were looking.

Disillusioned, I considered my options. I would not be allowed to retire, my services would be demanded. If they even had an inkling at how deep my cynicism had grown, I would likely have been killed in one of their fits of paranoia. I could disappear, but I would live in fear of being found to the end of my days. No, there was only one real choice. I would work for the other side, and make sure that they won. However loaded with hypocrisy, I could not imagine them being worse than the devils I knew.

I took risks to establish contact, but eventually I made it. Tacit meetings and cold drops, building trust. Finding more secrets to give them, things they almost certainly could not get anywhere else. Until, one day, a thing fell into my lap. A gathering of my side's leadership, an opportunity for a decapitation strike that would end the war.

I requested a meeting with the other side's top covert assets. People with clout, people whose opinions would have weight. It was scheduled, and I counted each hour nervously. It could be a trap, I could be about to be abducted and tortured to death. I stowed my nerves and headed to the site.

I sat down at a table in a park. There were people circulating through it, none obviously suspicious. I waited with my hands in my pockets, until a woman sat down across from me. ""I understand you had a gift for my sister?"" she said. I swallow my doubts, and take a leap of faith. From my pocket, I pull the trove of intelligence, copious notes and copies of schedules.

I don't know how to phrase what I must say in any code or subtext, ""I want to be protected in what follows. I have family I want out of the country when this goes through.""

""We take care of our own, but I must ask again about the gift, my sister looks forward to it greatly.""

With a shaking hand, I passed it to her. I offered my hand, and she shook it. It is surreal, This is the kind of intelligence that wins wars. Millions of people are dead, and it all effectively ends with some people in a park.

I go through the days, preparing myself as best I can. I continue doing what is expected of me, hiding that I know something significant is coming. It arrives as simple chaos. No one else around me knows, it is simply news of an attack. Only I know what has actually happened. 85% of the top leadership should be dead or captured.

1lbut98,mxvmjye,"I am a side-character.  
I am in a world full of anime protagonists, filled with auxiliary characters, and love interests, and rivals.  
I alone, am a side-character.  
I thought this meant that I could live a quiet life, after all, side-characters are barely the focus in a story, and give little to nothing to the narrative.  
I was wrong.  
Instead of leisurely finishing university, and doing a soul-killing 9-5 job, I am the most sought after commodity on the planet.  
ALL protagonists are trying to get me.

  
""So, I am a Harem protagonist.  
If you become the side-character of my story, I am sure one of the chicks I don't really like will bounce over to your side."" he winks at me.

Some of them even broke into my apartment, trying to entice me, blackmail me.  
Thankfully, if I don't voluntarily go and become their side-character, they can't force me.  
Why do they want me so much?  
Well, the books say that while a side-character isn't that important...  
They always have a role in the story.  
Whether to further the plot, to aid the main character at a decisive moment, or simply to allow the protagonist to shine brighter.  
Overall...  
I am like a buff to them.

1lbut98,mxzf524,"I'm not sure what the kid wants yet, though even before I cut power to the water hammer I already have a decent idea of who they are. Most folks around here are black haired and dark eyed, with the sort of clothes and face that just sort of... blur out if they're far enough away from you. Normal folks doing normal stuff. Wake at a normal hour in a normal bed, work a normal day, eat a normal dinner, take a normal bath, and then have normal dreams. 

Folks with hot pink hair don't do normal, or at least not the same normal as the great masses. This is a protagonist. Not *the* protagonist; haven't met them yet. Just *a* protagonist. A person with some manner of destiny, or goal. Lots of chosen ones (still weird having to pluralize ""one"", but that's the world we're in), but also a lot of folks who just want to be the best at something. But this is definitely a chosen one; I can tell by the fact that she's looking at me like I owe her something, and she's not holding a number. 

As for me, I fall somewhere in between. Grey haired, gray eyed. Came from a different Earth like most of the protagonists, but without a set endgame. Not mundane, but not empowered for greatness either. The 52nd best weaponsmith on the planet, though more or less entirely by virtue on having a 21st century knowledge of arms and weapon making history. I've got enough magic to make magic weapons, but because I sat down with the books and studied. But people seem to be able to smell the fact that I'm not part of some grander plan, and think it's a great idea to get me to help with theirs. 

No offense to the heroes of the world, but if my options are to help a hundred protagonists by making them an electric sword or a singing spear or to die face down in the mud so some young kid I was teaching can learn a valuable lesson about something, I'll stay in my shop. 

""Listen kid, if you want to do business, you need to go to the desk, take a number, and go over the rules with Makoto."" I say, taking the protective earmuff off one ear so I can hear their response. Ironically, Makoto herself is a protagonist; she's the 10th so far who has manned the receptionist desk on her way to some plot about being the best merchant in the land or something. Good kids, for the most part. I miss them when they go, but hey, that's the price of employing folks with a destiny. 

""Didn't you hear me?! I said the world is at stake!"" She yells, flailing her arms about and bouncing in place. Like most of these protagonists, her outfit looks more a matter of fashion than protection, but that's not really as much of a handicap out here; an arrow or a spear hitting a bare midriff seems to be about as common as winning the lottery was back home. 

""If you had taken a number and made a proper appointment, I could have met you when I wasn't operating obnoxiously loud power equipment. So no, I didn't hear you, it's not your turn to be heard, and your world-threatening peril needs to wait until I assist with the world-threatening peril of the 12 people in line ahead of you."" I say, pointing to the door that leads back to the reception area. ""Makoto can get you started on all the paperwork...""

The door to the reception area is wide open. I had that door magically enchanted by a one of my other customers as payment for a +2 vorpal sword so the sound of the work area wouldn't bother Makoto or the clients while at her desk; even in a completely different room, this gear gets loud enough to cause harm with sustained exposure. With the door open, *anyone* in the building should have heard the hammer as loud as an alarm siren, and I almost never use that door during work hours.

""Um, I don't have time for that..."" She says, putting herself between me and the door, a look on her face that speaks less of annoyance, and more of fear. ""I have an urgent quest, and I need your help to see it through! You have to join my party! It's the fate of the world!""

""And if you had talked to Makoto, she would have told you that I don't do quests. But you're here now. Let me set this gear on standby before we talk."" I say. She seems to relax a bit. Stay calm. Don't overreact. Verify first. I make a show of returning my work piece to the fire and heading over to a set of controls, fiddling with the gas flow to the fire before hitting the button that turns on the intercom. Well, that should be 'intercom'; the technology on this world hasn't gotten to that point yet, so I had another customer build a magical equivalent as payment for a tomahawk that automatically teleports to the thrower's hand after impact. 

""Well, it's about time."" She says, relaxing a bit and going into her sales pitch. I give her a few 'yeahs' and 'oh reallys' as a push the buttons on the intercom, occasionally fiddling with the gas flow with my other hand to make it look like I'm doing something work related. Somewhere between her prattling about the Dark Litch of Wherever and the brave warriors of the Who The Fuck Cares Guild who are going to foil his evil scheme, I catch a sound through the speaker, turned down low enough that the protagonist can't hear it. But I can. Once you get to know it, the sound of someone wanting to scream their head off but only being able to manage a whimper is pretty distinctive. 

Stay calm. Breathe.

""So, *now* will you stop messing around and help me?"" She asks. 

""Yeah, kiddo, I'll give you exactly what you need. Just let me turn the gas off and we can get going to meet the rest of the party. Do me a favor?"" I ask, killing the fuel and airflow to the forge and moving over to the coat rack.

""Sure."" She says, smiling.

""Pop your head out into the office and let Makoto know I'm stepping out for a bit."" 

""Um... yeah! Sure. Will do!"" She says. The moment of initial confusion isn't the sort of evidence that will hold up in court, but it's close enough for me. She turns and heads towards the open door as I reach inside one of the coats on the rack

Sometimes, folks who come to this world bring things with them. Computers, cell phones, stuff like that. I didn't receive the blessing of a goddess, or the lineage of a dead king, or anything like that. But I did get something familiar. Something special.

Spears and arrows avoid a bare midriff. 

Bullets from a 45 caliber pistol don't show the same courtesy. 

Mid stride, her legs stop working with all the grace and dignity of a puppet with it's strings cut as the first round severs her spine. By the time she lands on her knees and starts sprawling forward, rounds two and three slam higher into her back, left exposed by her very fashionable halter top plate mail. 

The blood is flowing generously from all entrance and exit wounds when I close the distance. This is the part where a villain would start gloating, or bragging, or otherwise give the hero a chance to do something productive. 'There's no way they could survive that', they say. 

I am not a villain. 

Rounds four, five, six, seven and eight go into the back of her head, and after the slide locks back I run out of the workshop and into the reception area.

Before I can even round the corner I see the pool of blood flowing out from under the desk. When I see her, she barely lifts her head, eyes unfocused. The dagger is still stuck in her chest, blood seeping slowly around it. Her lung is punctured, air being sucked in a second wound between her ribs every time she tries to breath. A third wound, in her abdomen, is bleeding fast, blood as black as death. 

Back home, she'd be as good as dead. I'd call an ambulance, get a ride to a hospital, sit in the waiting room for 8 hours to be told ""sorry, we did everything we could"", and then I would get to just live with knowing I had failed someone. 

Here? I scoop her up, take 5 steps, kick my own door open and step outside.

""**MEDIC!! I NEED A MEDIC HERE!!**"" I scream at the top of my lungs, gambling that anyone from my world would recognize those words. Ten seconds later, I've got a blue haired girl dressed like a shinto priestess telling me to set her down while she starts waving a magic stick around. Twenty seconds, and Makoto is surrounded with green energy. Thirty seconds, and the only damage left is to her clothes. 

The priestess helps me bring her inside and help her into bed. Her name is Yukio, and her presence is not a coincidence. 

She explains the situation while helping me clean up. She doesn't look much older than 17, but clearly is unfazed by the blood; probably an actual doctor or nurse back on Earth. Partway through the backstory, she stops over the pink-haired protagonists corpse.

""Um... sir? Do you know her name?"" She asks. ""Final rites generally work better if we say the deceased name.""

1lc5rlx,mxzyjtl,"Romantasy conventions have become the bane of my existence. Vampires love to walk among adoring fans willing to throw themselves at the vile creatures with thoughts of a torrid love affair with the undead. In reality, vampires were barely above rabid animals, their bloodlust uncontrollable.

Also, convention entry fees were ridiculous. $250 for the VIP package to go to some costume ball with finger foods and gaudy costumes. But I go where the prey is. It was easy for them; they could just mesmerize some poor victim into buying them a con badge. And it's not like I can file these expenses on my taxes at the end of the year.

I can't even bring weapons into these things because of security, so I had to try and find something once I made it in. Unfortunately, these conventions were usually filled with plastic swords, foam garlic, and tap water being sold as holy. Needless to say, I was going to get creative. Maybe I could break a chair and use a broken leg as a wooden stake.

My current prey was masquerading as some outcast vampire prince in the latest Booktok darling series. Tall, dark, brooding. Gen Z Dracula. You get the picture. He had eluded me at the last two conventions. He would always point me out to his adoring victims and they would swarm me while he made his escape.

The latest convention finally gave me an unexpected advantage. The costume ball was masquerade themed, which means I get to disappear into the crowd with a mask without a second glance from others in the crowd.

He was easy to spot. They always were at these things. Perfectly tailored clothes, hair that had that messy look down to an art form, a smile of perfectly white teeth with canines just long enough to let the adoring masses know who he was.

He currently had a woman hanging off his arm that was dressed as the heroine of the story. The human dying of an incurable disease that the vampire of the story falls in love with and turns to save her. I could see the glamor in her eyes. She was hooked and hooked hard. I would have to be careful with her.

I had managed to find a vendor earlier that was selling real wooden stakes. I had bought five and concealed them within my costume for the night. I slipped one into my palm as I slowly made my way around the ballroom, moving closer and closer to the vampire.

Suddenly, his head jerked almost imperceptibly. His smile never left his face, but I could see his body tense ever so slightly. He knew I was here. He might not know exactly where, but he knew.

A woman stepped in front of me. She was dressed as the heroine's best friend. Her mask couldn't hide the anger in her eyes.

""How dare you show yourself here!"" She angrily whispered as she grabbed my wrist. ""You can't stop him. Blaise hasn't turned Lunaria yet.""

I tried to pull away from her grip, but she just held on tighter. ""Lunaria is just a character in a book, you dolt!"" I angrily whispered back. ""But I assure you, that vampire is very real and will kill your friend.""

I frantically looked around. This woman had distracted me enough that the vampire was gone. And so was the woman hanging off his arm.

I finally jerked my arm free and began to quickly move through the crowd. All pretense of stealth now gone. I couldn't let this vampire take another victim.

""You can't stop destiny!"" the woman called as I left her behind. ""Their fate is written in the stars!""

""It's just a book!"" I called back to her as I left the ballroom in search of my prey.",11,1750033088.0

Clay read slowly with remarkable effort. The embroidery picture was one of three, hanging neatly above the mantlepiece. The other ones read “Live, laugh, love” and “Home, sweet home,” stitched in cheerful, flowing script.

“I get the other ones,” Clay muttered, “but wouldn’t a sword be useful even if you have a house?” He tilted his head, still staring at the embroidery. “For example, to fend off bandits, I’d suggest.”

I was a person who hated the current leadership, and have tried multiple times to overthrow it, or destroy it.  
Never have I hurt a civilian, or infrastructure true, because my power is overwhelming enough to strike directly at the pigs that think nothing of the rest of us.  
While he...  
He would protect his own killer, if he could.  
""Because we have been at it for 2 years, and we fought daily.  
You are like my best friend, and enemy, and the person who knows me best."" he smiles.  
Oh boy.  
This kid...

""Fine. What is the theme? When and where is it?  
And who is your bride?"" I ask.  
""Thank you! Thank you!

""It's ok - it's a private ceremony, using non-hero identities. I know you know my real identity, and if you didn't know I knew yours, well, now you do - Gerald.""


I raised an eyebrow. ""What makes you think I know you're secret identity? I'd definitely have taken you out in your sleep if I had that information.""


""Yeah, you've got to say that. But I'm not stupid. I can see what you're doing. Me and you, we fight. We destroy a lot of property, but somehow the Dark Phantom never does more damage than Gerald Price the trust fund baby can generously repair as a service to the city. You only ever ""risk"" civilians when I'm conveniently nearby to foil your evil plans. And a suspiciously large number of even those were trained stuntmen who just happened to be visiting for no reason they cared to mention, and happened to retire rich out of nowhere after.


""All the other villains are terrified of you. So they mostly stay away. A few get bold and try to butt in on occasion, but no villain could allow another to trespass on his turf, so you deal with them swiftly, if I don't get to them first. 


""So it's just me and you. Duking it out every couple weeks. Never quite taking advantage of each other's weaknesses. Injuries well within our respective tolerances. Always putting on a show. The giant moon laser was a nice touch - but don't think I didn't catch that you embellized from it to fund a children's hospital. Big impressive schemes that fail at the last second, or succeed but don't actually hurt much. And everyone else stays away. Best partner I've never had. So what do you say?""


I sighed. ""Alright James, you got me. Two conditions though. I'm gonna kidnap myself next Tuesday. It'd be suspicious if the Dark Phantom never went after Gerald. I need you to help with the illusion by rescuing me from myself. Standard fight, I bring out that rock you pretend to be allergic to, you go all weak, but conveniently escape it at the last second, I run down a hole, etc etc, then you rescue me from the underground cell. Also, the kids at that children's hospital would really appreciate a visit from Captain Awesome - would you mind dropping by?""


""Wait,"" James asked, ""you knew I was pretending with the pyrite?"" 


""Obviously, I'm not stupid either. What kind of hero is allergic to a rock? Come on."" I stuck out my hand. ""So do we have a deal?"" 


James grasped my hand and shook it. ""Deal. Also, Captain Awesome is a stupid name, so at some point he should lose a fight to you and retire. Raise your notoriety even further. Then you can help me come up with something less stupid for the next hero identity.""

""It's my day off. Get out of here,"" I said into my microphone. He jumped, at first startled. Then saw the camera. He gave it a thums-up, then immediately charged into my base. I groaned. I couldn't be bothered that day, soI let him bypass my security systems without incident. Once he found me, we fought, as was customary between us. It was clear neither of us were actually feeling it, though. We both stopped it in a draw, over as soon as it began.   
  
""I told you to go away,"" I said coldly. 

""I'm here on business, actually. Serious . . . serious business."" 

""All the more reason -""

""Just hear me out, please."" 

""Fine."" I sighed. ""But I can't take you seriously in that stupid costume, nor can you take me seriously, either. Let's both take them off. I'll get us something to drink, too. What do you fancy?"" 

""Er . . . I dunno? A mimosa, I guess."" 

""I should have the stuff for that. Hold on."" A few minutes later, and I set up a table in my secret base with some snacks and drinks, and both of us were in our normal civilian attire. He leaned forward in his chair. 

""I came here because I had to tell you something."" 

""Yes, you said serious business. Did someone die?"" 

""What? No!"" Silence passed between us. 

""In that case, I'm confused,"" I said. 

""I came here . . . to give you this."" He blushed and handed me a . . . wedding invitation?

""What's this?"" 

""I think you know."" 

""I just wanted you to say it."" I looked down at the table. ""You know I'll have to decline."" 

""But you're not just any old guest! I want you to be my maid of honor! Or is it best woman?"" 

""Best woman, I think. And in that case, I have to decline even more so.""

...Yum, this is pretty good. Could you pass the salt, Ladybrand? Oh, it’s time? I was in the middle of- ok, whatever. *Ahem*!

Greetings, puny humans. And Venusian. Yes, I know you’re an alien, Man-Human. Doxxed, HAHA! Anyway, it’s monolog- er, speech time. I’m the best man , everyone has to shut up and finally listen to me speak. Put down your drinks, I’m talking. Seriously.

I WILL TELEPORT A SHIT INTO THE PUNCH BOWL. Now, if anyone interrupts again I’ll de-alcohol the champagne, and necromatize the chicken nuggets. *Ahe-hem.*

I knew uh, what’s the name again? Whatever. I knew Musclebro since he was just a sidekick. At thirty-three! Haha, I was like, ""Never seen a sidekick with a 'stache before!"" and he was like ""You live with your mother."" I do NOT live with my mum! I am born of an eldritch goddess from beyond the veil of your consciousness, and I just HAPPEN to have an idol representation of her in my evil lair, which is used in diabolical rituals and curses beyond your very imagination!

Aaanyway. His hero got caught in my death laser ray project and got buzzaped. So then I decided to let the sorry sack go and- oh, don't look at me like that, I had twenty magi-ninjabots waiting to go if you so much as tickled me. And I'm telling the story, sit down, groom.

Where was I? Ah yes. I let Musclebro drag his pathetic, squirming, tight, sweaty biceps out of there, and next thing I know, I'm a Nemesis! Talk about a career jump. And I know however many two-bit villains you put away, or how many bodybuilding competitions your oh so defined, chiseled, bulging... body... uh, wins, you can never forget the one who gave you your tragic backstory. So really, I gave Pleasantville Musclebro. Three cheers to me: The Techno-Mage of The Great Beyond! Hip hip... hm. Tough crowd today, huh?

""That's exactly my point. You don't have to say anything if I'm not there. And he's not the only one we'd have to worry about.""

""Don't call us whelps human! We are fully grown dragons. The mightiest of beings. Cease your arrogance at once"" one dragon roars. The green scales make it clear to me that is a Veracia variant. 

I put on a mocking grin. ""Ohh a superior being you are? You know. The one hundred brethren of yours I've slaughtered said something similar. So why are you here? Need some help?""

The Dragon sputtered at my perceived insolence. I truly hate these arrogant lizards. ""We are here so you may answer for your crimes murderer."" The Dragon starts. 

""And what may those crimes be? Ohh great superior being?"" I interrupt him. The mockery not fading from my voice.

""The murder of countless dragons of course!"" The dragon roared ""You have killed Lord Vermont the leader of the Verdant Dragon tribe!"".

""Do you know why I killed Vermont?"" I ask of the Dragon calmly. Letting my killing intent flow out of me. Crushing down on the dragon who seems to fight not to flee.

""How should I know the reasoning you lesser races have? It was probably just for the glory of having killed a mighty dragon. Are you proud of having slain such a powerful being with your underhanded tricks?""

""Ha"" I laugh without humor at first, but then something drives me to continue. ""Hahahaha. Is that what you think?"" I point my sword at the dragon speaker. ""Verdant has used magic to induce nightmares and trauma into tens of thousands of people in the city of Jarn. The people went mad and ripped each other apart. It lead to the deaths of 95,643 people and left thousands of traumatised orphans.""

The dragons start muttering. I don't let them. I point my sword at the the group of red dragons to my left. ""Riscia was very proud of her scarlet color. She took baths to keep it always bright. How do you think did she manage that? She bathed in blood. She particularily liked to bath in the blood of children. You are smart, how many children do you think it takes to fill a bath for a 30 meters long dragon?""

The dragons are silent now. I point my sword at the black dragons. They flinch as I do so. ""Heron, Priscalla and Urami were big fans research. Particularily, they liked researching biology. They unleashed a designed plague on the Haven Empire. The plague spread through the entire empire killing 5,643,954 people directly. Furthermore it caused a civil war in the Haven Empire, resulting in its breakup and several wars with the surrounding nations. The total casulties went into the tens of millions, even I not able to track them anymore.""

I lower my sword and instead adress them all. My voice reverberating across the entire area ""This is why I killed your kin. Your tribal leaders. For they were monsters, every single one of them."" I lower my killing intend a bit. ""You however, you are not monsters. Not yet. You are simple whelps. You however have a choice. You may fight me and thus end the Dragons for good."" 

Some look angry at that and want to say something. I supress them with my killing intend. They are just beasts in the end and are thus cowed like beasts. Thus I continue speaking, with more force.

""Or you may accept the errors of your past and become a part of society. Use your perceived superiority for the good of everyone. Don't repeat the errors of your ancestors. Swear an oath of peace now or die to my hand. But know this, I will always be there. Always be watching!""

1lc4sh1,mxypae8,"She slumbered. Far beneath the rising countries above, she resided in a domain belonging solely to her. A cavern lined with molten rock, heat choking to those unprepared. The trail was twisting and treacherous, making all but the bravest or foolhardy turn around.

Yet those who passed it would find her home. A pile of treasures, looted from dozens of long dead civilisations. Much was gold, yet gemstones and works of art were included within. The fortunes she held would cripple a country should they be spent poorly, or save uncountable masses if spent wisely. Yet she chose to sleep on it instead, supporting her shockingly small form.

Indeed, the beast of legends was still larger than a human. But she was small enough to only just fill a decent sized room herself. Her purple scales gleamed atop her hoard, amethysts looking to be fallen scales littering around her.

Geleyhru huffed, rising from her dreams. A pale pink eye opened, gazing down at the entrance to her lair. A pair of Elves stared up at her, wearing lightweight white robes sewn with flames. One bowed his head, as the other stayed in the entryway. ""Wise one, I return to enact our pledge.""

The dragon huffed, unmoving as her voice echoed around her. ""Your pledge is foolish, as I have said. Yet I shall not stop you. Take my blood, and use it in your work. Yet I hope it shall fail.""

The Elf raised his head, watching a small vial filled with crimson fly towards him. His hands reached out almost reverently, cradling it to his chest the moment he grasped it. ""I shall not, Great one. You shall not be alone much longer.""

She watched him go, saying nothing to his back. Yet she knew what would come from this. The damage caused, the lives lost. But it was not hers to stop. The fates were cruel in this way. Even if she refused to help, they would find another way. The decision couldn't be stopped.

It was no visitor that told her of the outcome. Instead ot was a message, appearing from midair before her. Geleyhru opened her eye, staying where she was as the letter rose to her. Her pupil narrowed to focus on it, as smoke curled from her nostrils.

**Lady of Scales,**

**Your kin are here, and they are burning our cities. Slaughtering our people. We ask you to protect us, as you swore in the Draconic Accords.**

**Chamber of Unity.**

It was short, but it didn't need to be long. She huffed, finally rising from her bed of gold. The pair of Elves had done it, creating eggs from her blood. The specifics didn't matter to her, all that did was the result.

They were young. Weak but numerous. She could easily defeat them, as belittled her title as the last dragon. It was her battle to lose, and the reason she went this path.

1lc4sh1,mxzxeq8,"Dragons were long-thought extinct. Opportunists hunted them for treasure, adventurers hunted them for glory, knights hunted them to protect their kingdoms. At the turn of the modern age — where swords were traded in for rifles, soothsayers were less trusted than computers, and sorcery was illegalized in most civilized states — dragons were thought to have been gone around the same time as leprechauns. As formidable as the beasts were, they were no match for the ambitions of ancient man. 

Decades ago, a dragon was discovered alive. The scarlet scaled beast was the size of a 747, and it exhaled smoke and flames as it snored. A spelunker discovered its cave. The cave-diver was familiar enough with ancient tales to know not to wake the beast or disturb its treasure. He simply exited carefully and alerted the proper authorities. 

The discovery sent the world into a frenzy. Scientists believed that this dragon's slumber had started a millennium ago, when dragons would have been considered endangered by today's standards. Some wanted to end the species right there. Others wanted to send armies to guard the cave. One group of conservationists had another plan. 

The Children of the  Forest, an NGO mostly descended from the druids of old, rallied to declare the cave a protected site. Humans, dwarvres, elves, and all sentient species would be kept away and the last dragon would be left to sleep in peace. Their cries of support convinced a world that had long forgotten the carnage dragon attacks often brought. Even the most fearful were put at ease when governments agreed to store any shiny currency away from population centers. 

As the year passed, fear dwindled and the dragon became a niche interest. Merchandise was made. The dragon had plushies, t-shirts, fan art, figurines, and even theme parks made in its likeness. Streamers would try to get as close as they could to the cave before chickening out or getting caught by the authorities. Scientists were allowed to set up a camera in the cave that constantly monitored the dragon's slumber. Every toss of turn made headlines and the constant stream would hardly ever fall below 1 million views. Many even hoped for the dragon's awakening and bet money on the year. 

It was clear that there was money to be made in the dragon market. A crafty opportunist, a young orc named Kromp, noticed a detached scale when watching the stream. It had been there for ages, long before the stream had started. The dragon had tossed and turned enough over its sleep that the scale was far enough to be collected without disturbing it. He knew if he could get his hands on it, he could somehow turn it into enough money to move his family out of the Orclands. So Kromp saved his coins and hired an illegal sorcerer to get him into the cave unnoticed. It was simple enough, a teleportation and invisibility spell did the trick. The scale was gone and the heist went flawlessly. 

Headlines were made, but that worked to the orc's advantage. The scale was wanted by collectors, ancient healers, weapons manufacturers, researchers, and even national governments. Dragon scales had a variety of ancient uses, but the supply ran out soon after dragons had disappeared. Kromp did not try to sell to any government, he believed they would have tried to arrest him for illegal magic and confiscate the scale without paying him. Their bounties were far below the prize offered from ForLife. This research company, the for-profit arm of Children of the Forest, was offering the GDP of a moderately-sized country for the scale. Kromp delivered it to them, and lived a happily-ever-after on a small private island.

ForLife, however, found a way to further genetic research, fund their conservation efforts, and (in spite of the hesitations of their ancestors) bring back dragons once and for all. They used the DNA from the scale to clone Dragon Eggs and sold them to collectors. ForLife shot to the top of the stock ticker. Many people were hesitant about the legality, but at the price point they were sold for, ForLife's targeted collectors basically MADE the laws of their countries. This was a fun novelty, but fast-forward a few years and the dragons hatched. Fast-forward a decade and the dragon's grew large enough to eat their masters. A few more decades, and dragon shelters were as common as bomb shelters and dragon attacks were as common as devastating earthquakes. 

The dragon population was saved. All attempts at domestication failed, and the dragon in the cave continued to sleep on his pile of treasure.",5,1750032659.0

Cardinal let out a soft sigh as he entered the little sleeping girl’s mind. Dammed angles always interfering. The place ,like all sleeping minds was a chaotic mess of broken mirrors floating in a white void. Each mirror displayed a memory or a thought. 

Cardinal materialised a piece of meat out of nowhere and took an animalistic bite out of it while he looked around the mindscape as if he was checking out a nice room before landing on a floating glass piece. He peered into it ,it was red signifying rage normally he would have liked to see the show but he needed to find a joyful one to take control before she woke up. He could still get control of the mind if a person became lucid but that would be powerful enough to bring the Angles to him again. 

Cardinal pushed against the mirror to another one ,floating trough the ethereal space before turning his body around to land on another piece. Taking another bite out of his meal he looked at what he stood. 

Another one of rage ,this time the memory materialised before he could move on to the next one. It was a classroom ,covered with the red hue of the mirror ,the child’s eyes were locked on to the teacher ,handing her a paper. Cardinal was surprised ,a memory this prominent of rage over some school thing ?

And again he pushed the mirror away ,landing on to a third one. Red again. He let out a frustrated broad ,throwing the piece of meat letting it dissolve into nothingness 

”God dammit ,again?” He screamed to the ever expanding sky before seeing a shard with a blue glint.. Joy 

He lunged at the shard ,gripping on to it and looking inside. 

The eyes were in a backyard garden ,a squirrel squirmed in her child sized hands. Her free hand picked up a small stone while her thumb opened it’s mouth.

Cardinal arched up his eye brows “wow ,well I am probably going to see this kid back home one day” he said with a slight smirk ,reaching out his hand to the memory. The image swirled and distorted before producing a blue tendril that reached to him too. before she awoke 

“your in my mind” a childish voice rang

The mindscape started sifting into whatever her conscious mind was ,the personification of her mind.. it would be normal right 

“well let’s see if this is normal cardinal“ 

In an instants change cardinal froze ,not out of what control she had.

1lboo0v,mxumeai,"You know, sometimes when Fate plays tricks on you, you can play tricks back on it.  
I have been ""blessed"", with ""Unprofitable Future Sight"".  
This means that I can see the future, give prophecies, but when I do, Fate twists it so that everyone benefits but me.  
I get it that it must be a balancing act, for such a power, but it's not a problem.  
I have 2 ways to make it so I can eventually profit from my prophecies.  
And both of them require almost nothing from my side.  
So this is what I did.

  
I prophesied for free, talking about Fate, and Causality.  
Some gave me money on the spot, others, considering they were down on their luck, and I helped them reach higher heights, paid me when they hit it big.  
This was one of the methods.  
Sure, I depend on the good will and the personality of the individual I help, but usually, when they see that my Future Sight is real, they start to believe in Fate, and Causality as well.  
So they come back, to repay me, less somehow I can mess with what they gained.  
It's a good method, but not as good as the other.  
The other while it takes longer, it makes sure I will profit from my prophecies.

  
I travel the world, and check on simple people with good ideas, and on geniuses.  
And then I help them find the certain path to Greatness.  
Right now, I have been doing this for a decade, and quite a few diseases have been cured, the plastic from oceans is 30% gone, which is a lot, and pollution is to an all-time low.  
Food is abundant, and healthy, and healthcare, and public safety are well-maintained.  
How?  
Because some geniuses knew where to look, instead of fumbling in the dark, and because some kind people with good ideas knew what path will lead where they want to arrive.  
And through all this...  
I profit.

  
Not directly, for these people while haven't forgotten me, they aren't rich, nor are they believers of Causality.  
They saw my ""prophecy"" as guesswork, and advice from someone wiser.  
Nonetheless, I profit by proxy.  
If I were to fall ill, I can be certain there is a cure, my food, my water, my air is cleaner.  
My expenses are lower, and overall I can enjoy life more than before.  
This is the way, even if it is slightly long winded.  
Nonetheless, I have some prophecies out there, that will usher in a completely new age.  
An age of glory, and space travel, and through that...  
I will reach the stars, and see what else I can do, to further improve my life.  
I have my limits, and I can profit directly from my powers, but honestly...  
It makes me feel better, as I am not burdened by the idea of ""I could do more"".  
This is perfect as it is, and I am content with how I can use it.",91,1749957089.0

Fate's a bitch.

People hear it, hell, they say it, but they don't know what it truly means to have fate loathe you, or want to mess around with you.

I'm not sure when it started happening, but one day I started to sorta read the future. I follow a golden thread with my eyes and can see written in gold what's gonna happen. 'Course, being the smart ass I am i tried to take advantage of what I read right away. And Fate didn't like that. So Fate put a twist on it things. A twist that has everyone but me benefiting.

So I got more creative. If Fate is intent on me not profiting, then I'd make others profit and I reap the benefits. Hey if folks are happy then I'm happy. It ain't always about money, it's about making people genuinely happy to be around ya. And if they pay for a meal here and there or ask their parents to give me a special discount, who am I to reject it?

Course Fate was pissed, but that's the game we play. I can't say I hate it.

Though, this is the fifth time I've had to save Chelsey.

""Thanks again Seamas,"" she said.

""Not a problem,"" I said, maybe a bit to eagerly as I stared at the blade of a saw that nearly hit her. ""But, are you sure, you aren't magnet or somethin'?""

""Oh ha ha,"" she mocked, ""but it is pretty disturbing that all these things keep happening.""

""Hey, I just saw that shit happen, you okay, Chels?"" Jimbob asked and I had to hide frown.

""Oh I'm fine, Jimmy,"" she said in a sweet tone.

""Oh! And ah, and hows about you Saemas?"" he asked, almost as an after thought.

""Oh you know me, big guy, it'll take two bulls to put me down,"" I said ignoring the small part of me that wanted to make a wise crack at the guy.

He nodded and directed his attention back to Chelsey. I'm not gonna lie, I like her. Really liked her. And it looks like Jimbob did too. And judging by the way she looked at him where big doughy eyes and how she twirled her hair, she liked him to.

Fate knew.

It mocked me.

""Watcha gonna do now?"" it taunted. It knew I wouldn't get between the big man and the girl of my dreams, no matter how much I wanted to. I liked them both too much for that. And there was no way I was benefiting from this either. Fate wasn't some static thing we all can't comprehend. Fate can be petty and vindictive, and Fate can learn and refine it's approach.

Fate can really be a bitch sometimes.",23,1749961575.0

I cursed a bit, but then continued sewing, a bit angry about pricking myself.

When I finished the shirt, I was happy.
It was a good one, then I noticed the sleeve was a bit loose.
I tried to get the needle through it, but...it was stuck?

Two: the military will solve this for me, IF I become a military gear supplier.

Villain Bob crosses arms over chest leans back against the wall, “Damn straight Skippy. I opened a clinic, which I upgraded to a hospital. I was healing all comers, rich and poor. Most people that did not have money paid on the barter system. Bringing goods, food stuffs, cooked food, providing personal services. I got so much food, I opened a soup kitchen for the needy. I had so many people volunteer their time to prepare food and different people to serve food, then a third crew to clean up.” 

The Hero Miss Marvelous looking at Villain Bob in different light now asks, “ so how did you become Villain #1???” 

Villain Bob walks over to a coffee pot on a table, take two mugs off a tray. “Would you like a coffee Miss Marvelous? “  Villain Bob pours rich black coffee into 2 cups of, then offered one to Miss Marvelous. 

Villain Bob begins “ at first a city inspector arrives at the hospital, notice the soup kitchen. He just began inspecting everything, saying I did not apply for nor was I approved for permits , to build, operate, run, store, house, feed humans, blah blah blah. “ 
“So I got really mad , and mutated him into a giant toad. He is still here eating any and all bugs that would come near the portable shitter. “ 
“Yes yes I know but it was easier to hire a company to setup perform maintenance portable shitters , then to get plumbers and work permits to fix public water and sewage lines. “. 

Miss Marvelous asks “so you are Villain Bob “ 

Villain Bob holds up a hand, “ the Doctors and Nurses , the medical board, found out from the city and county that I was performing free healing with out any license or formal training. They hired lawyers, tired to drag me to court.  “
Pause sipping coffee.
“Again I got mad mutated the lawyers into blood sucking leaches. They are a vital function of our free blood bank. “

Miss Marvelous raised eyebrows at this? 

“Of course police and sheriff deputies were soon to arrive. But I remained calm. Fixed each and everyone health problem. They went away saying they had more important criminal matters. “ 
“Then the pharmaceutical companies tried taking me to federal court saying that I was not Approved by any kind of government inspectors .” 
“Bunch of Federal agents from federal agencies arrived in black SUVs.  Blocking the portable shitters, crowding the lobby and soup kitchen, and they drank all the coffee.  So I mutated them into field mice, and they ran around for hours being chased by the feral cats that live here. “

Villain Bob smiled “not even, I bought the two hotels across the street. They were quite run down. But from the money I took from the federal reserve bank. I was able to renovate both hotels, as free volunteer/ employee housing. Of course no building permits, no city taxes paid. The mayor came down here asking me to stop being difficult.

They always talk for so long. “Your point?” I interrupted, just trying to get through this confrontation. 

“You’d be invaluable as a medical professional; there’s no way you’d have been thrown away, and there’s no record of you in any medical database, or any at all until a few weeks ago, you chose this!” They also never seem able to make simple observations.

“W-what?” their voice shook, the sort of fear you only her from concerned loved ones, after the worst kind of news, clearly present in their voice.

“From treatable, very treatable ailments, how many people do you think have died, during our talk?” Their face shifted, seeming more confused than the mother of a child gone, after “treating” them with essential oils and literature.

“I’d assume one, at most; like, who doesn’t just go to a doctor, when they’re sick?” it’s not hard to spot a rich kid, from their actions, but it’s even easier to spot a dumb one, from their words.

“234.”

“…”

“Two-hundred and thirty-four people have died, in the last six minutes of us speaking, and I know that to be fact. More than half of them were children.”

“Th-th-that’s… how!?” Their guard still stood, and for good reason, if what they knew of me was true, I’d already have killed them before they could see me. Their hands flexed unconsciously, on their shield, seemingly from the shock. “You did that-“

“No, you did that.”

“No! I don’t give world leaders and health company executives cancer or tumors! I don’t kill kids!!”

“I don’t kill the kids, those world leaders and insurance companies do, and that’s pretty common knowledge. Those kids who couldn’t find help for their illnesses? It was because they couldn’t afford it. The reason they couldn’t afford it, those governments who keep them poor. You stand with the problem.” 

“That… that doesn’t answer my question!”

“My name, Orcus, was given by you people, and so was another, Thanatos. Now, I am known as the god of peaceful death-“

“So you are the one who killed all those people!”

“No…” I ignored their accusation, continuing on with my story, “and I take pride in that title, but it is not as you might think, at first. I bring peaceful death, by keeping you from seeing the river, until you are ready. Or, I brought… after your people forsook ours, all those thousands of years ago, we were forbidden from interfering, and such organizations took advantage.”

“I’m done here,” then spoke the child, before leaping to take my breath once again, “and so are you!”

""When I first awakened my power,"" the aforementioned villain explained, ""I wanted to do more than give people scales and claws. It had such precision, I could excise inoperable brain tumors without disrupting synapses, down to the risk factors and even the genome. And I did. Years of chemotherapy that may not have worked, averted with just a touch and a few minutes. New kidneys, stronger hearts, reconnected nerves - I felt like an angel, or a lesser contemporary of Asclepius², but I remained humble.""


The doctor then gestured to a contract - one that Ergogene realized was a criminal assassination contract with the signature of a Paragon Initiative benefactor from the medical sector.


""The rich,"" Dr. Therian added, ""especially the ones who control the best medical options for hefty sums, wouldn't hear of me anyway. No matter who said I was only defending myself when I ossified the bones in their limbs, rich men have the best lawyers with the worst morals. I guess I always knew... which is why nobody ever knew I could alter biology at moderate range under stress until that court date.""


Ergogene remembered that day. He had been there when Dr. Therian - until then known as Professor Serqet³ - shut down the optic and auditory nerves of everyone in the court for an hour. He still had minor ommetaphobia⁴, and a memory of the sensation of an officer accidentally shooting him, followed by the tingle of Dr. Therian healing the wounds.


""I knew they would brand me a criminal,"" the doctor said. ""So did Faerland⁵. I didn't even need to call in the favor she owed me for healing her wounds from the Devil's Circus⁶ - she called in every favor she could to set me up with a lair and a connection to people who wouldn't mind more ""exotic"" alterations and a side job.""


Ergogene shuddered as he remembered all of that - the sensation of Faerland's power, the chaos of the Devil's Circus, the outright dragon he had to fight just to reach Dr. Therian - and said, ""And you even managed to create a business of mutating people temporarily with benign viral serums.""


The two stood in silence, before Ergogene said, ""We both know I can't just leave.""


""Of course,"" Dr. Therian agreed. ""Why do you think there's a ""throwing hatch"" on the ceiling and a pair of demi-ants behind you?""


Ergogene barely had time to react before he was tossed - yeeted, even - through a tube with a carbo-titanium aperture door by a pair of ant mutants.

I stare at her, feeling my jaw go slack as that explanation sinks in. Seriously? This is why? This is why she’s been hurting all these people? I expected something more.. Reasonable but edgy, like ‘no one ever looked at me when I was helpful’ or ‘healing someone only helps until they get sick again, mutating them is permanent’. Something from a classic hero-villain story, which is what I thought we were in. What is this, a drama?

“Why would you start hurting people, then? Instead of just leaving them alone?”

“Because if I had just disappeared, people would know I was forced out of the scene.” She hurried to a desk pushed up into the corner and began rummaging through papers and letters. I should have grabbed her right then and there, but for some reason, I was intrigued to know more. “Read this cease and desist letter.”

I pulled a piece of paper covered in legal jargon and signatures out of the half-ripped envelope. I didn’t want to read the whole thing–I wouldn’t have understood it anyway–but one part, circled in red, echoed loud and clear.

***“As of August 1st, 20XX, STEPHANIE SORTA is not permitted to perform any medical practice in any way under…”***

“Your name is Stephanie *Sorta*?”

“Fake name. That’s besides the point. But, they didn’t just tell me to stop doing my work because the people liked me more. In court, they forged evidence of me mutating people with my powers, just like you see now!”

She motioned towards all of the liquid-filled vats lining the walls, each of them containing an unstable specimen, a victim of her actions. Disgusting. I knew that, even if what she was saying was true, she couldn’t be forgiven for all the harm she’s done. But maybe I had a little chat with the mayor due.

“Before,” she continued, “I owned a medical clinic. It was the best in town. You probably went to it once. But then people started being a little *too* healthy. They didn’t need insurance or predatory pensions when all they needed to do was head to the local clinic to get fixed right up for almost nothing. Big businesses started slowly losing their money, and they couldn’t take it. So they took me to court for “medical malpractice,” forged evidence of me using my powers for evil, and forced me to stop, otherwise I’d face jail time.”

She began to pace the room, her boots crunching over broken glass. She seemed more upset now thinking about how the elite had wronged her than she’d ever been when I sabotaged her plans.

“And when the people started getting angry that my clinic had been closed, showing up to the mayor and the governor’s homes and the insurance companies, here comes the governor, knocking at my door. He told me that I’d better make a fool of myself and make it seem like I’ve been a villain all along, so people don’t start liking me. He’s behind pretty much all of this. Who do you think keeps bailing me out of jail? …At least I’m making medical discoveries with this.”

My disgust was immeasurable. I was torn between patting her on the back, arresting her again, or maybe using my powers on the real villains in town. “That’s unacceptable,” I muttered, unsure what else to say. She scoffed and stopped pacing, turning towards me. Her eyes held a venom that, for once, wasn’t aimed at me.

There’s no comparison to suddenly gaining three limbs. It would not be the same as taking three away, which is all I can think to compare it to, and badly because I’ve never lost a limb. It feels a little like being clairvoyant, possessing the sixth sense. I tug at my hair and allow the babbling stream of curses to topple freely out of my mouth. Is this better than cancer?

There’s a knock. How polite. I love when they do that, as if it’s a teenager's bedroom. 

“Uh!” Fittingly, I furl my wings behind my back about as extra-conspicuously as a teenager hiding a too-big bong. “W—wait I—”

“Is everything okay in there?” 

“I don’t know.”

The doctor opens the door, confused, worried.

I smile awkwardly, face red. “Ah hi.” 

He relaxes for one second, assessing me as fine. And then he sees the issue. Maybe it’s because my smile isn’t alluring enough, or because it’s too sharp–toothed and the horn-like growths on my head form a natural path for his eyes to reach the wings folded behind me. Either way he drops the icepack and the clipboard both. His back meets the closed door. “Oh dear.” He says, straightening his glasses with both hands as though crookedness can manifest devil wings. Well maybe moral crookedness can.

But I consider myself a pretty moral person. “Hey. don’t run I just… Well I don’t know what I just did… is this like a thing that happens? Like how some people look kind of like neanderthals… I know dinosaurs are a lot further back evolutionarily but maybe it’s like a recessive gene or something… I feel like I would’ve heard it in the news or– or some sort of buzzfeed article if people could just sprout wings– but you tell me.

“Well… you’re an oncologist. You see  unprecedented all of the time…”

“I–Id–I don’t think this is cancer.” He clarifies.

I nod. I sort of expected that, but it’s always good to hear a professional opinion. “So?” I stretch out my wings for further observation and he shuts his eyes with a flinch.

1lbs61c,mxvktko,"They told us to hold the refinery.

They didn’t say for how long— just handed us two charge packs, a ration bar, and pointed toward the smoke. By the time we got there, the sky was black with ash, and the ground stank of promethium and blood. I found cover behind (what I thought was) the leftover burnt-out shell of a tank. 

My lasgun felt too light in my hands. I kept checking the charge, even though I already knew it was full. It wouldn’t matter anyways. The thing was a joke of a weapon even among us. In a world filled with 8-foot tall super humans, ravenous bugs, and the greenskins who just loved fighting... there were also us.

*The Astra Militarum.*

We numbered in the countless billions spread out across endless strategic points to protect and defend the *Imperium of Man*. Our life expectancy numbered in the seconds once the fighting began. I was fortunate enough to have survived my first two battles, but the situation unfolding before us this time... it felt like the reaper had finally come to punch my ticket.

Orks; Greenskins as they were called among us, were roaring toward us. We might be able to hold the refinery against the mindless savagery of the nids, but Orks? Orks were something entirely different. I had only heard stories about them; never faced them. 

Word was they were built for war by the Old Ones and then outlived them. They existed now as gods who didn't know they were gods. 

They charged into battle with weapons that shouldn't work. They called them ""Shootas"" or ""Choppas"" that only fired properly because the Orks wielding them *believed* they should. Orks literally had some kind of mindfield that made their beliefs into reality.

An Ork war boss once ordered his men to repaint all their wartrukks red, because, “Red wunz go fasta.” One trukk, painted in a particularly vibrant crimson, actually *broke the sound barrier*, despite being made entirely of rusted scrap, powered by a squig on a wheel, and lacking anything resembling an engine.

There was a tale once of a regiment of guardsmen running out of ammo against an Ork horde. So, the commander had the genius idea of ordering his men to lift their guns and make shooting noises aimed toward the enemy. The Orks, believing they were actually being shot at, were torn to pieces by the incoming fire.

I sighed. ""We're really expected to hold against these monsters?"" I asked out loud. ""They're a fucking circus.""

Next to me, Larn was humming again. Not a tune, but just noise. He did that when he was scared, though he’d never admit it. I never called him on it either. We'd both survived all three of our first battles alongside one another. We knew in our hearts the time would come to say goodbye to one another, but we'd never voiced it. He sat fiddling with his knife next to my knee, stoic as ever.

“You ever think about home?” I asked. I hoped I could calm his nerves and maybe my own too. Two birds, one stone.

“Which one?” he asked, not looking up at me.

Fair question. Although we'd only seen war thrice now, we had been shipped around to different stations and bastions for years. Some we stayed months, some merely hours.

“You think they’ll send backup?” he asked. ""Against the Orks?""

“No,” I answered, regretting it instantly. He was probably looking for some sort of reassurance from me, and I went and dashed his hopes.

“Figured,"" he sighed. ""Just wanted to hear it out loud I guess.”

There was a long lull that hung in the air; the kind that could stretch forever if I let it.

“You scared?” he asked before I could break the silence.

I didn’t answer. 

I didn’t *need* to. 

My fingers were trembling on the grip of my lasgun, and my mouth was completely dry, evident whenever I spoke. He knew damn well I was scared, but it wasn’t dying that scared me. I was scared of what came before it. The ripping, the screaming. The thought of vanishing in a place no one would remember, snapped in half by the greenskins.

Just another corpse in the mud that nobody would regard. No grave, no nothing. The only one to carry my memory would probably die just as soon.

The whistle blew: three sharp blasts. My attention tightened, and adrenaline rushed through me.

Larn stood up with a huff. “Welp,” he muttered, cocking his lasgun. “Time to die screaming, I guess. You with me?”

My knees didn’t want to work. I had to force myself forward, but I *did* follow him. Not for glory. Not for the Emperor. I didn’t even think it was about orders anymore.

We charged because if we didn’t, the other would have died alone.

And as the Orks crested the ridge, roaring and slobbering with butcher’s knives and scrap-metal guns, I let loose a war cry.

If death was coming, I’d rather face it loud than silent.

1lbjlt8,mxtvhf4,"John noticed changes when his family first moved away from the bustling city to a quaint fishing town.

It was the small things at first. Like a prolonged unblinking stare from his wife. His kids seemed to be bigger eyes that bulged a little too much when they got excited. He tried to dismiss it as weird stuff he was imagining after a long, tiring day at work.

Then, the whisperings began. They spoke in bizarre tongues John didn’t comprehend. Always at night, always behind his back. As the weeks passed, they grew more brazen, casually conversing in what was probably ancient languages in front of him.

This weekend, John was going to ask questions. He squatted behind the family sofa, having come back earlier from a basketball game with friends. But without telling his wife and kids, who went to the beach.

When they stepped into the house, his wife peeled off her skin. She had a zipper behind the neck where she pulled. The monster beneath was a dark, worm-shaped mass of tentacles and eyes, which then hung the skin like it was a jacket on the clothes hanger. The children did the same, all revealing themselves to be as beastly as their mother.

John didn’t dare breathe a word.

""Honey?"" The largest monster, which had worn his wife's skin, called out to him. ""Are you home?""

He tried reaching out for his son's baseball bat, leaning against a wall near the sofa. Could he bring himself to strike them? Did he still want to have this conversation? And would they rip his skin off and let one of their own wear his skin?

""John, we have been meaning to tell you for quite some time,"" the wife-monster said. ""From that time, you started wooing me. When you said you did not mind that I had kids from a previous marriage. We... we were never humans in the first place. You married a shoggoth.""

Trying to ignore her words, John tried to crawl quietly towards the door. As she, it, whatever that shoggoth thing was, headed to their bedroom to look for him. The kids had floated into their rooms. Now was a good time to open the main door, run, and never look back at these abominations.

But he froze.

What if he had been in love with these monsters all along? Did knowing what they were beneath their disguises changed their personalities? She didn't sound like she was going to devour him or skin him alive. But what if it was all a convincing trap?

""Honey? Please don't be scared,"" the shoggoth had turned to face John. It tried to extend a tentacle to pat him on the shoulder in a reassuring manner. ""We would never hurt you. We love you as you have loved us.""

""Why reveal yourselves now? You did not do all these weird, creepy shit when we lived in New York.""

""We were concerned about freaking people out. But here, in Innsmouth, where supernatural beings live openly among mortals, we don't have to hide.""

""No wonder you chose this place,"" he said. ""If we went with Boston, you wouldn't be peeling off that human disguise, right?""

""Perhaps.""

Was that a tinge of sadness, John wondered. Could this creature be such a convincing actress, or did it genuinely love him?

""Would you still love us now that you know?"" She pleaded. ""We have not changed as people. Our appearances are different, but we are still who we are. Our personalities remain the same. Our love remains the same.""

John sighed. ""I don't know...""

""But you did say you would love me if I were a worm...""",95,1749946809.0

""Thud, that says, *FIRE DRILL.""*

Behind Thud, a gaggle of first-year imps giggled. The brute clenched his fists. ""Let me see that spellbook.""

Silence.

By now, the whole lunch room was watching--including Impina, the cheerleader from Andrew's Divinations course. Heat rose to his face.

*""FIRE DRILL!""* Thud cried again, this time doing a weird thing with his eyebrows. He hopped from one leg to another. Mimed drilling into Arnold's head with an imaginary drill.

Arnold, who volunteered as a tutor in the school's Remedial Reading and Encantations Center, felt a pang of pity. After all, Thud had shown up for countless tutoring sessions--always in disguise, always slinking, cowering. Our hero held out a hand. ""Hey, Thuddeus,"" he said gently, ""I actually know some really cool conjuring spells. If you want, I could show you how to--""

1lbfvvm,mxtfdlj,"Mana gathered at his fingertip, form a ball that grew denser and denser. Soon enough it appeared to the naked eye, a speck of burning red. A look of concentration was set on his face, as he made it stronger and stronger.

His hand began to shake, as it threatened to break free. With a cry he let it loose, flying through the air towards the waiting mage. The mage who widened their eyes, before raising a hand. ""Control Flames.""

It erupted around them, the Fireball released. Its destructive power was incredible, the air crackling from the heat. Stones below charred and smoked, a few weeds turned to ash in an instant. Yet the flames left the mage untouched, curling around them. It vanished as they lowered their hand, smiling. ""Sloppy.""

The boy frowned, pulling in power again. ""What?!""

The mage shook their head, long earrings jingling as they did so. ""That spell was sloppy. It took you far too long to shape it. It lacked intent. The construct would have fallen apart if you aimed any further. The only thing it had going for it was strength, but even that was lacking.""

Rage coloured his expression. ""I'm a dragon-blood! Don't you look down at me!""

It earned him a sigh. The mage pointed a finger to his side, their voice soft. ""This is what a Fireball should look like.""

A bead of red shot from his finger, appearing and moving in an instant. It left behind a tiny streak of superheated air, before it hit the ground. A low roar heralded its consuming flames, hungrily clawing at all it could. A wave of heat washed from it, making the boy breathless for a time.

The mage looked back at him, lowering their hand. ""That is what you are trying to achieve. Strength is useless without intelligence to back it up. You want to be powerful? You need to learn.""

His gathering mana dissipated, as his eyes widened. ""You... you're strong!""

They chuckled. ""Not as strong as some. But smarter in many ways. So, are you still going to ignore my offer to teach you? Or do you want to see just how much better you can be?""

The boy clenched his fist. ""Teach me then!""

It earned another laugh. ""Very well, Margren. But you will have to do as I say.""

Margren gave a nod, a very serious nod. ""Yes Archmage. I will.""

The Archmage smiled to themself. This was good. Very good for them. Maybe this one would be sensible enough to finish their training, and not rely too much on their own inflated self importance. If not, at least they could charge a few more mana crystals before their inevitable demise.",33,1749941039.0
1lbfvvm,mxvjcmi,"""FIREBALL!""

The bright blue softball sized orb twisted and streaked out from the boys hand, slamming into the end of the range and blinking into a brilliant white-blue lotus of rolling flame. A muffled *thump* hit them nigh fifty feet away as the teachers mouth hung open.

""YEAAAAH OH YEAH!"" The intolerable little shit jumped up and down, finger gunning the air as heat waves radiated from his horns and hair. 

Haxgneel studied the damage at the end of the range before he quietly incanted force, smashing the stupid boy to the ground. 

""That. Wasn't. A. FIREBALL!"" He spoke slowly.

""Whatever wizznerd! Huge ball of fire! FIREBALL!"" The boy pointed, entire body shaking under the pressure, barely self aware enough to know whatever he had produced was certainly *not* a classical fireball. 

Haxgneel proceeded to hop on top of the boy, all 30 pounds of archmage might, fairy dragon of gold, lecturing in his tiny voice at a mile a minute. ""Unfocused! You couldn't even form a bead!""
""No way you could wordless cast that one day""
""Bright blue and fired on a curve""
""Flower shaped, what, why even-""
""Undependable with no magical structure""
""No even radius""
""Energy wasted as sound not concussive force""

The machine gun of frustration continued for a full minute as a minor illusion of fireballs magical structure danced in front of the boys face, then the image of... Whatever he had achieved was, all the while the pressure continued to increase, creating snow angel into the coarse sand of the blast range beneath them. 

He settled into a daze, retreating into his happy place until finally, he realized it was silent. 

Two glowing fairy dragon eyes were inches from his nose. Quietly pondering. 

""You know. It was actually quite genius for a first attempt kid.""

""Come on. I'll help you codify your... blue fire explosion flower thing, as you memorize fireballs spell structure...

1lbmnbk,mxu1cco,"For the purposes of this writing prompt, I’m assuming that they meant the house was under construction and had just been finished two months ago. I have no idea what a “construction house” is supposed to be. Also…I tried. Hopefully it doesn’t suck.

There wasn’t any chai and cookies to give to the several men in Ghostbusters uniforms, rummaging through Shiva’s house. Not that Shiva would’ve given them chai even if they had some.

He watched them with a frown, crossed arms, and rapidly tapping his foot as they ran around his new home in Halloween costumes. He watched as they waved beeping devices in his living room. He watched as they rummaged through his cabinets. He watched with something less than awe.

Shiva could only hope that the neighbors wouldn’t see this nonsense. Just the kind of bad first impression to ruin his domestic life in his first home. His “wife”, a term he used loosely, was conversing with them. Mathula had the right half of her hair in a sloppy bun while the left side fell loose. How she managed to do that, he’ll never know. Henna tattoos trailed down both her arms, emphasizing the color of each nail. Every one was a different color of the rainbow, including her toenails. His “wife” was going over all the men’s supposed “findings” as if they were saying anything other than nonsense.

It was clear that this was an issue for the police, not voodoo scammers. How much had she paid them? All they needed was a well placed cop, and their problems would be solved. Though how much of this was true was up for debate. Mathula was the one to see the intruder.

It wasn’t an unusual night, and until proven otherwise, he’d continue to believe that. Mathula always filled their bed with her exhausting musings such as, “the stars aren’t aligning” and, “there’s bad energy in the air”. It’s best to leave her to her devices in those moments. Or at least, that’s what’s best for his sanity.

It was the strategy employed every night. Leave her alone to do whatever she did. And that night, was apparently screaming. A lot of it. “There’s a woman downstairs!” she bolted into the bedroom, “Call the police!” He’d barely opened his eyes when Mathula yanked him out of bed, shivering like it was winter.

With no better options, Shiva armed himself with their little lamp and hoped the woman would run off. As he crept down the stairs that night, he tried listening for a sound or anything to tell where the intruder would be. There was nothing. He steeled himself for a fight and jumped down, roaring like a wild animal, just to find no one. Despite searching the house, Shiva never saw a thing.

His “wife” continued to obsess over floor plans with the head Ghostbuster, ensuring everything was checked.

Shiva let out a short grunt and walked up to the lead man, trying to vacuum his floor. What else was that device supposed to be? “So chief,” he tried giving the kind of face his dad used to give when he got a B. “You find the ghost?”

His “wife” gave him such an unpleasant expression, and Shiva sighed and put on the world’s worst smile. “After all, you’re the professional.”

“No,” the man replied in a similarly short tone. He had a southern accent from a state Shiva didn’t care to place. The man had an unkempt long scraggly beard with hair to match. He had a single monocle hanging down his neck and a red bandana around his head and forearm. Mr voodoo looked at Mathula, “There’s bad energy here, but it ain’t no ghost. No demon either.”

“Have you ever found one?”

The look the man gave was something else. “I do my job just fine.”

“I’m sure you do.”

Shiva’s “wife” moved to his side, and he felt a pressure on his foot. Mathula kept talking to the man as normal, but a glance down showed her trying to stomp on his toes. It wasn’t particularly painful, however, which probably wasn’t the intention.

“It’s…odd,” bandana boy said. “Real odd. Can’t say what’s goin on here, but it’s something. For now, I’d recommend lighting candles at night. None of that scented bullshit from Walmart. You get a good local boy to make one. Make it unscented.” He pulled out a purple card with an eyeball in the middle. “Here’s my card if you need me again.” He gave Shiva another look, “Might need it.”

“Uh huh.”

When the men left, his wife turned on him. “The hell was that!?” Her face was as pleasant as the day they got married, though he figured his was probably the same that day.

“Don’t pay people like that to look through our stuff.”

“They were helping!”

“Seems like they were scamming to me,” Shiva walked into the kitchen to collect ingredients for Mathula’s favorite meal. Hopefully, it would make the night easier. Food was always her greatest weakness.

""There was a woman in our home!"" she yanked the bag of dried chillis away from him.

“Are you sure yo-”

“I saw her!” fists began crumpling the bag.

Shiva grabbed those forming fists. “Ok,” he carefully removed the bag from her grip, “I believe you. But they’re gone now.”

His “wife” shook her head. She stomped off, searching every nook and cranny of the house again. Every cabinet was opened, every corner thoroughly searched, hell, even the throw pillows were checked. Though what she expected to find was beyond him. Shiva only continued to cook. Maybe rasam would satiate her. Exactly how her mom used to make it.

The search eventually ended with Mathula collapsing on the couch, muttering no, and trembling. She took several glances in all directions.

Shiva huffed, put the stove on low heat, and walked over to hug her. She melted into those arms. This was unusual for them, but in the spirit of an ancient friendship, why not? “There’s no one here,” he rubbed her back in slow motions, “We’re safe”.

Mathula nodded and wrapped those arms around his neck. “Why can’t it always be like this?” she buried her face in his chest.

Why indeed. “I’m making rasam.”

Her face brightened, and she smirked, “At least you’re good for something.”

He gave a light snort. “We’ll make pulusu tomorrow.”

The grin grew wider, and she leaned into his chest and told him she loved him. He said it back, but wasn’t quite sure if either of them had told the truth at that moment. Or at least, it wasn’t the truth in the way their parents had wanted.

They ate after, and while she was hesitant to go to bed, she eventually agreed after the two of them had personally checked every lock in the house.

...

Shiva woke up to use the restroom.

1lb7ntz,mxraszz,"It all started when one single necromancer decided that the best way to avoid being hunted down by holy paladins was to be a paladin too. He had served the God of Death well. His god had admired his creative proposal.

And so, with a hearty laugh, the God of Death pronounced his favourite necromancer his chosen champion. His official paladin.

That gave the Holy Inquisition a headache. It had taken them many years to unite the various denominations. To have all factions of the holy gods agree for their paladins never to persecute each other when there was evil out there. To do away with infighting. The law was that paladin should not attack paladin.

Worse of all, that necromancer wouldn't shut up about how this worked in his favour. Nobody wanted to ask questions. Most feared breaking an old law, or offending the God of Death, even if he wasn't among the pantheon that governed the Holy Inquisition.

Now, every forbidden magic school had rebranded their students as ""paladins"". Gods of darkness and chaos, deities of bloodshed and damnation all jumped into appointing ""paladins"" like it was an undying multiversal meme. Even cultists made self-appointed paladins. Those who contracted with demons, prayed to eldritch monstrosities, they called themselves paladins. And demanded to be protected by the law that forbade paladins fighting each other.

""I'm a paladin too, hence you should call off this hunt,"" the octopoid creature in black robes frowned and waggled a tentacle. ""Inform other paladins, monster hunters, and god slayers to cease their attempts on my life.""

""Who said you're a paladin?"" The commanding officer from the Holy Inquisition bellowed, his sword still trained at the entity's face.

""I appointed myself as a paladin,"" the eldritch being flashed his crudely fashioned ""paladin badge"", which amounted to a crayon drawing of an octopus with a helmet on cardboard. ""If the other gods of dark magic and forbidden spells can elect paladins, surely I can assign the role of paladin to those within my church. Churches can have paladins, and I am the god who presides over the Church of Innsmouth.""

The Inquisition Officer sighed, ""Nobody said a god can nominate himself as a paladin. Much less the Eldritch God of Madness. Lord Elvari, you're not a paladin just because you said so.""

""Nobody said a god could not nominate himself as a paladin. There's always a first for everything,"" he had this smug grin, sustained by the belief his idea was totally genius. ""Look, do I not qualify? I protect and bless my townsfolks, eliminate dangerous monsters that pose a legitimate threat to my meatbags...sorry, humans. Isn't that what paladins do?""

""The gods of the Holy Inquisition will not approve of this. All these unorthodox false paladins will be disregarded in a potential revision of the Inquisition's laws. The practice of forbidden knowledge and eldritch powers you possess will still be banned. The Holy Church will not permit this insanity to continue.""

""Ah, but I will allow this madness,"" Elvari laughed. ""For that is my domain.""

Elvari figured this ""paladin thingy"" looked like fun. The other thing is he's trying to peacefully exist in Innsmouth (well besides taking out the odd disrespecting Fae), so if he took out the entire Holy Inquisition and their church, it is an act of war that will rile up other pantheons and allies of the Inquisition.

Death massaged his cloaked temples in exhaustion. ""Richard, please,"" he said. ""You've come back fifty-eight times. Give it up.""

A compulsive gambler by trade, Richie bristled at the words *give it up.* He hitched up his slacks. ""When you said it would be worse than the previous times--was that, like, for sure?""

""Yes! Richard, how many times do I have to tell you--""

""What's the over-under on the next time being better, maybe?""

""It will not be better.""

*""Right...""* Richie said, making a mortal expression Death had learn to recognize as *winking.* Richie pulled out his wallet. ""Let's make this interesting, shall we?""

Death massaged the spectral void where the bridge of his nose would be. ""Richard, I'm running out of ways to kill you. You've come back so many times, and I've had to make each death worse and worse. I've had to bend the fabric of spacetime just to inflict more suffering. Do you understand? Do you know what your recklessness has done to the cosmos?""

Richie thought about this. A grin spread over his face. ""Sounds like I'm due,"" he said, jabbing Death on the arm. He held out what Death recognized as a handful of sweaty singles. ""All in.""

""Due? What do you mean *due?* There is no *due,* Richard!""

Richie slipped the bills into Death's cloak pocket. Patted them, as if making sure they were secure.

""Richard,"" Death said gently--for his bone-heart ached on behalf of this man, this creature of compulsion. At the same time, he felt a strange respect, admiration for one so totally enthralled by life that he would choose it again and again. ""The afterlife is beautiful. Your whole family's there. Don't you want to stick around? Please stick around, Richard.""

For a moment, Richie was silent. He stroked his soul patch in thought.

""Fifty-eight times,"" Death added. ""You've already hit the jackpot, my friend.""

Richie, however, had already removed and handed over his Timex and polo shirt, a handful of loose change.

1lb90qj,mxqxk2c,"Death had taken many forms over the ages. I guess the novelty of showing up with a grinning skull and a pale scythe tended to wear off, especially when it came to repeat offenders. He did prefer the human side of appearances, though a friend of mine once saw him as a mute, watchful wolf. Across all my deaths, he's appeared as elderly and child alike; the former grave and the latter with a mischievous sense of adventure.

It hardly mattered which form he took. It didn't make it hurt any less.

Talk about deals with the devil. I wouldn't say the deaths became more painful. After all, is being crushed by a falling shipping container more painful than a three year battle with cancer? They only became more drawn out, more lingering, to the point where every waking moment was spent begging for an end. 

To be perfectly honest, I never expected to be burned at the stake. Especially not in the year 2412. Not that anyone else was keeping count, of course. Most people though it was year 200. After a while, the ever-evolving cultures that rushed past me with the march of years had a tendency to blend together in my mind. Makes it surprisingly easy to slip up.

I recognized Death immediately. He was an old friend by this point, though he'd picked a particularly stylish form this time. A hunter in green with a immaculate goatee and a bow slung across his back, pushing through the baying crowd. They barely paid him any heed, even when he climbed up the pile of oil-soaked wood with deft hands and light feet.

""Here we go again."" I gave him a grin that did not betray the fear in my stomach.

He snorted. ""I had hoped being mauled by a bear would be enough for you. But at this point, I can't tell if you're trying my patience or desperate to impress me.""

Shrugging was not easy with the ropes strapping me to the stake.

""Either way, you're more crazy than the Judge gives you credit.""

""I'll take that as a compliment. He doesn't usually underestimate people.""

""People don't usually last this long.""

A flaming brand appeared over the heads of the crowd, moving in the hand of my executioner.

""So, are we going to end this farce? Or will I have to think up something especially agonizing next time?""

""I'm sure your creativity will not disappoint.""

He was shaking his head as he hopped down from the scaffold and slipped back into the mob. I couldn't watch him go for long. The torch had arrived, parting the crowd with fire, like the trenches of the Catabatec Wars, so long ago. Before any of these people were born, before their parents, grandparents. Their ancestors fought wars and lived lives they could hardly imagine, and did not remember.

As flame touched the wood, a flutter of movement and a flash of green caught my eye from the top of the tower. Death crouched on the battlements, arrow on the string, reading for the shot of precision. Never a second early, never a second late. His timing was always perfect. And I should know.

Ever aware, his hands on the scales of life and death, he gave a sly smile and a curt nod. Was it a nod of respect? A smile in challenge?

“I am afraid I cannot tell you. I can only see your life until the point of death. There is nothing past this point until you have made your choice. To leave or to continue. Only you can set your path.”

“What about her? Why isn't she here? What did she pick?”

“She has not yet had to make her choice. Her time does not end here. She has many years ahead of her”

“How? She can't survive this. There's, there's so much blood. Too much blood. Are you saying someone manages to help her? To save her?”

“In a way. Someone will find her before she passes, but they will be unable to make her whole again. Her body, her mind. Hers will be a life of suffering. Of pain and loss. She is one of the few I pity their existence”

“You have to help her, you can't let that happen. She doesn't deserve that.”

“I cannot. I am unable to cross the veil”

“If I take the deal, how does it work? Where and when do I go back?”

I stepped through the gate and made my way to the desk and said, ""Good Mor-umm...not sure what  time it is...Hello.""

""Yes, it's now, sit. What is it you are requesting?"" I don't think the clerk was human but looked human-ish.  Had I seen him before?  He seemed familiar or reminded me of someone I knew or a pet, maybe? He, or it, never looked up and was typing furiously on the keyboard in front of him.

""I would like the prime deal...er...please?"" 

He stopped typing.  ""Again!?!"" he said abruptly and head still down, completely froze in place.  He took a breath, looked up, and asked, ""Do you know how many deaths already?""

Again?  Did he say again?  I had to think, I was expecting him to ask why?  The answer is none or zero, then I realized I said it in my head, so I repeated it out loud.

""I heard you the first time.""  He took off his glasses and stood at the same time.  He stepped in front of the desk and leaned back into it. He crossed his arms and looked right at me with strange colored eyes, then said, ""It's been nine times, NINE times, you don't remember me?""

""No, I don't think so."" Still the same feeling was there, and he looked iritated with me.  

""Do you remember how you died?""  He had stressed on the word how when he asked this and then made his way back around the desk and put his hands on the back of the chair while standing behind it.

I knew this.  I looked over at the picture on the wall just behind him and recalled the memory, ""I was camping with my family, and we were cooking over a campfire.  I asked my wife to grab me some cooking oil for the grate.  We had left it in the sun all day so it was very warm when she handed it to me and when I went to open it, it sprayed all over me and the fire.  The bottle slipped out of my hand and into the fire.  It caused the fire to flare, so I caught on fire.  I immediately ran away from the fire and dropped to the ground, and started rolling around to put it out.  I think I was doing OK but then I fell.""  I looked back at him, and he was still looking at me, so I continued,  ""You see we were camped near the edge of a very large and deep ravine, and I fell into it.  I think I broke every bone in my body by the time I landed, but I survived.  The next thing I remember was the sun coming up and being in extreme pain.  I started feeling all these bugs crawling on me, I think they were eating me.  The sun grew very hot as the day wore on and caused my skin to burn even more, and then bigger animals started to eat me, I probably smelled like cooked ham.""  I chuckled a bit at this and looked back at the picture.  ""I remember a big bird taking one of my eyes and then a wolf tearing at my throat and then I was here.""  I looked back at him and said, ""It was a horrible and excruciating death.""

""And you want to go back again?"" He put both hands up as he said this.

""Yes, yes I would.""

He stood there for a second and then he let both arms just drop heavily to his sides and he shook his head.  He sighed and said, ""This isn't right, wait here.""  He turned and walked to the corner of the room and went through a door marked, 'Officium Defunctorum'. 

I heard muffled talking that got increasingly louder and then there was roaring sound and a bang then a slight tremor crept by.

The door in the corner opened and he stepped back into the room but now he was completely covered in a dark soot and smelled a bit charred.

""Sorry for the delay. Your request is granted.""  He coughed into his hand and said,  ""Please follow the red line to the end of the hall and check in at the window.""  He looked back down and resumed his furious typing.

1lcd06z,mxzlj77,"Aura is a fairly recent concept. It has been detected about 50 years ago, but has since shaped society in all forms.

Having Aura is the most important thing when you want power. What is important for Aura? Looking the part, acting the part and speaking the part.

The way society views you, or maybe the way your view yourself. You need to confidence to do what you are doing.

The rich and powerful have long since made sure that they are on top of the Aura ladder. Walking around like Vampire Lords, gaining immortality from it. The clerics with their angelic appearance, capable of casting miracles, yet only doing so for those who have the money.

We poor folk? We need to take whatever scraps of Aura we can get. The rich were quite throughout. Trenchcoats were outlawed. At least for us peasantry. So was cosplay. They didn't like what happened when a body builder put on a Space Marine suit.

To my side I see some construction workers. A big guy with the vest only losely hanging over him, cigarette in his mouth carrying a cubic meters of stones by himself. The Aura he portrays granting him super strength.

As for me. Nobody looks at me. My mask is hiding my face. The hidden weapons enhancing the effect. The only thing that kills the people up there with any kind of success.

After the herculean task of getting out of this shitty bad, I see that I am in a perfectly white room, that seemingly has no door? Or windows?

1lbgzyz,mxsiwze,"In the highlands of Castile, where the wind howled through the stone walls of León Castle, Lady Leonor de Mendoza observed the horizon with calculating eyes. Her small but strategic kingdom was coveted by many, especially by the arrogant Don Alfonso of Aragon, whose lands bordered hers.

Her father’s death had left Leonor as the sole heir, a woman in command of territory that many considered too valuable to be in female hands. Palace intrigues were constant, and nobles began to question her authority.

On the other side of the mountains, Don Alfonso received news of the old king’s death with a smile that did nothing to hide his ambition. At last, he could annex those lands rich in water and pastures that he so eagerly sought to expand his influence.

“Prepare the troops,” he ordered his advisor. “It’s time León had a worthy ruler.”

What neither of them knew was that the late king, foreseeing Alfonso’s greed, had consulted ancient scrolls kept for centuries in the cathedral. There he found an ancestral pact between the two houses, signed in blood five generations ago.

Three days later, when Alfonso’s emissaries arrived at Leonor’s castle with veiled threats, the king’s old confessor emerged from the shadows with a sealed parchment.

“My lady, before proceeding, there is a matter of utmost importance,” said the cleric, unrolling the yellowed document before the full court.

The parchment told how, after a bloody war, the ancestors of both houses had agreed that if their lineages were ever reduced to one heir from each side, they should unite in marriage to prevent further bloodshed. The pact had been blessed by the Pope and ratified by the King of Castile.

Alfonso’s messenger turned pale.

That same night, as moonlight dimly illuminated her chamber, Leonor threw her silver cup against the wall.

“Marry that barbarian? I’d rather die first!”

But her advisor, Lady Inés, a woman as cunning as she was beautiful, approached stealthily.

“My lady, perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Marriage would give you access to his chambers… to his food… to his wine.”

Leonor’s eyes gleamed with a flash of understanding.",9,1749930196.0
1lbgzyz,mxtg9zr,"Count Anton lifted his goblet to his lips and was about to take a sip when the faint scent of almonds entered his nose. His lip curled, and he set the goblet aside. *How pedestrian*.

""Is the wine not to your liking, milord?"" Duchess Ophelia asked from across the table. Her elven heritage was evident in her pointed ears and slender figure, only accentuated by her close-fitting dress. While her tone was politely concerned, he could sense her irritation at the failed ploy.

He smiled at her, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""I prefer milder vintages.""

""Oh dear."" She laughed affectedly and raised her hand to a servant. ""Bring the good count a dessert wine that would suit his childish palate.""

Anton's cheek twitched, but he suppressed his irritation and even managed to nod graciously as the servant picked up his goblet. Yet his fingers closed on the silver table knife, and his gaze darted around the table. Once he was certain no one was looking, he raised it and threw it at Ophelia's throat in one smooth motion.

The part-elven wench turned her head aside with infuriating ease, and the blade embedded itself in the back of her chair with a thunk. Flicking back her long dark hair, she glowered at him. ""What is the meaning of this, Count Anton?""

""Forgive me,"" he said, forcing his lips into a smile. ""My hand slipped.""

She leaned forward over the table and hissed, ""Are you finally tiring of the pretense? Because if you are, I could have my armies at your doorstep in—""

""I could say the same to you,"" he retorted, jerking his chin in the direction the servant had left. ""Are you even trying?""

The duchess grimaced. ""Good alchemists are expensive to employ,"" she said, sitting back. ""We make do with what we have.""

""Don't we all,"" he muttered. The entire east of the empire was suffering from poor harvests and emigration. It was part of why he needed to take over her lands with their lush orchards and fields.

For a time, Ophelia only glared at him, not saying a thing. Then she drained her own goblet and set it down with a clack.

""Count Anton,"" she said in a measured tone. ""I think I've had too much wine, and you've had none, so I could use your steady hand. Would you be so kind as to escort me back to my chambers?""

His eyebrows rose, but he dabbed at his lips with a napkin and stood. ""Of course, milady.""

He walked to the table's end, where Ophelia joined him and slipped her hand into the crook of his elbow. Several servants followed at their heels while others set to clearing the table without a word. Ophelia steered him into the hallway decorated with woven tapestries and lead him up the stairs.

A sharp jab in his arm made him stumble. Glancing to where Ophelia's hand lay upon his arm, he saw a tiny needle glint from under her index finger. She flashed her teeth at him in a vicious smile. He could already feel a numbness spread through his arm, and his vision was clouding.

Grunting, he reached into the inner pocket of his jacket, drew out a silver flask, and took a measured gulp of an antidote. The numbness swiftly passed. He grinned at Ophelia, whose smile turned sour.

""Better,"" he whispered. 

He could've sworn she'd blushed, although by the time he blinked the lingering blurriness out of his eyes, her face was again set in a haughty mask. In short order, they arrived before the doors into her chambers. Ophelia let go of his arm and hesitated, tapping her foot against the floor. Then, as if coming to a decision, she laid her hand against his chest.

""Milord,"" she said softly, ""would you like to come inside and entertain me for a time?""

A gasp came from the direction of the servants at the openness of her proposition. Anton ran his gaze over her slender figure and leered theatrically. Despite how close-fitting her dress was, he was sure she'd hidden a stiletto somewhere. He rubbed the enchanted ring on his finger. It only had one charge left, but in close quarters, it would be enough.

""I'd like nothing more, milady."" Clasping her hand, he kissed her fingers, taking care to avoid the hidden needle.

Ophelia's lips curved into an insincere smile, and she pushed open the door. ""I am not to be disturbed,"" she said, glancing back at the servant. ""No matter what you may hear.""

The servant nodded, flushing. The two maids behind him were already whispering to each other. Such things just weren't done out in the open in noble society, but Ophelia was clearly ready to end the game. 

So was he. Smiling grimly, he followed her inside. 

The hour they spent ensconced in the duchess's chambers would become the hottest gossip topic for months and the subject of more than one raunchy tavern song. There were screams. There were grunts. There was broken furniture. There even was a fire—Anton had used his ring—but that too was somehow chalked up to heated passions.

After things finally went quiet, the doors creaked open, and before the servants' wide eyes, the duchess limped out. Her hair was in disarray, her fine dress was ripped, and she was red-faced and panting for air. 

Anton followed shortly after, topless, sweaty, and clutching a developing bruise on his ribs. His trousers hid a thin long slash, bandaged with the tatters of his shirt. He had been wrong; she hadn't hidden a stiletto. 

She had hidden *two*.

He and Ophelia glared at each other in silence for a time, both breathing heavily. She spoke first, almost reluctantly.

""Count Anton, I must say, for a man your age, your endurance is incredible."" 

One of the maids who'd waited for them outside gasped and nearly swooned.

""And you're every bit as flexible and limber as you look, duchess,"" he said, rubbing his bruise with a wince.

Her eyes narrowed. ""We must do this again soon.""

He smiled darkly. ""I can hardly wait.""

Planting her hands on his shoulders, she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him. Anton froze in surprise. A moment later, she withdrew and looked up at him expectantly. 

He opened his lips to speak, but felt them going numb. Ah, her final gambit. His hand stretched habitually to his inner pocket before he realized his jacket lay in tatters inside Ophelia's chambers. Chuckling, he reached into his trouser pocket for a handkerchief that had been soaked in alchemical potions and pretended to cough, wiping it across his lips.

""Apologies, milady,"" he said, smirking into the handkerchief when he saw anger flash in her eyes. ""It's a little drafty out here; I might be coming down with a cold.""

""That won't do,"" she said, glancing at the servants. ""Get the count a cloak and see him to his carriage."" She narrowed her eyes at him. ""I'll send you a letter shortly. Do stay in good health until then.""

 He sketched a bow. ""Anything for you, duchess.""

She sniffed, turned on her heel, and limped off, favoring her right leg. Most of the servants scurried after her, while one remained, gesturing politely in the opposite direction. 

His eyes lingered on her back for a few moments before he looked away. It appeared their game would continue for a while. Strangely, Anton was no longer sure he wanted it to end.",7,1749941359.0

In the castle of Aragon, Alfonso received the news with similar disgust.

“A woman sharing my throne! Impossible!”

His master-at-arms, a man who had served three generations of his family, leaned in to whisper:

“Sir, a brief marriage might be convenient. Widows have little authority in these lands.”

Alfonso caressed the hilt of his dagger while smiling.

Two weeks later, in Burgos Cathedral, the two enemies met for the first time. He was tall and robust, with a reddish beard and piercing eyes. She was slender but firm, with dark eyes that revealed no emotion.

As they exchanged vows before the bishop, their minds calculated timing and methods. Leonor thought of the poisonous mushrooms growing in her forests. Alfonso contemplated how easy it would be for his new wife to suffer an accident on the stone stairs.

That night, during the wedding banquet, they toasted while staring into each other’s eyes, each holding a cup they had watched carefully to avoid poisons.

“To a long and prosperous union,” said Alfonso with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

“To an… unforgettable future,” Leonor replied.

Two rulers united by obligation, each planning the other’s destruction while their courtiers observed every gesture, every word, every glance.

What neither of them suspected was that their kingdoms faced a greater threat coming from the south. The Almohad banners were approaching, and soon they would discover that their most dangerous enemies weren’t in their marriage bed, but at the gates of their united lands.

But that is another story yet to be written, as Leonor and Alfonso retired to their chambers, each with a dagger hidden in their clothes and a courteous smile on their lips.",11,1749930219.0

All their near death experiences and fights had led to this. To her wife and two adopted kids they adopted as well as a great bond with her parents. 

Her ten year anniversary of villainy was actually coming up the next month. It just so happened that her daughter Olivia’s birthday fell on the very same day. A giggle had escaped her when she realized the coincidence but now it left her with dread. Maybe that was an overreaction, she looked forward to celebrate her daughter. How couldn’t she? 

It’s just her daughter’s birthday wish that was hard to fulfill. That was not an exaggeration. See, she would do anything to bring her dear Oliva anything. The world would burn or rather fall apart due to chemical acid(considering her own power) if her baby asked. But this? Having to ask her nemesis if his sidekick could attend a birthday party? That would be humiliating on another level. 

Regardless, she promised to fulfill her loved ones wishes to the best of her ability. If this meant kidnapping a teenager then so be it. 

She’d put on her villain gear, full body armor along with her gadgets and preparing to use her powers. Being able to produce toxins from the palm of your hand turns out to be very useful. Even in smaller quantities.

”You can’t be serious.” He stared at her, Mr Unbreakable in all his glory. 

”I am. You have no idea how serious I am.” She was slightly annoyed but her determination to make her daughter happy exceeded her annoyance. 

”Why did I not know YOU out of all people had such a strong family spirit. Or even a family.” From where he floated above ground she would’ve been able to get a handful of acid shoved in his face. She could not understand how this city could love this guy so much. 

She had to hold herself back and think about Olivia, she’d be so disappointed if her current infatuation started hating her because of her own mother. Deep breaths. ”What do you not understand about secret identities? Of course I won’t give you any leads on who I am.” 

”Well, your telling me now which proves to me that you love that family of yours.” Why did he look so pleased from up there? His face was twisted into a grin from the power he held. 

She sighed loudly and did her best to show her disdain. ”Yeah, well, you know how it is. Kids and all, you can’t stop the urge to spoil them every chance you get. Your sidekick, Fighter- that’s his name right? Don’t you want to protect him no matter the cost?” 

”I don’t know what your implying. He’s my sidekick.” 

”Deny it all you want, I know the way you look at him. It’s the same worried glance I give my daughter every time she wants to do something outright stupid. But I’ll always love her regardless. I only want to bring my princess happiness.” 

For a moment the man looked away, hiding his emotions by diverting his gaze. ”Fine.” 

”Wait- really?” 

”I’ll ask him to attend your daughter’s birthday party. Only as a present for your ten year anniversary.” 

”Huh.” The only thing she needed to do was to give an emotional story. ”I’ll send you the details one way or another… Thank you. I look forward to a few more years of kicking you butt.” 

”Hey!” He yelled but there wasn’t any real anger in it. She ran away into the shadows of the city’s alleyways.

“And now?”

“Now I think you’re telling the truth. You really don’t remember.”

Peter exhaled, rubbing his temples. She continued. “The bruises. The mud. The teeth marks on the steak I left out.”

“You ate it raw,” Alice said, matter-of-fact. “Licked the plate.”

Alice hesitated, just for a second, but it was enough. His stomach lurched.

“Who?”

“No one human,” she said quickly. “But the sheep, the dogs… Peter, you’re fast. You’re careful. You don’t leave tracks. Except when you do.” She tapped the notebook. “Like last Tuesday. You came back with burrs in your hair. And blood on your sleeve.”

He stared at her. “And you just… watched?”

“I followed you once.” Her voice softened. “Just to be sure. You didn’t see me. You were beautiful, in a way. All that power. But you weren’t you.”

Peter stood abruptly, chair scraping. “This is insane.”

“Is it?” Alice stood too, stepping closer. “You sleep through full moons. You wake up starving. You’ve never been sick a day in your life. Tell me I’m wrong.”

He opened his mouth, then shut it. The truth sat between them, heavy as a stone.

Alice reached for his hand. “We can fix this.”

“How?”

“Silver. Wolfsbane. Chains, if we have to.” Her grip tightened. “Or we don’t fix it. We manage it.”

Peter pulled away, pacing. “You’re talking about me like I’m some kind of project.”

“I’m talking about you like I love you,” she said sharply. “Which means I’m not letting you tear yourself apart in the dark.”

Silence. The clock ticked.

Finally, Peter sank back into his chair. “What do we do?”

Alice sat beside him, her knee brushing his. “First, we lock the doors better. Then we take notes. Then we learn.” 

She paused. “And maybe we get a stronger lock for the bedroom.”

A laugh escaped him, ragged but real. “You’re not scared?”

Alice studied him, her gaze steady. “Terrified. But not of you.”

The acrid smell of the burning suit was still lingering on, somewhat overpowering the smell of alien dead. 

""Okay, Son, maybe what you are telling us is not one hundred percent bullshit. Can you tell us your story again, from the point you sat down with a book and a glass of wine?""

""I already told you and I have not seen it helping me in any way.""

""That was before the first piece of proof, son.""

""Also, please don't call me that.""

""Okay, Mr. Stimson. Please tell us your story, now into the record.""

So I told it again, starting from the sudden thunder of their landing and the roof crashing into my living room.

""Why you, Mr. Stimson?""

""I really have no idea, Sir. Maybe I have that kind of face that makes everyone want to bully me? Maybe that hobby project I did a couple of years ago, sending a message towards Alfa Centauri, and left it running because it looked cool?""

With such interruptions I went through the events. How I noticed that the two Things coming to my house had no eyes but prominent ears, suggesting echolocation. How I put on the chicken suit I got from and ad company in high school to promote Best Chicken, and kept when both the ad company and Best Chicken went out of business. How I managed to hit the Things and found that their skin has some acid, burning my hand. How I bludgeoned them to death with the only object which was solid enough, my bowling ball.

How I recognized that these two were just the vanguard and two dozen or so are circling the remains of my house. 

My beloved and finely tuned bowling ball was just a smoking little knob, so I jumped into my car to go to the only place where I can be sure to find people equipped with heavy stone object, the Little Mermaid Bowling Hall, where the county championship was ongoing, without me, because now that they could win actual money, suddenly everyone was there and they did not needed me, the substitute. 

How they caught up with me just a block away from the Little Mermaid and hit my car with some ray which melted the car around me in a couple of seconds.

""Wait, Mr. Stimson. Dexter, anything to add?""

""You do know that I mostly working with blood, Chief?""

""Yes, but splatter is splatter.""

""I can tell you Chief that the smear outside does looks like it was once a car, going with a high but not unreasonable speed. All the separate drops had the same direction, and there is a definite thickening at the front where the engine should have been. Some black colorations could have been plastic parts, but for that you have to ask for a chem analysis.""

The rest of my story was easier to confirm, because there were eyewitnesses in the Mermaid. They have seen me rushing in in the burning chicken suit, they have seen the Things coming after me, they beat the Things to pulp. I was running to the back to put out the fire at the ball washer station, when the police came in and caught me.

""Okay, Mr. Stimson. Let's say that I put this into the official record. By tomorrow both of us will be in an institute with very helpful personnel and soft walls to not to injure ourselves.""

""Well, I can't lie now, Sir.""

""But I can. And I do. And here are a couple of guys from something called MIB who will help us.""

They came in, said nice things, then there was a flash, and I was back at my living room with a book and a glass of wine.

I rush towards the shop, as gunshots, and groans are heard, as the Mafia fights off some gang that tried to abduct me.  
I mean come on!  
I don't have any connection to them!  
Why are they doing this?  
It is ridiculous.  
And even if I ask the Mafia members who come to my place, they just smile.  
""You know."" they say, and that's all I get.  
I don't! I really don't!  
But it seems, I will soon find out, for I got a letter from ""The Boss."".

  
I look at the woman, that looks like someone who stepped out of a cliche traditional wife portrait, and sigh.  
""Seriously?"" I ask her.  
She nods.  
""Things are getting dicey, but please don't worry, we will keep protecting you."" she says.  
She is ""The Boss""...and she did this, as a cover.  
""You are cruel. Leaking that I am extremely important to you, and to your organization, only so that all eyes are on me, while you do whatever you want elsewhere."" I sigh.  
""Not whatever I want, as not all resources are put on your little cafe, don't be ridiculous, but yes. You are a good bait. Keep it up."" she said, patting my cheek, as if I was a kid, a fool, and she leaves.  
I sigh.  
""""Keep it up"", she says, huh? Not like I have a choice."" I mutter, watching the dozen cars leave with her.  
How can I be this ""lucky""?",10,1749903795.0

The artificial sun gives us enough sunlight, and warmth to survive, and to grow crops.  
There is no rain, no winds, and no issues inside the Walled City.  
But why is it walled?  
And why that just against the walls, and shield of the city, violent, horrible winds, and acid rains are decimating the world?  
What happened?  
And how long can we last, considering...the space is limited inside, and under the city?

  
It is not a long story, by any means.  
We were born, we grew, we developed, we fought, and destroyed the world.  
The End.  
Really, that simple.  
We were advanced, but foolish.  
Our weapons messed up the electromagnetic field of the planet.  
Our bombs shifted the tectonic plates, and made them unstable.  
And all this somehow also messed up the rotation of the planet itself.  
Now...  
The Walled City is all that remains.

  
The city is a marvel and peak of our civilization.  
It uses the tremors of the ground, the heavy winds, and even the acidic rains to fuel its shields, and keep its walls intact.  
We lack no energy, and our air is purified, so is our water, and soil.  
But...  
We, the survivors, have enough knowledge to maintain, and repair our technology, but we have yet to have an individual that could...improve it.  
Thus, we are forced to stay here, in the city.  
And while it is big, it has been 21 years already, and the limits of the population have been reached.  
Now...we have to choose: prohibit procreation, or find a way to have more space.  
Not that we don't have an alternative: the underground, problem is, the untreated soil, is highly toxic.

  
So now, we have to treat, and cleanse the soil, if we want to build downwards.  
We have to somehow increase the area of the shield, if we want to build outwards.  
All the while, our population is growing, as most of the survivors were either young, or middle-aged at oldest.  
We are in a dilemma.  
How can we give birth to a genius, if we disallow the birth of children?  
But how can we allow the population to grow, if our space, and supplies will soon be unable to bear the load?  
Nonetheless, the weather is beautiful.  
The life inside the city is amazing.  
As for the slowly building tension, and unease?  
Ignore it, for as long as you can, and hope for the best.",16,1749876134.0
1laimsy,mxn3jqt,"The scent of stale coffee and instant ramen hung in the air, a fragrant testament to a week of glorious, unapologetic sloth. I was sprawled on my worn-out sofa, a throne of threadbare cushions in my tiny Setagaya apartment, scrolling through an endless feed of cat videos on my phone. Any minute now, I kept telling myself, the numbers in my banking app were going to balloon. A cool ten million yen. The grand prize from ""Cerebral Cataclysm,"" the game show notoriously billed as ""the Everest of intellect.""


Honestly, I still couldn't figure out the hype. The final challenge, the one that had sent every previous contestant home in a gibbering wreck, had been a breeze. A series of intricate, shifting 3D puzzles displayed on a holographic table. They’d called it the ""Neuro-Labyrinth."" To me, it was just…intuitive. The patterns, the connections, the solutions—they all just clicked into place as if my brain already knew the layout. While the host, in his garishly sparkling suit at the TV Tokyo studio, had looked on with a mixture of shock and awe, I’d simply nudged the final glowing cube into its slot and…won.


A week later, the only evidence of my triumph was a mountain of takeout containers and the lingering buzz of studio lights in my memory. I was refreshing my banking app for the tenth time in as many minutes when a thunderous thump-thump-thump rattled my front door. It wasn't the polite rap of a delivery driver or the hesitant knock of a neighbor. This was a demand.


I shuffled to the door, peering through the peephole. A man in a stark, black suit stood on my doorstep. His haircut was severe, his jawline looked like it had been carved from granite, and his eyes—even through the distorted lens—were cold and assessing. He wore a small, silver pin on his lapel, a stylized ginkgo leaf I didn't recognize.


With a sigh, I unlocked the door. ""Can I help you?""


""Mr. Kenji Tanaka?"" he asked. 


His voice was a low, gravelly baritone that seemed to vibrate in my chest. He didn’t wait for an answer, his gaze sweeping past me to scan my small apartment.


""That's me,"" I said, leaning against the doorframe, trying to project a nonchalance I didn't feel. 


""If you're selling something, I just won ten million yen, but it hasn't cleared yet, so…""


""I'm not a salesman,"" he cut in, his expression unchanging. He held up a sleek, black wallet, flipping it open to reveal a government identification card. The photo was as grim as the man himself.


""My name is Ichikawa, from the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office.""
My casual lean evaporated. ""CIRO? What does government intelligence want with me?""


Ichikawa’s eyes narrowed slightly. ""You won 'Cerebral Cataclysm' last Tuesday."" It wasn't a question.


""Yeah. The check's in the mail, I hope."" I attempted a weak smile. It bounced off his stoic face and died on the floor.


""Mr. Tanaka,"" Ichikawa said, taking a deliberate step forward, forcing me to retreat into my own living room.


 ""What I'm about to tell you is a matter of national security. 'Cerebral Cataclysm' is not a game show.""


I stared at him, bewildered. ""Of course it is. I was there. There were cameras, a live studio audience, a host who tans more than he blinks…""


""A convincing facade,"" Ichikawa conceded, his eyes locking onto mine. 


""The prize money is real, a necessary part of the cover. But the final challenge, the 'Neuro-Labyrinth,' is not a puzzle.""


He paused, letting the silence stretch, thick with unspoken meaning. My heart started to hammer against my ribs.


""It's a diagnostic tool, Mr. Tanaka,"" he continued, his voice dropping even lower. ""A highly advanced aptitude test, designed by a special research division at the Ministry of Defense in Ichigaya. It's designed to identify a very specific, very rare cognitive type. A mind capable of navigating non-Euclidean, multidimensional frameworks. To put it in layman's terms, the 'puzzle' is a direct interface with a captured alien artifact.""


The world seemed to tilt on its axis. The cat videos, the ramen, the ten-million-yen prize—it all felt like a distant dream.


 I sank onto the arm of my sofa, my legs suddenly unable to support me. ""An…alien artifact?""


""For fifteen years, every contestant has failed,"" Ichikawa stated, his voice devoid of emotion. 


""Most suffer acute psychological distress. Headaches. Vertigo. A few have had complete psychotic breaks. Their minds simply cannot process the architecture. It's fundamentally incompatible with standard human cognition."" He took another step closer, looming over me now. 


""But you solved it. In seven minutes and forty-two seconds. You didn't just navigate it, you streamlined it. The researchers who designed the test said it was like watching a master locksmith pick a simple lock.""


He let that hang in the air for a moment. ""We don't know why your mind works this way, Mr. Tanaka. We don't know how. But the artifact responded to you. For the first time, it initiated a two-way data stream.""


The aggressive knocking suddenly made perfect sense. The gravity in Ichikawa's demeanor was no longer just bureaucratic seriousness; it was the weight of something unimaginable. My easy win wasn't a stroke of luck; it was a revelation. A flag on a global watch-list.


""So, the money…"" I trailed off, my voice barely a whisper.


""Is yours,"" Ichikawa said. ""But your time as a private citizen is over. 


The check has cleared, Mr. Tanaka. But it's not a prize. It's a signing bonus."" He reached into his suit jacket and pulled out a single, unmarked file folder, placing it on the coffee table next to a week-old bowl of solidified noodles.


 ""Welcome to the real game.""",298,1749852330.0
1laimsy,mxlgl0p,"""Jim!"" you cry. ""What a pleasant surprise. What are you doing in West Palmdale?""

Jim was another contestant on Put the Rock in the Bag, the only gameshow where contestants must put a rock in a bag. His suit and black tie contrast sharply with the Hawaiian shirts you remember. Last time you saw him, he wore a visor with the words BEER COMPANY on the brim.

""I come bearing news,"" he says--his low, rumbling voice contrasting sharply with the nasal, triumphant laugh you remember from Put the Rock in the Bag's lightning round. ""May I come in?""

Soon he's sitting in one of your folding lawn chairs. The nice one, with the cupholder. He sets a thick black briefcase on the refrigerator box you've been using as a coffee table. He adjusts a cufflink. ""That gameshow,"" he says slowly. ""It was a test. We've been observing you for some time, Larry, and you've proven yourself just the specimen for--""

""Can I get you anything to drink?""

""No, thank you. Larry, the human race is at war. A war in the skies, against forces beyond our ken. The stakes couldn't be higher.""

*The stakes couldn't be higher.* Classic Jim. He said the same thing during the teamwork challenge of Put the Rock in the Bag.

He clears his throat. ""Crucial to our success is the willing participation of minds like yours,"" he says. ""Citizens willing to suspend disbelief and commit themselves wholly, even recklessly, to our resistance."" He smiles, almost with pity. ""You're going to be the tip of the spear, Larry.""

Sounds pretty cool. You jab him on the shoulder. ""Hey, remember when Debra's bag wouldn't open, and the host said it was because she had used all her phone-a-friend points back in Round Two?""

No response.

""I thought that was pretty cool,"" you add quietly.

""Indeed. Larry, it is precisely this enthusiasm of yours--this willingness to believe such a gameshow would exist in the first place and then lose yourself in vain battle--that recommends you for our cause.""

Sounds kind of bad. ""What do you mean? *Vain battle?""*

Jim scoffs. ""You don't seriously believe there's a gameshow called *Put the Rock in the Bag,* do you?""

""Well, I mean... a little bit?""

He studies you over the tops of his tinted sunglasses, shakes his head.

You wring your hands together, as if searching for the tactile memory of some comforting bag. ""B-but I was there! I met Drew Carey!""

Jim sighs, popping the latches on his briefcase.

""Are you saying the show--doesn't exist?"" You start to stand up. ""What have I been watching on TBS every night for the past year?""

From his briefcase, he pulls out a weathered leather bag, and your heart skips a beat--a flutter of hope, an echo of the good times you shared--but then out from the bag comes what appears to be some kind of probe.

1laimsy,mxreq3z,"""I will never have to work again"" I thought. It was a little odd how nobody had ever won before because the gameshow was surprisingly easy. But I shouldn't overthink it. I'm a multi-millionaire and set for life, as soon as I get that check.

I sat in the middle of my living room in my beat-up, old recliner. Probably for the last time. I was going to ditch all of this old crap and live a life of luxury. Sitting there in my underwear with a box fan blowing cool air I was just about to drift off to sleep when all hell broke loose. My front door exploded open and a stream of soldiers poured into the house. They fanned out going from room to room shouting ""Clear!"" as they went. In my shock it took a few minutes to realize that they didn't seem particularly concerned with me. Other than a couple of soldiers standing to either side of me, with their backs turned, none of them so much as looked at me. 

After what seemed like an eternity everything went still. And then most comically chiseled man I have ever seen walked through the rubble of my front door. He looked like he was made of a series straight lines that met only at right angles. He marched up to me and, in a somewhat aggressive tone, asked if I knew why he was there. I weakly responded, ""To deliver my check?"" and instinctively shrunk back, trying to disappear into my recliner.

""No, and you're not getting a check."" was the response.

""The gameshow was a setup. The questions were designed in such a way that the ONLY way you could answer them correctly was by knowing the answer to FUTURE questions. You're a time traveler and this was a trap to find you.""

I'm sorry, I'm a fucking what?! I protested and pleaded with him that I didn't understand, that I barely travel outside of my dump for a home much less through time, and for them to please not kill me. 

""We're not here to kill you, we're here because you're going to help us."" Somehow hearing those words was even worse than if he had said he was going to off me right there.

Through days of intense discussion it was made clear to me that I, or some future version of myself, is able to time travel. More specifically, this future version of myself travels through time competing in gameshows and taking the prize money... apparently even from myself. I had questionable morals but this was a new low.

""We have discovered a pattern amongst the most contemptable villains over the past 100 years. They win TV gameshows and ultimately use those earnings to fund the beginnings of their criminal empires. You're going to stop that. You will travel back in time, compete in gameshows, and win. Or do whatever it takes to stop them from winning.""",5,1749917525.0
1laimsy,mxoav7f,"I stared at the nondescript folder lying amongst the debris of my lazy week. It looked so ordinary, yet it felt like a bomb that had just been armed. 


My voice was hoarse, barely a croak. ""A signing bonus? What are you talking about? What is the real game?""


Ichikawa’s lips curved into something that might have been a smile on a different man. On him, it was just a slight rearrangement of grim lines.


 ""The real game, Mr. Tanaka,"" he said, his voice dropping to a confidential murmur, ""is finding out why the artifact is here in the first place.""


He gestured vaguely towards the window, towards the sprawling, oblivious metropolis of Tokyo.


""That artifact? It's not a trophy. It's a key. And we're not the only ones who know it exists. Other nations, other...interests, are looking for people like you. People who can turn that key.""


My mind reeled, trying to catch up. ""So, this is... espionage? You want me to be a spy?"" The idea was so ludicrous it almost made me laugh. Me, a man whose greatest recent achievement before the game show was building a seven-level pillow fort.


Ichikawa's expression hardened, erasing the mirthless smile. ""Spy is an inadequate term. The people you will be up against don't deal in state secrets. They deal in existential threats. The Neuro-Labyrinth wasn't a one-off test. It was the qualifier.""


He leaned in closer, his voice a cold, sharp point in the quiet of my apartment. ""The real game is ensuring that when other 'keys' like this one are found, we get to them first. It's a race, Mr. Tanaka. A silent, global race. And you, whether you like it or not, are now our star player."" 


He straightened up, his duty delivered.
""The game is survival. And it starts now. A car is waiting for you downstairs.”",140,1749867628.0
1laimsy,mxq7c8c,"""A car is waiting for you downstairs,"" said Ichikawa. 


I followed him down the narrow stairwell of my apartment building, my mind still spinning. The car was a nondescript black sedan, the kind that blends seamlessly into the Tokyo traffic. We drove in silence, the neon glow of the city blurring past us.


The journey ended in Shinjuku, in front of a seemingly abandoned SEGA arcade. The paint was peeling, the neon sign flickered erratically, and the entrance was dark and unwelcoming.  


""Here?"" I asked.


Ichikawa nodded, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. ""Welcome to CIRO's Tokyo branch. We find that secrets are best hidden in plain sight."" 


He led me inside. The air was thick with the scent of dust and stale cigarette smoke, a relic of a bygone era. Rows of silent arcade cabinets lined the walls, their screens dark and lifeless. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Out Run…relics of a simpler time.


Ichikawa walked to the back of the arcade and pressed a sequence of buttons on a faded Street Fighter II machine. The cabinet hummed and a “Hadoken!” sound clip played.


A section of the back wall slid open, revealing a brightly lit, modern hallway. The contrast was jarring, like stepping from a sepia-toned memory into a high-tech future.


""This way, Tanaka-san,"" Ichikawa said, his voice losing some of its earlier severity. 
""I'd like you to meet someone.”",57,1749902342.0
1laimsy,mxweutj,"The transition was dizzying. One moment I was in a dusty mausoleum of 16-bit memories, the next I was striding down a corridor of gleaming white panels, bathed in cold, blue-white glow.. The air was cool and filtered, carrying the low hum of powerful computer systems. 

Men and women in crisp, dark uniforms with the same silver ginkgo leaf pin as Ichikawa moved past us, their faces focused, their steps silent and purposeful. None of them gave me a second glance. I was an anomaly, but one that was clearly expected.

We passed laboratories where scientists in white coats peered at holographic displays filled with complex, rotating geometries. We passed data centers where colossal servers blinked in rhythmic patterns, processing unimaginable amounts of information. This wasn't just a branch office; it was a nerve center, buried deep beneath the noise and chaos of Shinjuku.

Ichikawa led me to a heavy blast door that hissed open at his approach. It revealed not an office, but a circular chamber. In the center of the room, suspended in a shimmering, pale gold energy field, was the ""artifact.""

My breath caught in my throat. Seeing it on the game show's holographic table was nothing like this. It was real. It was here. 

The object was roughly the size of a car engine, a chaotic yet elegant lattice of crystalline structures and what looked like solidified, iridescent light. It defied geometry, twisting in on itself in ways that made my head ache just trying to follow. It was beautiful and deeply, fundamentally alien. It felt...alive.",15,1749991080.0
1laimsy,mxwewn4,"""Incredible, isn't it?""

The voice came from a woman standing in the shadows at the edge of the room. She stepped forward into the light. She was older, perhaps in her late fifties, with sharp, intelligent eyes and silver-streaked hair tied back in a professional bun. She wore a perfectly tailored grey suit and carried an air of absolute authority that made even Ichikawa seem like a subordinate.

""Mr. Tanaka, I am Director Kaneshiro,"" she said, her voice calm and measured. ""Thank you for coming so...promptly.""

""I wasn't exactly given a choice,"" I mumbled, unable to tear my eyes from the floating object.

""Choice is a luxury we lost the day this object fell from the sky and buried itself in the Tanzawa Mountains,"" Kaneshiro replied smoothly. ""What you called the Neuro-Labyrinth? That was us, reverse-engineering its surface-level defense mechanisms. A lock, to use your analogy. For fifteen years, we've been able to do nothing but polish the outside. Then you came along.""

She gestured to the artifact. ""We call it 'OriKami,' the Folding God. It doesn't communicate in any language we can comprehend. No radio waves, no radiation, nothing. But when you interfaced with it, it...resonated. For the first time, we received a data stream that wasn't just gibberish. It was a map.""

A massive holographic screen flickered to life on the wall behind her, showing a swirling star chart that was utterly unfamiliar. ""We don't know what it's a map of,"" Kaneshiro continued, ""but we know two things. One: we are not alone. And two: other, similar objects have fallen elsewhere. Moscow. Langley. Beijing.  All in a silent, global race. Each government found its own OriKami. And each government is now desperately searching for its own Kenji Tanaka.""

The weight of her words settled on me, colder and heavier than the air in the room. This wasn't a game of espionage. It was a race to understand the rulebook for a game that had already begun without humanity's consent. My unique mind wasn't a gift; it was a strategic asset.

""What...what do you want from me?"" I finally asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Kaneshiro's expression was unreadable, a mixture of scientific curiosity and grim necessity. ""The game show was a diagnostic. A qualifier. Today is your first training session.""

She looked from me to the shimmering, impossible object floating in the center of the room. Its crystalline facets seemed to pulse with a faint inner light, as if it was aware of my presence. As if it was waiting.

""We need you to reach out to it again,"" Director Kaneshiro said, her voice dropping, taking on the finality of an order. ""But this time, we don't want you to solve its puzzle. We want you to ask it a question.""",17,1749991102.0
1lany3c,mxmbs5p,"The ropes binding me to the chair were tight and expertly tied.  As I tried to wiggle my shoulders, I felt no give and despair was trying to claim my hopes.  My eyes were glued to my captor, my expression one of infinite rage as he continued to monologue.

""As I was saying, before you rudely interrupted me, it's nothing personal.  Someone paid me big money to get your attention.  I'm sorry that I took your kid and shoved a combat knife through your Playstation, but my client was tired of you ignoring them. They'll be along shortly to talk to you.""

I forced my eyes closed, mentally trying to see how he had tied my hands, trying to figure out how to loosen my bonds.  I felt the sweat covering my arms and tried to use it to moisten the rope, anything to get out of this position.  I could hear him moving around the kitchen, pulling open cupboards and filling what I hoped was a glass with water from the sink.  The opening of the refrigerator door, glass bottles clinking together and crinkling sound of aluminum foil meant he was looking at my leftovers.  Maybe yesterday's fried chicken would keep his attention from he as I tried to free myself.  I could feel the ropes cutting into my wrists when his sudden exclamation paused my efforts.

""They're here! Finally! Now I can get my final payment and get outta here.""

I watched as a smartly dressed woman entered my home though the side door into the kitchen, escorting my son.  His eyes lit up at the sight of me and he rushed over to give me a big hug.  There was no sign of distress on his face, and I noticed that he was wearing a new Disney t-shirt.  Before I could say anything, my son shouted ""I had a great time at Disney World!""  He ran back to the unknown woman, who wordlessly handed him a gift bag, presumably of new toys, and left the room to go play.

My eyes turned to the intruder.  Her expensive suit and haircut screamed executive, and the icy expression on her otherwise beautiful features froze any words that would've come out of me.  She arched an eyebrow, looking me over as she pursed her red lips in a frown. When she spoke, her voice was cold and unyielding, like someone who was used to getting their way.

The man who kidnapped him only wanted money, and in his greed, killed the love of my life and kidnapped my son. I have searched for months, only stopping when I eventually passed out from exhaustion. Now, I finally have him, and the relief flooded my emotions.

I put my hands on my son's shoulders and held him out at arms length, ""I need you to wait here for a little bit."" 

He looked at me with confusion written in his eyes. ""Why, Daddy?""

""I have to make sure it's safe out there. I need to make sure the man who kidnapped you isn't here anymore.""

He gave an understanding nod, and I stood up to leave. It wasn't exactly a lie, as I was making sure the man was gone before taking my son out of this hellhole. Although the relief and joy I felt was cemented into my heart, so was revenge - so was hatred. 

I walked out of the basement where he was being kept and inched up the stairs to make sure that he didn't hear me coming. I took the gun out of my waistband, holding it ahead of me incase he saw me. I heard the radio coming from a room and prowled towards the door. My heart beating so fast I could hear it echo in my head.

I slowly cracked open the door, and saw him sitting in his desk, back turned towards me. He was painting a picture and listening to his music as if he didn't just have a child chained up in his basement. My disgust for the man was palpable - it made my hands shake, and my jaw clench so hard I thought I was going to break my teeth. 

I slowly walked behind him and pointed the pistol to the back of his skull.

""Turn around slowly,"" I said through clenched teeth, ""If you move a muscle, I'll shoot you in the fucking face.""

He turned around and looked at me with wide eyes, as if he didn't expect anyone to be able to catch him. He didn't say a word, just stared at me with the eyes of a coward - the eyes of someone who's afraid to die. 

I cocked the gun and put my finger on the trigger. ""You killed my wife. You kidnapped my son. Why should I let you live?""

His body tensed and his eyes widened even more, to the point it looked as if they were going to pop out of his eyelids at any second. He took a deep breath and relaxed his body - as much as a person with a gun to their face is able to relax. ",41,1749848259.0

    ""No."" I grab the bag and pull it open.   Deposit certificates and cash.     Just as it had to be.  ""This is 2 million dollars. My fee for killing your husband. ""  i slide it to her feet.  ""Im going to send it home with you. Pay off your house, buy a new car.  Invest the rest.   Put your boy through college.""  I was aching,   with the press of a button the cage holding the boy opened.    ""My job is done. ""   i undo the knot on one of her hands. ""Live well.  I hope I never see you again. ""    with a turn I start towards the door.   The secret service would be through to clean out the building before long.   I heard the click too late,  my sense were dulled from the years stacking on me.  I turned to see the boy,  pointing my gun at my chest. 

    ""You hurt my daddy.   Bastard."" I didn't Believe the movies,  but time slowed down,  I was still standing as my body hit the ground.   I guess this wasn't a bad way to go out,   but I was a little disappointed to be killed by a 9 year old.   Everything was slowly going dark and I smiled softly.   I hope she can raise him to be normal.    But for now, time to rest.",15,1749868825.0
1lany3c,mxouo7c,"""Well, for it to be personal, I'd have to know you and have something against you. To me, you're just a guy in a file handed to me by a guy with a lot of money. Now that guy, it's definitely personal for him. Do you know how much he paid me? Honestly, kid, you should be flattered. It's not everyday bounties are that high.""

""I told you, I'm not a fucking kid,"" now I was really pissed off. I took a deep breath only to be reduced to a choking cough as the blood pooled in my nose was sucked down the back of my throat. That only pissed me off more. If after all of this I die tied to a chair in my own fucking house choking on my own fucking blood while the world's most nonchalant asshole twiddles his thumbs and watches I'm going to lose it.

""Kid, guy, Kevin, whatever,"" my captor waved his latex-gloved hand at me dismissively. He was far too busy digging through the plain black backpack he had set down next to him on my couch to pay much attention to my complaints.

""MY NAME IS ALAN,"" I barked at him. To my disdain, he didn't even flinch.

""Okay, sure thing, Kevin.""

Before I could continue my foolhardy endeavor of running my mouth at my captor, I was sobered in an instant when from the depths of his backpack he brandished what looked to be an oversized candle wick trimmer.

""Yeah, that'll do the job,"" the man said as he held it to the light for inspection. ""Don't worry, Kevin. I'm a real 1-2-snip kind of guy. You should be grateful I'm the one who got your file. Some of the other guys I know? Oof, real fuckin' sadists. Not me though, I've got your back.""

Okay, I'll admit, this is where I started to get nervous. The cooper taste of blood burning my tongue all but disappeared as the fear-induced adrenaline surge hit my body.

""What does 1-2-snip entail?"" I asked feebly. My hands shook behind my back where they had been tied together and my knees all but started knocking.

""I think we both know what 1-2-snip entails.""

There was no use in arguing that. We did both know exactly what 1-2-snip was.

As my captor got off the couch and started walking towards me I entered the bargaining stage of grief. It's one thing if I'm about to be 1-2-snipped, it's another for me to have no fucking idea why.",7,1749875597.0
1lany3c,mxmqo4k,"He sighed, ""Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. I just needed the money.""

My face burned with anger at this. ""First, I'm thirty-five. I am not a kid. Second, you broke into my home, killed the love of my life and kidnapped my child at school, and you're trying to tell me it's *nothing personal*?""

The rage I felt in this moment was unfathomable. How is killing someone not personal. How is kidnapping their child not personal? It was personal to me. 

I uncocked the gun. I took my finger off the trigger. The demon in front of me relaxed his muscles, and looked into my eyes. His eyes painted the picture of true gratitude, but no amount of mercy should be given to scum like him. 

I picked up my pistol, and smashed the side of his head with it. He fell to the side, with a guttural sound escaping through his mouth. I hit him so hard that his eyeball began protruding through his eyelid, as he muttered ""please"" to me. I hit him again, and again, and again. I hit him so many times, blood started pouring out of his nose, mouth, eyes, and ears. His skull was a mushed mess after I was done. 

As he lay there motionless I sit there looking at the blood that splattered my hands, and painted the rug underneath me. I went downstairs, got my son, and left the house that was my son's prison for the last six months. Even though I have my son and got my revenge, the hatred still lingered, and the grief still present. I don't know why I still feel this way, but right now, all that matters is that my son is safe, and that the demon who took him will never hurt anyone again.

  
Then like fucking Darth Vader comes out and chokes the shit out of me and I'm like ""woahhh dude, I think you got the wrong guy."" and then he's like, ""nah, definitely the right guy."" and then I'm like ""bruh I don't got shit to do with the rebels or empire... I work at Wendy's"" and Darth Vader puts me down and is like ""Oh shit for real? My fault bro."" Then I'm like ""All good bro. I know work can get stressful and shit."" Then we high five and my son is like ""bruh why the fuck did you get choked by Darth Vader right after saving me from that house?"" like bro, I have no idea. Just killed a guy, kinda loopy from getting choked still. Vader comes back and says, ""I know I just choked you and all, but you mind if I can have some coupons for Wendy's? My son is coming to visit and kinda just found out that he's having a lowkey incestuous relationship so he's kinda bummed out. I say, ""god damn, uhhhhhh, sure that's fine... kinda fucked up tho."" and Darth Vader says, ""yeah, pretty fucked. Thanks though!"" and leaved again. The end.",7,1749848283.0
1lany3c,mxouot3,"""Listen man, listen,"" I stammered. ""I just don't understand why all of this is happening. I'm a decent guy. I mean, I'm no saint. I haven't donated to fuckin' charity ever and the truth is I think my in-laws are some of the most obnoxious people I've ever met. But I take care of my family, I go to work and I pay the bills. I cook and clean so my wife has time to herself and I wasn't one of those guys that refused to wake up when the baby cried or change her diaper. None of this makes any fuckin' sense!""

""Alright, Kevin. It just so happens that I like you enough to bite. Sure, seems like you're as close to a decent family man as it gets. Keyword, close. You know what the thing keeping you from decent is? Fucking other people's wives. Decent family men don't do that, Kevin. I'm gonna need to take off your pants now, I'd appreciate your cooperation.""

Time seemed to slow down as my captor crouched next to me and began to unbutton my jeans. My first thought was a man hadn't unbuttoned my pants since that one time in college. My second thought was whose wife did I fuck? The only wife I'd ever fucked was my own. I'd never even considered fucking someone else's wife. Who the fuck does this guy think I am?

That's when it hit me. Kevin. Whoever the fuck that is. Whoever the fuck this guy thinks I am.

""Fuck you, Kevin,"" I swore through gritted teeth. My captor paused and looked up at me.

1lavrdy,mxojqkr,"For more than a decade, I have kept myself to my moral code of never killing.  
As a hero, I caught villains, and handed them over to the authorities, and most of the time it worked.  
Not with him. My archenemy.  
He always escaped, and we played a game of never-ending cat and mouse, as he wreaked havoc, again and again.  
A week ago, I had enough.  
As he kept an entire hospital hostage, I snapped, and finally killed him.  
It was horrible, but I had to.  
Today, I am to give an interview to a journalist about it.



""So, Mrs. Gravita, how do you feel?  
Having felled your greatest enemy?"" the journalist asks me.  
I sigh.  
""Tired. Wrong. But free."" I say.  
""Free from them? From anger? Hatred?  
What made you kill them? What made you break the code that most heroes follow? The code of never killing?"" he asks.  
I sigh.  
""I wanted to live a normal life. That's all."" I say.  
He frowns.

  
""What do you mean a normal life?  
From what we know, you still continue acting as a Hero, and catching villains.  
How is that a normal life?"" he asks.  
I nod.  
""Yes, I still want to be a Hero, but most villains don't specifically target me.  
Most villains are smarter than to take babies, and ill individuals hostage, and torture them to make me mad.  
And I know that people call me monster, or liar, or hypocrite, for breaking the code.  
I don't care. I know it had to be done.  
I don't regret it."" I say.  
He nods.

  
""What about those voices that say: ""Why haven't you done it earlier?"" or ""Why do heroes have this code?"" ?"" he asks.  
I knew this was coming.  
""Because as heroes we have to be role models, so we can't be murderers, killing everyone.  
Also, not all villains are lost causes, or outright monsters, some of them can be saved, some of them are villains due to circumstances.  
I personally won't be killing any villain anytime soon.  
Now, I am free of the game he forced me to play, free to actually save people, and maybe change villains for the better.  
Thank you for the interview."" I say, as I stand up.

1laraz9,mxn92yo,"Sam awoke with a start, looking around frantically. He didn't remember falling asleep, or anything like that. The last thing he knew was walking home from his crappy minimum wage job, wishing that he could get lucky for once. He had stepped into an alleyway before... *darkness*.

Sitting upright, he heard movement around him. Muffled exclamations followed, as he tried to see. But he was in an utterly black room, not a single speck of light to be seen.

A sudden jolt ran through him, as he felt something change. The air had felt close and stifling, yet now seemed to be expansive and free. It was still impossible to see anything, despite knowing something had moved.

Then came a clapping of hands. Dazzling light poured on him, making him wince. The exclamations he had heard before came back with a vengance, cries of pain and shock filling the air. He groaned, blinking rapidly to try and see something.

A voice suddenly boomed out. Like an announcer on a reality TV show, but with a scratching quality to it. ""Welcome, new Tributes!""

Forcing open his eyes against the blinding light, he focused on the person before him. They were blurry at first, bit gradually swam into clarity. They wore a bright red suit, complete with a long flowing cape. A tie the colour of blood sat over a pure black shirt, looking like it had never been worn before.

Sam noticed the tophat on their head, as bright crimson as their suit. But when his eyes focused, he couldn't look away from the face. Or rather, the lack of a complete one.

They had a mouth, that was true. Wide, and filled with perfectly arranged white teeth. The grin almost dazzled him, so perfectly maintained. But that was the only feature they had. There was no eyes, nose, ears, even hair. Just smooth skin, not hints or scars as to where the rest of the face might be.

The person spread their arms wide, speaking in that scratchy tone. ""Each of you has desired for more. A better go at life. Comfort in knowing you will not worry about your next meal. Simply more in your bank. Well tonight, you all have that chance!""

Sam looked either side. Six others were lit like him, looking around in surprise. All of then looked... normal. A barista from a coffee chain. A man in an ill-fitting suit. A couple of homeless people. A woman in comfortable clothes. And an angry looking tattooed man.

The announcer wasn't done. They gestured behind, as a place lit up. A building that shocked and awed them all, its size grandiose. They looked upon a castle, once that dominated the sky. With towers, buttresses, arrowslits and more, it was everything they could imagine.

The scarlet person let them see it, calling out. ""This is The Dreamers Castle, where you can find what you are after, of you survive. For the rules are simple. Survive a monster of my choice for one night, and you’ll have enough money to last you a lifetime. Tell me, are you willing to risk everything for a chance at a peaceful life?“

The angry man swung up his hand, transforming it into a rude gesture. ""Fuck off! You kidnapped me!""

The faceless one bowed their head. ""Very well. Farewell Tribute.""

The light over him vanished, and Sam heard a muffled cry. One that was soon lost, as he blinked. Suddenly the five others were closer, equally spaced as though the man hadn't existed. He felt his skin prickle, as the... person somehow watched them. ""What are your choices? Risk for reward? Or the safety of a life without?""

He swallowed. He had always wanted a chance. This was it. Or a dream. A hallucination maybe, after being hit by a car? It was too absurd to take too seriously. He raised a hand, calling to them. ""I...I'll go.""

They laughed, a grating sound. ""Marvellous!""

Their gloved hands clicked, making him jump. Light above intensified, before disappearing as he found himself in a hall. An entrance hall it seemed, though the portcullis over the doors proved he had no chance of getting out.

The voice of the announcer boomed overhead, anticipation evident. ""Our first plucky Tribute! How far will you get, versus...!""

A rumbling resonated, a drumroll of heartbeats. It vibrated his chest, making his breathing catch. ""The IJIRAQ!""

Sam turned to see a shadowy figure rise from the ground. It looked human, save forw the antlers sprouting from its head. Then he saw its face, and the vertical eyes and mouth. Burning red eyes locked with him, filled with a malicious, hungry intelligence.

The unseen announcer laughed, claps coming. ""Yes! What a match this will be! Now, Tribute, in the spirit of giving you a fair chance, you have a five minute head start. I wish you luck, and here is a bit of advice. Don't stop running.""

He bit back a curse, seeing the way it looked at him. The way it seemed to crave his death. If this was a dream, he would be fine, right?

But he turned to run nonetheless, a creeping dread filling him. For deep within, he had suspicions that it was nightmarishly, disturbingly, impossibly *real*.",35,1749854217.0
1laraz9,mxophed,"""Alright so those are the rules?""

""Correct, what is allowed, what you can use, and yes you will be provided a head start."" The bizarre entity clarified all my questions before I accepted, but they also seemed quite curious, ""I feel that you were going to accept this challenge even if I refused to elaborate on the rules.""

I gave a shrug, and gave a quick look around at the area as I answered, ""Well, to be honest, with how things have been going your offer is far more appealing than you think.""

""Oh, I know mortals can have difficult existences, but to say surviving being hunted by one of my, pets, is quite unusual.""

I took my place at the start line it had pointed out, and decided to elaborate myself.

""Well, there are several things lining up I guess."" I did some stretching more for my nerves than anything, ""You see I have a...problem.""

The entity moved to my side, a look I guess was inquisitive, as I continued.

""As terrifying as being killed by a monster, having my life cut short would usually be, it is something I have actually already been grappling with.""

I could hear the monster in its cage growling more frantically now, it knew it was going to be hunting soon.

""The thought of what would happen to the people I care for if I was gone scares me far more."" I talked, once again not really to answer but to steel myself for this, ""Would they be alright, financially stable, who would look out for them. Those sorta things.""

The entity now seemed a bit confused, ""That seems like motivation to, Not, take my challenge mortal..?""

""Actually it is the opposite."" I responded, having gained my final nerves for this, ""You see I either survive this, and they will be taken care of, or I die here and they don't have to deal with what comes next.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well according to the doctors."" I took up a running stance at the line, ""I'm gonna die in a few months any way, after more than likely racking up a great deal of medical debt for them.""

The entity grew silent after that.

""Either way...they benefit some way from this."" I took one final look at the entity, ""So, I'll take my chances, and either way I have no intention of dying quietly when I go.""

I looked over my shoulder at the creature in the cage.

""So that thing better be ready for what happens if it catches me.""",14,1749873281.0
1laraz9,mxp9i8v,"""Kakaka! You've really gone and dug a hole this time Vosshy!""

The Slayer's Guild and the Witch's Coven had been allied for many a new moon and while every Slayer was thankful for their sorcerous partners, Vosh did sometimes wish he was assigned an older and more mature ally.  
  
""-are you done-""

""I almost busted my gut when I saw you actually take the devil's deal rather than just cut his head off.""

""Which would have meant certain doom for the folk already caught in his spell so-""

""\*Survive a monster of my choice for one night, and you’ll have enough money to last you a lifetime!\* HA, honestly it's poetic. Genie-like even! You know I'm something of a conniving bitch myself but I don't think I could've found a more fitting twist of the knife.""

""So you know what I'm facing?""

Piercing eyes stared at Vosh through the scrying mirror. Pupils golden and silver seemed to bore through him as they rested on a black and red feather the size of an ox at his feet.

""Aye, I know the beast which hunts you. It is called a Minokawa, a distant cousin to the Roc but even bigger if you can believe that. There are tales from the east which claim that night and day come and go because the sun and moon are running from the Minokawa which seeks to eat them.""

""And if it is empowered by a devil to never tire...""

""It can keep chasing and the sun will never get a chance to rise while it's sleeping. Your one night will never end until one day you keel over from hunger or despair and the devil takes his prize.""

  
Vosh felt a cold sweat on his neck. Not much got Veronica serious and the sudden change in tone worried him more than the description of the beast.

""So it's the bastard child of an overgrown chicken and a dragon. Big deal.""

""The only bastardization here is your brain regurgitating my words but essentially yes. That means while your blade might be able to clip a few feathers it will not pierce the scales underneath. Not that you'd even be able to get a good swing on a beast of that size while it's trying to eat you.""

""So how do I kill it?""

A wide, maniacal grin creeped across Veronica's face. Vosh got the feeling that he was not going to like the answer to his question.

""Why by letting it eat you of course! It's a lot more bird than dragon and while it's clearly not big enough to actually swallow celestial bodies I doubt it's the kind of monster that chews or even has teeth for that matter. So let it eat you! Let's see if our little beasty is as well protected on the inside.""",9,1749883274.0

“Oh how I have waited to say that line.” I say 
That beautiful lady god seems a bit pissed at me. 

The lady god speaks, “You should take this seriously, it ..”

I interrupted her, “ it will be hard, it will be painful, it will be costly, it will be blah blah blah. So what do I get when I win? “ 

The lady god crosses her arms, scowls and says, “if you win, most likely you will fail and die a horrible death as all those before you have.”

“Yah, yah, but when I win. What do I personally get from you? “  I continued “ can I have something from you instead of money?”

Lady God stopped tapping her foot, glaring at me, asked “What are you asking for?” 

I hold out my hand, “make the deal. I will tell you everything once I have won. “ 

Looking suspiciously at my outstretched hand, lady god says “ You must use only what you have on your being right now.  No super future weapons, no help from other beings. Just you. “ lady god timidly raises her hand to mine. 

I grab her hand shaking it vigorously, “DEAL” “no take back sees now my pretty little goddess “ . 

She jerks her hand away, as I turn to face her kraken monster.  
A 20 foot tall hybrid monster with the body of a bull, head of an octopus with 8 tentacles for hair, clawed paws like a bear, and lions tail. All covered in purple scales. 
She should have picked better. 

I reached out with my mind , and pulled a giant oak tree up by the roots. Spun the tree in the air several times. 
Then began beating the lady god monster about the head and shoulders.  
The monster ran around for several seconds. Before sub coming to the beating. And just collapsed on the earth dead. 
Before the lady god could resurrect her monster. I flung it out into space. 

I dropped the tree, turned on the lady god and said, “ I wish for you to become my wife “ 

The lady god looked at me, was about to say something. 

When a voice from the heavens sang out “ Yes, it shall be done.” 

The lady god huffed “But Father, I don’t want to get married, especially to him “ she pouts pointing at me.

1laipjj,mxliyue,"Death, it is a constant, boring to those accustomed to it, and ever unchanging and static. If you see one person die you have seen it happen to all of them, the ways might differ but the result is the same a soul moving on from their plain of origin. One thing that did change though was the way these souls are processed and lead to 'the Afterlife' as mortals called it.

Back when life was barely in the hundreds it was common for a single entity to 'harvest' the souls and personally lead them to what awaited them next, the mortals called them: The Grim Reaper. And they were the most prominent even to this day being the being most mortal believe to be the face they would encounter once they pass, a belief so strong and great in number it became the uniform of my kind. We replaced the singular workforce once they no longer could handle the demand alone and war started becoming a more common thing among mortal nations. And with time technology evolved and war became more horrific more hands were needed and technological inspirations were taken to make our work easier.

The zenith came with the 21st century as mortals called it a time of limitless progress and equally great death a constant that even their truly miraculous inventions could never change. Now each of us had a work station and position like a company hierarchy some reap, some process, some fix things, some lead. No matter which position most have an easy job simply overseeing systems that did the truly difficult work only ever doing something ourselves when something happens, something like what happened to me just this moment.

An error message appeared on the screen of my workstation interrupting a game I was playing, nothing against policy we all do it, and it befuddled me greatly. Now I was not a newbie at the job, I have been working here since the 15th century, thanks to the aftermath of Columbus of course, and I was one of the more stoic ones in fact I usually get excited when I need to do something other than my routine. But this was something I could never have anticipated, the message read the following: **Error - Transfer of Soul not possible.** A simple error I have seen many times before but not the following explanation for it: **Soul already in registry.**

That was the exact statement that confused me but it also intrigued me as to what exactly it could mean. I closed my game, without saving might I add I was that invested, and began digging through the logs and messages that related to this error. Through this I discovered a possible explanation that immediately disappointed me, someone from the reaping department must've messed up something and accidentally split a soul in half, happened before was not fun then but is easy to solve and a non issue nowadays. I hovered over the **Ignore and overwrite soul** option when I got this strange feeling that I should not be hasty, might have been my own desire for something more or fate telling me to stop, whatever it was I took a closer look.",15,1749835515.0

His existence rotates around like on a turn table. and I see him again and again. each different expressions different clothing. Duplicates overlaid on top of each other. 

""How?"" The rotation continues and his duplicates become asynchronized over that rotational axis. An entity, human shaped, with with multiple arms and heads overcomes my hold like it was nothing, a face of wrath finally settles among the multitude as weapons rotate into existence with his hands.

1laipjj,mxm8utj,"**New Changes to the Corporate Structure**

Spreadsheets, proprietary software invented by higher spirits far above my level of enlightenment, and the skimming of emails made up most of my day. For the past millennia or so my job had been slowly siphoned off to the etheral machines that somehow surpassed even the All Knowing in their capabilities of speed and effenciancy. Honestly, if you ask me I think that the All Knowing was just gearing up our higher plain for sell to an even higher one, along with the lower plain of mortals that we administered over. The automation made my life easier at least. Most of the time I just sat around in my office all day watching lifetimes of random mortals for entertainment while ignoring the occasional email about new changes to the corporate structure.

However, not everything was perfect. Every few decades or so I’d have to personally evaluate a soul to make sure the software was functioning properly. The occasional QA if you will. Made work entertaining from time to time. Most of the time though I’d just read off a series of quick questions, input some date into the checkbox, and go on about my decade. The last soul I had was about forty years ago, man named Matt. Middle American, middle aged, mid weight, and with a middling career in middle management. The most run-of-the-mill American man I’d ever seen. I wasn’t even sure why he appeared in my office, his info was so perfect for that demographic that I was sure that it had been a mistake. Oh well, gave me something to do. It was only about five decades later when Matt arrived on my couch again did I grow suspicious.

There he was, almost exactly as I had remembered him. Wearing a button down plaid shirt fit for a manager who came by your desk every few hours with a coffee cup in hand to ask you “are we working hard or hardly working?” Always followed with a chuckle. Plump but not too plump. Jeans with a relaxed fit and a his shirt tucked into them. He sat at the couch on my office with a cheerful almost dimitted smile.

“I’m sorry,” I said the moment I saw him. “I believe there’s been some sort of mistake. You weren’t supposed to have been reincarnated. We abandoned that program millennia ago.”

I remembered those upstart days. We were recycling souls so often because the All Mighty and their team of higher spirits were fine tuning the soul creation process. I worked my ethereal ass off in those days in QA. It really felt like my work meant something then, unlike nowadays. At least this apparent glitch in Matt’s soul provided me with some sort of novelty.

Matt just smiled and said. “I guess my wife was right, I should have prayed more. Because, if I’m back in the office then this is really is Hell.” Followed by a chuckle.

“I assure you that you are not in Hell,” I answered. “We decomissioned the Hell program just two centuries ago. I’m sorry about your reincarnation.”

“Reincarnation?” He asked.

“Do you remember any past lives? Usually coming to the afterlife and remembering them all can lead to a moment of shock.”

Matt shook his head. Okay, weird but sometimes it takes a few centuries or so for the memories to come flooding back after a soul finished its reincarnation cycle.

“Give me a second,” I said reaching for my phone. “I’ll sort this all out and see that you get the proper reincarnation counseling. We have this great therapist, she came from Hell originally, but they say that Hell makes the best councilors.”

I dialed up Dawn. Former reincarnation QA manager, now almost fully enlightened to CSO, the chief soul officer. We go way back, although it had been about half a millennia since we last spoke to one another. She answered.

“What is it Adam?” She asked. (I posit to say here that I am in no relation to the first male soul of the same name, just a conicidnece.)

“I think there’s been a mistake and a soul has been reincarnated again. I was wondering if you knew anything about this.” I said. I looked at Matt who just waved at me with a gentle smile.

Dawn let out a large sigh. The last time I had heard this it was followed by her saying: “There’s a reason why I’m at the top and you’re not.” I didn’t let those remarks get to me, but whenever she sighed it reminded just how much we’ve grown apart since our QA days.

“Do you not read your emails?” She asked.

Not really. Especially not corporate newsletters, but I didn’t say that, instead I said: “Occasionally, but always if it’s addressed to me or Angelia.” Angelina was my manager, very sweet woman but also about as checked out from her job as I was with mine.

“All Mighty, we’re going to have to run another corporate engagement survey aren’t we...” Dawn said to no one in particular.

“Everything okay?” Matt said. I guess he could see the shame in my face.

“So about this Matt situation...” I said.

“I shouldn’t be the one giving you this spiel but since you’re not going to read your emails anyways I guess I’ll say it,” she sighed. I could just see her pressing a finger to her temple in my mind’s eye. “We’re rolling out a new program. New standardized souls for every culture on Earth, at first at least. Plan is to gradually create a standardized soul for the entirety of the lower plain. You, being in QA should have been informed of this. We’re starting with Matt: Median American Testosterone Template. We’ve already delivered out hundreds of thousands of these souls over the past century. Next decade we’ll be rolling out the female counterpart, Sally: Standard American Lady Layout. Understand?”

“I understand that you higher spirits need to get better at acronyms.” I said, with a slight chuckle.

“Do you understand?” She said with no humor.

I looked at Matt, one of many apparently. He smiled and waved. “Tell her she sounds like a very smart lady,” he said to me. I ingnored him. I was not ready for dealing with centuries of men like him. I couldn’t imagine what Sally was like. I guess I’d figure out in due time.

“Yes,” I said. “So you just want me to run some QA on him? Is there a standard I should be reference?”

“Get with Angelia on that,” she said. “Now if you don’t have any other questions I have more important things to do.”

“Why though?” I said.

“Why what?” She said, her annoyance thinly veiled.

“Why the new soul template program?”

”It’s what the All Mighty wants, simple as that.”

If that’s true, I thought, then maybe the rumors were true. Maybe our plain was going to be put on sale soon. I had friends in fellow neighboring plains that had been bought out. It never went well for those on the bottom. Even worse for the souls that resided on the lower plains that they managed.

“Are the rumors true then?” I said.

“It’s what the All Mighty wants, simple as that. Are we done here? I have a meeting to get to.”

“Yeah.”

She didn’t even say goodbye, the line clicked and only the hum of a disconnected line lingered in the earpiece.

“I’ve seen that look before,” Matt said pointing at my face. “Bad call with the boss? I know those, every Monday my manager let me get an earful. Maybe this is hell after all,” he chuckled.

I took a deep breath and loosened up, forcing a smile on my face. “Everything is all good,” I said as I pulled up my old QA list of questions. Opening up the copy from fifty years ago that I had filled in the previous Matt’s answers with. “Now if you don’t mind, I have a list of questions I want to ask you before we send you about your way.”

“Oh I love surveys,” he said. “Do I get to enter a sweepstakes for answering? I always wanted a speedboat but my wife wouldn’t let me have it. Said that money was needed for our daughter’s tuition.” He chuckled. His response was verbatim to the last Matt I had seen.

“Alright, question one,” I said. As we ran through the list of questions I felt my eternal soul die a little on the inside as I prepared myself for our inevitable buyout.

""Did they not explain to you about fixed point time in any of your testing?""

The soul seems somewhat shocked and ashamed

""I mean, y.. yes but what does that have to do with any of this where am I?"" the soul asks me bewildered.

""You're in the office of afterlife management, many call me grim, death, whatever have you. Ultimately I just want to show up to work, do my bit until the shift ends, and go home."" I state flatly

""But how did I... when...""

""Yes! My recently deceased problem case, you've got it! When! Exactly the thing that killed you.""

""But I followed everything else correctly...""

""I get it, you're confused a bit, but there's a reason where every single bit of your testing for a license always made sure you knew not to travel to a fixed point in time""

""How would you know about that?""

""I am not of your plane, time has no meaning here. Everything that is, never happened yet and everything that isn't, is happening now. I swear, you're the fifth case just this afternoon. I had to stop my lunch break early just to...""

""But I thought you said time has no meaning here.""

""Listen, we have a strong union, and I'm proud of what they've done for us. They're a large part of why you're here to begin with.""

""That doesn't make any sort of sense""

""It certainly makes a whole mountain more than deliberately going against the very thing you were taught so frequently! Look, fixed time points exist for a reason. Do you know how awful our work was because of you time travelers? Certain events you just had to go back and alter and fix and alter and fix.""

""Look, I get that but what happens tomorrow is really bad...""

""You think I don't know that!? What's worse is when your kind gets all mixed up in a perpetual war of trying to 'correct' the past. Every person who died 'too young' or every villain who 'should have never risen to power' leaves a whole mountain of time traveling corpses in their wake.""

""Yes, but...""

""No, what will happen, has already happened. It is up to those in the now to guide the events that transpire! You were told that countless times before you passed the exam for your license but apparently it didn't stick.""

"".....well what happens now?""",5,1749860780.0
1laipjj,mxlizq1,"They died at 17:37:04 their soul being successfully reaped and processed instantly and sent to 'heaven', as they call it, for their great efforts in the scientific fields. Then ten seconds later an exactly ten seconds older but otherwise identical soul arrived having been reaped and now is awaiting processing being stuck until I choose what do to. If this indeed was a case of a fragmented soul then the second soul should have arrived at most one or two second later, reaping is not incompetent they notice errors like that faster than anything and act even quicker. But if it wasn't that just what could it be? I dove deeper having to request records of the Time Keepers to actually look at the events that lead to it and I couldn't believe it at first.

I watched as a mortal, the soul in question, entered into the left entrance of a machine with two cylindrical chambers that were not connected and a short moment later exited from the right and then the left both identical and amazed at the sight of the other. Then the right chamber exploded and instantly killed the right, panic spread with the left so shocked they could not move and exactly ten seconds later was killed in the same manner as the left chamber exploded. It explained a part of the problem however it also made more questions and more so created some implications that did not sit right with me.

I called in the soul that was currently stuck in limbo, the metaphorical kind as the real one is just a storage now, and they moved from the old waiting queue, which was kept just for cases like these, toward my office. They entered clutching the pamphlet handed out also for cases like these titled: **A deadly flaw. Your moving on was interrupted, please be patient while the Grim look into it, after all eternity waits for you too.** Not the most comforting but at least well written to explain it all, and by the look on their face they had already read through it. I had them take a seat on the dated grey yet very comfortable couch and began explaining the situation from why they were flagged to my personal theories on what happened. Finally I gave them the floor as they probably had their own pieces of information to help solve this issue, and they in fact had just that.

The machine I had witnessed work and also kill was apparently a prototype cloning machine, something which would create a perfect copy of a physical object, a novel concept and now that I knew what it was a terrifying concept. It meant that the reason why they were flagged was because the machine not only copied the physical but the spiritual creating a second identical soul something which should most definitely not be possible, wither because it is unethical, unnatural, or in my opinion a major complication and possible wrench in our systems. I got to work sending messages to management about this invention and the current situation. Reaction time was always fast with at most a few minutes being needed to solve an issue, however the soul is still in my office hours later, with the only positive I have about it being that I finally have a partner to play games with while I wait for a response.",20,1749835521.0

""Wait, what does that mean for me? What's going to happen to the me right now!?""

""You will slowly fade into nothing, as the folds of time slowly erase the ego that sits so arrogantly before me. You were warned of these things long before ever being able to set foot in your own time machine. While no one ever figured out the science behind it, the one rule that you all agreed upon was to not travel to fixed points. Travelling to fixed points meant death.""

""...but... I don't want to...""

""Just as I don't want to sift through thousands of millions of files manually while you all try to decide which was the best ending to WWII. For death's sake, that was such a nightmare before we implemented the current system.""

""...what can I do?""

""You've got two options really. You can live in the now, for all the better or worse that brings... Or you can live in the past. I'll let you rewatch your entire life, complete with sitcom laughter and music scoring, the works, you've got just enough time to relive it before you completely fade away.""

""...I think I... I would really like to watch that...""

I let out an exasperated sigh. ""Fine by me, take that door out, follow the hallway all the way to the end, third door on your... right? no, left, definitely left.""

""...Thank you, I guess""

The soul quietly, defeated, leaves my office. I sit at my desk and begin filing my report on the situation. Not the worst one I've had to deal with, but far from the best to be sure. My shift ends with no other issues and begin to make my way home. My family greats me warmly and we begin to get ready for dinner.

1laye76,mxp3p2g,"When the aliens first came in peace, they declared they would take away our most miserable humans and make them happy. At first, our world leaders thought this meant throwing all those trapped in poverty. The bottom of the rung. The lowest in the castes.

Turned out, the aliens saw our CEOs and political leaders as the unhappiest people too. Should've seen it coming, to be honest. After some futile exchange of firepower and a nuclear launch that mysteriously disappeared before hitting the alien's spaceship, we let them take whoever they wanted.

And then, they were gone. Just like that.

We humans filled the vacuum fast. Companies appointed new CEOs. We elected new leaders. In the massive shuffle, some people lost their jobs and hit the bottom of the rung. It was almost as though the aliens didn't manage to change anything after removing the unhappiest humans on earth. We were a rather depressing place to live overall, I guess.

It was only a year later, the aliens apologized and beamed back the people they took.

Turns out, they couldn't please those humans. They had grossly underestimated human greed and desire. Humans could only be temporarily pleased by what the aliens gave before wanting more. And more. And more, until the aliens conceded there was no end to this. There was always more to want, there was always something better out there.

Now, there was chaos. The old leaders wanted their positions back. The new leaders weren't about to back down. The lines were drawn. New elections were called for. Finances were fought over. Some country leader almost launched a nuke, only to be stopped by the aliens, who were regretting their attempt to bring happiness to the most miserable of mankind. 

There was only so much the aliens could do. They could disarm us so we didn't destroy each other in mutually assured destruction. They could provide material comforts and try to fulfil wishes. Temporarily. but they couldn't do anything to actually make us happy for long. They couldn't make us stop being flawed humans with endless desires.

As World War III erupted, it was at this moment, the aliens knew, they fucked up.

As I duck from a blow, I realize how to make my headquarters completely self-sufficient.  
It is a wonder, to be honest.  
My powers and intelligence scale based on how much pressure I feel under.  
As the hero keeps getting closer, and the hits almost land, I get a huge boost, and I escape.  
I get back to my hideout, and start renovating it.  
Though, it feels a bit odd.  
Why do I always manage to escape?  
Eh, maybe the boost catches them by surprise.

  
Day by day, I try making my plans work.  
Alas, without pressure, I can't really figure them out, but I can't complain.  
My civilian persona is an accountant, so I get plenty of ideas while I am at my day-job.  
Also...  
I started dating recently, and I love her, adore her, she's perfect.  
I don't know what I did to deserve meeting such an angel, but...  
I am about to meet her really strict parents.  
And oh boy, the pressure is building up.

I just cured 18 incurable diseases, and I know how to disseminate this information for it to be unable to be blocked, or faked, or stolen from me.

Have created a bacteria that will eat away all the plastic, and other pollutants it can find, then simply dissolve in non-harmful elements.  
And I still have 2 more days until I met her parents.  
God...I am a wreck.  
And all the power, and intelligence can't help me find a way to calm down or impress them.  
And the heroes noticed this.

""Relax, they will like you. But they will like you even more if you aren't a villain."" he says, before flying away.  
That was weird.  
I leave, and for the next day I busy myself.  
When its time to meet the parents, I am a shivering mess.  
""Relax, they will love you!"" my girlfriend says, as the door opens.  
""Dad! Mom!"" she says, hugging the two who appeared...and I froze.

Mr. Ray and Captain Volcano...two top-tier heroes, and apparently, the parents of the love of my life.  
""H-Hello! I am John S-Smith, a pleasure to meet you!"" I say, trying to keep it chill.

All the cowardly clerks start running for a back door. 
I turn as the first guard reaches me, laying hands on me. 
Guard 1 “listen here fellow “

I turn my head, flick my hand. Guard 1 flies backwards into the wall. Landing with a thud. 
I flick my fingers, Guards 2 & 3 , smash against each other crumpling to the floor. 

The vein on my head throbs, all the computers in the county clerk’s office explode. 
I strut out the door. 
Vending machines empty their contents. Parking meters wilt and bend over to the side walk. 

I think to my super AI , Sindy , “ send out the new system to replace the local government computer system, setup, have AI Bob run operations and storage.  Replace all employees with new pleasant robots”. 

Thinking “Sindy let’s buy that de-commissioned base outside the city. “ 
Sindy responds “John there is a silent alarm at your bank, apparently it is being robbed, I have deployed the robot squad. But you are around the corner “. 

I think back “ yes yes, I am on my way. That is where I keep my gold.”

I break into a sprint. 

I arrive at the doors, there is a U-Haul truck parked half on and off the curb. 

I pull open the doors, pausing to catch my breath. I yanked the doors open.  I strolled into the lobby. 

5 individuals dressed all in black with ski masks covered faces, holding a variety of weapons. One with a male voice was yelling for the tellers to empty their drawers, while a female voice was screaming, who is the manager.  A individual by the doors noticed me. Starts to raise his shotgun barrel to point at me. The others are occupied with the employees and customers of my bank. 

I flick my wrist, shotgun guy crumples to floor. 
I YELL “ STOP, HOW DARE YOU!”

Every one falls silent and turns their attention to me. 

Good, vein throbbing, waving both hands, like I am conducting a symphony.  I lift up the four of the robbers simultaneously. Slamming them into the ceiling then down to the floor, and up and down many times. Till I heard someone vomit 🤮. I figured I might have over done it a bit. As I let their crumpled bodies rest on the floor. 
The robot squad arrived, my robots began escorting customers then employees out to parking lot. 
The police arrived as I walked away. 

I glanced up in the sky, is that Miss Marvelous. Guess better to be late than never. 

I think to Sindy, “make sure the vault stays locked down “ “can’t have the law and Miss Marvelous sniffing around my gold “ 

Where are all the buses ? 

Sindy replies “someone stole all the diesel for the buses and trucks “

I get angry as I have to walk everywhere now. “Ok Sindy put out we need more employees for our new hydrogen fuel plant and for our hydrogen fuel buses. I just don’t have enough workers to build. “ 

Sindy asks “ have you decided what you want to do about henchmen, I mean employees healthcare?” 

I think at Sindy “yes, we are going to hostile takeover Memorial Hospital, beef staff with robots and all those Veterans we hired at job fair. All employees get free care as long as they treat at our hospital. “  

Sitting in n my office, I say out loud. “Sindy, I want barren land around the base we bought. I have an idea how to make it fertile for crops. “  

Sindy asks “do you want to buy it?” 

I replied “ steal, foreclose or pay as little as possible. “

For a few minutes, bricks, mortar, and human body parts rained down on him, making him chuckle. I was close to him, so I could hear him muttering, ""...like tears in the rain,"" before he laughed.

I could almost touch him, but I opted to stay hidden and take a few steps back, as the falling debris and blood might have revealed my invisible form.

Screams and cries filled the air as parents, who had rushed to save their children, realized there was nothing left to save.

I shouldn't be bothered by all this.

Society never did anything for me but shunned me and kicked me in the face.

Why should I help them?

Could I even help them? I had never unleashed my powers beyond playing pranks on stupid supes.

My eyes locked onto a tiny hand on the floor, clutching a teddy bear soaked in blood.

It was so small. It could fit in the palm of my hand like a marble.

So small.

I couldn’t see. Everything was misty. The tears burned as they rolled down my cheeks.

I could feel a numb pain in my jaw. Why was I grinding my teeth so hard?

It took me a minute to recognize this rage swelling inside me.

Kids never hurt me.

Kids loved me.

Even if their parents told them to stay away since I wasn't a good role model with all those practical jokes they didn’t care.

They would laugh, point at me, share their sweets and fruit, and ask me funny little questions.

Kids never did anything to deserve this.

They didn’t get a chance to make up their minds, to choose a side.

My knuckles were white from squeezing my fists too hard.

He turned, looking straight into my eyes:

""I can smell you, coward. I can feel your fear. Run. Run, or you’ll end up just like these puny humans, crushed into a bloody pul—""

I lost control.

One of my arms swung—faster than sound—with a crack like a jet breaking the sound barrier. He didn’t even get a chance to blink before it made contact with his jaw, the bones piercing his cheeks and being ground into dust from the force of the blow.

The blow didn’t just crush most of his head—it launched him into a low orbit.

A few minutes later, I saw the rest of him burning up as he reentered the atmosphere.

His ashes mixed with the rubble and body parts, falling on crying parents like black snow.

I wiped my tears, and his ashes left dark lines on my cheeks.

Barely a villain. Just enough to keep the heroes annoyed and amused.

But it's just a role.  
A performance.  
A mask with a sweeping grin wide enough to hide the truth.  
Because there's a shadow beneath the laughter—older than the city, colder than the midnight streets.  
A presence I don't let anyone notice.

I've been around longer than anyone remembers.  
I ended empires when their first stone temples stood.  
I whispered the last breath from gods, whose names have been lost to dust.

I got tired...

You can't understand what it's like to carry that many endings.  
To hold every final heartbeat, every last scream...  
Every mother's last goodbye...

So I walked away from it.  
I folded up my cloak and buried my blade at the edge of the universe.  
I made a new name for myself.

Oftentimes we would sit on the rooftops after she stopped one of my ""crimes"".  
We would eat greasy fries and make jokes back and forth.  
I liked her more than I should have.  
Quiet smiles. Quick glances. Moments where my mask almost slipped.  
I don't know if she ever saw through me, or if she even tried.  
But I could be with her, and nothing else would matter.

Then came Oblivion...

Just a slight redirection, so the superheroes would never actually hit hard, by ensuring they were half a foot further back, just for a brief moment on ""impact"".  They always thought it was some sort of kinetic storage skill that let me absorb their blows.  Left me as a warning that only the heaviest hitters could throw down with me, and that I was too irritating to actually jail.

Heh.  And when the heavy hitters came in, complaining about my being a waste of time, the pranks were hilarious.  Training them in case a monster came around, or some threat we'd have to team up for, even if they never realized it.

Glitter bombs, burning bags full of dog poop that they'd never picked up behind them as they walked their dogs.  Mailing them various things at their homes and jobs, just to mess with them.

Oh, I can't forget the paint grenades in their underwear and sock drawers!  They still haven't figured out how I'm doing it!

""It wasn't like all those other kids that do crimes, not really.  I did it for the laughs, to mess with them, not to steal.  To bring smiles to the kids, to ensure they'd have a good laugh."" I admit, in the privacy of my own mind.  ""Can't be too careful with what I whisper, after that one guy who could hear whispers came to town.  What was his name again?  Whisperbro?  Something like that.  He's currently on the Super Dudes, the local Hero group after all...""

Still, Blackjack had never figured it out, nor did his Super Dude buddies, for what I was up to.  Fun times!

Then I pause, looking down at a new shadow on the ground in the alleyway, before slowly looking up.

My attention focuses firmly on the flying saucer shaped thing of one 'Professor Aeromind, Villain Extraordinaire'.  I can't help but put my face in my free palm.

Seems like my break's over with.

It's a simple matter to amplify the distance of where I am, so I'm in my hidden lair.

A few moments to change, and I'm ready to face off with my most annoying foe yet... a villain that didn't realize I was training the heroes for extra-terrestrial foes, rather than them.

""And now,"" I muse as I reappear, putting on my voice of HAM as I walk past the local news crew, ""it's time for the Irritant to walk once more!  To irritate the heroes, to mess with the villains, and to make national TV collectively wonder if they're smoking something, and if so, why they're not sharing with their audiences!""

I grin, as the police cordon aptly freaks out at the realization that I somehow got past them.

Then my frown dies, as I spot a badly injured Blackjack on the ground, missing one arm.  Idly, I focus and amplify how fast his healing is countering the blood loss.  Won't be any good if I trained him this far, only for him to die on me, right?

""Ah, Blackjack.  It looks like you've been disarmed by a foe!"" I smile under my mask, letting him see my toothy grin.  ""Needing some help there, old acquaintance?  Perhaps a hand?""

""I would rather die than take help from a vi-wait, it's YOU."" Blackjack snarls, before blinking at the slow realization that I'm in front of him as his snarling rant dies, replaced by confusion.

""Buddies not faring so well?""  I ask, looking up at the flying saucer overhead.  Distantly, I can make out loud laughter, and screams of ""This is the end for you fools!"" from the distant craft.

""That's an understatement.  He's figured out how to use dimensional warping to displace arms and legs."" Blackjack admits.  ""I'm bleeding out, and my Super Dudes are up there without me as their heavy hitter.""

Idly, I focus, and with a twitch of power, I amplify how fast the warping technology will take before it runs out.

Both of us stare, as an almost eldritch looking monster claw drops in front of Blackjack rather than a human hand.

""Was that my hand?!""  Blackjack stares in utter terror, as I finally let myself frown.

""Looks like he's cooked up something new and irritating.""  I finally admit aloud.

""No sh-"" Blackjack starts to snarl, as I put up one finger in front of his lips.

""Not in front of the camera crews, Blackjack!  You're a hero, after all.  Act the part."" I amplify my whisper into his ear, ensuring the cameras don't pick it up.

""You're right.  As much as it pains me to admit it, I don't think your villainous ways are going to be up to snuff against whatever the mad Professor has cooked up this time, Irritant."" Blackjack shakes his head.  ""So long as the power source of that craft is giving him nigh-unlimited power, we have no chance against him!""

Idly, I look up, before the flying saucer starts smoking as I amplify the main reactor of the ship, into a distant sun.  Just to be safe, after all.  No risk chancing him having made some crazy failsafe bomb or something.

Watching it lose power and drop, I amplify how slow it's going, so it looks more like a controlled descent than a crash.  Inside, I can hear screaming from Professor Aeromind, as he discovers the joy of all his technology failing to work without it's precious power source.

""How did it fail?""  Blackjack stares in confusion.

""Perhaps an irritation happened, which left his technology aimed upon it's own power core?"" My grin at Blackjack never wavers.

Slowly, the hero raises one finger up while staring at me, then lowers it.  ""I swear, if your superpower is LEGITIMATELY being the most irritating person in existence, I'm going to want to hurt you.""  He finally bites out.

""Ah, my old foe.  It's not your skills.  It's how you use them!  Now, I've been working hard at making sure there's a 'no killing' policy on the villains side of things, and you've been working to do the same for the heroes.  Shall we both be irritating for our mutual nemesis and introduce him to what happens when heroes and villains team up to deal with people like him, that don't get the memo?""  I whisper into his ear, amplifying the sound once more.

Slowly, Blackjack grins to match mine, as he realizes exactly what my plan is.

For once, we're on the same exact page.

I'm going to enjoy paying Professor Aeromind a beating.



A few days later, I'm casually sipping on another ice cold drink with lots of flavored shaved ice, from a corner store, as I walk through the city once more.

The heroes have finally realized I may have more tricks up my sleeve than they realize.

Alas, for poor Professor Aeromind, his discovery of what it would be like to lose all four of his limbs during transport has rather become irritating for him.  Somehow they wound up in the middle of the sun.

Hmm.  Pity his plans for replacing the Super Dudes with a legion of mind controlled parasites grafted onto their bodies, somehow failed in it's entirety.

Somehow the parasite infected limbs wound up in the sun, too!

And if I'm subtly working in the background to amplify how many superheroes and supervillains might rise up with new healing powers, or powers involving building prosthetic limbs, who's to know?

No fuss, no muss, no issues.

And I get back to messing with Blackjack, by buying him one of the things I'm slurping on, just to irritate the hell out of him.

""Hey there, buddy.  Looks like you're missing a hand!  So let me give you one, by buying you one of these on me, huh?"" is the last thing he hears before I drop one into his remaining hand, and walk off.

""Hey, you left the straw cover on!  I can't get it off with one hand!"" is what I distantly hear from him as I walk out of sight, before I let my grin fade as I realize I'd forgotten something important the past few days.

It's a bit past time to amplify the length between alien invasion attempts, again.

The local stars are starting to run out of room with the last 57 attempts, due to their new super-metals in their star ships.  Whatever they've started to come up with that keeps their ships safe, at least.  And it's seriously getting on MY nerves.

Then a ranting Blackjack, still in civilian guise rounds the corner, shouting about ""You should get this straw cover off for me, you irritating- *wait a minute.""*

To grin or not to grin, and possibly let him realize it's me.  That is the question.",110,1749826450.0
1la8u3x,mxiz5w2,"I am doing the thing I usually do as a villain: have fun.  
So I tease, and flirt with the ladies at the market, and all around town to be honest.  
Annoy some patrolling heroes.  
Every now and then take something without paying, and chuckle as I run away.  
It is fun.  
As I am charming this new flower shop owner, whom I tried to impress for weeks now, hard to get women, but it is so worth, a huge explosion shocks us.  
I protect her from collapsing rubble.

  
""Thank you."" she says.  
I smile at her, and want to work my charms, as I finally got the opportunity, but several other explosions occur.  
I protect her, and take her out of the store, but seeing her life in ruins...she faints.  
I am pissed.  
""Who the fuck ruined my chance?"" I mutter, as I teleport away.  
In the middle of the town, a villain is laughing, as he is waving around one of the superheroes' arm.  
""Is this what you can do? This is all you heroes amount to?!  
Ha! This town will be mine from now on!"" he laughs, throwing the hand away.  
I catch it, and take it to the hero...  
He always plays along.

  
""Who are you?"" the villain asks.  
""Prankster! Run! He is a real villain!"" one of the heroes say.  
I chuckle.  
Man, how lucky I am.  
""I am the villain of this town, so piss off newbie."" I say to him.  
He laughs, and attacks me, raining down what seems a miniature sun on me.  
I sneeze, and it is snuffed out.  
He freezes.  
""Sorry, did I destroy your toy?"" I ask.  
""Who are you?"" he asks gravely.  
I snap my fingers, and every hero, and citizen, and camera gets some nighty-nighty time.  
I don't want them to know.  


""This town is my playground. Once again, piss off, before I get mad."" I smile at the villain.  
He snorts.  
""Do you know who you are talking to?!"" he roars, as 9 suns appear behind him, starting to melt the surroundings.  
I slap him away, and watch as he flies into the sun.  
""If you like suns so much, go take a hike in one."" I mutter, and snap my fingers.  
The town is restored, and the people slowly wake up, with faint memories of what happened.  
I chuckle, and go back to talk with Flora.  
She's a bit cold once more, after all, she forgot that I saved her...  
Oh, I should have tortured the dude more, though, to be honest.  
I like a challenge.  
""Hey Flora..."" I smile, as I watch her roll her eyes, but there is a slight smile there, hidden.  
I am getting there, slowly.",264,1749801229.0
1la8u3x,mxlmfpk,"""Oh great heavens, what is going on here?"" i say looking at the few corpses on the ground, some battered heroes all around and some edgelord in dark armor covered in blood.

One of the supes turned to me and with angry tone screamed: ""We really don't have time to deal with your bullshit now Mustachio!""

To be honest i got a bit offended. It was ""Mr. Mustachio"" he wasn't my friend or lover to call me by just ""Mustachio"" Nevertheless my grin never wavered. I fixed my top hat, smoothed out my black coat and twirled my moustache.

""Oh but there is no need for such foul language friend. Who knows? Maybe i'm not going to do any mischief today. Pray tell me, who is this goon over there?"" - I answered him and he looked at me flabbergasted before he took a deep breath and shared some information.

""He calls himself Krieg. He surfaced a month ago and began going from town to town doing damage, stealing etc. We managed to stop him everytime so far but it's not looking good..."" - he looked uncertain, some minor wounds on his arms propably didnt help his confidence

""I see, thank you, it's rare to see such wise younglings like you these days. Sleep well, you might have just saved the rest of your friends"" i said while extending my cane forward. 

""Sleep? What are you talking abou--"" He didn't finish the thought. At the same time he stopped talking entire battlefield fell quiet. Including all the heroes, Krieg himself and propably half the town

Slowly without haste i walked towards - now uncouncious - man in dark armor. I took a rock that was laying nearby and sat on it. 

""Wake up friend. It is unbecoming of a knight to rest during battle.""

He shook his head as he looked at me, clearly struggling to wake up. 

""What the fuck just happened? Why was i sleeping... "" - he looked around - ""The fuck?! Why are they sleeping?!"" 

I shook my head - ""Calm down knight, by using such dirty words you bring shame to your fellows. Why don't you sit down and talk with me for bit hmm?"" 

He still looked confused. After a bit he sat down near me and looked at me warily - ""Who are you? What did you do?!"" - he asked his voice clearly not very calm. 

""Now now, calm your nerves, all in due time. I am Mr. Mustachio. I am a local expert in everything villainy, a true master of devious plans and a gentleman that makes all ladies weak in their knees"" - i handed him my business card and continued - "" What did i do you ask? Well I simply stopped you from breaking everything"" - i laughed

He looked even more confused. ""But why?! It says on your business card you are a villain, why stop me?! If you joined me, you could just make them fall sleep and we would have won easily!"" 

""No, no, no friend, you don't understand. I am not interested in you winning! If you killed all the heroes. What would i do? You can't be a villain without some heroes silly goose!"" - he looked at me as if I was insane, but he was somewhat used to that i guess since he didn't really press me on the matter. 

""But what kinda trick you used? How did you make us all fall asleep? It seems very convenient, i wanna buy whatever you used off you."" - he said with a smile. 

I smiled in response - ""You are wrong again friend! I used no trick, it's unbecoming of a gentleman to do that! I only play with the cards I've been give by fate. Nature itself has given me power to dominate the will of others you see!"" 

I saw him focus his gaze on me. I now had his sole attention

""Seems very powerful... And you could affect me... What are you doing in this shitty town? If you wanted to be a true villain im sure with that power you could have made it big.""

My smile widened more - ""And you wouldn't be wrong my friend! Let me tell you a secret, just between us. I actually used to rule you!"" - i saw him furrow his brows before and tense up as i continued - ""And i dont mean just you, i mean all of you! The whole world was mine!"" 

He took a step back - ""What are you talking about? That's impossible..."" - i looked at him - ""Is that so? Then why did you just take a step back? Did you perhaps remembered something? Or rather... Is it possible i let you remember something?"" 

He went pale and his knees went out in an instant- ""no No NO THERE IS NO WAY! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO? HOW DID I FORGET YOU... YOU FUCKING MONSTER GET AWAY FROM ME"" 

Now this was a reaction i was more used to back in the day 

""You see power to dominate wills is really, Really powerful, you can make someone bring you coffee, bend their knees, kill their family, or make the whole world forget you ever existed. But it gets boring pretty quickly... Sometimes you just want to go smaller you know?"" - i stood up and began walking in his direction

""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU JUST LET ME GO I WILL DO WHATEVER PLEASE..."" - his voice broke down - ""please just let me go...."" - he was almost whimpering at this point.

""I would let you go friend. But..."" - i look at one of the corpses laying nearby - ""You see the one with golden cape laying over there? I liked that one, he was so nice he even went out on tea with me once!"" 

He was terrified. Tears steaming down his face as pure terror set in, some, or most of it implanted by me. I wanted him to taste true fear. 

""So now, why don't you do me a favor, fly away from here, go into the ocean and once you are... Let's say 500 meters under the surface take off your helmet okay?"" 

""NO NO, PLEASE FORGIVE ME I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN PLE-"" he didn't finish. His body unvoluntarily set off the engines and flew off. 

I took out my pocket watch and checked the time - ""If they wake up in 5 minutes i think it would suffice... I'll make them think a meteor hit or something..."" - i talked to myself as I started walking away not really in mood for more villainy today. 

""ah"" - i remembered - ""i need to take out my hilariously oversized money bag from laundry, tomorrow will be a truly legendary stunt for Mr. Mustachio, Muahahaha""",43,1749836477.0

1la8u3x,mxll6e4,"The Mountain of a Creature out of Lovecraft horror novel stood in the middle of Downtown. 
The Amazing 5 super heroes lay torn to pieces on the ground around the Creature feet. 
The Creature was chewing on the last head he had just bitten off of Girl Wonder. 
Major Euro head was gone, presumably eaten before I arrived. The IT was just stones scattered across the ground.  
The twins Freeze and Fire lay on the ground missing arms and legs, heads crushed. 
Lots of blood everywhere, I mean buckets and buckets of blood.  

I could feel my rage growing. 
I stepped out into the open. 

“STOP , you vile and foul beast, how dare you? HOW DARE YOU???” I yell at the beast. 

The Creature stops chewing and looks down its nose at me. Says “run and hide little huuumen, I sense no power in you “.

I grit my teeth, ball my hands into tight fists. Concentrate, one by one veins bulge on my forehead. 

The Creature right arm moves, grabbing a bus from the street near by. 
The Creature right arm slams the bus into its own face over and over. The Creature left hand tries to stop its right, to no avail. 
Soon the Creature is rolling on the ground left hand and both feet trying to stop its right arm from bashing the bus into it face. Black blood and gore fly from the continuous beating. 

Time passes, the Creature is Laying limp on the. I let the right arm fall to the ground. The bus falls out of its dead fingers. 

I collapse to the ground exhausted. I need rest.

1la8u3x,mxkz1ri,"The moth was pissed, this was his playground! These bulbs were HIS to bonk, those cotton fabrics were HIS to destroy, and damnnit! Those self righteous heroes were his to annoy the shit out of too. 

He perched on a building, wings folded, scanning. He was not going to let someone named ""dread"" ruin his fun. He killed two speedsters (he forgot their names), The meercat, and even good ol bosco. 

He saw it almost immediately, four meta humans, dressed all the same, trying to fight dread, in the middle of the sky, they weren't even from their lovely city of Alecville. They seemed to be losing. The moth didn't want to be a hero.  but being rich gives you access to some strange but completely legal things, like a colony of carnivore moths that can eat a cow in two minutes. That could be used for good, 

He flapped away, the moth had trained his little buddies to only eat dread shaped foods, hoping they would only crave the organic locally sourced asshole that decided to ruin everything. 

He was treading air beneath the five meta humans when he released his henchmen and henchwomen. 

The moth did not look. It was rather ugly just hearing dread scream as he lived the very common nightmare of being eaten by creepy crawlies. He did her the faint clatter of clean bones hit the ground as the moths slowly returned to their master. 

The four meta humans looked at him, in awe and shock, a nobody with wings just appeared out of nowhere and dissolved a tier one villain.

The moth tried his best to sound evil, 

""Let this be a lesson to anyone who encroaches on the mild annoyances of the moth!"" 

The four heroes quickly took him by the arms and dragged him across the sky, the one who looked like their leader turned to the supposed villain. ""I really do not care if you think you are a villain, the whole city owes you a steak dinner... but that was just creepy. The blue defenders will never interfere with your annoyances if you don't do that again.""

1la8u3x,mxmbdfn,"Thirty minutes into the hostage situation and I was really running out of steam. I'd only prepared enough material for about five minutes of monologue, but I'd only heard about the financial troubles of The Buns yesterday and if I didn't act soon my favorite bakery would be shuttered. So I'd been improvising. And after half an hour of improvised villain monologue it gets pretty hard to avoid repeating yourself or to say something that someone might take seriously enough to use as real inspiration. I wanted to avoid a Manson cascade. I usually took pride in my monologues, but this had been a rush job. Historically opposed to the idea, I decided next time to use AI.

I was about to start reiterating my points on how bank notes were printed by moon men when I saw the sluggish form of Stupendous Man meander through the air, and then slowly craahed through the plate glass window at the front of the bank.

""Stop raiding that vault, villain, or soon you'll be the one locked up!"" He extolled. Oh Paul. Those improv classes aren't really helping.

""That's far enough, STUPID-nous man!"" I said. ""Come any closer and I'll..."" uh... well, who was I to judge in the banter game? ""Do something we'll all regret!""

""Not so fast, you fiend!"" He said, flying towards me. Stupendous Man was the best hero in the city, which is to say woefully inadequate. He'd managed to double his flight speed since I started working with him, but it was still maxing out at around a dozen miles per hour.

I forced myself to stammer as he flew up to me, landed, squared up and then wound up for a punch. Paul could lift a few tons, but his striking strength was barely above a civilian who did pushups. Plus he was slow. And he telegraphed EVERYTHING. I'd been planning to get him into boxing classes. I knew the owner of a boxing gym downtown, who'd taught me to fight when I was a teen, a real stand up guy who ran free classes to underprivileged youth. I planned to do something to threaten the gym, and Stupendous Man would swoop in to stop me, and the owner, in his gratitude, would offer to train him for free. It would be a win win situation. The gym would get a little fame, and new paying customers to help pay the bills, it would be slightly more convincing to throw these fights. I decided to move up my timetable on that. I'd do it as soon as I could write a convincing monologue.

What would the theme be? Something about keeping the city weak so I could more easily dominate it? Something along those lines. Then a thought occurred. Maybe boxing wasn't right for Paul. There was a Muy Tai place that just opened. And a mixed martial arts place. Grappling would be great for him with that lifting strength. But the MMA place was across town for Paul and the last thing I wanted was more of his time spent stuck in traffic.

Paul drove a beat up 92 Buick with shoddy air conditioning and a radio that only worked sometimes, and I know getting across town in that thing, during rush hour, wasn't pleasant. And flying was even slower for him. So he liked to drive somewhere, find somewhere inconspicuous, and then change into his costume. He ran a food bank and paid himself a salary that only vaguely resembled a 5 digit number. In his free time, when he wasn't dealing with me, he volunteered. Everywhere. He built houses, he worked in the soup kitchen, read to kids at the library, walked the dogs in the shelter. He cleaned litter in the local parks and led a scout troop. It had gotten to the point that I needed to monitor his schedule to plan my villainy so I didn't interrupt him.

His punch connected, and I reacted appropriately. I rocketed backwards, flipping end over end, modifying my course to avoid one of the ""hostages"" who had begun to stand up. I collided with the wall of the vault, making sure to hit hard enough to leave a me shaped hole in the plaster that covered the reinforced vault wall. I'd impacted upside down, and teleported a blood capsule into my mouth and bit down. I pried myself free, falling to the ground, and slowly stood, making sure to sway a little like I couldn't get my balance.

A trickle of ""blood"" ran from my lip and I spit the rest of the capsule out. If I did it right, they might think it was a tooth. ""Is that all you've got?"" I slurred, squaring up.

""I'm just getting started!"" Stupendous man said. He lifted gingerly off the ground, ambled forward through the air and raised his fist for another punch. He wasn't going to land for this one? He was learning!

With a yelp I dove out of the way. He glided over me as I scrambled to my feet, pulling myself behind the teller desk. Stupendous man landed in  front of a kid who gaped up at him. ""Don't worry, lad, you're safe now."" He said, confidently, and turned towards me.

""We'll see how safe you can make anyone!"" I screamed, and ripped a pen from the desk, the little bead chain with it. I spun it around. ""You've heard the pen is mightier than the sword, but in my hands it's deadlier, too! Take this!"" I released the pen, and it sailed across the lobby and bounced harmlessly against his chest.

He stared down at it for a moment before locking eyes with me again. ""Looks like you brought a pen to a sword fight. Should have brought a sword! Now get ready to face my swords."" He held up a fist. ""Justice."" He held up his other fist. ""And honor."" I quickly did the math, calculating how much I'd need to increase my donations to the theater group so that they could open a second location close to Paul's house, allowing him to attend improv classes more frequently. I'd need to make sure a studio was available, the yoga place would work. I figured an unexpected windfall of half a million would let the owner retire. I'd need to make sure nobody else rented the place in the meantime, that tattoo artist had an eye on the space but I preferred to keep her downtown, there was a bus stop for the local school right there and I'd rather the kids see actors when they got off the bus than a tattoo artist. Although the tattoo artist did need a new location, the little strip mall wasn't getting much foot traffic these days, and if I moved her out I could turn it into a medical plaza, which would be much more convenient for the retirement community just outside town. Where would I put her? There was the spot besides the dive bar, but her work was pretty tasteful and the clientele there wouldn't appreciate it. Well, that was ok, the bar owner could move in to the old Thai restaurant that closed down a few years back. It wouldn't be hard to get him in there, and I could arrange for him to win tickets to some tropical destinations to inspire him to convert it to a tiki place. We needed a good tiki bar downtown.",15,1749843736.0
1la8u3x,mxmyay2,"It was they night they brought that Pollack wannabe's crap modern ""art"" to the museum. I walked up to the wall, then blipped past it.

That's what I call it when I teleport. Blipping.

It's how I started getting called ""The Blip"".

So I sauntered through the place, took a minute to appreciate the Renoir, put googly eyes on some statues, put their mummy in the Saturday Night FEVER pose. I was in no hurry. I had all night and I was going to treat that hideous set of squiggles like a paint by numbers set; I couldn't wait to see the artist have a meltdown at the premiere.

I turned a corner and that's when I saw them. Captain Virtue and The Peace Princess. The Violet Vindicator. The Hellsquirrel. Almost the whole damn Lawcorps roster. Their heads were on the floor, lined up in a row. Their bodies... I'd need a week to sort out who's was who's. They were just spare parts and stains.

Standing in the middle was The Kogethian. I still don't know where Kogeth is, but I really hope he was the exception. The last time he'd come to town, he'd said he was the harbinger of an invasion, but was banished.

The people who did the banishing were the peopleburger sprayed on the walls now.

""What... what did you do?""

The Kogethian looked up from beneath his hood.

""You are called Blip. Walk away and you will not suffer their fate. I have no quarrel and you're not my concern.""

To my surprise, I was shaking. Not with fear. With anger.

""You killed the Princess. Why did you do that?""

""You are a villain in their world. You have little power, but you use it to do as you please. You understand why.""

""Princess... helped people. The Captain was a tool and Hellsquirrel was a psychopath, but... they all helped people! How could you?""

""Do you mourn them? Pathetic.""

My blood went cold. I stopped being happy.

""Did you just insult me? How dare you... how dare you come to my world...?""

""Don't posture, worm."" The Kogethian laughed. ""You have never done anything more impressive than shift your body a few meters at a time and you do nothing but make fun of people. You're a buffoon. Now leave before I decided you've bored me.""

I started walking towards him. I hadn't figured out what I was doing yet... but this was not OK.

The robed conqueror raised a gauntleted hand. I felt the stirrings of his power. He was going to throw lightning at me I think. 

"" Worm... die.""

No lightning shot out though. His arm went limp at the elbow like a wet sock. He looked at it and as much as I felt his malice, I felt his surprise.

I dropped his radius and ulna on the floor.

""What? How?""

""Do you know what it takes to teleport? At least the way I do it? You have to be aware of every molecule, every subtle force. And then you shift some of them. Like your femurs.""

As they blipped into my hands, I tossed them on the floor, too. The Kogethian shrieked as he hit the floor.

He screamed at me.

""I'll kill you!""

""I'm still talking."" I brought his jaw to me this time. The hard way. Through his skin. 

""Kogeth, "" I said calmly. ""I feel everything for light years. All the time. I realize how pointless this mud ball is. I have a perspective even someone like you, who walks through worlds, can't begin to comprehend. And when I see the pride and pettiness of this tiny spec, it makes me want to demonstrate just how silly everyone is being.""

I gestured and the quarter deflated warlord rose into the air, held there because I decided it. He stared at me with utter contempt.

"" But you... you're just a dick.""

I crushed him into a super dense marble. Slowly. Over the next hour. I kept his body running so he'd feel it.

1la8u3x,mxoj4g9,"Art is made better by working within restraints. Only use specific colors, use a specific brush style, use charcoal instead of pencil, or only use a kid's box of crayons to name a few I've tried. 

I was even nice enough to give the kids her crayons back when I was done with that piece.

Artistry is an interesting pursuit; to add is as important for a constructive sculpture (like combining trash), as removal is for reductive sculpture (like stone carving).

In all these pursuits, however, I maintain one simple rule. Nothing irreversible.

It sounds more restrictive than most think, you obviously can't kill, but you can steal. You obviously can't deface and practice reductive sculpture, but you *can* swap something with something that looks like you defaced or destroyed it. And painting ridiculous cartoon monocles on political posters is a time honored tradition. 

But for someone like me, the rules are that much more... maleable. Moldable. Like putty. That's because things, and to a degree even people, are flexible to my will. I can manipulate them so, but their minds can be altered, or they may suffer through longer term effects. 

That is not allowed, because the rule says it is not allowed, and I would be a poor artist if I did not keep true to my rules. 

So, I can modify people, but in minor ways. A snap of my fingers and their hair is dyed, a useless flourish with a marker, and the cartoon monocle appears on their face. But never damage to clothes. An embarrassment like that is never recoverable, let alone reversible.

Yet this upstart seems to believe that it is not me, but my tools that cause such changes. They have marched through, destroying scenery, breaking property, killing people. Little is left, and certainly not enough that it can be reverted. Especially not the lives lost. 

Yet for all their power, they have not yet faced a true reality warper. I issued a challenge, laid out salt in a large circle, and waited for their arrival. They came, they saw the circle, and they laughed, ""Are you making your death into a final art piece?""

""No, I'm amending my rule. That I may do irreversible things within these boundaries.""

""Then I shall strike you down without even entering.""

""You can try,"" I reply with an easy smile. 

And, credit where due, they try. They use beams of heat and of cold, they use physical projectiles, as well as ionizing radiation. From dessication to disintegration, they try their powers. Nothing passes beyond the ring of salt.

They seem to get worried at this, and turn to leave. At least they try to. You see, turning someone is quite reversible, so each time they turn, they end up facing me again. They turn left, they turn right, they get desperate and try to fall in their side.

No matter what they do, they end up facing me. I can't help but respond to their spirited efforts, ""Not the best somersault I've seen, but a good effort.""

""What are you?""

""Take a step into the circle, and I'd be happy to show you. Until then, consider me a rater spirited artist.""

They attempt to get away after I say that. An odd choice, since I just turn them towards me once again. Before they realize their mistake, they passed the salt boundary. 

And then they are stood there, shaking my hand. They turn to leave, but instead they are stood there, shaking my hand. They try to punch me, but just before it hits they are stood there, shaking my hand. They open their mouth to scream, yet silently they are stood there, shaking my hand. They attempt to punch their own chest, trying to just be done with this, but before that they are stood there, shaking my hand.

""I told you it would be irreversible,"" I say, ""I never said it would be something as blasé as your death.""

Horror begins to dawn, but it doesn't have time to set in. Not least because they are stood there, shaking my hand.

Ah, the community college would be wrapping up the year soon, I'd pose as an entrepreneur and hire a few people in the culinary arts program to turn it into a little hipster place. The kind where people who love to smell their own farts spend $25 on an all grass fed truffle burger and the fries are an extra order. That denographic was rather insufferable, but it was hard to have a thriving art community without them. It would also help the little art gallery around the block and the chocolatier across the street.

The next punch connected, another one where he didn't stop to land. It sent me sailing straight into the vault, directly into the stacks of cash, which exploded in every direction, starting a rain of money in the small room. My impact with the vault wall rang loudly and left a sizable me shaped dent. With a thought, I broke the security cameras as I impacted. For a breif moment, a fluttering twenty was directly in front of Stupendous Man's eyes. No one else had line of sight with me, so I snapped some cash out of the air, only twenty or thirty grand. I teleported that to my hideout before going back to the spot that I'd hit the vault wall in the instant it took before that fluttering twenty left Paul's line of sight.

I pulled myself away from the wall and stood, shouting so I could be heard by the civilians outside the vault. ""You've foiled me this time, STUPID-nous man! But you'll never catch me!"" And I teleported away.

After a quick shower, I went to count the money I'd stolen. I'd grabbed more hundreds than I'd thought, so I was closer to eighty grand. Well, that was ok. It was all insured, and I'd find uses for the excess.

Now the townsfolk had long since gotten used to John's working at all hours. He was an honest man, always willing to lend a hand whether it was fixing a roof or plowing a field.  So a little extra noise now and then? Not a worry for the townsfolk. Some might have even found it reassuring, knowing that John Samuel was still working away while the rest were asleep.

On this particular night the moon was full. John paused in his chopping for a moment and wiped the sweat off his brow, admiring the moon's bright glow. Her light crossed the fields, across barley and wheat and corn near ready for harvest. The fireflies couldn't compete for how brightly she shone.

John Samuel, as he was wont to do, went back to his work and kept chopping until the moon began to dip towards the trees. He stood beside a pile of wood so large it would be fit for many winter nights. He placed his axe down by the well where he drew up a bucket of water. To washing he went, and he was nearly clean when a voice whispered from behind him. 

""You would make a fine husband for any woman, John Samuel.""

John Samuel whipped his head around, first right, then left, but saw no person who could have spoken. He heard a laugh, the same tone as the voice. He pulled his shirt on over his torso, ignoring for the moment that he was still soaked from washing. ""Where are you?"" he asked the voice, standing tall despite his state of dress. 

The voice laughed again. It was a soft voice, a laugh that would have been sweet had he not been so confused. ""How strange that you should be with me every night, and still not know me. Let us meet in the morning, for now I must go.""

The moon went below the trees at that moment, and in the darkness John Samuel could not find the bearer of the voice, no matter how hard he looked. He kept his axe by his door that night and barely slept.

""John Samuel,"" she spoke, and he recognized her voice from the night before.

Now, John had many questions, but he was a polite man as much as an honest one. He removed his hat from his head and bowed slightly. ""A pleasure to meet you, ma'am.""

The lady's silver eyes glinted with mirth, and she laughed more loudly than he'd expected. John Samuel stepped back at the sound, but the lady explained- 

""I haven't been called 'ma'am' in a very long while."" She paused just a moment before continuing ""And I've failed to introduce myself."" She reached into a bag at her side and brought out a round glass ball. It was lit as if from the inside, though dim in the daylight. ""It may sound impossible, but I am the moon.""

Hundreds of slightly different conversations taking place in isolated pairs. The priest bickered amongst themselves, the economic advisors spoke about the newly balanced budget as the late princesses “lifestyle” was no longer the responsibility of the crown. Mercenaries and soldiers alike discussed the possibility of a militaristic operation, already strategizing the best methods and tactics. 

The room came to a silent drop as the kings deep voice brutes out from his throne. “I HAVE MADE A DECISION”  

The eyes of the kingdom rested on the aging monarch. 

King Iris stood up from his throne and uncharacteristically grabbed a cigar from a nearby drawer before any servants could retrieve them for him. 

“We do nothing” the king says as he uses an impatient hand gesture to request a light. A high ranking general awkwardly pulls a lit torch off of f the wall and lights the cigar. “I beg your pardon my liege?” As captain Opal backs away. 


“We don’t do a damn thing, seriously I’m not bailing her out again. Shes 24. and I’m fucking done” the king says while taking a puff. 


A few tense moments of silence fill the room before a high priest breaks the stagnant tension “my lord….. shes the heir to the empire. Shes the signal of your house and the….” The priest is interrupted by the king 


“WHAT SHE IS,  IS AN UNGRATEFUL SPOILED BITCH……..” the king raises his hand towards a large ordinate map on the wall of the keep. Roughly in the direction of the Republic of New Rusigrad. “LAST WEEK WE HAD TO SEND A MILITARY EXPEDITION TO THE REPUBLIC OF NEW RUSIGRAD because she sent a letter saying she was kidnapped by soldiers.. we take several border forts in a FUCKING MILITARY CAMPAIGN only to find out….. shes hung over in a bar in a border town with no danger at all” after ending his statement the king looked back at the quiet room just waiting for an interjection. 

“Put sir, the” a finance minister utters before immediately being cut off by the King. 

“Captain Oripal or Opal or whatever the fuck your name is, how many men did we loose fighting a war for no reason?” 


Captain Opal pulls at his collar awkwardly as his nerves get the better of him “well, I don’t know exactly …I’d have to check with battle commanders a…” 


“HOW MANY WAS IT” the king shouted while approaching captain Opal.  



“2047 sir” the captain says in a sobering tone. 



The king eyed the crowd looking for any naval merchants. “YOU, merchant Hammir, why do you trade in a glorified canoe and not the 1st rate naval vessel I bestowed on you?” 


Merchant Hammor looked down defeated, “because your daughter keeps sinking the ships you gift me”


The king open his eyes wide “uh hu uh hu, and HOW does she keep sinking these behemoths of a vessel that cost YEARS TO MAKE” 


The merchant looked around unsure of how truthful the spectating  crowed expected him to be. “Um…… she keeps distracting the ship captains and try’s to steer the ships on to land because and I quote ‘we’re infringing on the rights of the fish’ and in all cases she crashes them into the natural reef and sinks them…. Often getting a non-significant amount of sailers killed. 



The king clapped, “yes you guys see? Just catastrophe after catastrophe for someone that should know better. I’m done saving her.” 


The esteemed financial minister, a career politician and diplomat who has served the kings father stepped forward. Perhaps the second highest authority in the empire after the King. “Iris, I get it…. But it looks bad if your heir is just living in dragon territory” 



The king glares at minister Tali, seeing him as an old friend and confidant instead of whatever official job he was doing at any given moment. But even with this mutual respect the king’s annoyance made him jaded “Yeah yeah yeah? Looks bad huh?, tell me. HOW MUCH GOLD DID THE EMPIRE NEED TO SPEND TO PAY BACK all the cavern and bar owners as well as……… exotic PET dealers……” 


The minister put his fingers together and rested them again his forehead in an annoyed fashion, knowing his response would not help any case to go save the princess “, “ugh………… 3.8 million ducats.” 


The entire room stared at the minister before the continued awkward silence was once again broken by the king. “Yeah, shes done. You know what? Start writing checks to the dragon lords, tell them to keep her,” 



A voice erupts from the crowd “THE DRAGON LORDS ARE OUR GREATEST ENEMIES” a minor aristocrat shrieks 


“Yeah? And me and the dragon lords are going to fly themselves into the sun after dealing with my daughter for any extended period of time. Win, win matter resolved.” The king walks back behind the throne seemingly leaving for the day",218,1749773694.0

""Oh, please! Dragons would eat any Human foolish enough to approach, I would never - but she? My daughter, will have the chance.""

""But what if they eat her?""

""Oh, Cornelius..."" I smiled, ""my daughter will find a way.

I, Faye Lambrois, daughter of Caligula Lambrois III, slept on a pile of bloody dragon gold, still cold.

The giant red dragon, Ourous, breathed fire from his nose, ""hey, Faye, thanks for helping out.""

""No problem, just bunking till my dad sends a party. You come back, I leave. I just want to prove to the townspeople he isn't insane.""

A little mailman came into the cave, ""hello, ma'am! Dr - DRAGON!""

Ourous laughed ""you are safe, I have better things to do to eat little, bony things. Please, Cows are far more filling.""

The mailman cleared his throat, ""oh - okay, um...Faye...your father, Caligula...said he is fine with you...leaving...but..."" he swallowed ""...is taking away your allowance...""

""...I'm sorry?""

""He said you're having a tantrum, and...""

I turned to Ourous, ""um...so...will you eat one, very specific Human?""

""Your father?"" he looked longingly, then said, ""no...cloth tastes awful. I will burn him, or decapitate - ""

I held my hand up, ""thank you, that's good enough."" breath, ""may I ride you to the capital? Revenge must be - ""

""Oh yes, sounds fun!"" he said, ""climb on!""",127,1749771893.0
1la0q0l,mxhztt8,"The courtier stares at me, shocked.
""What?"" I ask.
""Your Majesty...
I know the princess is a bit willful, but she's still the princess of our kingdom.
Shouldn't we save her?"" he asks.
I shook my head.
""Nope.
It's the 38th time in 6 months that she is ""kidnapped"", and oddly enough always after marriage, or further education discussions.
Time to let her go, if she wants to go."" I said.
He bowed, and left, while I resumed working on the documents for a trade with the dwarves...

A month later, a letter arrived.
""It's from Lilia!"" my Queen said, giving it to me.
I threw it in the fireplace.
""Husband!  Why?! We haven't heard anything about her in a month!"" she screamed at me.
""Exactly. Also, she knows where we are. If she wants to say something, better say it to us in person."" I said.
Before the Queen could say anything, I swooped her off of her feet.
I knew how to avoid an argument with my lovely wife.

3 months later, she was waiting for me in the throne room, for a visit.
""Hey dad."" she says, smiling at me.
""Daughter. How are you? How have you been? Everything alright?"" I say, hugging her.
She says nothing.
I sigh.
""What's wrong?"" I ask.
""You took my allowance! And cut my magic crystal card's access to the family's account at the Dwarven bank!"" she said.
""And?"" I ask, smiling at her.
She was fuming.

""Do you know how embarrassing it is to not be able to pay!"" she roars.
""Then find a job. The dragon that ""kidnapped"" you, surely has acquaintances, doesn't it?"" I say.
She blushes.
""Fine. You win. Sent me to whatever school of magic, but I am not marrying a random prince!"" she pouted.
I nodded.
""You start in a month at the Silverwood Elven Academy, considering your talent in wind and wood magic.
It's a 3 year program, so you will finish at the age of 25, or faster if you are talented enough.
After that, your mom and I, have 12 suitors that we found acceptable. If you find one of them okay, then we go ahead with the marriage, if not, we will keep looking.
Now go, and find your mom, she was worried sick."" I said.
She nodded, and started leaving.
""And Lilia."" I started.
""Yeah?"" she asks.
""I missed you. And I love you."" I smile at her.
She blushes, mumbles something and leaves.
I shake my head.

1la0q0l,mxi710n,"The court was aghast when the King abruptly left the throne room after being told of the news that his daughter, the Princess, had been taken by a dragon. Even the Queen herself – the ultimate pro in managing public displays of emotion – looked visibly shocked when she exited the chamber shortly after.

“What – the – fuck, - Edmond?” the Queen let out when finally alone with her husband.

“What? Don’t tell me you’re buying into this publicity stunt,” said the King, unbothered. “Darling, you must know by now that Clarice couldn’t possibly be kidnapped by a dragon unless she went out of her way to stage this little narrative.”

“Of course it’s a publicity stunt,” the Queen said. “You don’t have to sell me on Clarice’s cries for attention. But how could you act like this in front of the entire court? You were basically calling out her publicity stunt. Now everyone is thinking that, if the Princess is capable of going there, so are all of us in the royal family!”

The King now seemed concerned.

“You really think so?” he asked his wife.

“I KNOW SO,” the Queen replied, and she was livid. “I wouldn’t be surprised if those shitheads out there aren’t already wondered if I staged my own kidnapping by the trolls all those years ago”

“Oh, that was such a good stunt, wasn’t it?” said the King.

“The best”, the Queen agreed. “I really miss being fake-kidnapped. And while Clarice was a fool for going rogue like this, I can’t see why she would be craving for a fake-kidnap narrative of her own. You should be proud of her initiative, not dismissive!”

The King let his wife’s words sink in. He knew the Queen was right.

“How can we bounce back from this?” he finally said.

Moments later, the Queen was back to the throne room.

“You must forgive my husband,” the Queen announced. “As every parent here will know, the possibility of your child being harmed is enough to get any us – even Kings – into a deep state of denial.”

The Queen turned to soldier who had reported the Princess’ abduction.

“Alastor, gather all your men and do whatever it takes to rescue your Princess from the den. Even if you have to kill every dragon you find in our way. Now, GO!”",29,1749786685.0
1la0q0l,mxmtsak,"""Pardon?"", my advisor Ruger blurted out rather bluntly, ""Did I hear right? You want to- what."" He started pacing around my office, left-right, left-right aaaand a circle. It was kind of amusing to watch him ponder over my words, I've never seen him this confused.

""Ruger my friend, my daughter Aileen is a damn handful. You know that. Everyone on the guard knows that. Erikson over there even came to me personally to beg to be reassigned away from her, because she's such a menace."" The large bodyguard in the corner shuddered heavily at the mention of his past assignment. ""So, if she's actually been taken, either the dragons will bring her back because she caused so much chaos OR she'll be eaten. Which is actually less than likely, since she's thinner than a polearm."" 

Ruger seemed unnerved by my casualty about the situation, nevertheless he stopped pacing and let himself fall into one of the big plushy armchairs. He let out a heavy sigh and brought up his tablet. ""Very well, I'll cut off the weekly transfers to her account. Do you also want me to cancel her cards, phone contract and various memberships?"" 

""The fancy memberships can go, but keep the phone online. She may be a menace but it's safer if she has a reliable phone."" Ruger nodded as he tapped away, letting out a sigh now and then. It took several hours, but we were eventually able to slog through all the accounts of my daughter and cancelled most of them. It was easy, since I was usually the account holder and the one keeping them stocked with money.


Later that day, in my private chambers, I stood on the terrace overlooking the capital. Playing with a glass of whiskey in my hand, I drifted off in my thoughts. Overthinking the what if? What if my daughter had actually been kidnapped? If yes, why hadn't we received a ransom demand by now? Had she just run off with a boytoy again? Would she return once  the excitement wore off? Ugh, she had become so unpredictable the last decade. 

""Henry."" My husbands' soft voice brought me back to reality. He came up beside me, tenderly grasping my hand and resting his head on my shoulder. ""The ambassador of the Sidion Alliance has contacted me directly."" I took a sip of whiskey, ""The Alliance of all the dragon clans... Must've been important."" I felt his grip on my hand tighten. ""It's about Aileen. It appears that she's been...well..."", he trailed off and I turned to look at him. He was desperately trying not to laugh, but failed as soon as he met my gaze. It took us about ten minutes until he was coherent enough to talk again.


""Aileen apparently went on a bender through half the clubs of the Alliances capital city. Some way through your little cancellation spree went in effect and her cards started getting declined. So, what does she do? Throws the biggest tantrum ever and gets herself arrested. Property damage, cursed out some law enforcement, vandalism and you know, all the same stuff your brother got away with all those years."" I stared at him, he was giggling with glee. ""But get this, she gets booked and tried to evoke our names to get out. Since she's a princess, they got the embassy involved, right?"" ""And what did they tell her?"" ""Well, Ruger informed them that she's on her own and that they can't help her anymore. Oh how I wish to have seen her face when the news got back to her!""


I just shook my head at the revelation. But, soon after I got infected by my dearests' giggling and we laughed until our sides hurt. Gasping for air, I was just able to stammer: ""Oh she really does take after her father.""

""Yeah well, the Alliance wants us to take her back though."" ""Nah.""",11,1749849225.0
1la5kst,mxilv2x,"""You kiss your mother with that mouth?!"" I shouted at Hephaestus, a new and upcoming super villain that has more weapons than 90% of the countries in the world. ""On second thought, I just read Oedipus, so maybe don't answer that!"" 

He was enraged and pulled out several spears shaped like thunderbolts.  Uh oh, I thought.  Gotta be fast. Gotta avoid them. Those things could really do some damage. He fired them at me, but was still way too green to be any serious threat. In five years, he could be dangerous. Right now, my simple quips are causing him to get frustrated and lose focus. This should be easy. I'm afraid to pull out the big guns. One bad pun might send him into a catatonic state. 

The three javelins flew right by me as I took aim with my power gauntlets. A sudden burst of kinetic energy flew out from them, hitting Hephaestus and knocking him backwards through the wall (several walls actually) and into another part of the building. Oh damn, I hope I didn't hurt him too bad.  I walked through the Hephaestus sized holes in the walls and saw him, buried under a pile of drywall and desks, unconscious, but still breathing.

""Wave Force to the CPD,"" I said in my communicator. ""Hephaestus is down, 3rd floor, just follow the giant holes in the wall. I'll disarm him, you lock him up, over."" 

""WAIT A MINUTE WAVE FORCE YOU STAY RIGHT THERE AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS AND...""

""Oh is that you Captain Finnegan? Sorry can't hear you, over.""

""DO NOT LEAVE OR I'M PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST"" he shouted over the radio.

""Sorry Cap, you didn't say over at the end of your transmission. Uh oh I'm flying through a tunnel, I'm losing you.""

I heard some cops talking as they were walking through the rubble.  Time for me to leave. I saw an open window and flew out and into the cold Chicago sky.

I arrived in my tiny apartment and saw my cat was sitting by the window, waiting for me. 

Another, less cuddly, surprise was waiting for me also. A note. 

""I know who you are Wave Force. I know where you live. I know where your family lives. I know where your friends live. Enjoy the last night of your private life."" 

No. No no no no. I started scanning all the bugged ""secret"" lairs and hideouts, hoping for some chatter.
The first five bugs were silent, or didn't yield any important info. Until I got to Dr. Poison's office. I could hear him talking to someone over the phone.

""YOU DID WHAT?"" Dr. Poison shouted. ""I don't want to hear it! No. Stop talking. No. I don't want to know who Wave Force is or any other super hero. We have codes! We have rules! If we go after their families, they will come after ours! Goddamnit! You screwed this up! Do you know why they are heroes? Because they are good and kind people. Its literally in their name you moron! And you take away that goodness and kindness? What are you left with? Walking, talking, pissed off Nuclear Bombs waiting to unleash their force on US. No. You better hope any of the heroes you threatened do not find you! I'm ending this call. Do not contact me again."" 

Before he hung up, I was already flying to Dr. Poison's penthouse office. Even flying as fast as I could, I could see the look of terror and horror on his face as I crashed through his skylight window.

He barely got a word out before I had my hands wrapped around his throat and his body lifted five feet off the ground.

""Who were you talking to?"" I said. 

""I don't, I don't know what you are talking about,"" he said. 

I placed my left hand right near his face. He could hear my gauntlets powering up.

""Talk or this whole penthouse goes up for sale first thing in the morning. After they repaint the walls.""

""Lightning Lord!"" he said as he shut his eyes, waiting for the blast.

""Did he tell you anything?""

""I wouldn't let him! I swear! I follow the Code""

I dropped him. ""Is he still at the old power plant?"" I asked.

Dr. Poison was catching his breath and let out a quiet ""Yes."" 

As I was flying towards the electric plant, I sent out a few messages to friends and family, asking if they were okay. Everyone was fine. Everyone was safe.  As I arrived at the plant, several lightning bolts shot out from the ground towards me. He must know I'm coming.

I dodged them but was exposed and an easy target up here. I landed and made my way into the dark and destroyed power plant. 

""Oh Wave Force, or should I call you Edward. Did Dr. Poison give me up that easily?! ,"" he shouted.  ""I know you are here. After I dispose of you, all your friends and family will fall pray to 'freak' accidents! Hahaha! They will be deemed the unluckiest group of people in the world after all the 'random' lightning strikes hit them!"" 

I didn't respond. I turned my power gauntlets up to their maximum setting. 

""Come on, where are your jokes! Where is the good humor you always bring to our fights! I love your puns. I love your dad jokes! Your knock knock jokes need some work though!"" he shouted into the darkness. 

I crept up closed to him, still hiding in the shadows. He was on the open floor, firing randomly into the darkness, hoping to catch me or at least hit me. He was growing erratic and frustrated by the lack of response from me. 

""SHOW YOURSELF,"" he shouted as he fired more lightning into random directions. One hit just above me that I had to duck down to avoid getting hit. 

As he turned his back towards me, I quickly dashed over and stood behind him. As he turned around, I put my open palm on his chest.  ""Knock knock,"" I said and and let out a huge burst of energy. He went flying backwards into the steel walls. 

I walked over to him. He looked up at me, his face bloodied already, a huge scorch mark on his chest. 

I placed both my hands around his head and powered them up. The simple vibrations and sound of them made Lightning Lord shout in pain.

""It took me one shot to disable you. It will take me one shot to kill you. You are going to leave this town. You are going to go anywhere else but Chicago. So whatever city you arrive in, you let me know. Send me a postcard. You know where I live. And I will warn their heroes about you. And how you are a Codebreaker. This is your first strike. But this isn't baseball. You don't get three strikes. One more strike, and you are marked for retirement. And our retirement parties aren't as fun as the civilian ones. Do we have an understanding?""

He was too injured to say anything. 

""I'll take that as a yes.""",45,1749793692.0

*And woe betides the fool who, on a moonless night, sailing in the stormy seas, angers the god who chose to be kind.*

**~~**

""If you valued your life, you'd stop insulting my god,"" the boatman sneered. ""The storm is not his fault, but it is by his blessing we stay afloat and not sink beneath the tides. Did you not listen to the old tales of the great and ancient Lord Elvari I told you on the way here? You have been full of complaints from since you stepped foot in his town.""

""What kind of sea god can't do anything about tidal waves?"" The grumpy tourist shouted. ""Calm the seas, moron! Look, I don't need this so-called kindness of drifting in stormy seas! I need good weather, calm waters! Didn't that tentacle dork say he was a good god?""

**~~**

*He wasn't born a good god. He was born in the shadows, not in light. A prophesied Great Evil that would plunge the world in madness and darkness. But after years of spiralling into senseless violence, he chose to do good.*

*What then, separates him from the other good gods of holy pantheons? They were born to be good. They were told they were good from since their conception. But a dark god who chose good over evil? That is a deliberate choice. One that can be undone.*

**~~**

""Oh yeah?"" The tourist wasn't convinced. ""How scary can some tea-sipping terror can be? Hey, is he scared of one-star reviews on his website?""

The boatman didn't say a word.

""When are we actually going to see some abominations of the sea? Are they all hiding? Is this a scam? I paid good money to see leviathans, not get my boat rocked!"" The man hasn't stopped ranting. ""You see this harpoon? Clear this stupid storm so I can spear one of them sea beasts for photos to post on my Instagram! Tell Elvari to get his ass here and do something about the weather? Is this out of his domain? Does he only cover that small dinky town of Innsmouth? Is his influence that tiny?""

**""Do you know why an ancient god would choose to stay in one small fishing town? When once, he had spread his influence across multiple dimensions?""** The boatman was speaking, but his voice was calm, yet deeper than the depths of the Abyss, his eyes glowing a vivid violet. **Because he tries to limit the spread of his madness. Because he's trying to be kind. In doing so, he limits the insanity to zany silliness. But when you take that away, all that is left for you is endless horror.**

The boatman snapped back to his senses. The rich tourist who booked his boat did not. With every crash of tidal waves, the man would scream and stab at the air. Yelling incoherently about dangers from every corner. When he was out of breath, he'd collapse on the floor and sob uncontrollably, all while clawing his eyes out and bleeding from his orifices.

For he saw nothing but endless horror of an eldritch deity who decided to stop being kind for a minute.

Why would they release the stable strain into a populated area intentionally? It’s a simple question, but the connotations are immense. In theory, it’s a sound plan, releasing a contagion to curb humanity’s pointless warring, but even at a passing glance, it’s easy to see the unintended effects.


Excessive bleeding from the eyes, vomiting, confusion, and mental instability besides the lethal components that made it so rightfully feared to begin with. They’re all reasons it should’ve never been done; but necessity makes a fool of us all.


But it didn’t work; it never would have stopped the death. Necessity; who’s mine or theirs? Was it even right to inflict your “truth” on another?


With one hand, I press a palm against my right eye in some ill-fated way to hide the brilliant sunlight slipping through my office windows and the chirping of distant birds. I’ve been here three days now; in this cramped office. 


Despite being a block away from the epicenter, it’s deceptively quiet. The usual honks and revving engines of the central roadway are absent, as are the hurried footsteps of my fellow staff members in and by the admin building. 


I can only linger in this cluttered space as I wrap my digits and hurl the chief administrator’s plaque on my desk in a flurry of paperwork and audible wrath. The guttural scream from the depths of my lungs is enough to rattle the windows in the throes of my frustration. 

“You dumb motherfucker Marcus!”


The lead scientist of the harmony project isn’t here to hear it, but it’s cathartic in the moments leading up to my collapse into my office chair.


At most, this pathogen was supposed to be used on the mentally unwell; it’s not a cure-all treatment. So releasing it was like prescribing Pervitin to an orphan. I’m glad the son-of-a-bitch died on the day of the outbreak. It was a service to the collective gene pool of humanity. 


I’m tired now. The rage lingering as it might be has been displaced by another emotion as I slam my head against the desk. 


Nothing can be done now. 


Pandora’s box has been opened. 


(…)


Such is life.


A sigh is the only noise to escape from the space between my head and piles of paperwork. 


At least I didn’t have to worry about pipe bombs in my mailbox in theory.

And again, she is dreading it, which, to be honest, is more a sense of discomfort.              
Similar to light ice wind crawling up your arms, raising the hair on your neck, and running as a shudder throughout your body. Body, yeah, right. Hers' a little different right now - again. Something *she* does not mind, but her mother... well, let's say they're another story.  
  
Magic is considered to be fictional in this part of the world. You don't share any other opinions on that matter; scientifically speaking, you will never see proof unless you’d walk across the border.              
To any other country in the vicinity, that is. ""Magic does not exist. Technology is everything"", welcomes you on signs at the borders.       
       
Shelly followed her half-sibling into the academy. Luckily, he does not have a bodily manifestation of magic. Hence, he stays at the mental dorms. She's not that 'lucky', according to her mum, who's been damming the conversation she agreed on her ex-husband sending both children there.              
Unfortunately, or as a blessing - in Shelley's perspective - the contract states you can't leave school, unless extensive security measures are in place. Due to her home country denying the existence of energies running through nature's fibers, this is impossible.  
  
Entering her room back home through a time-activated rune circle, Shelly hears her mum talking to her dad over the phone, probably trying to convince him to visit, for *Shelly's sak*e. The wise man has denied every invite since his former spouse read the contract's fine print. Shelly grins.    
Taking off her jacket, she walks toward her room door. With a deep breath, she clears her head before opening it.       
Her mother looks toward her as soon as she walks through the threshold, her mouth immediately pressing into a thin line as her gaze travels up and down her youngest child's body.

At this point, her mother's face is nearly as pink as hers, edging towards dark red.    
Shelly swallows. She could wait this out in a different part of the flat; there is no need to actually trigger her mom into something the woman denies she possesses in the first place.  
""You went to the med station because *you were worried*. Admit it! You were scared by his experiments!"" Shelly leans backwards as her mother leans in.         
Somewhere in the back of her head, a slight bell goes off. Someone is trying to enter.  
  
""It's not an experiment, mum, he's a nice guy, Akeno, would not harm me! I went to the med station because Le passed out in sparring class. The doctor just took a look at me, then.""  
Her mum scoffs.         
""Look, I know that you know that this will wear off in the next several hours. I love you, Mum. Still, you need to get used to me being at this school now. Dad wants to help you move closer. That way, we don't have to hide when I visit, like *this*.""

1la2yi7,mxhp3gs,"For my time as a monster, I remembered nothing of what I was before. As far as I knew, my life began on an obsidian table deep in a dark wizard’s lair. My creator looked upon me with dark eyes and smiled. Were I not restrained, I would have tried to rip her throat out. As if she knew my thoughts, she smiled even wider. Then she uttered something, and all went dark.

I woke up again, this time in a forest. I did not know how far it was from where I was born. I recognized nothing. Throbbing in my head was the need to inflict harm. To rend flesh, break bone, and shed blood. I understood what I was, a weapon of terror unleashed upon the land for some end I did not know or care to know. All I valued was violence.

I don't know how long I remained in that state, falling upon caravans in the dark of night, raiding villages, pillaging farms. In my wake was sorrow and carnage, and I reveled in every moment of it. Increasingly powerful people began to harry my blood soaked escapade. I killed a few of them, but the terror I inflicted on peasants did nothing to prepare me for actual threats.

It all came to a head when I found warriors lying in wait at the next village I intended to slaughter. I was a dangerous thing, but I was not a match for ten people who knew what they were doing. I clawed and bit at them, until a hammer fell upon my skull and all went dark.

An uncertain amount of time, I woke. I found myself restrained, but the drive to slaughter and maim was gone. I felt large things drifting in my unconscious mind, things that fled when I reached towards them with my mind. Then I realized I was not alone. A wizard wearing a serious look stared at me with cold probing eyes.

As I floated restrained, people came to speak to me. I asked so many questions, received no answers. They wanted to know what I remembered, the people I had killed, how I had become what I was. They were keenly interested in what I could tell them about the wizard I saw as I lay lashed to the obsidian table.

Until finally, the wizard with the cold eyes stood before other faces I had spoken to, and stated, ""I've purged as much of her work as I can. He should be stable, I give a very low probability of a relapse to violent tendencies. We can begin reintegrating his previous identity. It will take time.""

They would make me go to sleep after that, and I would have the most vivid dreams. Soft dreams of smiles and days in the sun, punctuated by occasional sadness and loss. These were memories, memories of who I had been before I was turned into a monster. I knew that ground shaking emotions loomed over me, kept just out of reach. So many shattered pieces slowly being put back together.

Then began the pain. The horror of the person I was before I became a monster at what I had done as a necromancer's weapon. I convulsed and vomited, disgusted. Hundreds of people and thousands of animals slain, acts that the thing I was at the time was delighted to have committed. I begged them to stop, I begged them to kill me. I could not live with myself. But still the process continued, that same wizard with cold eyes staring at me, his face betraying none of his thoughts.

Deeper and deeper, unlocking more memories and latent emotions. Things that inflicted so much emotional pain that my mind had been protecting me from processing them. They explained that what I had done was not my fault, but still it was agony. I was often restrained to prevent me from doing long term damage to myself.

Until, eventually, the rain of blows ended. There was no more horror left to face, no more memories to reprocess. Apparently satisfied, the man with cold eyes smiled for the first time in my presence, ""What happens now?"" I asked.

""That depends on you. What do you want?""

""I... I want to atone. I don't want to kill or harm any person or beast ever again.""

""You should know that what we pulled out of your mind will help us hunt the person who made you what you were. We've been searching for years now. Her name is Natasha The Flesh Reaver. Do you have any particular notions about what you would like to do?""

""I think I would like to help fix people.""

""I can see about having you apprenticed to the local healers guild, if you would like.""

""That sounds nice.""

So I became an apprentice healer. The gruesome knowledge from my time as a monster actually helped me fix people better. My teachers and peers did not know what I had been, only that high ranking wizards had recommended me and were paying attention to how I managed. My mind would likely never heal entirely, but I could make the world just a little brighter as I began the long road to my own recovery.  A simple, modest life, but one worth living. Driven by the need to mend rather than rend.",52,1749779877.0
1la2yi7,mxhvqaq,"The trap was set.

Carmen hid behind some bushes, waiting for the monster to approach the screaming convict tied to a tree, blood slathered onto him as bait. The monster hunter's rifle was locked and loaded. Ready to shoot before it could lunge at the man. She loathed her superior's orders to make a bait like this, so she was prepared to save him if needed.

A low growl echoed in the woods, scattering the birds and small mammals in the area. The monster, an artificially created homunculus-gone-wrong, imbued with excessive bloodlust to be a murder machine only to make its creator its first victim, was here. It sniffed the air, elongated limbs stretched out towards the bait. Blood dripped from its cavernous maws, no doubt from an earlier kill near the area.

Before Carmen could aim at its head, a black portal swirled into existence. Out popped a pale tentacle, which gripped a metal baseball bat and thwacked the monster on the head. The homunculus howled at the offending appendage, which gave the creature a few mighty blows to the head. When the monster slumped to the ground, the tentacle made happy cooing noises. More tentacles then emerged to pull the entity into the portal.

Carmen didn't need to intercept the portal; she knew exactly where to go.

**
--

It felt like many hours later, that the homunculus woke up in a garden near a tall, black building. And to a strange tentacled creature looking at it.

""Hello there, are you hungry?"" The octopoid entity cocked his head. ""What would you like to eat? I sure hope the answer isn't humans.""

It did not have an answer. All it remembered was a desire to murder everything that moved. To devour the flesh and drink the blood of its victims. Nothing else. And now, even that was gone. It still wanted food, but it had no idea what food to ask for.

""How about some tea and biscuits? I happen to have these on hand. How about some cheesecake? This friendly eldritch is always ready for tea parties.""

Before it could answer, a woman with a rifle charged onto the scene.

""Elvari, hand that homunculus over,"" she pointed at the aberration. ""It was created with only bloodlust in mind. It has killed many others. Eaten many humans. That thing is a danger to society.""

""I'm naming him Gobblesnork and adopting him,"" the eldritch god curled his tentacles around the abomination. ""You don't wish to kill anymore, do you? What do you want to eat now?"" He repeated his earlier question.

""Teaaaa. Biscuitsss,"" the homunculus pushed the words from its jaws. ""Cheesecake. Teaaa partayyy.""

""What did you do to it?"" Carmen demanded to know. ""Besides bonking it on the head with a baseball bat?""

""Have you ever heard of the story of an [elf's greatest revenge against The Devourer](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/18aatjg/wp_you_enacted_the_greatest_revenge_on_the/kbxfm93/) which killed many of his kind?"" Elvari asked Carmen while handing biscuits to the newly named Gobblesnork. ""It didn't involve murder. He peeled away at the madness within to restore its mind. To make it feel emotions. To make it learn to love. I want to do the same for Gobblesnork.""

""Alright, you win,"" she couldn't argue with him. ""Nobody else can teach a monster kindness better than another one like you.""

I was a monster. An aberration created only to follow my bloodlust.
The blood I spilt could create rivers, and lakes.
The heroes that tried to stop me failed, again and again, until a mighty blow landed on my head, knocking me out.
Now, I am caught, and caged like the animal I was.
I was.
For now, my bloodlust is replaced...by other needs.
""Guards? May I ask for a canvas?"" I shout, hoping they will fulfill my needs.

I paint.
I paint rage, and death, and pain, and life, and the thrill of the hunt.
I am still caged, but I am freer than in my previous state.
I no longer feel the need to kill, to slaughter.
Now, all I feel is this strong desire to...paint.
To free my emotions, and my thoughts.
And it is working.
For today, for the first time in months, I feel normal, and I have a visitor.

""You killed my parents."" the young woman says.
""I apologize."" I say to her, as I watch her fiddle with one of my paintings.
""How can a monster like you, depict pain in such a wonderful way?"" she asks.
I sigh.
""I changed, after the defeat, something was knocked right in my head."" I smile.
She nods.
""Yet you don't deny you are a monster."" she says.
""No. I am, still could kill thousands with my bare hands.
I was created for slaughter, a mix of vampire, werewolf, and dragon blood flowing in my veins.
It just now, it's not a need to slaughter that I have, but only a possibility that I will never choose again."" I said.

And also...I require a shadow, that will do the things the duchy can't do, but has to."" she says.
I sigh.
""Must I become a weapon once more? If so, I would prefer to stay in this cell."" I say.
She stares at me intently for a good few minutes, then breaks out into a brilliant smile, that shall haunt my dreams, and my paintings...I know.
""Good! You truly changed, the alchemists and physicians were right.
You shall only act against criminals, and corrupt individuals that are smart enough to stay on the good side of the law in the light, disallowing the duchy to act directly."" she says.

1lac15h,mxk52tw,"The room was dark. His pipe lay cold. The air smelled of ink and wax. Saruman revised his letter to Galadriel yet again. Why wouldn't the words come?

He thought back to when he last saw her. A sip of wine, bitter. Then for the first time, he truly saw her. 

Her face, her golden hair, those starlight eyes. It was as if her image had carved her name into his soul.

Gandalf had been there. He brought the wine. But Gandalf didn't matter. His world had become entirely Galadriel.

He tried to shake it. Once he might have called the Uruk-hai. But now his hands reached for a quill instead. Sauron's voice once haunted him.

Now, he couldn't be bothered. He stood and paced to the window. Below, the pits were quiet. No hammers. No snarls. Orcs milled, confused.

He hadn't given orders. Instead, he stared up at the moon and tried for a comparison with Galadriel that wasn't trite. Pulling at his hair, he moaned. Every word he imagined was a cliche. 

Why hadn't he studied poetry rather than magic? He saw her in the moonlight. In the curve of the river. His chest tightened.

Gandalf had come yesterday. ""What's this, Saruman? Poetry?"" 

Saruman snarled. His voice broke. Gandalf's eyes held secret knowledge . As if he knew the source of Saruman's obsession.

An orc shouted outside. Saruman didn't move. What would she say if he sent an imperfect letter? He couldn't risk it.

1l9r1le,mxf9ydl,"""But my Lord Father, Prince Charming smells of lavender and roses and cedar...""

""Isnt he lovely, my sweetums?""

""The scent I felt when I have awoken was different... stronger, healthier...""

""That must have been some miasma from the simple folk who brought you back from the accident, sweetums.""

So the princess wandered around in the castle, searching for the places where the smells and scents occurred in the wildest varieties.

The lair of the Magician was full with the nose-twisting smells of the medicines, potions and poisons. She remembered some of these, applied on her during the panicked search for a solution to her slumber, but these were all clean, crisp sharp smells, not the, let's face it, peasant smell she still remembered from her waking moments.

The kitchen was amazing. All the exotic spices, fresh and preserved fruits and vegetables, fragrant oils for cooking, wood smoke, the sweet smells of desserts, but all these she knew and loved, nothing like the scent she dreamed of.

She had the idea to visit the places with less pleasant airs, and there she found it. In the stables, over the familiar smell of dung and horse sweat, there was the thin thread of that smell.

She followed it to a corner where a stable boy was munching on something.

""Boy, what is this you are eating?""

The stable boy was speechless. Managed to croak something which was similar to ""Your Majesty"", but that was all. And it was not even the proper way of addressing her.

With the help of the Chief Groom the boy gathered his wits.

""Your Majesty, it's knackwurst. It's my lunch.""

""Can I taste it? And by the way, it's Mylady, not Majesty. That's the King, my Father.""

""Your Mylady, everything here is yours. But... this is the last piece and I really like it.""

""Not to worry, young groom, I really just take the tiniest bit...""

Yes! It was that smell! The princess was sure now.

""What is this knackwurst? What is in it?""

""Your Mylady, it's pork, garlic, some kind of bread... I don't really know, I just eat it. Tom, the butcher knows better but he's disappeared two days ago.""

This was the first time the princess heard of garlic. At a table where saffron, cardamom or cloves were found every day, garlic was not common.

""What do you mean disappeared?""

""There was that big hubbub with your sickness, your Mylady, and he was one of the random people taken to your room. And then your Mylady was back, and some of those people were not.""

""Thank you, boy. And Chief Groom, I ask you that no harm shall fell on this stable boy by your hand or will.""

The only place where people can disappear this perfectly in the castle was the dungeons. There she went, and oh this place was a veritable cavalcade of smells. Horrible, bad smells, of fear, of excrement, of blood and of pain. 

She swept through the tunnels, the Dungeon Master running after her, trying to stop her with his useless words. She knew that a lackey was already on it's way to bring here her governess or even his father, so she had to be quick.

And she found him! She could have asked for his name, but the brown, warm eyes, even clouded with the suffering were the same, the sudden brightening of his face was telling.

""Open this door, Dungeon Master!""

""But Mylady, your father...""

""Open the door, now!""

Maybe the Dungeon Master felt that this was the first occasion when the princess commanded with the power she will wield when she gets the throne. Maybe he just disliked the cruelty of jailing people without any good reason. Maybe he was just a fan of the sausages of Thomas. 

Whatever was the reason, the door opened with a creak and she was in the filthy arms of Thomas.

""Why are you jealous?"" I asked, folding my arms. ""It’s not my fault none of you paid attention to her needs.""

Hargrave’s nostrils flared, as though trying to inhale enough outrage to survive the night. ""Her needs?"" he spat. ""I offered her dominions, armies, my own ancestral sword—""

""All of which she already has more of than you,"" I said. ""And the sword was compensating for something, I suspect.""

He bristled. ""You impudent cur! She is the Iron Princess! She is a legendary warrior, unbroken, untouchable!""

""Untouchable? No. Untouched,"" I corrected mildly. ""Unbroken? Not any more. That was her problem, wasn't it?""

His face darkened like overcooked gravy. ""You dare suggest—""

""I don’t *dare* suggest, I state it,"" I said. ""I asked her one question. And when I asked it, she didn’t want titles or castles or your dull, tedious attempts at performative courtship as if she were some bird to flash gilded feathers at. She wanted a *night*.""

Hargrave made a noise not unlike a wounded goose. ""You make her sound like a common —""

""Careful,"" I said, my smile turning sharp. ""Say it, and I’ll make sure you finish that sentence on your knees. She is still your sovereign.""

""But you—!"" He sputtered, caught between rage and some unarticulated horror at the notion that a common man could succeed where nobility had failed.

""I pleased her,"" I said simply.

He trembled with suppressed fury. ""I am a Lord of the Blooded Houses. My lineage is—""

""—a paper saying you were born,"" I said. ""Her body didn't care for your lineage when my tongue was writing poetry across her.""

The color drained from his face in such a hurry that it was probably halfway to the next duchy by now. ""You filthy fucking peasant.""

""I am,"" I agreed. ""Filthy, exhausted, and very successful. She's asleep right now, purring like a contented lioness. And you,"" I added, tilting my head, ""are standing here arguing with me, because you never once thought to ask her a question.""

Hargrave drew himself up, his voice icy. ""Mark my words, commoner. Your rise will be brief. We Blooded always reclaim what is ours.""

I chuckled at his double entendre because he didn't know he had done it, then I chuckled at that one. ""Bring your armies,"" I said. ""Though you might want to wait until she wakes. She's rather cross when disturbed, and is liable to lash out at whomever awakens her.""

Hargrave codfished, looked past me, went white, turned on his heel and stormed off.

Behind me, from the shadows of the tower, came the soft sound of silk against stone and the Iron Princess herself, voice thick with lazy amusement.

They say the sea demands a wary eye, lest you find yourself on the wrong end of the **Screaming Sirens**. Or so they say, and I hope it's true. This damned salt on my back itches, scratching at my skin like a thousand tiny crabs. I reach to relieve the torment, my hand slips, and I nearly tumble from this pathetic plank I'm clinging to. A quick, desperate scramble steadies me. Honestly, though, a shark might be a tempting alternative to this skull-splitting headache.

How long has it been? Two days, I think. I was aboard the *Sailing Pride*—an ironic name now, isn't it?—on a passage from Portugal to the Caribbean. Then, a storm. Not just any storm, but a beast of a squall that swallowed the horizon whole.

I was in the galleys, watching the chaos unfold in agonizing slow motion. A monstrous wave, truly colossal, dwarfing everything around it, crashed into our port quarter. It was easily half the mast's height. The impact was bone-jarring. A cannon, ripped from its moorings, hurtled straight for me. My life flashed before my eyes, only to be interrupted by another cannon breaking loose, deflecting the first one just enough. It saved me, but not the poor soul beside me. The cannon slammed into his chest and kept going as if he were made of air. Blood and gore exploded, a gruesome tableau, until I saw his oil lamp slip from his hand, tumbling straight toward a gunpowder barrel.

Pure, unadulterated terror fueled my legs. I sprinted, a frantic blur from starboard to port. Then, a blinding flash, a concussive blast that ripped through the ship, and… nothing.

The next thing I knew, I was bobbing on the open ocean, the acrid stench of gunpowder battling the salty spray. Something struck my arm, a sharp, sickening crack. I think it broke, but it was also my salvation: a large piece of the ship's wreckage. Clenching my jaw, I ignored the throbbing agony and hauled myself onto my new ""vessel."" There wasn't time to do much more than grip the board with white-knuckled desperation. A single glimpse of the *Sailing Pride* was all I needed to confirm her fate. The gunpowder magazine had detonated, tearing the ship in half.

Ariel yawned. She could escape, of course, but it would ruin the plan. She was tempted to escape anyways, just to piss off Sebastian. An escape would also serve to reinforce her reputation. These sailors weren't nearly as afraid of her as they should be. They had already passed three planets they could have landed on, where her powers would be useless and she would be in actual trouble. But no, they insisted on bringing her to the core worlds for a public execution. The arrogance! Only one of the crew on the Imperial Dreadnaught Ursula looked at her with what Ariel considered to be an appropriate degree of terror. 

""Hey,"" she whispered through the bars of her cell. ""Hey Flounder.""

The man was a hybrid. Human DNA spiked with space born organics. She couldn't command him like she could the trueborn creatures of the void sea, but she could make him *feel* what she was. The man didn't respond. She glanced at the clock bolted to the wall above his desk. He looked at her with eyes wide with fear, then averted his gaze. Ariel sighed. ""Fine,"" she said. ""Be like that.

He sat in the chair, and waved dismissively toward Flounder, as if he had anywhere to go. Ariel had seen him try before. The brig airlock was gene coded, and Flounder didn't have the right stuff. He just stood a little back, rubbing his cheek. Ariel looked at the clock. ""It's simple, really,"" she reclined her the uncomfortable steel bench and grinned at Rene. ""I keep besting you."" Rene's face began to turn red, but he composed himself before exploding. ""I have come at the request of King Triton,"" he said through gritted teeth. ""The Pirate King, your father, has agreed to diplomatic relations, but only if he gets back his love."" Ariel rolled her eyes at that. Rene flared his nostrils. ""I will ask you once, girl, and only once. Where is the Screaming Siren?"" Ariel glanced at the clock, then winked at Flounder.

So I regaled him with the, Actual, tale.

Yeah, we grew up in the same town, knew each other since we were tots, and I can safely tell you that there isn't anything supernatural about her.

The real story, her mother was an entertainer from a foreign land, wonderful singer honestly probably where the siren part comes from, and her father was just a ship captain.

If anything he was a privateer, had a Letter of Marque, but barely ever did any real privateer business. Met, Amalia's mom while doing business overseas, but retired after her tenth birthday.

""Wait then what about the stories?"" He inquired, ""Her deadly voice and the sea creatures?""

Well, why she doesn't have any supernatural powers she was really good in figuring out how critters behave.

She figured out that dolphins can be trained while she was young, spent a lot of time at the beach training them, and liked to show off how she could get them to do things in command.

Also knows how to attract critters like sharks to areas, and how to get them to do things she wants. Not really tamed, but she knows how to get them where she wants them to be, or to keep them away.

Something about smells, I can't quite remember, been years since she explained it to me.

""What about her killer voice?""

I took a swig of my drink before continuing this part.

Well, remember how I mentioned her Mom was an entertainer, singing especially?

He nodded.

Amalia, is definitely not. Girl had the singing voice of a seagull feeding frenzy, but didn't like being told so. She was never afraid of raising hell when someone pointed it out.

Hah, deadly voice is right.

""Wait,how do we know that you're just not the one full of shit, exactly?""

Well,

""Captain, Amalia's ship was spotted off the eastern shore!""

I sat up from my seat, placing my hat and navy coat back on, before throwing some money on the counter.

""Well, we have kept in touch in a matter of speaking.""

As I walked towards the exit I gave one last answer, ""The only part you got right was that she is a pirate.""


(Some time off the eastern coast of the island)

~On tHe WavEs, the SIrlInG wAaAAvEs~

Captain Amalia, a Navy ship has been spotted off the starboard side!

Amalia jogged to the side, smile on her face, as she saw the familiar ship.

Perching herself in some ropes she called out.

""Gibson, still chasing me, people are gonna start talking you know!""

Her voices carried over the waters, passed the pod of dolphins that followed her vessel. Then a response echoes back to her.

""Someone has to save us all from that racket you call singing, Captain Siren Child!""

With a wirey smile, and a slight hint of frustration she mumbled to herself.

""Oh, you're gonna pay for that one."" She turns back to her crew, ""All hands to stations, and get some of those firerafts in the water.""

She gave a whistle, and the dolphins took up a formation at the ships side, ""Alright lads and ladies get ready to show little Gibby a new trick.""",5,1749786211.0

My mind usually rambles like this, but this time is a desperate attempt to cling to consciousness. If I sleep, I know I won't wake up, the numbness on my body tells me, its been a while since I felt my arm, that can't be good. The screams return, a chilling echo. No, think of something else. That old song from my childhood… how did it go?

""A fearsome tale we spin, me lads, of dangers on the foam, 

Beware the Screaming Sirens, lest ye never make it home! 

A woman at the helm, they say, with ocean in her blood, 

Born of pirate's fire, and a siren's deadly flood. 

With creatures of the deep at her command, and a voice to chill yer bones, 

Her song's as sharp as cutlass steel, that pierces through the stones!""

Gods, what an eerie song. Why are sailors like this? Why can't we sing about nice islands with sun-soaked beaches and plenty of rum? No, it always has to be something mysterious, deadly, and utterly grim. Ugh. So much for trying not to think about my impending death. Though, honestly? Being her crew does sound pretty badass if you ask me.

""I'd even consider joining them,"" I blurt out, not entirely sure why, but the idea strikes me as morbidly hilarious. ""Seriously, sounds like a laugh to be part of her crew.""

I stare up at the sky. I'm going to die here, aren't I? Man, at least I wish the clouds were still here. But no, it's all brutally sunny now. Guess I'll have to die on a happy note.

""Is that a proposition?""

The voice is cold, feminine, powerful. My heart punches against my ribs, a painful drumbeat. I look around. I'm alone, yet I hear it again.

""I won't ask a third time. Is that a proposition? Do you wish to join?""

Is that… *her*? Well, I'm already about to kick the bucket, so I might as well answer. ""Uh… sure, why not? I'm—""

A terrible pain sears through my chest. My heart pounds, faster and harder, until something cracks. A horrid, sickening sound. And then, I watch, horrified, as my own heart rips itself from my chest and plummets into the sea.

""Then it is sealed. Welcome to the crew.""

Suddenly, she's there. The most beautiful woman I've ever seen, mysterious and utterly serious. And somehow, I'm on a ship. An old, decayed one, rising from the sea itself.

""Officer, take him to his new quarters. He was about to die when we found him. He needs some rest.""

1l9rblk,mxfgnwf,"I warned my brother that this ritual wouldn’t bring his daughter back. I told him that spirits often take far more than they give. But he wouldn’t listen. He summoned help from beyond, and it cost him his kindness. His empathy. His mind. The Ryan I grew with and loved was consumed by his hopeless, twisted prayer. 

I watched silently in horror from under a desk as the unnaturally stilted gangrene-limbed man I once knew as my brother stalk the empty office halls while beckoning out to his wife as if he were calling their children down for dinner. “Sheils, this is crazy honey. I love you but I need you to think about what you’re saying to me right now. Why should I starve myself and let the *face I own* spoil just because you’ve decided on a whim you want to keep it?  It’s not yours to keep honey, you’re being selfish. I’ll die if I don’t eat. Meet me halfway here”.  What sickened me more than his words was the tone of his voice. He seemed to earnestly mean every bit of what he had said- as far as he was concerned, his wife’s face *belonged* to him and he was entitled to eat it as if it were a sandwich she had playfully snatched from his fingers and run off with. 

“Found you. Mischievous today aren’t we?” I stifled a gasp and averted my eyes- but not fast enough to spare myself the grizzly image of the bravest person I’ve ever known- a woman any reasonable person would be lucky to call sister-in-law- flail her legs and defiantly scream as the towering spindled demon lifted her off the ground to meet his gaze. 

I closed my eyes and strained them until I saw stars in my vision. *CRACK*! Silence deafened the corridors. I felt the wind leave my sails as my stomach turned. “Charlie boy-o, not you too! What is going on with you guys today? Seriously,  I’ve had enough.  I know you’re down under that desk, you absolutely reek! Why are you looking at me like that? Did I do something to upset you?” I instinctively scrambled backward, only for the back of my head to make jarring contact with the cold granite wall I was pressed up against.",38,1749754146.0
1l9rblk,mxfmiwr,"I hear the sounds of her voice all too loud despite the music blasting from every system in the house. I set it up on purpose to hide the sounds of the kitchen hood, which in turn is necessary to try and mitigate the scent, alongside copious amounts of air fresheners.

I move around frantically, knowing I'm on borrowed time now that she's awake. It'll only be another five minutes before her heightened senses zero in on me, maybe another three if she decides to make a game out of stalking me. These eight minutes are all I have to complete the final steps of the ritual.

I have no time to carefully measure the final pinch of alchemical ingredients. Eyeballing it is somewhat risky, but timing it is crucial, so I just go with my intuition and a low estimate. The heat of the enchantment is almost too much to bear, and sweat is dripping down my neck both from the temperature and the nerves. Still, there's nothing I can do now but see the process to its conclusion.

I hastily get the gloves and grab the tray with the blistering, searing mass of hand-crafted magic. I carefully arrange the prepared components and apply the arcane sigils with fresh blood. This is the smell that will draw her in in moments, but that's exactly what I'm counting on.

Not half a minute later, the doors to the kitchen burst open. There she stands, so familiar but so changed, with bloodlust in her narrow golden eyes, green scales running down her neck, and long claws promising naught but death and pain. Her jaws hang open unnaturally low, drool dripping down onto the floor, as her manic gaze surveills the scene before her. 

""Surprise, darling! Happy Transformation day!"" I exclaim, presenting her a tray with pieces of juicy medium-rare stake, carefully seasoned and accompanied with various veggies and pastries, combining into what could only be my greatest culinary masterpiece.

Her gaze softens and lingers on the plate, even as her drooling intensifies. ""Oh... Dear... You didn't have to..."" She mumbles, even as her claw reaches for the plate. I push it gently aside with a wide grin. ""Anything for you, my love. But not before you brush your fangs""",16,1749755806.0

You swat at the flames with your newspaper. You go for the fire extinguisher, but unfortunately, it's on fire.

""I must request that you relocate to the basement,"" your Tiny Maid Robot repeats.

You cough on all this drape smoke. ""HOW THE FUCK IS GOING TO THE BASEMENT A GOOD IDEA?""

""I must request that you relocate--""

Damn thing's blocking the only exit. You try to push the Tiny Maid Robot aside, but it is actually quite large and cumbersome. Countless anti-skid resistor pads line its weighted base. ""Tiny Maid Robot,"" you say, steadying your voice. ""This is an emergency. I request that you--""

""In case of emergency, please call the number printed on the inside of my control panel.""

The control panel is under the weighted base.

As if on cue, the flames leap to your spice rack. The smoke swells with Paul Prudhomme's Pizza & Pasta Magic.

""Shall I deploy the reticulated safety net?""

You wasn't aware this Tiny Maid Robot came with a reticulated safety net. What the hell's a reticulated safety net?

Before you know it, Tiny Maid Robot has deployed the reticulated safety net. You watch through its encumbering mesh as the last scrap of the kettle crumbles into char.

""TINY MAID ROBOT,"" you cry. ""REMOVE YOUR SAFETY NET!""

Tiny Maid Robot's head--an add-on you had installed to reduce the uncanny-valley nature of this whole thing--appears to slide from its robo-shoulders, thumping hideously to the floor. Why the hell wasn't the head more firmly attached? You watch, annoyed, as Tiny Maid Robot begins to secrete some sort of viscous brine. It issues a low, sonorous farting noise and then powers off.

Later, you watch from the curb as firefighters haul Tiny Maid Robot from the wreckage, and you fill with a resolve as bitter as your singed-off eyebrows. This is the last time you order appliances off Temu. Probably.

Rude. They didn't even offered me a drink.
Nevertheless, I go where I am told and I do find the witch.
Quite easily, and as I see her, I sigh.
""Seriously?"" I mutter as I watch her tend to her vegetable garden.
She is literally linked to the entire goddamn forest' lifeline!
Now it makes sense how and why hundreds of villages complained about her.
I take her away, the whole forest is damage, which wouldn't be that big issue for a wizard...
But this forest is covering 60% of the entire Kingdom!


""Yo! Stalker! Will you come down and talk, or you get off by only watching?"" she shouts.
I freeze.
What...
I descend.
""Excuse me, I am William von Argent, Royal Wizard.
The villages around the forest raised a bounty against you."" I said.
She smiles at me, and gestures around.
""You can see my magic don't you?"" she asks.
I nod.


""You are a green witch, and you draw your power from the forest.
But in exchange...you tend to it, and protect it."" I sigh.
""So can you guess why villagers hate me, just before winter?
And after the harshest tax season? And a potential war on the horizon?"" she asks.
""They started to prepare for bad times.
Cutting trees and hunting."" I said.
""Overhunting and felling trees, when there are plenty of logs, and already fallen ones."" she frowned.
Then it makes sense.
""Want some tea? My cookies are legendary."" she continues.
I am surprised, but agree.


The tea and cookies are truly good.
""So? Am I going to jail?"" she asks.
She is so...calm.
""If I were a newbie, yes, but I know that you basically can't do anything detrimental to the land, nor can I take you away from it without damaging it."" I said.
""Then?"" she asks.
""Provide the villagers what they need without damaging the future of the forest."" I said.
She laughs.
""That is nice, but how can we do it?"" she asks.
""There is a part of the forest close to the Royal Capital.
We can meet there with ministers to find a way."" I said.
""Is that an invitation to a date?"" she winks at me.
I blush.


""W-well I will be going now.
I will tell Her Majesty about you, and have this movement started.
The forest snd the villagers are the foundation of our Empire."" I say, standing up.

1l9p1hg,mxi5b4x,"Along the shoals of Willow's Tarry, brackish waves gently lapped the grey rocks and brown weeds, gently nudging the near dead shrubbery inward. 

A young woman knelt down to touch its brittle sprouts, paying no mind to the old man that was approaching her from the village's edge. He waited until he was a respectable distance behind her back, far enough to not impose any physical threat but close enough for her to hear him. 

He rose his walking stick to tap the ground and notify her of his presence since she undoubtedly didn't hear his steps in the grass and sand.

""Hello, wizard.""

""Greetings. I'm no wizard. I do not travel with the carnival. Although, I do drink with them quite often."" The old man chuckled. ""I'm a mage educated at Oxford. My name is Offal.""

The woman stood up and turned to face him, her drab skirt twirling with stiff muddy edges. ""Offal? That's an unfortunate name for a mother to give to a son.""

""Good thing it was my father then."" Offal noted that her eyebrow only rose a minute degree in amusement. He thought he was funnier than that. Then again, all men do. ""I'm here to meet a witch.""

""And you think I'm her?""

""Perhaps. I haven't a stone and a lake to verify though.""

The woman stiffened. ""That practice works on the most starved man just as much as the most gluttonous woman, wizard.""

""Not a wizard."" Offal corrected. ""I'm joking. Witches don't breath air. Why would they ever drown?""

""What makes you think that witches don't breath air?"" The woman asked. Was this another legend amongst the evangelical townsfolk? It was bad enough she had to give up sweeping her cabin because of last week's chatter.

""Well, fiction doesn't have lungs. They *come* from lungs."" Offal waved his hand exaggeratedly. 

""Oh."" The woman blinked. Offal reminded her of more than a few drunk uncles. ""I'm Beatrix.""

""Why did you think I was a wizard?""

""Well, the town keeps trying to get a trial for me and according to the town bylaws, we need a wizard from the court to officiate it. Then half the town argues that wizards are unholy and cannot be summoned even if to kill a witch.""

Offal nodded knowingly. ""And the other half?""

""They think the ends justify the means and that they need our town gypsy, Fred (who is really our town Etruscan) to summon a wizard.""

""And what does Fred think of this?""

""I dunno, you tell me. You're here, aren't you?"" Beatrix crossed her arms.

""Fair enough. A Greek fellow named Fred did show up in the Royal court asking for a wizard. He didn't realize that your town bylaws actually say 'mage', so everybody kept directing him to the carnival."" Offal muttered. ""By the time I was summoned, he told me of you and the town before leaving with the carnival to the east.""

""Huh. And what did he tell you?""

""There was a young woman who kept curing their town with the bark of various trees. And the town did not believe her when she said there was no point in divining humors.""

Beatrix smiled proudly. 

""He also told me that this young woman was also selling spells in hex bags at high costs. And that the wives who bought them are the ones needling their husbands to summon a wizard after finding their husbands still alive in the morning.""

Beatrix winced. ""I told them they had to express their energy hard enough. If it didn't work, they clearly still loved their husbands. That's something positive to take from the purchase.""

""I'm pretty sure they just wanted a dead husband.""

Beatrix's shoulders slumped. ""So are you here to take me to trial?""

""Yes, but not here. I'll take you to one of the lower Royal courts where you'll stand trial for practicing without an Apothecary license.""

""Not witchcraft?""

Offal shrugged. ""Witchcraft? The courts don't care about illusions meant to rob the gullible. Otherwise,  we would never have a carnival. Gather your things and I'll assure you it's probably a light sentence until you can pay the Apothecary guild for membership.""

Beatrix was surprised but nodded and started walking alongside Offal. ""So why did Fred leave with the carnival? He did have a life here.""

1l9k5i0,mxh7z2k,"My power is very confusing and is extremely challenging to use. The power to have all powers that nobody believes I have is, in all honesty, a bit of a mind f@&k. When I was first brought into the agency the agent believed that I was an all-powerful hero with limitless potential… my power thus made it so that I wasn’t all powerful and my potential was very much limited. When the agent asked me to demonstrate I was always handicapped by their belief in me. I remember when I started to fly and immediately crashed to the ground because the spectators thought I could fly. Same thing with super-speed (crashed into a wall), laser vision (awkwardly stared at a spot on the wall), breathing underwater (lifeguard had to perform CPR). I quickly realized that I needed to get creative.

 

The first thing that I had to overcome was how I personally defined the power I was using. Secondly, I had to convince everyone who is watching that the power I was demonstrating was not the power I was actually using because the moment that even one person thought that my power was anything other than what I told them could spell disaster. For example: I am not using the power of flight, I am manipulating gravity to allow me to lift off the ground. The average person would think that it was a flying ability, and I would reenforce that thought by telling them that “I could fly”. With this, incredibly twisted/confusing mindset I quickly went up the ranks of the Power Agency.

Mae's eyes went wide. ""You did what!"" she yelled. Jean’s chin began to tremble, but then the dragon, still nestled in her arms, stirred his head. With no mouth movement, his voice resonated in their minds, ancient and deep, a tremor through the very air.

**""What disturbs you, my dear Jane? Is this… 'Mae'… an issue?""**

Jean, head bowed, whispered, ""She just doesn't want you to stay with me!""

Jean began to cry, as any young girl would when denied a pet—except this time, it was a dragon. The dragon then turned his gaze upon Mae, and his voice, though still soundless, thrummed with a power that seemed to stretch across eons.

His jaw set, ""what, tell you that im a monster? Watch you look at me with disgust like every other human?""

“Tucker… why? What?” were the only intelligible words I was able to exclaim between stuttered confusion.

He sighed as if *I* was being unreasonable. “I took something at a party last night. I thought it was molly. I guess I don’t know what molly looks like. I was trying to let loose! God forbid!” He slammed the fridge door shut, perhaps with more force than intended, as we heard the clang and crash of bottles from within. “My bad.”

I found myself slowly emerging from the doorway I was hiding half of my body behind. It really was Tucker. He made a big to-do yesterday about wanting to go out with some of our more extroverted friends in lieu of our usual nightly routine of smoking weed and watching Gilmore Girls. I decided to stay home because I’m a creature of habit and now Tucker was… well… a creature.

“This is what I get for one fucking night out…” He was continuing to ramble while I was still in processing mode.

“You seem weirdly chill about it,” I started. “I mean – you do seem pissed, but this seems like the same amount of pissed as when Mindhunter got canceled, not turned-into-a-fucking-monster levels of pissed.”

He sighed and took a seat at the little thrifted dining table, gesturing for me to come join him. I very reluctantly took a seat at the opposite end.",14,1749760976.0
1l9eqox,mxg4c3j,"“I had my freak out last night, babe. This is supposed to wear off by tonight. I was dancing with a guy. He gave me a pill.”

“And he said it was Molly?”

“He said it was going to keep me up all night and feel something I’ve never felt.”

I stared at him with blatant judgement.

“I WAS TRYING TO LET LOOSE.”

“Okay, okay. Sorry. Go on.” It was in that moment I started to recognize his actual features behind the monster-ness of it all. Tucker’s brown eyes, his nose, his mouth. It looked like him beneath it all, as if he was given the most world-class prosthetic treatment for a high budget film.

“So I took it. Went back to his place. Next thing I know, I’m either insanely horny, hungry, or both. He was thrilled. I figured I was hallucinating—looked in the mirror, saw this”—he gestured to himself—“and yeah. Not a hallucination.”

I stared at him, unwaveringly focused. “So who is this guy? He did this to you then?”

Tucker nodded. “Beth, this guy was a fucking freak. I was looking around his apartment and it was like a teenage girl obsessed with Twilight’s fucked-up fantasy. Books everywhere about werewolves and vampires and creepy-cryp—”

“…crypto-zoology?” I finished, and Tucker nodded again.

“Beth. This guy turned me into *this* with a pill. When I realized, I lost my shit, threatened to call the cops – he told me to just enjoy it and that I’d be back to normal within a day. Said the cops would fuck up my life if I showed up looking like this. I mean, he’s probably right. And, well…”

Tucker adopted a sheepish, guilty grin that he immediately tried to erase. And it hit me.

“Oh my god, Tucker, you fucking slept with him still?”

“GOD FORBID I LET LOOSE A LITTLE.” He exclaimed, standing up from the seat and walking away dramatically.

I put my face in my hands, processing the insanity of it all. I guess in this new age of tech and genetic engineering, to make someone appear different temporarily maybe wasn’t THE most insane thing, but the rate at which it worked – this mystery man was clearly a genius, though unethical and insane on countless levels.

“Tucker, we need to talk to him. What if he’s lying? What if you don’t go back to normal?”

It was clear Tucker didn’t want to entertain the idea that this was anything other than very temporary. “No. It’s temporary.” He asserted, suddenly very serious, and that was the first moment I heard real fear in his voice.

I nodded slowly. “Okay, you’re right. Temporary. Let’s just wait and see.”

“Can you please go get me a burger? I’ll send you money.” He said, continuing to ponder. “Actually, maybe a few burgers.” I rolled my eyes and grabbed my keys, about to head out the door.

“Actually – can you just get some raw burger patties at the store?” He corrected.

If he didn’t go back to his regular self that night, we had a very real problem.",13,1749760996.0
1l9otoa,mxf2h6t,"""I fear for the younger generation of mages. They literally cannot read their Grimoire to any standard considered a basic level. Spellbook comprehension is atrocious. And the signs? They don't even bother, they just as the oracles to do their premonitions instead. They all just go chat with Gryneium, Phemonoe, and Tages, and just take what they say at face value.""

""I know, your eminence, and worse still, the instructors do it too, trying to figure out if the students have gone to chat with G, P, and T, they go chat with G, P, and T. Do they not realize how much hallucinogenic mist those oracles are breathing, all the time? Sure, they can glimpse the truth from time to time, and even a future future that may not yet come to pass, but still... I've always taken everything any oracle says with a heaping helping of salt.""

""As well you should, generative prophecy is as unreliable as these current students reading ability. Your report stated that less than a quarter of the students are even functionally literate in the arcana alphabet. The recently enhanced access to the oracles alone cannot be the whole cause of this. Tell me bluntly, administrator, what is happening here?""

""I think, sir, that perhaps the 'no mage left behind' initiative might have something to do with it.""

""What?""

""Respectfully, sir, some mages aren't meant to be archmages. The current generation doesn't *all* need to become esoteric researchers. We will still need some run of the mill artificers to make all the everyday things we use. Do you know the magic toilet enchantment by heart, sir, or would you hire out a replacement if your latrine enchantments wavered?""

""My latrine enchantments would never!""

""I'm not saying they would, but mine might, and I too, am a highly ranked archmage. I would certainly hire a lesser mage to fix the toilet. Toilets are beneath me, and you too.""

""But all mages should be equals!""

""High-minded, but impossible, and you know it. Do you consider us as equals, your eminence? You have easily triple my mana capacity, and double my years. I'm sure if we fought you would squash me in mere moments.""

""Hmmph. You've made your point administrator.""

""Have I made it strongly enough for you to rescind the 'No mages left behind' initiative?""

""FINE! Yes you have, but... I am placing *you* personally in charge of the return to the old ways."" 

""Unless you plan to undo the Legion of Locations Magic applied to the oracles by those archmages with more talent than ethics, I suspect we'll have to come up with a *new*, new way to teach them. Perhaps beatings could be part of it, though I suspect that might have other, unexpected knock on consequences.""

""Beatings were common in my day. We had a lot more necromancers back then too, *surely* they weren't related. Come up with something *actually* new.""

""Well... maybe beatings are out then. I'll think of something. Somehow, we've got the get the young mages back in their Grimoires, and out of their chats with G, P, and T.""

""Practical tests, more laboratory work as part of the curriculum, perhaps? Make them prove their skill in act, not just on the scroll.""

""Is that how it was in your day, sir?""

""Somewhat, yes. We didn't even have magic circles well researched back then, and communication stones? Forget about it, we just shouted down the hall.""

""Hmmm... I can work with that. We might have a half a generation of unfixable mages already, but the next ones we can hopefully keep from going down the same path. Some will fail, and some will shine, but all of them will have a place in society. I worry about these illiterate prophecy addicts though.""

""As do I. But lets worry about helping them another day. If our efforts at the next generation fail as well, then perhaps the same solution will work for both sets of generations we failed.""

""Wise as always, sir.""

1l93bob,mxa5qrz,"I could remember it well, part of the blessed curse of my kind. Unfading memory, no matter how old we grew. It was an average week day for most, downtime for us in our adventures. It had been an overcast day, threatening rain that never appeared.

We had been joking about a recent escapade, venturing into the cave of a pregnant Rock-bear and her mate. It was my idea, wanting to observe and study the birth. Part of my studies on rare creatures, exploring where no sane person would even dare think about. And it had been wondrous. They hadn't seen our arrival, nor notice our presence at their birth.

That was until Jernen sneezed. Out of the blue, where he couldn't hold it in. It made me jump, as it broke the stealtg enchantment upon him. The very, very angry papa bear showed his displeasure by attempting to eat Jernen. We had run, and managed to escape without further incident.

Jernen had looked over at me, a shy smile on his lips. I was finishing saying how I wished I could have someone to care for who cared for me, like the bears. And he had said in that quiet voice of his. ""I bet I can make you fall for me.""

I laughed, nudging him with my shoulder. I answered with two words. ""Challenge accepted.""

And like that, it began. He courted me throughout the years. I of course accepted it, because it was only a few decades to me. Plus, it was a challenge to him. It would hardly be fair if I ignored it.

We had wed a few years later. He wanted to experience it, as did I. With the benefits avaliable to married couples as well, it was a no brainer really. It had been a beautiful winter wedding, snowfall as we joined hands.

The years flew by, etched in my mind but melting away like ice in the summer. So many pleasant times, with me for the remainder of my long existence. A few sad times to mix in. The odd fight, and embarrassed apology after. A tapestry of life, mine and his together.

But it didn't last. He faded away, as they always did. He grew old, old and weary, whilst I remained appearance wise in my prime. Illnesses hit harder, his reactions slowed. I helped him, of course I did. I wouldn't abandon him now, not after so long.

And now, the spectre of death hung close. I could feel it, as could he. He lay in bed, breathing gradually becoming more laboured. But he still managed to turn to me, his humour present, as he whispered. ""So... did I win our little bet?""

I knew exactly what he meant. Many responses filled my head. Joking, comforting, even charming. But only one was right. I held his hand tightly, knowing it was only right for me to tell him the truth.

I leaned in close, giving my gentle smile. ""No. You didn't.""

He blinked, but I quickly continued. ""Because I had already fallen for you before we made it, my love.""

His face broke in a wide grin, looking up to the ceiling above. ""I'm so glad.""

It didn't take long after. He closed his eyes, as I sung over him, as he so loved. Between notes he breathed out, a rattling breath that I knew was his last. My sing petered out, as I leaned in to steal one last kiss.",609,1749680890.0
1l93bob,mxc3ad4,"""Not the way you wanted to, darling."" 
He smiled, wrinkled lips shifting the hair around them back into the messy nest it inevitably became. 
""You bastard. Don't mix your silly philosophies into this, just admit it."" 
A smile of my own found its way as I tried to fix his beard once again. I uttered a few protestations as he kept pushing, trading small thoughts, but eventually I found enough of my words.
""I found a new sense of joy for the small nothings. You helped me see that, and I'll always carry it. But the way you love, the passion you lived in and for, that was never me. I couldn't fall for you, because I can't feel like that. 
A thousand years before you, maybe a thousand more, but these decades will always stay with me. 
You will always stay with me.""
He chuckled, a wheezing breeze that seemed to come from beneath him rather than his own body. 
""Sounds like I won well enough!"" 
""Because you're a stubborn little thing. Your species feels differently, you know."" 
His chuckles turned to coughs. 
""Or we have differen ways to esplain the same thing! Who k-nows, you might evn lose a tear for me..""
""My sweet summer being, brought to the autumn of life.""
My hand found his cheek, and my eyes found his, once-bright but clouded with age. 
""You were more special than I expected. Maybe, if we had another few lifetimes together, I would have understood enough of you to feel something similar to what you've described throughout these years, to what I've seen time and time again. Your choice of challenger was difficult, even for an elf."" 
His breath began to shorten even more, now. It wouldn't be long. 
""I know."" 
It was a whisper. I leaned closer, to make it easier for him, almost putting my face to his.
""But I also knew you were the only one I wanted to challenge."" 
His impetuousness always tickled me, which I had always found odd. I chuckled, and noticed water has fallen onto him, following his wrinkles off onto the pillow. As his light died, more came, and with a suddenness I realized where it came from. 
""Maybe you did win, after all.""",42,1749707843.0
1l93bob,mxgb6d1,"I sit on the chair by their bed, doctors said there is nothing else they can do, but keep her comfortable. Humans die so fast. I reach down and grab her hand. She opens her eyes and makes contact with mine, “So, did I win our little bet?”

I look back at her. I think back the sixty years I’ve known her. Back to the time, 5 years after we met, and started adventuring together. We avenged her father, her kingdom, but in doing so, made it so she was unfit to rule. I think back on why I had joined. My old friend Domgar the dwarf had said this was to be his last adventure, and he wanted it to be with me. Considering I was the one who could drink his father under the table, it sounded like a request I could easily fulfill. His connection to the quest was three human generations back, when the great grandfather had attended his father’s funeral, had a drink, and a promise was made to help the family in time of need. 

So we had joined a party of adventurers, one Princess who had been chased out from her own land, family brutality killed eighteen years prior. Domgar had been waiting for her to come of age, and then when she was twenty five, she was ready. She had forged her blood axe, sharpened it, and was ready to use it. 

Finding the king, who had stabbed her father, after surrendering, pleading to not destroy their kingdom. Her mother buying just enough time to get the daughter out, down the hidden dwarfish tunnels to the north. Right before the Seven year tithe, a period of non-contact the dwarves do once every two centuries, training all the next generation. She lived there seven years under the ground, learning the forge. Blacksmithing, and finding a talent no one would have expected. 

When she emerged she learned of her kingdoms complete fall. Now a vast bog, as if the gods of death had cursed her kingdom. It was then she received the call, become justice for her people. For her family. But she must prepare first. Eleven years it took to prepare. I visited when just a year was left. She had locked herself in the forge, as was tradition from the god of the forge. He didn’t know when she would come out, but knew we had to be ready when she did. This is when I learned her story. 

She didn’t rush, like humans like to do, but she didn’t just wait like my kind do. She proceeded forward, and waited and got her perfect revenge. Two years we got revenge, three years we stopped the king’s resurrection but she lost her royalty status to do so. A noble sacrifice, but it left us afterwards, at the pub, wondering what to do from there. Me being a nomad wasn’t worried, but Domgar’s adventuring time had finished. He had his family to return to, his promise fulfilled. He had just bit us goodbye when she looked at me, a little drunk, and made the bet. 

And what’s a small bet like this, to a three thousand year old elf? I asked her “are you sure? I have rigorous requirements. I don’t stay in one place, but move around constantly.” 

“Then we will go together, and see the world” was her response. “Besides, there is nothing here or anywhere else for me now”

“You could have gone with Domgar. Returned to the forge.”

“I could have, but that isn’t the forge for me. His son who was trained with me should manage that fine. I’ll find my forge on the road.”

So we paid our tab, and slept off our drink, and we wondered. We stopped in various kingdoms, she forged weapons of war, or plowshares wherever we went. She helped local blacksmiths improve, but never had her own forge for long. Three years is the most we would spend in one place. And we would never go back. 

Thinking back over everything, I can’t name a singe point in time when I lost the bet, but I know I had lost it. Considering how drunk she was when she made it, and that we never talked about it since, I wasn’t sure she remembered it at all. I can’t speak though, I can only nod my head, and tears form in my eyes. 

She smiles as I cry, and grabs the locket that has hung around her neck since the bet. With a surprising amount of strength, she pulls it off, and breaks it open. And on one side I see Domgar. Perfectly crafted in the middle out of the red metal that was her blood axe, but tiny, so so tiny. “Return this to her when you have the chance. But this one” she places the other half in my hand and closes it around the warm metal “you keep.” 

She then closes her eyes, and her breathing slows, and stops. She grows cold far too fast. But in my hand, still warm, is a pair of figures crafted in a hug, a warm loving embrace. It is of her and I. I hang my half on my neck. Comforted by its warmth, knowing she will always be with me.

Wait, did she say Domgar was a female?",9,1749763122.0
1l93bob,mxi1vu2,"""So, did I win our little bet?""

The healers have ceased their bustling around the room. The clouds of incense, whose spicy, saccharine smell I loathed when Elora first began her descent, are now strangely comforting. We have been doing this for so long, I find that I have come to associate the scent with her–with the long hours beside her bed, the frequent visits to the houses of healing that forced us to slow down. No more adventures to the edge of the world. No more slaying dragons.

""You know,"" I say, squeezing her hand, which is always so cold these days, ""I believe we have learned more about one another in the past few months than we ever did during our courtship or even our first year of marriage.""

She rolls her eyes. ""Tyr, I don't think--"" She gasped in pain, then sank further into the pillows. ""I don't think we have time for another of your... thoughtful replies.""

Still so sharp. Her quick tongue is one of the reasons I accepted her bet in the first place.

I have always been fascinated with humans. Though many of them walk through their brief lives as though they are immortal, their flash-in-the-pan nature seems to affect every aspect of their culture. With every second so precious, they are obsessed with convenience. They seem to have a new little machine or a new spell every time I blink. They speak of a single day as something one must take hold of, must wring, like a wet cloth, of all its pleasures.

Mother hated how much time I spent in the neighboring human village as a youth. But having only lived for twelve years, I had not yet grasped the meandering flow of time. I craved danger just as the humans do. Though I think Elora craved it even more than I did. 

I thought myself brave, even reckless, when I joined a band of adventurers. Then we met our first quarry–a massive troll who'd been terrorizing a defenseless hamlet nearby. And as I sat under cover, strategizing our best route to victory, thirteen-year-old Elora limped back behind our boulder–no one had even noticed her leave–with bloodied sword slung over her shoulder and eyes ablaze from the thrill of the fight. The troll had snapped her leg, but not before she had managed to plunge her blade into its belly.

It took many quests and many years for our band to learn to work together, and it was Elora and I, more than anyone else, who butted heads the most. When we were sixteen, I distinctly remember arguing that ""you can't just stab a dragon, Elora.""

And she disagreed!

""Is there a single thing you can accomplish without depending on that cursed blade?"" I asked, having stewed on the insult for months. Somewhat ashamed of my rudeness, I looked down and continued scratching a battlemap in the sand.

""I bet I can make you fall for me.""

Taken aback, I met her eyes, so green and so completely earnest. She quirked an eyebrow.

""Well?""

I let a smile slip onto my face, resuming my map-scratching. I had nothing to lose, really. Her life would be so short, so even if I stayed with her for the rest of her life, I wouldn't even have reached one hundred by the time of her death. It would certainly be an interesting few decades.

Mother would be furious.

I chuckled. ""All right."" I lifted my eyes to hers again. ""Challenge accepted.""

I was pretty certain she would win, but I did not expect to be beaten so soundly or so fast. Holding to human tradition, our courtship was short. We married only a year later. And I was right; Mother was incensed. Her fury is not as amusing as I thought it would be, though. She refuses to be in the same room as Elora or our son, Eldrin. “His blood is contaminated,” she says.

Our son is perfect, and his blood is fine. It is my bride’s blood that is contaminated. It kills her from within.

The healers say this can happen to humans sometimes. Their bodies get confused and forget to clot their blood, forget to defend against illness, and can even poison themselves. And this is not the kind of human sickness they can just cut out. Believe me, Elora asked. She would have taken a blade to this enemy, too, if she was able.

“Are you going to answer me? Or will you let me die without knowing?” Her tone is playful, but the question stabs.

I kiss Eldrin’s tiny, fuzzy head and transfer him to her arms. He stretches for a moment, then snuggles into her chest, asleep once more.

I struggle to speak past the knot in my throat. “Our time was not supposed to be this short!”

She grimaces. “Tyr–”

“No! I knew we would not grow old together. But when I accepted your challenge, I expected decades. Stars, I have not even reached the Slowing yet! You have not a single silvered hair. Our son–” I cannot continue. Instead, I bury my face in the bedcovers at her side.

Her cold fingers twist in my hair, and we lie there quietly. My body quakes with silent weeping for a while, until her steady breathing calms me. We breathe as one for the last time.

“So, I won, right?” She asks again.

I lift my head and choke out “Yes, Elora.” I cannot help the laughter that escapes as well. “You won, My Love.”

She closes her eyes with a satisfied smile. “That’s good to know.”",6,1749784582.0

1l9rzdz,mxfq1u4,"Yesterday was insane.

Planet Breaker returned and his plasma blast had incinerated a quarter of Capital City. Fortunately, he was stopped in less than an hour thanks to a quick response by the Capital Protectors. 

I work at a crisis hotline that heroes like the protectors call when they're at the end of their rope. We see these guys as unbreaking and unrelenting, but their close up seat to the things that the news would get fined for showing us weighs heavily on them. 

Almost all of the Capital Protectors called in before the end of my shift yesterday. A colleague of mine got a call from Steel. We knew that was coming. News footage showed him surviving a plasma blast that completely obliterated the family he was trying to protect. His impenetrable skin was perfect for protecting his internal organs, but his body could only cover so much. 

Another colleague was on the line with Track Star. I've received calls from her before. Her happy-go-lucky persona hides the guilt she feels when she's not fast enough to move everyone to safety. I'm sure she's in the gym right now training to run faster than a plasma blast, but I don't think that's gonna happen unless she comes across another radioactive hummingbird.

I heard at the water cooler that somebody had to talk The Thinker out of quitting. Her heart couldn't take another mind going silent moments before rescuers pulled the body from the rubble. She needed a reminder that she saves more people than she misses.

The hospital called us and my supervisor was on the line with Tank trying to convince him to accept medical care. He was tired. He happened to be on site for all 4 of Planet Breaker's attacks. He accepted medical care when he learned of Planet Breaker's fate.

Which brings me to Captain Capital. No call from him. We've never had a call from him. Maybe he has his own personal therapist that he talks things out with. Maybe he's just built for this type of thing. However, the fight ended with Captain Capital crushing Planet Breaker's heart. It happened so quickly, the news cameras didn't have time to cut the feed. 

Captain Capital had never ended a life before that (at least not to the public's knowledge). He never had to. He has a toughness and speed unmatched by anyone on the planet. He led the Capital Protectors for a reason. It was a move one would expect from a war hero like Tank, but Captain Capital always seemed so above it all. So unflinching. So unwavering. So consistent. 

I wasn't on the line with any of the Protectors yesterday. I had spent most of the day trying to convince Clonin' Cody that he was not responsible for the actions of his evil stray duplicate. I had a relatively uneventful day as I kept an eye on the news.

However, that changed this morning. I clock in, get to my desk, and receive a phone call within minutes. 

I hear incontrollable sobbing on the other line. 

""Hero hotline, here to support those who support us"" I say. ""Who is calling and how may I assist, you're not in this alone.""

The sobbing continues for half a minute. 

""Is everything alr—""

""The b-blood won't come off my g-glove..."" a broken voice manages to muster out.

Broken as it may be, this voice was recognizable from hundreds of press conferences, news interviews, and public addresses over the decade. It was Captain Capital as no man had heard him. Broken, hurt, and unsure.

""I've been washing my hands for hours,"" he continues, only slightly more composed ""b-but the blood won't come off.""

""Maybe you should take the glove off."" I respond gingerly, not entirely knowing what tone to take with a broken demigod.
 
""O-Okay. I can try that"" he responds. ""GAAAAAH!!!""

I hear him scream. ""Is everything okay sir?"" I ask calmly. 

""IT'S ON MY HAND! THE BLOOD IS ON MY HAND! IT'S UNDER MY NAILS! IT'S ALL RED! HIS BLOOD IS ON MY HAND!""

This one seems above my pay grade. I wave my supervisor over and place the phone on speaker, ""Sir can you hold on while just a second whi—""

""NO!!! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!! HELP ME GET THIS BLOOD OFF MY HANDS! PLEASE!!""

My supervisor also immediately recognizes the voice. 

""Hey Captain,"" my supervisor begins, ""Are any of your friends there to help with the blood?""

""Nononono,"" Captain Capital responds frantically, ""My friends can't be near me! I hurt people! I don't want to get blood on them too!"" 

""But Captain,"" my supervisor begins encouragingly, ""you save people. Even yesterday, you saved a lot of lives.""

There's a few seconds of silence

""Then why won't the blood come off..."" He says this in the steadiest voice he's had all call. We hear a click and then nothing. 

""Do you think that's the last we've heard of him?"" I ask my supervisor.

The scarred woman pointed her weapons towards the mass of cackling toxic blue. She could see red lights inside, one of them was the nucleus, the others decoys designed precisely for this: Conceal its position.

The mass of toxic waste chuckled with dark voice as a big man was fighting to get free of it, his tactical suit and skin getting melted in contact with the monstrosity.

""Clair! Shoot! Shoot! You have to hit the right one! Quick!""

Clair looked at her companion being consumed, sighting as she glazed quickly at the red lights. There was no time to be horrified, there was no time to save him, there was no time for pity or to remember the good times. In a few seconds she would also be engulfed in the toxic waste and then all would be lost, well maybe not, but she would be death and for her it might as well be.

As his companion screamed in agony and disappeared inside the monstrosity the lights focused on her. A chorus of bubbling sounds resonated from the creature to form things resembling words.

""And there was one left…""

As all the red lights focused on her Clair had a revelation. She aimed her gun and…

""BANG!""

 There was a silent on the room as the creature keep wobbling, suddenly the toxic waste hit Clair’s leg and she fell on the ground as it started to dissolve. The blue toxic mass made sounds similar to laughter as started covering her.

""You missed…""

""Je…"" Containing her screams of pain the scarred woman managed to also laugh as felt her cells being poisoned by the radioactive waste. ""No I didn't...""

""…huh?""

The monster paused and its focus changed, the red lights all looked at one of them, expecting something to have happened to it.

                                                                             **BANG**

Suddenly a bullet pierced the nucleus that the creature had just looked at, breaking it into pieces. The monster screamed and trashed about as Clair kept laughing while her body continued melting.

""Ha! Made you look!""

The toxic blue waste screamed, trashing about in fear and fury as Clair managed to craw what was left of her out of it. Her legs were now useless and she was already feeling sick due to the radiation, but for the moment she was alive.

The creature screamed as one for one it’s fake nucleus started to lose its red light one after another until finally only one was left, focusing at her, desperately trashing about in pain.

The scarred woman pointed at it with his index and smiled at it with a painful smile.

""BANG!""

The red light looked at the woman imitate once again the sound of a pistol before going dark. It was over.",16,1749754522.0
1l9lk3j,mxfgf10,"It seems my parents only had a limited pool of luck to pass on to their children. My youngest brother has all the luck. Sure, things don't always go great for him, but every roll of the dice seems to land in his favor. Lotteries and ""random"" drawings always go his way. He thinks it's a karma thing, but the reality is that my inhumanely bad luck balances out his wildly favorable luck.

There can be a dozen doors lined up. One unlabeled door is locked, the others are unlocked. I will invariably smash right into the locked one. I don't win lotteries, dice hate me, and even strangers are often shocked at how abysmal my luck can be.

On my morning walk one day I decided I had finally had enough. I purposefully passed under a ladder that was leaned up against my apartment building. My heart was pounding. It felt good in an exhilarating, defiant kind of way. I went past my door and to the other side of the parking lot just to cross paths with my neighbor's black cat.

""You like this?"" I yelled at Lady Luck, storming through the living room into the bathroom to shatter the mirror with a hammer.

I went on a bad luck rampage, doing everything I could imagine that might invite more bad luck.

Huffing and sweating in a pile of spilled salt and shattered mirrors, I looked down at my hand. A large gash was burning in my palm, blood pouring out and running down my fingers. I cried out in pain and ran to the kitchen sink to rinse the salt out of the wound. I blotted at the injury with the kitchen towel, and it was dark and heavy with blood by the time I admitted to myself that I needed stitches.

""Great,"" I muttered to myself.

Driving to the nearby emergency clinic with one good hand wasn't easy, but it was made harder by my distracted mind. I pondered the many years of bad luck I'd already endured. A bad marriage, layoffs, and fluke accidents. I would have cut my hand without smashing mirrors. ""I hope you're having a good laugh,"" I said to Lady Luck.

A car honked at me as I pulled into the parking lot. I must not have seen them backing out. I sighed.

At the clinic a nurse gave me a tetanus shot and poured Satan's tears mixed with rubbing alcohol and battery acid into the wound. I yelled and scowled at the poor young man.

""Hold this gauze tightly against the wound until we can get you stitched up,"" he said, putting a wad in my palm.

I had just taken a seat in the waiting room when my name was called. A young lady holding a clipboard stood just inside the door leading back into the bowels of the clinic. As I approached I saw smile lines at the corners of her lips and eyes. She was closer to my age than I had thought. She grinned at me and nodded her head toward the hand where I pressed gauze tightly into the palm.

""Bad luck,"" she noted.

I shrugged. ""Par for the course.""

""Let's get you sewn up and on your way,"" she said, leading me to one of the many exam rooms.

I followed in a daze. She was gorgeous, and somehow I felt as though I already knew her. As she ushered me into the room I tried to catch a glimpse of her name badge. No luck. It was behind the veil of her glossy blonde ponytail, which flowed over her shoulder like a river of fine gold thread. My mouth hung slightly ajar as she pointed out the chair where I should sit.

She laughed and I forced myself to look away from her glowing smile and vibrant eyes, instead turning my attention to the injured hand.

""Do you cut yourself often, Brad?"" She said my first name with a familiarity that gave me goosebumps.

I chuckled nervously. ""No, and this is my first time getting stitches.""

""Well you've got nothing to worry about. I'm told my skill with the needle is unmatched."" She pulled a rolling table loaded with supplies over and sat across from me on a stool.

Our eyes locked briefly before I looked down again.

""Go ahead and hold your hand out so I can take a look.""

I extended my hand and watched as she gently pulled the gauze away and rubbed down the surrounding skin with a fresh wipe. I looked back at where her name badge should be. She had pulled her hair back, but now the badge was hiding behind a fold in her white coat.

Her eyes met mine again and she smiled. ""You must not remember me,"" she laughed. ""We went to school together.""

I looked up at her face again and squinted. ""I thought you looked familiar,"" I said, ""but I couldn't place your face. What is your name?""

""Kelly,"" she said. ""I sat next to you in math class.."" She paused, then added, ""We also had chemistry together one year.""

Her cheeks reddened a little. A little bolt of lightning shot through my brain and into my heart.

I looked down and gasped. She was already sewing me up.

""Wow,"" I said. ""You really are good at this.""

She smiled and definitely blushed. ""Thank you. It's not every day I get to help an old..."" she hesitated. Her eyes darted up to my face then back down to the stitches. ""Well, I'm glad I got to see you again.""

""We should catch up sometime,"" I blurted. Immediately I felt stupid. She was at work. We hadn't spoken in over a decade. I barely remembered her from school. And everyone knew 'we should catch up sometime' was dismissive and polite but not serious.

She was quiet for an eternity while I regretted ever opening my stupid mouth. She took in a sharp breath, opened her mouth, then closed it again. Finally, she pulled the last stitch through, tied a knot in it, trimmed the loose ends, and took my hand in hers to examine her work. Her fingers were soft and gentle on my hot, throbbing hand.

Then she looked up at me and smiled. ""It would be unprofessional to give you my number while I'm working,"" she said, and her countenance fell.

My heart sank and a pang of embarrassment made my skin crawl. ""Yeah,"" I began. ""Sorry, I probably...""

""But,"" she said quickly, ""My shift is over at six tonight. If you meet me here I'd love to get dinner with you."" She smiled through a look of terror.

I gasped. The moment froze in time. She was more nervous than I was. Her fingers were clammy and trembling. Her eyes darted around my face, searching for a reaction. Just when I thought she might pull her hands away from mine, I cupped one of her hands with my good hand and pressed her cool fingers into the back of my injured hand. The trembling stopped.

""That would be really nice."" I was almost too breathless to speak. I struggled to my feet. She got up with me, pushing the rolling table to the side with her thigh. She was still holding my hand. ""I'll see you at six,"" I said, smiling.

""Yeah,"" she sighed. Her grin was enchanting. I stared at her face, wondering why I hadn't noticed her in school all those years ago. ""See you at six,"" she repeated.

I hesitated, laughing internally at myself. Then I looked past her at the door. ""So, do I pay out at the front counter?""

She blinked and looked around as though seeing the room for the first time. ""Oh, right, yeah."" She looked down at our hands and chuckled nervously. ""I should probably let you go."" She pulled her hands back quickly.

I laughed. There was so much I wanted to say at that moment, but my flustered mind could only look down at the stitches and say, ""great job, thanks.""

""Any time,"" she said wistfully.

""See you later,"" I said, moving toward the door.

She smiled and made a little waving gesture, sliding her other hand's fingers behind her ear as though tucking an invisible strand of hair back. Her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail. I grinned.

As I turned the corner she called out, ""It was lucky running into you today!""",6,1749754078.0
1l9k2f3,mxdis4f,"My last memory was of fire. The last battle was lost, and all the world was consumed. My brothers and sisters fell, one by one, standing firm against the insatiable hunger. The screams of all life tore at my soul as the Dark Gods laughed.

It was long before I was able to crawl out of shadow. Like a beast, nameless and witless, my mind strayed far from the realm of thought or memory. All the while, my body fought its way free from the snare of evil. Even now, with my wits returned, I cannot truly say what transpired.

The prophecies had spoken of the world's rebirth, had sung of creation returned to how it was in the youth of the Elder Days. Even so, when I awoke in a clearing of grass, surrounded by the rustle of trees and the twitter of birds, I at first brought only confusion. Quickly, this gave way to weeping. In death, victory. In pain, renewal. In sacrifice, new life. Perhaps I was alone of all the old world. But our loss had brought freedom and peace.

I wandered far, across hill and river, until I found people again. A small village, tucked between a forest and a lake. They fished and hunted, and their children played between the houses of wood. They treated me with all the rightful suspicion. I was a stranger to them. They had their own heroes, their own legends. My world was not theirs.

They were kind people, once I had gained their trust. I went to work wherever they needed me, taking a heavy load to distract myself. Often the memory of war and pain would burn brightly within, the loss of brothers and sisters moving me to tears in quiet and loud moments alike.

Sometimes I would become hearty at the feast. Sometimes I would dance with a stamina that outstripped even their most spry. Sometimes I would tell the children tales of valiant deeds from my world. They would sit with eyes wide, listening to stories they could scarcely comprehend. Though I would never truly be one of these people, these moments brought me as close to them as I could ever be.

One day, as I was felling a tree alone, there was a rustle behind. I turned to see a badger emerge from the foliage. It reared to its hind paws, and then bowed low.

""Hail, Phoenix Warden,"" it said in a voice born from the ground. ""We are gladdened to know that some of you have survived the cataclysm.""

""You know me?""

""Indeed. Mankind forgets, the world moves on, but the birds, the beasts, the tree spirits, we remember well. The sacrifice of your kind and kin will always be treasured, for the life it bought for many.""

""Thank you, noble creature.""

""It is you who are noble, Warden. This village is in good hands, with you to protect and to serve it. It may be a far cry from your ancient duties, but many will sleep sounder at night because of you.""",9,1749733843.0
1l9gea2,mxda0ms,"Retired Darkness (The Burden of Feeling)

I saw him again, months after I accidentally broke the seal that let him into our world again.
The dark lord, Anikatos, sat beside me on the roof.

Anikatos did not speak. He didn’t need to. He just sat, legs dangling, watching the same indifferent sky I watched, as if the clouds themselves were ashamed of what they had drifted above.

He turned to me, smiling—not cruelly, but with the knowing weariness of someone who’d read the final chapter before the book even began.

> “And I thought I was needed to ruin humanity,” he said.

There was no venom in it. Only fatigue. He hadn’t come to kill. He’d come to observe the corpse twitch.

I looked at him, really looked. There was still something human in his eyes—beneath the shadow and the fire, beneath the weight of rage and centuries. A question, maybe. A hope long since dismembered and buried in some grave he could no longer find.

> “I want to change this,” I said.

The words felt absurd in the air—soft, naïve, a whisper trying to rearrange a hurricane. But I meant them.

I didn’t have power. I didn’t even have people. All I had was the aching belief that there must still be something salvageable inside us.

I noticed that the main thing required to change this world was how humans began to view the world. Their traumas rewriting their reality, distorting beliefs. 

So I began with the smallest thing I could: listening and trying to nudge some in a better path. 
Little did I know how much of a toll it took on me.

---

At first, I thought if I could understand the people around me—really understand them—I could help them return to themselves. I started noticing the tremble in their voices, the flickers in their eyes when they spoke of things that mattered. I tried to mirror back their thoughts without distortion. To become a quiet receiver, faithful and clear.

But it’s never that simple.

How do you speak your pain bravely?

How do you share your internal chaos as it is?

Even when they tried to explain what they felt, I saw their expressions stiffen—not out of judgment, but confusion. Perception, after all, is a prism. Every word they said refracted through their histories, biases, traumas. What I received was never what they gave. And what I gave in return… often felt incomplete.

I began to carry the awareness of not just their loneliness, but the understanding of how I misunderstood it. That made it heavier.

---
How can I help people? Especially the ones who don't help themselves? 

The exhaustion was unexplainable. 

I labored over every word, every expression, trying to ensure I caused no harm, gave no false signal, missed no subtext. I listened as though people were sonatas—layered, delicate, never quite played the same way twice.

I still hardly could help. Maybe slight pushes was all I ever did. How can I do better?

There was a slow, creeping erosion of hope. A silent question blooming in the back of my mind:

> “Will I ever find someone who listens the way I do? Who sees without assuming? Who understands without owning?”

And I block that thought. 

I seem to be simply tired of trying to be the bridge between people who had forgotten how to build. 

And suddenly, I got up, staring at Anikatos, 
""I don't know how, but I feel I cannot afford to get tired, I cannot afford to stop now. I need to gather all my energy and continue in my cause.""

Anikatos, silently raising his eyebrows, eyes dilated, and talking to himself
*There was one person who I knew, who had that same drive that I see in your eyes. 
He was one human that I respected, one human that I was destined to stop, as he was too naive. 
His name.... *

And he slowly breathes the name out, 
""Kronos...""

As I was busy walking around in extreme thought, I could hear this,
""Ayye Anikatos! How do you know my name?!""",15,1749730679.0

I shivered.
I looked around, and I could see no one, well...
Why would there be?
I am in a cage, soon to be sacrificed.
What do I have to lose?
I drink the potion, and suddenly I feel sleepy.
I allow sleep take me, maybe it will be better.


I awoke, breathless, not knowing where I am.
""Calm down.
Deep breaths."" a voice said.
I for some reason, do as told, and I soon manage to calm myself.
I look around and...
I AM HALF IN THE GROUND?
i crawl completely out, and look around.
I see a dress and some shoes...then I realize...
I was naked.
""What happened?"" I asked, dressing up, even though nobody was around.


""The potion I gave you faked your death.
Your village buried you, thinking it was a sign from the spirits that you are not fit as a sacrifice.
They caught a bear, and several boars to sacrifice."" the voice soon answered.
I sighed.
""Who are you?
Why are you hiding?"" I asked.
""Not human."" it said, and that answered both questions.
Oddly enough I wasn't terrified.
""Why did you help?"" I asked.
The voice fell silent.


""Hello?"" I asked.
""Sorry...
My reasons are a bit selfish.
I am one of the beings your ancestors see as ""spirits"" ."" it said.
I froze.
""Have you ever?"" I asked.
No answer was an answer this time.
""I see. Thank you for the help...
Where am I?"" I asked.
""In the Violet Woods behind your village.
Head East for a few days and you will find a town.
You won't be the first young woman there...they are quite a few of you I sent there.
Though you might have to marry fast, to be safe."" it said.
I nodded.
That was expected.
""Thank you again."" I said, leaving.
In a few days I arrived at the town with no hiccups, clearly the voice watched over me.
I felt conflicted, but didn't have much time to think about it as I was approached by the guards.

1l8vdy5,mx9qngh,"The waiting was the worst part, for those both within the village, and for those trapped just outside of it. A dozen steel cages lined the outskirts of the Village of Eir, the home to thousands of Eirans, who had experienced years of solemn peace as the rest of the continent descended into chaos. The Elders had said their village was chosen, that it was destined by the Gods to rise from the destruction that would take the rest of the world, burying them under avalanches and tsunamis, entire cities collapsed under the weight of war.

In each of the cages, a man or woman sat on their knees. Their ankles were shackled, chained to the steel in case any of them had the heretical idea of leaving. But no one would leave. It was ingrained in them since their birth that sacrifices were to be made. Many hoped they would not have to sacrifice their lives. But hope was not what bound them together. It was the Offerings, the thing they were now to be a part of.

Alyra knelt motionless in her own cage. Locked and tucked just at the start of the treeline, a mile from the wall of Eir. Her cage was the worst of them all, hidden in complete darkness, the forest echoed around her. At every chirp, every swoosh of a tree branch, Alyra's ears beckoned - aching to find the source in a forest of shadows.

She had been chosen a week ago. Along with eleven others. They were drawn, taken to the Hall of the Chosen, pampered and fed, bathed and clothed, had every need and desire met for a week straight. Until they were bound, hooded, and forced to trek the mile to their cages without a sense of who was with them in the end - of those who would see them for the last time.

Alyra found no solace in the dark. She despised it. The village was bright and beautiful and the week in the Hall was the greatest she had ever lived. *Of course it was*. She thought to herself as bones of the forest groaned and creaked. *It had to be. Or else why would anyone go through with this?*

She had to think. As much as she could. She had to distract herself from the forest in front of her, the one that held the barrier between Eir and the rest of the continent. Though part of her wished to see it. The continent that was both burning and drowning. *What kind of people laid beyond the forest? What kind of bright and beauty did they have in their final moments?*

Alyra snapped her head as a branch cracked to her left. Her eyes stared endlessly into the dark. She had been here for a few hours already, and though her eyes adjusted, she could only make out shapes. Those of trees and bushes and—

A flash. A shadow. Something moved beyond the edge of the trees.

Alyra took a deep breath. *This was it. This was the monster we held at bay.*

The stories the elders told the children were simple. Eir was chosen, yes, but that came at a price. Dark creatures and monsters roamed their world, and so it was that these monsters needed to be appeased. Twelve, they said, held the perimeter of Eir, and while warriors had tried to slay the beasts, none had ever returned. Seemingly appeased by the offering of those fine warriors, the Elders began the Ritual of the Chosen.

And a few generations later, Alyra found herself to *be* one of those Chosen. Ready, willing, and able to die for the greater good.

She closed her eyes and focused on the sound of her own breathing. She did not wish to see the monsters. She did not have that much courage to face her demise with her eyes open.

1l8vdy5,mxabhej,"I knew this day would come. I always knew it would come, ever since my birth I knew I would end up as a mountain bride. A women of high birth no older than 20 years old is sacrificed to the mountain god for another year of fertile land, and fertile women. Now, I'm trapped here the last noble woman under 20 in my family left. Come tomorrow the moment the sun clips the horizon this cage will be taken from this cave and lowered deep into the lake bellow the mountains that leads to a supposed hidden kingdom. I never bought that story yet it was drilled into me as long as I can remember. After several days of trying to force myself out of this steel cage here I sit holding my throbbing fingers rubbed raw from trying to claw myself out of this cage. 

""Oh there has got to be a better way to do this, or do I just give up already."" I mumble under my breath frustration lacing ever word. The cave the cage has been sat in is only lit by a single candle by the far entrance and the moonlight itself. Then it happens, something scaled reaches deep into my cage. It's almost a hand shape but it's scaled like a snake  with  long fingers  slithering trying to reach out for me.

""HOLY SHIT"" I screamed. I back deep into the furtherest corner of this cage. The walls seem to be closer together than I remember just a moment ago. As I watch the strange hand it suddenly stops and drops a small vial before retreating quicker than it came, but still far too slow for my liking.  I slowly began walking towards that edge of the cage a small eye seems to be looked at me from deep within the cave itself. 

As I grasp the small vial and with that the creature flees even further into the caves system until their existence can only be proven by this small vial itself. I exam it in the moonlight the color is a smooth golden color with what appears to be some kind go flakes the color of deep mine copper. The lid pops off with a small ""pop"" noise barely audible to me let alone whatever guard is posted 30 feet away. A quick smell and nothing seems too wrong with it, a hint of rose and a large smell of sulfur, then it dawns on me. This could be my way out, it also could kill me. I don't know what this liquid is, but what if it gets me out. It must be a LIVE sacrifice the village leader always said so.

1l8vdy5,mxc3n0b,"I went willingly to the cage. The decision to be sacrificed was mine.  
It was, in essence, my vow of absolute fealty. Pledging my body and life to Teocihuiliztli and accepting their judgement, even if it meant being enslaved or eaten.  
&nbsp;  
I didn't see who came to visit my cage in the night; I was securely bound and blindfolded, my freedom willingly surrendered.
But I heard the rustling of parchment, the quiet clink of a bottle on the ground. A written prayer and an offering for Teocihuiliztli, most likely, by someone too shy to face our patron. They can be imposing.  
I heard my guard chuckle a little. I wonder why?  
&nbsp;  
The morning crowed, and I felt scaly hands picking me up, putting me on some kind of platter.  
I felt the warmth of the sun and the faint chill of the wind, heard the cheering of crowds as I was carried to my destination, to what must have been Teocihuiliztli's altar.  
As we went, I wondered; would I be freed, blessed to live a virtuous life? Would I become a slave, serving our patron's needs? Would I be food? Likely not the latter, for all the rumors the only sacrifice known to be eaten was an elderly widow.  
&nbsp;  
All too suddenly, the faint jostling of movement stopped. The crowd quietened, a priest announcing my presence.  
And then, my blindfold was removed. I looked upon Teocihuiliztli, the feathered serpent, the guardian of our people. And they were looking down at me.  
I could see the approval in their eyes, but also their contemplation. Weighing my soul, judging my fate.  
I watched as they turned their head towards what had come with me, the parchment levitating and unrolling in front of their eyes as they read whatever prayer(?) was within. I watched as that same force uncorked the bottle and Teocihuiliztli flicked their tongue, tasting the scent of whatever was inside.

Between the slow, rhythmic dripping of condensation upon the frigid steel cage, and the thin hazy fog that floods the room, Euripedes feels himself slowly fall into a feverish daze. Yet, such a trance fell far from sleep, partly from the incessant drumming of impending doom, and partly from the adrenaline. 

He had occupied himself previously with counting, but he quickly lost count. Then it was attempting to trade cracks in the stone on the ground, but the trail was quickly lost to the darkness. 

He imagined the spirits surrounding him, echoes of dead family, eidolons of friends. The image of them levitating just centimetres off the cold stone floor as they formed a circle around him, alleviated some fear of death. 

Glory was to be had for the one dying. The provident sacrifice to bring joy to the world, and to bring forth the next downpour of rain. To die so that others may feast on plentiful harvests. His life ; insignificant in the face of so many lives. 

The cage, although disconcerting, was no more harsh than his homestead. The darkness, although a cloak for the faces that lurk behind, not more unfriendly than one that plagues moonless nights. 

Drip, drop. 

Oh to have enjoyed the steaming golden baths of Aeryi, or the immensely succulent fruits among the roasted pork of the king's feast. To have daydreamed underneath the shade of a waving leaf of palm, or betwixt the poetry and olive oil. 

All that… shattered in a moment. Perhaps there was never a feast nor poetry, or perhaps the leaf of palm is to be wilted prior to fanning.

Perhaps never was the idyllic sacrifice a glorious one. 

The illusory divinity of his god flashed before his eyes. The gesture of holy blessing as his god’s messenger demanded that the sacrifice be provided. The recoil of his village as he, the eldest of his family, steps forward in blooming glee.

1l8vdy5,mxcxo66,"Our village lies hidden in the mountains — lost and forgotten by the big, scary world. I love wandering the mountains, herding sheep, breathing in the fresh air, and passing our old stone houses with grass-covered roofs. We’ve been living here for hundreds of years, and still, no one has found us.  
  
But everything has a price. Ours is what we call the “spirit of the village” — a name we use to soothe the children. But the “spirit” is real. It’s a demon — with a big, muscular red body, two horns on its monstrous head, and dark wings on its back. And a surprisingly decent sense of humour.  
  
Most of the time, the demon sleeps in its cave. But once a year, it wakes up — and it needs to eat someone. We call it “the spring ritual”. Everyone over twenty gathers in the main square and gets a white stone. Our mayor gets a black one. We put stones in the big bag and shake it. After all the stones are inside, we draw them one by one. I was the seventh, just before my wife. Unlucky — mine was black. Tomorrow, I’ll be sacrificed for the demon.

While I was still stunned, staring at the stone, the mayor took my hand and led me to the steel cage in the centre of the square – my last night would be in front of the village, and everyone could say some words. Including my young pregnant wife. She is beautiful as always, even when crying. Sorry, my darling, I was unlucky too early.  
  
The mayor — a strong, grey-haired man — told my wife and me how dangerous it would be to try and save me – by his words, “spirit” can destroy half of the village. I know it, I saw it once. We can do nothing. The outside world is too dangerous – I saw an archmage burn a capital city to the ground in a single second. I saw how aristocrats squeeze every penny out of a village. I know the world and know – the demon, who is hiding the village, is better than everything else.

The mayor is a good man; he brings a soft blanket for my wife and one more for me. The night is coming. Sleeping in a cage isn’t easy — there’s no space to lie down. As I struggle to fall asleep, I notice a scaly hand place a strange potion, along with a note, just outside the bars before retreating into the shadows. “Random teleportation for my friend”.",5,1749725360.0

It was there now. Whatever it was, for Alyra still kept her eyes shut, but she listened. The echoes of the forest were replaced with breathing, not of her own, but of whatever stood in front of her.

Deep, guttural breaths. They were long and hoarse, and it sounded as if the creature strained to breathe. She slowed her own breathing in response. *I am ready.*

And then she felt it. A skeletal hand on her own.

Her eyes shot open, not purposefully, but out of fear. They only caught a glimpse, a creature no larger than her darting off into the shadows. The faint moonlight glistened off their back, as she realized that they shone – if briefly – in the dark. They were gone a moment later.

Her eyes flashed around. *What is happening? Why would it not take me?*

Below her, she spotted it. A vial, and a handwritten note. Alyra took a deep breath, her hand shook as she reached for it.

**The truth is not what you think.** The ink was barely dry; it fell all around the edges of the words. **They are lying. Drink. Come and see. Drink.** **The Chosen are not dead.**

**Survive. Drink.**

**The Chosen live. So can you.**

**Come and see. Drink.**

She dropped the note. Minutes passed. Thoughts overcrowded her mind until there was silence there as well. Alyra was in the dark of the forest, which she had noticed, even that had grown to a strange silence. The animals stopped chirping. The trees stopped swaying. Even the wind had stopped blowing.

Alyra had no idea how long it had been, but eventually, she wrapped her still shaking hand around the vial. Inside was a dark liquid, occasionally broken by a white streak that lit up and disappeared a moment later. It flashed at her, and as she stared, the liquid itself beckoned her to drink.

Alyra had some courage, yes. She did not fight when she was called, she willingly fell into the system. But it was here that she faced her greatest test.

Wait and most definitely die, by monsters or the Eirans themselves.

Or drink. Drink and face whatever came next.

Alyra took one final look around her, turned back to see the flames of Eir – bright and beautiful as the celebrations began. Then she turned to the vial once more. She mustered every ounce of courage she had left, that wasn't taken by the last week of decadence.

In one motion, she took the cork off the bottle, and drank it one, single swig.

A moment went by. Nothing happened. Then a minute.

Then she felt it. Burning inside of her, the liquid flashed and burned and cooled and dug into her being. She watched as the skin on her began to change. Once pale, human skin, began to shift into something bright and glittering and shining.

Then the cage door opened, and her eyes met the monsters.

Less painless at the very least.  That's when I decide, whatever this is, I'm going to drink it. I bring the vail up to my lips and force it through past my better judgement. The taste is metallic and sweet all at once. I feel it push down my throat warm and smooth.

""What did I just do?"" I mutter to myself. The instant doubt of my actions reaching me moments to late to change the path I have set myself on. It hits slowly my head begins to lighten my breathing feels slow, suddenly the cage I'm in is out of my view and all I can see is the glimmer of the moonlight upon the copper ore above the cage slowly turning from a rich red orange color to a cool teal green. Then, there is nothing for a long, long time.

Suddenly everything is happening at once I feel myself moving, fast, faster than I ever thought possible before the cool wind brushing my face leaving red marks on my cheeks. The I'm being put down on something soft, definitely not in a cage anymore. My sight is either gone or I am in a place where light itself no longer reaches. It smells damp everywhere around me but my surroundings aren't wet.

""Okay, whatever the hell just saved me, Thank you first of all!"" I say trying to sound much less terrified than I truly am at the moment. ""Are we in the dark or,"" I don't have the power to push the rest of the words out. Suddenly I feel a hand, definitely human, thank the gods. It hands my a cup I take it slowly pulling it close to myself trying to make myself as small as possible. I bring the cup to my nose and smell it. Water. Thank the gods I am so thirsty, whoever this person is they can kill me after I get a drink. I think that's fair. 

Quickly I smell smoke then a I see it a small candle lit. I'm not blind, that's always a good thing! I take a moment my eyes adjusting to the sudden dim lighting. In front of me I see the silhouette of a woman. My gaurd lowers, at least that part of my dignity is spared for the moment being. Then I look up and see her face, she's the woman from last year. All around me I see woman ranging from there upper 60s to lower 20s all around me.

As the water impacts gently against the frame, a streak of effulgence streams through the door. It has been a long while since the gentle caress of sunlight, and even for the possibility of a pretentious torchlight, he can’t help but grin a little. 



The door closes, the piercing stream of light trickles to a stop. 



In the total darkness, a set of light footsteps approaches him. The rhyme and rhythm of the steps are a counterpoint to the dripping sound of water, almost as if they had sparked a debate. Their music intertwined into a cacophony of echoes through the room.

Their steps stop just before the bars of the cage. Accompanied by a shuffle of burlap, a jingle of copper keys and chain, was a flutter of parchment and a clink of a glass. 



He felt around the space within the cage, finally grasping the bottle and letter. With what little precious ambient light, among the grey mist, was the shadow of a retreating, calloused hand. 



“Who art thou, the walker among phantoms?” He asked, his voice untrained and gravelly. 



As swiftly as the messenger had arrived, he leaves. 



Following the lifeline of dark ink on darker paper, the words; 



“Venomous courage, or excruciating cowardice. Thou hands never had the grasp of choice, let this be thine method thus. Spin thine illusion into the hammer that shatters the false messenger’s mirage, let it be the revelation that signifies their reckoning.”

The next morning someone needs to retrieve the remains and bring them to the village for a burial ceremony. For the last two years, that ""someone"" has been me. So, I’ve seen the demon twice and now, surprisingly, I’m his friend. How else can I describe his loneliness?

The potion stays in the cage – I don’t want to change my fate. The mayor is sad and pale. As always. The chains are cold and rusty – they will be replaced in a couple of years. “See you” – I say to the mayor's back. He did not respond. I’m waiting for the demon for a couple of minutes – it's loud and angry.  
  
“Why didn’t you leave? They mean nothing!!!” – Well, it’s hard to respond after a sonic blast like that.

“They mean nothing to you and everything to me. I know you don’t need to eat anyone just to keep us here.”

“I’m a demon and I need to grow in strength.” – He looks sad but still serious. – “No, my friend, you will not die today. You want to live here? You’ll live - again”. He placed his hand on my face and squeezed. Pain surged through my whole body — and in the next moment, I saw my grandmother’s face as she lifted me into her arms.

Hello, world. Of course, I start to cry – muscles don’t work yet, I’m too small — and far too smart — to try anything reckless. Attempt number 67. I hope that in this run, I’ll have more time. Maybe this time, I can change him.

1l8o956,mx6ijrn,"I was only a knight, entrusted with guarding the door to the royal dome during the ceremony, yet the warning had reached even me.



As everyone raised their cups of wine high in the air, the witch was scurrying around, asking questions and making small talk with anyone who would hear her. None of them would last long. I didn't know if she could read the room, but it was clear she was only invited because of her nobility. Yet, she engaged with everyone, as aggressive as the last.



Some downright ignored her, but the sly smile on her face didn't fade. 



Her entire attire made her stand out. Her dark purple gown, bold eyelashes, void lipstick, and a pointy hat towering even the king's crown… so extra.



It was almost alluring.



That was until her gaze met mine. I tried to quickly look away, but she practically leaped across the room at that second.



She was now standing before me, hands behind her back as she scanned me like a curious animal. 



""Uhm… Is there something wrong—""



""Are you married?"" The lady interrupted, and I sighed.



It's not like I had anything better to do, so I went along with her games.



""No.""



She raised a brow. ""Have you ever been married?""



""No.""



She cocked her head in concern, ""A relationship, perhaps?""



""I have never been in any sort.""



""Really?"" She zoomed closer, almost sniffing my face. ""Your looks aren't half bad. I was sure you had a lady waiting back home.""



""I'm flattered, but I'm afraid I don't."" I then paused, slightly curving my lips. ""So, are you going to do your thing?"" I asked, and she grew curious. ""Matchmaking. I heard you were renowned for it.""



""Ah. That."" The witch flanked to my side, standing beside me as she took her hat into her hands. ""I don't do that anymore.""



""Why?""



""I suck at it."" 



Those words hit my head like a brick. 



""What? You didn't think I was self-aware of the fact that all thirteen of my attempts ended in both parties breaking up within a day or two?""



""N-No. It's just, I'm curious."" I said. ""What were the matchmakings like?""



The witch frowned but spoke, ""My first client was a tribal chief. He said he liked warrior women who were taller than him.""



I leaned my ear closer.



""…so I matched him up with a female orc.""



Those words hit me harder than the bricks before.



""D-Don't laugh!"" The witch blushed. ""He didn't specify it had to be a human!""



I let out a soft wheeze. ""And then the next?""



She cleared her throat. ""It was a princess, actually. She was tired of the dragons trying to kidnap her again and again, so she wished to meet someone strong enough to protect her.""



I leaned in again, hesitantly.



""… so I matched her up with the dragon instead.""



I almost fell to the floor this time.



""Listen! In my head, I thought if the dragon and princess got together, then every kidnapping attempt would be… a date instead... Plus, a dragon is pretty strong.""



""Just to be sure, my lady."" I steadied myself. ""Have you ever yourself been in a relationship?""



The witch looked at me surprised, then back at the ceremony before her. ""Even though I have royal blood, I'm still a witch—someone who practices taboo magic."" She said, raising her hands to show me the tips of her fingers painted black. ""People like us don't really have a good reputation, you see.""



""Huh,"" I remarked, ""They sure are missing out.""



Stunned, the witch quickly turned to me with wide eyes as I tried to change the topic. ""I mean. Being in a relationship could help you become a better matchmaker. Missing out on such an opportunity would be detrimental!"" I exaggerated.



""You talk highly for someone who hasn't been in one."" The witch retorted.



""Well, I'm always open.""



We both watched as the trays and tables of food before us were replaced by instruments, the hall morphing into a ballroom.



""Can you dance?"" The witch asked, putting her hat back on.



""I'm afraid I'm currently on duty.""



""That doesn't answer my question.""

No my main job is to attend political events in his name. It’s not like he hasn’t thought me much but I get why he loathes these events and why he sends me. 

Anyway here I am at the royal wedding. Nursing a glass of whatever the fuck vintage the elven ambassador brought. As I drink a noble that I overhear “Don’t you dare speak with the witch queen” “She’s coming” “Oh yes” “Why shouldn’t I speak to her is she going to curse me or something?” “Worse she’s a match maker.”

My brain is already flooded with ideas. Sure I shouldn’t talk to her but she’s the witch queen. She knows magical knowledge that make the court mage look like he can only pull a bunny out of a hat. There is too much to gain and at worst she tries to give me a date what can go wrong. 

I walk up to her nervously to say she is an extravagant woman is to say the least. I muster up the courage to introduce myself. “Hi Ms Witch Queen” I say nervously. 

“Oh hi darling. I don’t think I know you. You aren’t a member of any noble house as far as I’m aware.” 

“I’m Markia the court mages apprentice I act as he’s stand in. During these events”  

She smirks “The old fool did always hate gatherings, Can’t stand more then 5 people in a room at a time.”

I tremble slightly as I ask “I know now really isn’t the time but would you have any magical knowledge you would be willing to teach me. Even something small your just one of the greatest mages alive and I had to ask.”

She giggles and says “On one hand it’s not exactly a proper time to ask but I can’t help but find the hunger for knowledge an admirable quality.” She ponders for a moment before saying. “I know let’s play a game. I ask you some questions and after we finish I give you a grimoire I brought with me. I already finished reading it’s on the way here and why not give to the next generation of mages.”

I nod to excited to say words.

“First question: where did your interest in the arcane start”

“When I saw a wandering mage preform magic in my town ever since knew it was my destiny.”

“Humble background interesting. Second Question: what do you consider the most impressive spell ever cast”

“The great whether change. One archmage stormcrown ended the drought by forcing summer to end early.”

“It’s an unpopular answer but it’s not a bad one. Third question are you attracted to woman.”

I suddenly short circuited I was not expecting this question. I nodded and the witch queen simply said.

“Excellent. Now what is your ideal partner.”

I mumble unprepared. “I guess I want someone that is passionate about what they love and would be sweet to me. Also I kind of want her to be taller then me” 

“Well between your answers and the fact I was reading your aura throughout the questionnaire I say you passed.”

“Pass.. PASSED. Passed what!?”

“After the wedding you will go on a date with my daughter she’s just your type. You’ll love her.” She drops to Grimoire on the table. “Don’t worry I’ll raven you the details”

So, after he did a little reconnaissance (aka bugging the royal knights into telling him everything they knew about whatever Kyle considered important to ask), he realized that he needed to learn magic, and maybe try to figure out how to introduce the concept of sanitation to these guys. Seriously, only rich people had soap! There were soap artisans and everything, and soap was just too expensive to mass produce. 

So the first thing he did was pull up a how to guide on making soap at home. It turned out to be pretty simple. A few oils, water, and lye and he had some basic soap, nothing fancy. He even said that he refused to patent the recipe once he introduced it before the king (once he explained the concept of a patent, at least), just because he wanted to spread soap throughout the kingdom cheaply and efficiently. 

He still got a cut of the profits, of course. And it was also a bonus that cases of the nebulous, unoriginal 'plague' with vaguely tuberculosis-like symptoms went down by 30%. 

So, once he was done with that he figured that he needed to learn how to use magic. Turns out everyone here could. It was a matter of will and imagination as well as access to training, not biology or anything of the sort. Magical energy ran rampant throughout this world, and all he needed to do was tap into it. Most wizards used staffs or crystal balls, but Kyle? He said nah. He'd do it by hand. 

He used to read a lot of fanfic when he was younger (oh who was he kidding, he still did), and he pulled up a few of the really worldbuilding heavy ones and tried figuring out how wandless magic worked in Harry Potter fanon. 

He succeeded in casting the patronus charm after thirteen attempts. It was a dolphin, and it shimmered a beautiful silver as it soared through the air. He was pretty sure the patronus charm didn't exist here, but oh well. He used it to defend against a lot of dark creatures, and it worked, driving the darkness away. He also figured out a lot more spells. 

*Thank you, fanfic writers, for your many years of service,* he thought, smirking as he drove another legion of dementor-like creatures away with his trusty dolphin patronus. 

He also made a lot of use of the killing curse. Oops? Oh well, he didn't really care. You'd use it too if you had a giant flame monster coming at you. 

And then came the prophesied fight against the dark/demon lord or whatever it was people called him. 

""Ah, if it isn't the hero, Kyle the Courageous! At last we battle, at last the prophecy—"" 

Kyle tuned him out after a while. He was too busy being annoyed by this world's hobby of giving people stupid epithets. He wasn't exactly courageous. He mostly just rode around on his horse (that he only knew how to ride from a YouTube video) shooting killing curses at demonic foot soldiers. 

He snickered a little at seeing the demon lord's character design. Yikes, this was the guy? He'd seen scarier villains in kid cartoons. This guy looked like Skeletor with stupid big horns and a thick, dramatic black cloak with serrated edges and a shoulder guard for some reason as the only piece of armor. 

He didn't wait until the big bad guy finished his dramatic monologue. Instead, he fired a killing curse at him. 

And then after the body dropped, he set him on fire. The smell was awful, but a quick spell vented out the room. 

After a few minutes, all that was left of the demon lord who terrorised this world for so many years was ash.

He strolled out of the castle with his head held high wearing immaculate clothes. He didn't even look like he'd been in a fight. 

And that was it. He completed the prophecy or whatever and he'd only been in this world for maybe...three months? Oh boy. Hopefully he still had his job. 

Now here he was, before the king and queen and princess, and he had just rejected her hand in marriage while also making a fool of himself at the same time. 

Hopefully no one would cut off his head. 

""Hero Kyle,"" the king said right after he rejected the princess, ""surely we can reward your efforts in some way. Perhaps some land? A title? Gold?""

He perked out. ""That's fine. Er—sorry. Gold. Gold is good.""

He facepalmed internally. He wasn't very good at social interaction, that was better saved for his boyfriend, the biggest social butterfly he'd ever met. 

But gold would be nice. 

So, he got what he asked for. A spacious, magically-enlarged bag with a shit ton of gold, and a way back home. 

There were three balls, two parades, and a knighting ceremony before the king all in his honor before he could leave, though. So in the end, he only was able to return home a month after he defeated the demon lord. 

And all was well. He had a seriously awesome story to tell everyone. Talking to his family through facetime this whole time really wasn't enough.",8,1749690726.0
1l94odn,mxb4b2r,"Our astronomy told us we were special. That our lonely star sat in the void, far from any other stellar body. The nights were beautiful, the galaxy from which our star was ejected painted across the sky. We had so many questions, questions we later learned every fledgling civilization asked. ""Are we alone?"" ""If we are not, what are the others like?"" ""Can they be trusted?""

We husbanded our resources, knowing that we would be stranded on our solitary star for a long time, perhaps for the entire lifespan of our species. Our science grew, we plumbed the depths of mathematics, finding so many beautiful truths like geodes deep beneath the dirt. Our minds were brightened, then enlightened with new ways of seeing reality and of understanding ourselves. Faster and faster, making discoveries and creations that would have defied the wildest ideas of dreamers from only a century ago.

Until, after thousands of years, we found a means of faster than light travel. Over two decades, we refined it, until at last we could step from our lonely star all the way to the galaxy that spat it out. We found it full of signals, things we could not detect at our far removed point in space, but which we would have easily intercepted and translated millennia ago were it not for our isolation.

They were delighted to learn we existed, and so began a cultural and technological exchange. To our great surprise, we had surpassed almost all of them. Our understanding of mathematics was deeper, our physical theories more rich and complete. We had achieved things which they had thought were conclusively proved impossible. So many of their open conjectures could be readily proved or refuted by our mathematicians. Our algorithms surpassed theirs in almost every way. Our seclusion had forced us to grow in ways none of the others had, content in their abundance.

We had sleep walked into superpower status. Various polities vied for our favor, and our own societies and cultures were inundated with alien creations. Alien art, alien stories, alien philosophy. We were utterly unprepared for all of it. In the chaos, a contingent within our civilization crystallized. Alien influences were not necessarily deleterious, but we had to retain at least part of what made our cultures unique. We would learn and grow from our interactions with others, but the lifeblood of what we were, what we had won in our long years of solitude, had to be kept alive.

And so, time passed. The foundations laid by our ancestors were preserved. We came to grips with galactic society, and adapted to being a superpower. We did not fight in wars, we did not engage in political conniving and intrigue. Instead of losing ourselves, the keystones of our society began to bleed into the others. From our island in the sky, a legacy was born that would ring to the end of time.",10,1749692991.0

''BUT I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'.''  
''We'll see about that.'' The guardian stated flatly. As they finished the sentence, they gestured with their staff at the gate. The eye adorning the central lock flinched wide eyed, shaking slightly as it looked left, then right, then with a violent motion finally locked onto the recent, belligerent, arrival. As it peered deep into his soul, it began to murmur.  
*What? It never speaks.* The guardian thought.  
As it peered deeper, drinking of the man's very essence, supping at his nature, its' whispered nothing-words grew louder until the guardian could barely make out what it was saying.

Their meaning were lost on them, but words like *Assured, violent, berserk, kind* floated around in this morass of meaning. The murmur grew to its' crescendo, then it settled.  
Then the eye locked eyes with the guardian, staring as if mad. The eye shook violently as it shared its' understanding with the guardian, as if it would break out of the lock and beat them to death.

I won't bore you with all of the details, but suffice it to say that some drunken misbehavior at a sorority mixer led to me groping a girl that would turn out to be a powerful witch in disguise. And that's how I ended up here.


As I walk to the basement statuary gallery, yet again, the grizzled old security guard walks behind me - one hand on his stun gun. We both know the drill, as I strip down and climb onto the empty plinth at the center of the room. Just as midnight strikes, I immediately start growing to a height of 10 feet and my skin hardens into black obsidian.


Soon, the public will start coming in to see the most popular exhibition in town: the most realistic and scary statue of a werewolf cast out of indestructible black rock.

""Well, this is the time we say goodbye to our journey. And, regrettably, this is where I must also say goodbye.""

Most knew this day was coming, but none expected it so soon, so close to home. Hands were shaken all round, and not a few tears were poorly concealed. One by one, they all cantered away, down the crest, quickly dwindling amid the grassy hills. Before long, it was me and him alone, standing in stiff silence. Our horses had their heads bowed, as if aware of the tension.

1l8zd4t,mx9rx6s,"I watched in horror as the kraken moved around the Velvet Maiden. My captain, Johnsson, had fought with all his might through orders and steering this beauty of a ship but now he was doomed to drown or be slain by the kraken. Even now I heard desperation in his voice, it was hoarse from yelling but held the hope I’ve long lost. 

The mast which held up a large sail with patchwork from past tearing made a sickening crack as it broke in half. A salmon colored tentacle collided with the hull and water started flooding in. The Velvet Maiden was bound to sink in the sea and never be found. Rain poured from the sky above. 

Never had I thought that I would drown alongside my captain and friends I found in this crew. You may call it delusion to even think for a moment that I’d be given the gracious gift of dying on land. 

Just as the waves rise and the kraken looks ready to ambush I see Madam. My heart breaks at the sight of her sleeping by a pile of ropes. It’s where she he usually enjoys her afternoon naps after she has pestered Johnsson for cod. The tiny rascal would’ve been thrown overboard had it not been the captain himself who brought her onboard. It was either her orange fur or sharp claws that had Johnsson swooned, I would never know the answer. 

I watch as she stretches and yawns. It’s a miracle she hasn’t woken up earlier. Poor thing would end here. Her eyes open and looks around at the messy state the deck is in. Barrels of fish roll over while the rest of the crew yells and screams from horror. She doesn’t meow or run away from fear. I swear I could see her eyes sharpen as she paws her way up to the bow. Without any trouble from the constant wobbling of the deck she jumps up and stands at the edge of the ship. 

My worry for her almost overwrites my terror of the kraken but I cannot bring myself to stop her. I can only watch as she stares the beast down. The rain that usually bothers her doesn’t cause her to become a hissing mess. She looks out at the sea and I feel the ship almost calm down. 

The ringing in my ears lessen as my hands stop shaking. I close my eyes and prepare for my final moment. My mind convinces me this was the calm before the storm or maybe it’s already ended. My body swaying with the tide or buried far below the surface. 

I open my eyes to see the blue sky. Something is sitting in my lap- Madam? She starts purring and I force my nervs to calm so I can pet her. The soft fur under my hands sooth my worries. My friends are all passed out, laying around the deck. 

I continue to pet Madam. 

Only one person is standing. Captain Johnsson. His eyes land on me from where he stands by the helm. The madman dares to smile at me after all that!? My brows furrow. 

He winks at me. 

I decide that this is the reason why he gives the small creature in my lap the finest piece of all our fish.",25,1749676545.0

A human got lost in the Forest of Echoes, and I found them.

Albeit...  
The Forest of Echoes isn't friendly to outsiders.  
Let's see how this goes.

Something, something, his management of public services have been excellent, bla bla bla, he kept the sewage pipes unclogged, and improved living standards there...whatever, he wasn't fully paying attention.

Listening to public servants is not a thing that villains do. Villains like Ratman steal things. Rule over squatters and beggars living in *his* sewers with an iron fist (and claw). He clashed with superheroes occasionally. Usually, he was sent scurrying back to his labyrinthian sewers where the heroes lost track of him.

Yet now, he was out in the open, squinting at the bright sun. Waving at citizens, standing alongside other recipients of this award. Even the superheroes were clapping.

Was this a trap? To lure him out in the open, far away from the darkness of his sewers? The cheering, the applause, they seemed authentic. One kid with a pen and his hat asked for his autograph when Ratman finally got off the stage and could start feeling a little less awkward.

The pen didn't have a poison quill or hidden mechanisms.

""I want to be just like you! They say you fix smelly sewers and make it liveable!""

Ratman signed and gave a thumbs down that he switched to a thumbs up hurriedly. Kid looked happy, as did his mom.

The next person to approach was Vanstrom the superhero, with his hand outstretched. Ratman flinched on instinct, having been on the receiving end of his electric shocks. After much hesitation, he gingerly placed his hand into Vanstrom's for a handshake. A friendly handshake.

""Hey, good job, Ratman,"" the superhero patted him on the shoulder. ""We've fought in the past whenever people disappeared into the sewers, but hey, you been doing good, yea? You unclogged the sewer pipes. Took out all that trash. Keeping the city sanitary and safe beneath the roads. Our water supplies are clean because of you.""

""Thank you?"" Ratman was still bewildered by this turn of events. Yet his mind was racing. What if he could continue his petty thefts while still appearing as this good guy who maintained the sewers voluntarily like a good citizen? Could he get away with it?

Of course, he would. He must. Because Ratman is a villain, and some shiny useless award won't change that.

This part was true, I live in the sewers after all, and like most people, I maintain my home. Also when the possible side effect of not doing so means drowning in sewage you find a great deal of motivation to do so.

Here, quick context, I was homeless, PTSD from the war, and of course being a larger and intimidating looking sort didn't go well for reintegrating into society. When I got exposed to those weird chemicals I developed superpowers, and formed a psuedo-cult following among the homeless.

""While, your history is complex, we would like to point out that the level, and sheer degree, of your maintenance has not only kept it going, but has also improved its efficiency in certain places.""

He also pointed out some other charts, and continued.

""Also, the condition of the homeless has also grown to a far more acceptable degree. The number of homeless deaths has dropped significantly since you took power, and they are staying in communities they formed away from higher traffic and tourist areas.""

I gave an agitated grunt at that last but, but let him continue.

""So we would like to negotiate an agreement. The base terms are payment for your continued maintenance, we will delay planned demolition of some of the abandoned buildings you have set up ship in indefinitely, and as long as you keep your less scrupulous actions down here_""

So... when the first ambassadors came, they wanted a deal. They still would hunt me, but only on paper. The deal was, they would give me intel of the people that were in the sewers, and I would agree to not attack some specific people they asked; they even said they would forgive me, in case I made a mistake.

In exchange, I would need to fully disappear the people they would send here. Undesirables. Criminals. People they didn't like. People against the government. People they didn't want in the city. Bonus points if I could torture them.

So I did the right thing - I ate the ambassadors. Then the next ones. Then the mayor.

Next step, I am receiving gifts, letters, offerings from people, if I would just eat only one politician more... and gosh damn it, it happened.

They were cheering, sending me booze, food, the best clothes I have ever seen, because I freed them from the dictator. Then, these people were pushed, and I saw other people pushing who pushed them... it was a carnage.

I still have nightmares where they are here, screaming, bones shatered trying to kill the next one, just because they disagree on who are the _undesirables_ and who deserve to live and die.

1l8g6er,mx5m23m,"I haven't been above ground for years, but we do get a picture of what's happening there. Aside from TV (the reception is terrible , but we do get cable and streaming)  and the internet, you also get an idea based on the influx into the sewers and the stories they tell... Some are criminals, stolen goods and drugs to be stashed, some merely desperate. 

I pick my fee, take my cut, and the most disorderly of the criminals tend to disappear. Mulch helps things grow , with a bit of artificial light. And because sewers are kind of damp to live in, we fixed them, and used the tunnelling equipment to create underground spaces to live and work in. There's a fee we charge people of course ...  And some of it can be payable in work and food  and some can be via contraband and goods trafficked in from above, some via enforcement. We've been expanding. 

Still it was a surprise when the city sent down folks to treat with me. I did have a couple of cut-outs, but the story got passed upward, and this I had to hear for myself. 

Things have gotten bad up there. It's not just laws/legality (legality above ground isn't the same as that below and vice versa), it's the chaos, and disruption. Things decay and are helped along. Some of it is intentional with multiple bad actors, but you'd be amazed how much of it is simply lack of competence . The outflow of people and goods from above has become very noticeable even to the dim folks in what passed for authority , and some of the folks leaving recently haven't even been that desperate..  Many of the newcomers have found a place with me quickly, as I recognize talent. Hey, what works, works. 

The offer from the city officials, as I said, is something I had to hear for myself. A 10 year dictatorship, with immunity for me or my viceroy, a free hand to put food, infrastructure/housing/transport etc on a better founding, a sizeable fee payable in instruments of my choosing.. and that was their opening offer. I asked about dealing with the existing leadership, the ones who had allowed thing to get this bad, and they didn't blink. ""A free hand"" they repeated, ""we've heard how you run things down here"" . I heard them out and though they pushed for an answer , merely told them I needed time to think it over. ...

Once they had gone, I pulled together some of my key guys (it's true I had built a rather large and efficient organization, but it's what was needed as we grew underground), to make plans. As I told them, I wasn't thinking of taking up the city's offer exactly, but we still had to make plans. Every one of us had to think bigger. It was time for me to come back up above ground, and some of my guys with me.

Sewers, by their nature, are an unwelcoming place. Dark, dank, and full of things best left to the imagination. So why did Ratty live down there? Simple. It was a large, open area with multiple escape routes, a lot of adaptability, and a natural deterrent in the form of its appalling smell. Even the top heroes hated dealing with Ratty, each one knowing it would take days to get the smell out of their clothes. And, as silly as that sounds, that tiny bit of disgust was enough to buy him a lot of time, with the heroes drawing straws over who should be the one to enter the sewers, giving him a chance to hide any evidence.

 

Today, Ratty sat in his crummy office chair, the one that had springs poking out of its brown leather cushion. While the springs had annoyed him when he first discovered them, he now didn’t mind their metallic point, using them to scratch his lower back whenever he felt a harsh itch coming along. Torn furniture was something you just had to adapt to in the sewers, especially since the rats loved biting into anything that looked like it might have a taste to it, and if Ratty had to choose, he would much rather have them biting his furniture, than his body.

 

The flickering of his monitors made it hard for him to read his gardening magazine, having to hold the magazine a little higher than he was comfortable with, blocking the heavy shine coming from the screens as they illuminated the dark building he sat in. He licked his forefinger and switched to the next page, letting out a small ooh, when he saw a stunning patch of roses. While he didn’t have a garden, not seeing any reason to maintain one in a villain hideout, he often dreamed about it. That dream justifying his decision to keep subscribing to the monthly Sunflower Sun lover’s magazine.

 

Just as he was about to let himself indulge in a few plant based fantasies, the screen flashed orange, detecting some movement near his central manhole. He lowered the magazine an inch, since an orange detection wasn’t uncommon. Sometimes it was council workers, other times it was punk teenagers wanting to throw a firecracker down a manhole for laughs. Both things weren’t worth him getting riled up about. So, he continued reading, only stopping when the screen flashed red, telling him that someone was making their way down into the sewers.

 

“I haven’t even done anything.” He groaned, setting the magazine down. For once, he was innocent. Well, innocent if you count activities from the last two months. He had killed a supervillains henchman three months ago, but recently he hadn’t done anything. He reviewed the footage, noticing two suited up men climbing down the manhole, both with faces so disgusted that it looked as if their lips and noses were going to tunnel back in through the skulls.  

“They don’t look very super.” Ratty commented. He knew superheroes, and those men weren’t super, nor heroes. They were government figures, some form of it, at least. Most likely on the lower end of the scale if they had to climb into the sewers. You didn’t see many mayors making the journey.
 
He considered fleeing. He had equipped his small home for maneuvering through the sewers, so it wouldn’t be hard for him to avoid detection. The tiny building sitting atop a flat metallic surface, one held by two strong robotic claws. If he entered a coordinate on his computer, the claws which were connected to the sewer’s walls would pull his base through the tunnels, moving it to his desired spot. This being the easiest way for him to avoid heroes, while also keeping his feet dry.
 
But the longer he stared at the men, the less inclined he felt to flee. They weren’t heroes, so they didn’t want a fight, which piqued his curiosity. He watched his camera, making them trudge through the dirty sewers before moving his base closer to them, enjoying the looks of disbelief on their faces as they saw the floating, tiny base hovering above them. A ladder dropped from the base, while Ratty laid down a plastic sheet over the floor of his home, not wanting them to dirty anything.
 
The men exchanged looks before the younger of the two climbed the ladder first, followed shortly by the older, much stockier fellow. When they arrived inside the base, Ratty got a better look at the pair.

“No tricks. The sewer system has long been plagued with problems and we have never managed to hold it unlike you. Your rule here has led to you maintaining the sewers in a way we never could.”

I'm imagining the gnashing of teeth from some prim and proper heros standing around watching the rat man petty criminal being given an award for actually accomplishing something meaningful and helpful to the population at large. 

Frankly, I've been running with this story in my head and going nuts. Ratman is actually a very bad / low grade villain, probably not very smart in general. But surprisingly adept at water management and earthworks. 

Some parts of the city are letting him get away with small heists and robberies as areas that he frequents gets upgraded with vastly improved sewerage and water tunnels and drainage to fit his over complicated and silly escape vehicles.

""Oh SuperBatMcHero man, no need to save us from Ratman.. he's harmless really. Last month he 'broke' into the school, stole a bunch of gym equipment but when we filled in his tunnel, we found he replaced all the lead pipes with new hardware and removed ancient corroded fittings.

George was the younger of the two. A man in his mid twenties who held a confident swagger, despite having just wandered through a sewer. The youthful confidence even spreading to his haircut, which was a stylish brown bob that perched atop his skull. The older man, Adam, however, lacked any of that confidence. He was a man who had been beaten down by life, giving him deep circles beneath his eyes and a slight slouch to his appearance. While they both wore similar suits, it was easy to tell who took more care of their clothing, with George’s neatly ironed and washed, while Adam’s lacked any of that care.
 
“Hey, man. What’s up? I love how cool your place looks. Is that a nighty sky painting?” He said, with all the enthusiasm of a sleazy car salesman, trying to coax someone into buying a crappy 2003 Hyundai that would fall apart as soon as the contract was signed.
“Starry night.” Ratty corrected, gazing at the painting. He disliked people like George. People who believed they could be everybody’s friend. That positive can-do attitude that was almost insulting. It was as if they saw everyone as a sucker, that was just dying to be their pal. Ratty couldn’t have wanted anything less than to be the friend of someone with the personality of an excitable dog.

“Right, right.” George nodded. Before he could say anything else, Adam stepped in.
 
“Not a terrible place for a man who lives in the sewers. I’m Adam, and he’s George.” He said, tone formal, with no hint of warmth behind it. As if his mom had pushed him out of her body while reciting her tax returns.
 
“It isn’t bad,” Ratty agreed. If one had to describe the home, they would call it a cute home in a bad neighborhood. It had a kitchen, bedroom, tv, and even a recreation of a famous painting. The base itself was perfect, it was just the location that killed it.
 
Sensing that Ratty wouldn’t ask them why they were here, Adam continued. “We are here on behalf of the city’s waterways division.”
 
“Here to remove me?” Ratty snarled, having expected this day to come, eventually.
 
“No. George, you want to tell him why we’re here?”
 
“Yes, sir. Well, on behalf of the city’s waterways division, we are here to present you with a certificate for outstanding service to the community. It’s an honor, Mr. Volkina. I mean, Mr. Ratty? Wait, which is your birth name? Cause I said it’s Volkina, but Adam was like. It doesn’t matter, grumble, grumble-“
 
Adam and Ratty made eye contact, a brief middle aged man to man stare that silently said. Young people…. Ratty snatched the certificate before George could prattle on any longer. “Why would my mother call me Ratty? Nevermind. Yes, thank you. Is that all?”
 
“You’re not going to ask why we gave you that certificate?” Adam, a man who rarely asked questions, had expected this to be a lot harder than it was. That urging him to do the unthinkable and actually show a crumb of interest in the situation. 
 
“Not really? I kind of just want you gone. Is it a trap?” He asked, shaking the flimsily laminated paper, only for it to make a small, wibble wobble noise as it shook.
 
“A trap? No, not at all. We’re so proud of you, that’s why we had to give you the certificate. You’re doing so much for the community and everyone is super stoked to have you looking after things, so keep that close.” George smiled.
 
“So, it is a trap?” Ratty mumbled, assuming George had done the worst acting job in the history of acting.

“No. Since you’ve been down here, our city has never been cleaner. No busted pipes, no clogged systems and overall everything been running a lot smoother. That’s why the city has given you this certificate. It’s their way of thanking you for everything you’ve done. No traps, no tricks, and no tomfoolery.”
 
“You realize I’m maintaining it solely to keep my base functional. Clogged systems mess up my escape routes.”
 
“Whatever the reasoning. We still appreciate you keeping things sanitary. If you check the back of that certificate, you’ll see we even stapled a check to it.” Adam moved two of his fingers, making a flipping motion.
 
“Staple it?” George sheepishly scratched at his neck, and when Ratty flipped it over, he would find the check stuck inside the laminated certificate, with George laminating the two pieces of paper together.
 
Adam groaned, thinking about how he could solve his colleague’s mistake. “We’ll get someone to transfer the money into your account.”
 
Ratty read over the numbers on the check. $10’000, more than he had earned in the last three months. “Hey, will I get more of these if I keep maintaining things?”
 
“I can’t say for certain, since that’s above my payroll, but if I had to guess, I would say yes. Councils love saving money, and having you down here is a lot cheaper than sending our own men down to do the same work. If you leave, the cost of getting the resources to do what you’ve done would be at least six times that a month. Maybe more.”
 
“Hm. Ok, you may leave.”
 
“Right. Thanks for hosting us. What a lovely home.” George stepped forward. “Love the place, ever think about getting some plants in here? I know a guy who knows a guy, who knows a lot of flowers that don’t mind the darkness.” He stated, stepping onto the floor, leaving a dirty print as he left the plastic.
 
When Ratty grumbled, Adam hooked George’s collar beneath his fingers. “Sorry!” He said on his colleagues’ behalf. As the two left, the plastic scrunched beneath their feet, filling the room with the sound of twisted plastic until they left the home.
 
Ratty cleaned the mess before returning to his chair, squeaking when he sat on the spring. He rubbed his backside before perching himself on the edge of the chair, reading over the certificate. “Maybe I can cut back on my crime if they’re paying me? It’s a lot less work.” He mused.

Blue eyes, rosy cheeks, scuffed shoes and small toy bag at her side. There is nothing there that speaks danger or evil. Just like every other child, she simply … is, and nothing more. Her body lifts and falls with each breath. Short. Shallow, and filled with the chill dusk air. The icy puffs come from her in short spurts and fall, heavy to the grass at her feet. 

Mark’s fear is contagious and I feel it slowly building inside me. Unwanted, yet unburdened. I can’t explain the slow, dark, growth inside me. He must know something that I don’t know, see something I don’t see, hear something I don’t hear. I trust him. Trust him with my life and have for a long time. I take my eyes from the girl and turn towards mark, trying to understand and act with reason, not instinct. 

“Damn it, Jay. SHOOT!” Jay is what they call me down at the open air market. The streets. I haven’t been called that in a long time. Not many even know me by that name, know that I am a phony. Mark took me in and trained me, trained me to find those riddled with sin, possessed by devils. You can see it in their eyes, hear it in their harmonic voices, and smell it on their breath. When you find one, you don’t think, you act. You act to save yourself, but more importantly, to save others. I have killed countless demons. Ran from the law, no doubt possessed and run by devils themselves. 

“For fucks sake, SHOOT HER! If you don’t, I will. Give me that fucking gun you coward.” The girl simply stares back at Mark. She doesn’t run, doesn’t cower and stands resolute. She twists her hair with punctuated nervous energy as if waiting for her fate. Daring Mark to follow through with his threats. Her eyes appear to freeze as her feet drag her closer to us. 

I choke down the inexplainable bile from my throat as I find myself handing the gun over to to my old partner. The weight of the dangerous instrumentality drags, rebelling against my decision. Screaming loudly to reconsider my decision. 

""But sir, she's just a little girl."" I plead, though keep pressing the cold steel forward. ‘It’s not my choice,’ I tell myself. Consoled with the idea that my mentor has protected me thus far. Saved me from countless sinners and demons, but none as young as the girl before me. My bile rises again as the weight gets lifted from my hands.

It cannot be a discourse, for you to reason ‘why.’” He doesn’t even finish his sentence before the explosive sound rings out.

""Good, better than the others did."" I said.  
We talked for a while.

  
""Got to go, but I am happy I met someone from my world, here.  
Humanity is much more interesting, than the geezers, and dragons make them out to be."" she said.  
I nodded.  
""I got a place, and a job here, visit whenever you want."" I said, after exchanging phone numbers.  
She smirked.  
""You fancy a redhead, don't ya?"" she teased.  
""Yeah, so, want to have dinner sometime?"" I winked, teasing her back.  
She froze, pouted, and left huffing, and puffing.  
I laughed.  
This convention was a bit tricky, never would have I thought to meet someone who will recognize me as a shapeshifter, but it turned out good.  
I went back to roam a bit more, before heading home myself.

""You think so?"" Joe asked with practiced modesty. He'd been to enough conventions to play the part just right. It began accidentally when he visited his first convention decades ago. He was only trying to get out of the Summer heat and blend in when some kind strangers suggested he enter the costume contest. He won easily and since then he enjoyed reenacting that moment. 



He regularly visited all kinds of conventions, changed to an appropriate form, and waited near the event hall with longing glances at the stage every now and then. Fandoms of all kinds were welcoming and friendly, and he often met some kind souls willing to give him that 'final push' of encouragement. There had been fewer than a handful of times when he didn't get that friendly encouragement, and he always took it as a sign not to enter the costume contest. It was looking like this sci-fi convention would be another one of those until the last minute, when a group of friendly teenagers complimented his costume and got his scheme on track. 



""Your costume's too good not to win!"" Alice, a brunette, encouraged him with a shove toward the contestants forming a line. 



""Maybe I will,"" Joe nodded with genuine glee. He'd gotten what he wanted and confidently joined the line as his new friends cheered. One by one, the line moved ahead until finally he reached the stage assistant. The brown-haired young man with blue eyes and stern features glanced at Joe, then looked past him with a shrug because there was no one else interested in joining. 



""Yeah?"" he asked. 



""I want to join the costume contest,"" Joe nodded toward the group gathered up behind the curtain on stage. 



""Can't without a costume,"" he shook his head. 



""What? Do you see me?"" Joe asked with a chuckle. If his guard wasn't so relaxed, he might have been more aware of what just happened. But, he'd gone through the motions so many times he'd forgotten he wasn't wearing a costume at that moment. ""These wings...,"" he turned to show off the translucent insect wings growing out of his back. ""My compound eyes? You're going to tell me this isn't a costume?"" 



""Guy, we're just trying to have fun,"" the stage assistant shook his head. ""You look way too real to just be cosplaying. A shapeshifting ringer walking away with the trophy is pretty disrespectful to the people who put effort into their costumes."" 



""Shape-,"" Joe laughed. ""-shift-what are you talking about??"" 



""Dude, you're not the only fae in the world,"" he said. ""You're not even the only one in this room,"" he chuckled and nodded at the stage. ""There's another shapeshifter up there; but, they actually made a costume. Maybe you should give that a shot.""

I am mid-transformation, my human disguise half on, and my true form, that of a dragon also visible.  
He stares at me, and nods.  
""Sorry. Cool scales, bro."" he says, and then leaves.  
I remain frozen for a bit, before sighing, and putting back on my human disguise.  
I so wanted to relax, but I also don't want to lose this apartment.  
So I went to the living room, where I saw him drinking beer, and eating pizza.  
""Want some?"" he asked.  
I was confused.

  
""You aren't...surprised? Scared? Angry?"" I asked.  
He shrugged.  
""Mate, you are a weirdo that sits a lot alone in your room.  
Thought you are a gooner, or some hacker or some shit...  
This is better."" he said.  
I was shocked.  
""Excuse me, but I do work a lot, and my alone time is justified!"" I said.  
""Whatever you say bro.  
You pay your part, you help with groceries, and clean the kitchen and bathroom after you use it.  
Dream roommate, bro."" he said, giving me a slice of pizza.  
I took it.

  
After a few more beers, I get into the topic again.  
""So? Not angry that I lied?"" I asked.  
He shrugged again.  
""As I said, you ain't bad, and you pull your weight man, that's all I wanted from a roommate.  
And if you are a dragon, an alien, a serial killer...  
Bro, as long as you don't kill me, and don't touch my games, and comics, we good."" he said.  
I stared at him, and started laughing.  
""What?"" he asked.  
I couldn't stop.

  
""Rude."" he muttered.  
""Man, you said I am the weirdo, but look at you."" I said.  
""No. I said you are a weirdo.  
Didn't say I am not one myself."" he corrected me.  
I nodded.  
""True.  
So, want to order a few more pizzas, and maybe have a marathon of Star Wars?   
I have off tomorrow."" I said.  
""Sure, I have a night shift tomorrow, so we can chill till then."" he said.  
I ordered some pizzas, and beer as well.

1l8kiv9,mx64krb,"I never expected Benny to burst out laughing.

""I knew it!"" He clapped his hands and pointed at me. ""Dude I fucking knew it!""

The mask was only halfway on my head, the eye sockets sitting dead and lifeless above it. I sighed and pulled it the rest of the way off, letting my horns pop out. ""What gave it away?""

His grin grew wider. He counted on his fingers. ""You suck at telling girls and boys apart. You kind of smell like raw meat all the time. And when we went to the movies last week the car straight up buckled under you, bro."" He craned his head around, ""And your tail is hanging out.""

Out of habit, I tried to shove it back in my pants, instead knocking a bunch of beer bottles off the dresser. I gave up in a huff and leveled my gaze at him. ""So now what?""

Clearly he hadn't thought that far ahead. ""Well, uh... why are you in college?""

""Promise you won't laugh.""

He locked his jaw and waited.

I sighed and steeled myself. ""GDU has one of the best marching bands in the country.""

I'll give him credit - he tried. He really tried. At least he had the decency to step away to use the bathroom so I wouldn't have to see it. When he returned his face was wet - he must have splashed some water on it to make sure he wasn't dreaming. I was already packing my things when he stopped me.  ""Whoah, hold up. You're not going anywhere.""

I looked at him and my heart caught in my throat. Had I finally met someone who could accept me for who I really was? I was so sick of my disguise, the way my shaggy pelt got swamped after too many hours in my human suit. The way my horns kept working their way out of the mask, and how many bathroom breaks I had to take to fix it. And, most of all, the dumb human face I picked. I regretted it from day one.

He bit his lip and rubbed his hands together. The longer it went on, the more nervous I became. Finally, he broke into a grin. ""Bro, we're getting you on OnlyFans, to-fucking-day.""

It hit me like a slap. ""OnlyFans?""

""Yeah, bro."" He was laughing now, his smile growing wider. ""Monster fuckers are SO in right now.""",30,1749633186.0
1l8rn66,mx75p2a,"""Does this mean...we are in-laws?"" the wizard asked me.  
I was confused.  
""Your brother is the Evil Wizard?"" I asked, and the others also looked at the wizard.  
He shrugged.  
""It seems so, but last time I met with my brother, he was lost in a research about how to revive an ancient species of Titanic Apes...  
OH."" he said.  
The Evil Wizard and his beast army...  
Was it just this?

  
""Brother!"" my sister said, hugging me.  
""Lilia! How are you? Are you okay? And you are getting married? And I just find out now?!"" I asked.  
She giggled.  
""You are a busy man, Mr. Hero, so I didn't tell you until it was too late about, Jeff."" she started.  
Jeff? The Evil Wizard's name is Jeff?  
""And I am extremely happy. Jeff shares the same passion as me for animals! He built me a personal zoo!"" she chirped.  
I sighed.

  
Before I could say something, the Evil Wizard came towards us.  
""S-Sir Hero."" he stuttered, not even daring to look me in the eyes.  
""Brother!"" our wizard said, tackling Jeff.  
""Heey! I told you not to...not to do this!"" Jeff said, trying to stand up.  
""Lilia, how does he treat you?"" I asked.  
She rolled her eyes.  
""Don't you start being overprotective brother. He loves me. He would die for me."" she said.  
""I...I would!"" Jeff said, standing up finally, and holding Lilia's hand.  
I sighed.

  
""Do you know he has the renown of an Evil Wizard? And we were just tasked to eliminate him?"" I asked.  
Jeff paled, while Lilia stood in front of him.  
""Lies! He just frees animals from nobles keeping them in too small cages! Sure, some nobles do die, but that's because they try to kill us first!"" she said.  
""Us?  You join him in his activities?! Lilia for Goddess' sake!  
Sure, those nobles are pests, and human trash, but you could go the legal way, talking with the Church of Beasts, and petition for their release!"" I said.  
The two stared at me, as if they heard about this for the very first time.  
I sighed, then froze.  
With this hint of mine...did I just stop Jeff from committing crimes?  
""Let's enjoy the wedding."" I said, and Lilia laughed, and kiss me on the cheek.  
""I knew you would understand, big brother! You are the best!"" she said, running away with Jeff in-tow.

He flinched, grip weakening on his sword. It didnt sit right in his hands. There was no confidence there. No calmness that came with wielding a weapon that could kill.
His armour was far...less polished than most knights I knew. 
He swallowed hard, fear almost dripping off him. ""Im knight enough"" he blustered, eyes still searching the darkness for me. My entrance hall was large, just for this purpose after all. Kept clean up easy, allowed for a decent run up to launch myself in the air. 

""Knight enough? To come here. To fight me. Why?""

He whipped around, chasing the sound of my voice. A parlour trick. I wasnt trying to frighten him. Only to keep his eyes from adjusting enough to see me. Once he did, his fear would rule him and he would fight or flee. I wanted to understand.

""You're a monster!"" He shouted. I scoffed, monster? No. Though i did not deny some were. I had my halls, my libraries, magic to take me anywhere i wished to go. And all I had claimed was this mountain. All I had done was ensure that the forest spirits and the fey folk below could live without fear from the mortals. And yet the rumours circulated. 

""A monster?"" I hummed. Shifting my weight idly. Hearing the tremble of his armour. ""Tell me then. What monstrous deeds have I performed? You must know them to fight your fear to be here""

""You slaughtered knights!"" He tried

""Only those who would not leave my lair peacefully. Was i to let them murder those who dwell here under my protection?""

He faltered. Two handed grip on the sword shaking. 
""You kidnapped the princess!!""

Ah yes, the girl id found in the woods. She had mentioned being a princess hadnt she? 

""I did not such thing. She is and always has been free to leave. I think shes currently making her way through the left wing of my library. Voracious reader that one.""

""Shes alive?"" There. There was the hope. A crack in his voice. 
""Of course she is. I found her. Nearly dead in the forest. Once tended too she asked if she could stay for fear of her life within the capital. I saw no issue with another welp under my wing. So I agreed."" I rumbled a pause ""is that why your king sends men here?""

""You didnt know?"" The point of his sword lowered. 

""Few were willing to talk to me. Called me a deciever, a vile beast. Threatened to destroy my home. I dealt with them accordingly.""

""The king...he think you have his daughter imprisoned. He's offered a ransom to anyone willing to rescue her. A...life changing amount of money. My sister is sick. And it could save her life""

""She is not imprisoned here. Though I doubt he will accept that. She has requested not to return to the capital so I will not make her."" I glanced over him. Bravery should be rewarded. ""Bring your sister here. My magic should be enough for whatever ails her.""
The sword clattered to the ground as tears began to fall, carving through grime and dirt. 
""Thank you.""
I let out a plume of smoke, ""bravery and cleverness should be rewarded. Don't speak of this to any other""

""Of course!"" He rushed. ""Ill be back by tonight!""

I watched him run and knew, with that strange little burn of draconic foresight, that tonight i would welcome yet more strays to my home.

Of course I know what they want. They came for gold or one of the girls or both. Mostly both. This looks like a youngest son of a farmer, a bard, someone who never held a sword in their life.

Let me take it from him.

""Horrible creature I came to free Princess Lanolin from your dungeo... WHAT GIVE IT BACK!""

""No, you may cut yourself. This is a long sword, you should not hold it like a shovel.""

He pulls out a dagger. It's more like his size, at least he can hold it with the point up.

""I will kill you with my bare hands if it's necessary! The truth is on my side, worm!""

Sigh. I'm not a wyrm. I have hands and stuff. 

""You ignorant little man, you should have sharpened your dagger before coming to me. And maybe get one from a better steel? This looks like lost its edge during your trip here.""

""Don't play games with me, disgusting creature! Give back the Princess!""

Disgusting. Me. He's the one who did not wasted time to clean up, despite we having that nice clean brook next to the cave entrance... any wound of him would be infected and he would die quite fast after a battle. God save me from amateurs.

""Oh you are so scary little man! But you have to be more precise with your demands. If you go to the tunnel to the left you can find the princesses and others, choose your Lanolin!""

He's a bit confused. I think my sarcasm is lost here, but he feels that something is not how he imagined it. 

He runs to the tunnel, without checking for any traps. Duuuumb.

But I play a fair game, there are no traps, just the girls, prepared. Some shouting and clanging.

And here the mighty knight is! One eyebrow is bleeding from a hit, and he lost his helmet. Some of the girls are pretty good with throwing stones. He runs out of the cave without slowing down.

I decided to be the good guy and don't ask him if he wants his sword back. It's obviously not his sword anyway.

I put it with the other swords. By now I have quite a collection of these. 

I'll go check on the girls. Apparently all is well, by the time I get there they're back to their daily routine. I'll ask because the name ""Lanolin"" sounds so nice. It turns out that its the regal name of Wendy. I'll use that for a week or so just to annoy her. Haha :)

""Yeah, it's new."" I chuckle with my hand behind my head, acting embarrassed. ""We are still in the DTR stage of our relationship""

""Oh, well all the best to the two of you. This is the happiest I've seen you in a while"" Todd responded holding up the mug as if in a toast.

I awkwardly salute back with two fingers. ""Yeah, I really like her man""

Todd lets out an exhale. ""Well back to the grind for me. I'll see you later.""

I also let out an exhale as I see him turn to leave. ""Yeah, I'll see you later.""

I don't know why I lied. Maybe it was easier than admitting that Jocelyn wasn't real. That i didn't spend an afternoon writing myself love notes from the hypothetical love of my life. God, it sounds kind of pathetic thinking it out loud.

I tried the apps. Had a few dates. A few good dates even. But nothing clicks. I've cruised through the bars, but all I found was half-drunken regrets. My friends sent me on blind dates. But those ended in broken bridges lit with passion-less flames.

Because nothing stands up to the girl in my head. The one who always knows what to say to make me feel better. Who shares all my interests. Who cries when I cry and laughs when I laugh. The real somehow feels so insubstantial next to little Ms. Perfect in my head.

I wake up next to Rachel, as I do every morning, but today something is amiss but I can't put my finger on it. I continue with my morning rituals, kiss Rachel on the forehead, go pee, wash face, brush teeth, get dressed, and run out the door: somehow I never wake up on time although I have always asked Rachel to wake me up by 7 and today was no different.

I make it to work just in time to be unfortunately approached by James, my supervisor. He sees me and makes a beeline for me before slyly reminding me of what I was dreading, ""You know we are having a company dinner to celebrate the recent earnings of this department on Friday, I would love for you to bring Rachel, its a shame none of us have ever got to meet her, you'd almost think she was *fake.*"" these words sent a chill down my spine, I contemplated, then calmly responded by reminding him that ""You know Rachel doesn't do well in social situations, but I will see what I can do, see you Friday."" James gave me a frustrated look before walking off, accepting my answer. Yes, it was true that Rachel, my girlfriend of 2 years had never met any of my friends or family before, and yes, it is because she is scared in social situations. While I grew up with the perfect white picket family Rachel grew up experiencing intense abuse and neglect which has caused major fears of leaving her home. Truthfully, I had brought her on numerous occasions, but she always ended up in the bathroom or car begging me to take her home, this time I was determined to get her seen so I seem *less* crazy.

After a grueling 9 hours of work behind my desktop, I made my way home via subway. When I reached home, I was greeted with the intense but welcoming aroma of lasagna, Rachels signature dish. I made my way into our dining room where I found Rachel waiting for me eagerly. She looked up from her book and said cheerfully, ""Finally! You're home, me and Mr. Whiskers missed you so much so we decided to make your favorite dish!"" I often came home to sweet gestures such as these, but somehow each night I went to bed hungry, the food either spoiled or was not filling whatsoever, but I loved it anyway, because it was Rachels. I sat down and ate my meal, tentatively planning when I should bring up the dinner, I knew she would say yes because she wanted to make me happy, but I didn't want her to be stressing about it too much. During our daily catchup, I casually said, ""Don't forget the company dinner on Friday I put it on your calendar, and don't worry, I have your accommodations set up and ready."" Rachel looked at me shocked before going quiet, she was quiet a lot, but I understood that meant she was processing, I would give her space.",7,1749624536.0
1l8efa1,mx5q6pq,"Thursday and Friday go by like any other day, wake up, go to work, come home. When Friday turned from daylight to dusk, me and Rachel made our way from our apartment to my old Honda that I had received brand new as a gift for my 16th birthday. The drive was quiet, much like many I had experienced in the past, but the air now felt tense in a way that it hadn't before, maybe it was because she knew she couldn't avoid it tonight. As much as I love and respect her, I want to be able to share her with the world and show her off, not sit and hide her away in our apartment with our shared cat. Tonight is the night.

We walk into the venue all dressed up and I hold Rachels hand, for comfort, and to make sure she didn't find a way to slip away from me again. I make my way towards James before interrupting his conversation with another employee. ""Hey James, I know how bad you've been wanting to meet Rachel, and I finally convinced her to leave the house."" James looked at me shocked before dropping his glass of white wine, allowing it to fall on the floor, shattering everywhere. He grabbed me by the arm and quickly led me outside leaving Rachel to pick up the mess. I had never seen James look so scared before, his face was drained of all color, and he was acting as if he had just seen a ghost. 

""Have you lost your fucking mind?!"" James hissed at me in a low tone, I could tell he was genuinely asking and not just attempting to start conflict. ""What do you mean? Is there something wrong with Rachel? Did you have a past with her or something?"" James's face contorted into something I can only describe as disgust before whispering again, in a calmer tone, ""No? I still haven't met Rachel, there was no one next to you, no one holding onto your hand, you looked like a lunatic holding onto the air, are you playing some sick joke on me for always trying to get her out of the house?"" Just then, Rachel walked outside the venue to meet me. ""Speak of the devil, thank god you're here Rachel, why don't you introduce yourself to James, there seems to be some confusion."" Before she could answer James introjected, ""WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING TO!"" Now not only did he grab me, but he pushed me into his car before dialing what I can only assume was 911. He instructed me to stay quiet, so I sat quietly and worried about Rachel being at the dinner all on her own with no way to get home, I had the subway passes in my wallet, I was such an idiot for not giving her hers after they were scanned.

I found myself walking into a psychiatric unit while James was frantically talking to one of the workers explaining what was going on, what that was, I still wasn't sure. I was then escorted into a room where I was questioned for a bit before Rachel knocked on the door and made her way in sitting next to me. ""I don't understand how you guys can say she's fake when she just came in and sat next to me?!"" I protested. The woman questioning had a similar look on her face to James she looked around the room before calmly explaining, ""Sir, no one has walked in or out of this room since we started, if you look to your right you'll see a camera which has recorded this whole interaction. Is there anything from your childhood or past that may have left you with trauma or gaps in your memory?"" I stared blankly. This could not be happening, I had a normal life, a normal childhood, an amazing girlfriend, and a good job, how could this be happening to me? Her questions no longer seemed genuine, I found myself getting angry before leaping across the table pushing her to the ground screaming in her face that **Rachel is real** and that I wouldn't sit here for this stupid questioning. I heard commotion behind me but chose to ignore it, I was focused on something more important now. I soon felt a sharp pain in my neck and fell to my side, only seeing black.

""I don't understand how this could happen to our son, we've given him everything in life, he's never had any mental health issues or social issues."" My mother explained to the nurse who nodded and jotted something down in her notes, I lay in a white bed, connected to tubes and monitors. As I woke up, I felt different, I was kept in an inpatient program for 30 days, I reluctantly stayed and waited for the moment I could see my sweet Rachel again. I was given a plethora of medications, which I was required to take daily and ""under no circumstances end use"" so I listened so I could go on with my life as usual. 

I left the hospital and returned to me and Rachels apartment where I found... nothing... no one. Every bit of evidence of her existence, even her sent, was erased from our home, leaving nothing, no note, no email, it was just me and Mr. Whiskers. Rachel never came home after that.",6,1749624575.0
1l89if6,mx3h4dw,"I have been a poet, a scholar, a warrior, a priest and a thief. I have been courageous, a scoundrel, and a leader. I have been the greatest mage of my generation many a time, a prodigy often, and on a rare occasion, a mantis-lady - any of the possible forks of reality which spawn sentient life on Earth seem to be within my ability to travel to.

Each and every time, I use magic to achieve my goals.

What I have never been, until now, is bored.

This world has no magic. None. They speak of it in stories, write about it in books, but do any of them know any magic beyond what can be achieved with slight of hand? No. This is a strange world, utterly unique and cripplingly dull. To travel anywhere requires physical effort and far too much time. There are no space colonies - because no-one has successfully figured out a way to get to distant places without magic. So humanity (in this timeline, decidedly not mantis-people) is confined to just one world.

I miss the colony on Charon. Visiting it is usually the highlight of my visit to any reality.

Only one time have I seen anything like it - a reality where the system of magic functioned fundamentally differently to those I was used to. But within two decades, I had figured it out. That will not be the case here, for as best I can tell this reality is entirely divorced from magic. Not one drop exists here.

My boredom follows me through school and to university. I study history, hoping that I might find some fragment of lore which leads me to the truth of why this might be.

My boredom follows me as I have absolutely no luck in my studies. I alienate my peers through my stubborness - my insistence that there must be something there, waiting to be found.

My boredom follows me to party after party, as I turn to drink to dull the pain of a world without magic.

I begin to realise that it was not all just boredom. Depression, they call it. Not uncommon in a world without easy access to wonders, apparently.

Something has to give.

I talk with an acquaintance from university on the street. He asks how I'm doing, and I tell him the truth - that I am barely holding myself together. The pleasant veneer plastered on his face cracks, and he confesses that he feels the same. He talks of a support group, where we can talk about such things. I go, because despite everything, I am still bored.

I talk to other people and realise that I am not the only one feeling the lack of magic in my life. Kelly lost her husband to addiction. Alex didn't know what to do with themself after losing their job. Richard can't figure out what to do with himself, because his daughter is sick and there is nothing he can do to help.

We talk.

We talk outside the meeting space too. I invite Tasha to go bowling, because she said she'd always wanted to go but didn't have the money growing up. I find that there is a lot in common between slinging fireballs and throwing a bowling ball, though my technique earns me a few odd looks.

We talk on a hike, three of us together, and as we camp under the stars I point out where Pluto and Charon are. I tell the group that if I could visit anywhere in my lifetime, it would be Charon.

I hug Tasha, who has bought me a telescope for my birthday so I can be a little bit closer to my dream. It's not the best image, but on a clear night I can clearly pick it out in the night sky.

I quit my job at the university. Reminding myself of what I have lost is making me unhappy. My friends take me out bowling to celebrate. Tasha suggests pursuing astronomy, but I shake my head - it would be much the same.

Instead, I start painting - a minor skill of mine. It's amazing how many worlds require their youngsters to take art classes, so I've gotten a fair amount of practice over the years. My artwork depicts the mundane - magicless birds, buildings made of nothing but rock. A flag on the moon - put there without magic.

Apparently, I'm pretty good at painting. I don't find any particular fame, but I do find plenty of work. As I apply the varnish to finish my latest work, I realise that for the first time in my life, I don't feel bored.

I haven't been to the support group in months, but I still hang out with my friends. It's New Years Eve, and Alex introduces me to their friend Fran. We begin dating.

It's the middle of a bleak and dreary February evening, and it is pouring with rain outside. Fran is visiting her parents, and alone in the house with our dog, Pepper, I realise that I haven't thought about magic in weeks. I've been too busy, between work and my social life. Alex is planning their wedding and I offered to help. There's a lunar eclipse coming up, which I promised to see with Tasha, and Richard's family is visiting next weekend. My calendar is perhaps a little *too* full these days, but I'm happy.

And at that moment, I realise that there is magic here, after all.",115,1749592887.0
1l8e7e0,mx54fy8,"WIBTAH if I sent my friend's trad wife back where she comes from? 

The title sounds bad but please hear me out. I (29M) am friends with Shawn (30M). Fake name, obviously. Shawn is the friend who constantly makes an ass of himself. He's obnoxious. He's sexist. He says everything like it's a joke so you never know what to take seriously. But, what can I do? We grew up in the same neighborhood, and despite his short-comings, he saved my life more than once. He's not just a friend at this point. He's family. 

Lately, he's been going on and on about how much he wants a trad wife. I've been telling him that if a woman wants to be a tradwife, sure, but you shouldn't force one to be. Besides, you don't make enough money to support that lifestyle. He brushed me off as some sort of white knight, and asked if I could take a joke??? I said I could if the joke was funny. He just laughed at me. 

Well, the other day, he came to my apartment and said he solved the problems I was talking about. I *thought* he meant that he was going to drop the tradwife thing, but no. He took me to his basement where apparently he built a secret lab??? And then showed me that he had a time machine down there. He went into the machine and came out with a fair skin maiden in a coarse woolen kirtle stained with dust. The conversation went like this:

Me: What have you done?!

Shawn: I got myself a trad wife.

Me: When you said you wanted a trad wife, I never expected you to travel in time to get one!

Her: -salutes me- God yeve thee good morrow, fair sir.

Me: See? What does that even mean???

Shawn: I gotta understand her?

Me: How will you hold a conversation if you can't?!

Shawn: I don't need her to talk. 

I heard enough and stormed out of his basement and came home to type all of this up. I'm not crazy, right? Like this was a really insane thing to do? She probably has some sort of family back in her time or something. Who knows what we've screwed up? And I know he won't treat her well. 

Then again, she has more rights in this time. More say in how she lives her life. More freedom. Maybe she'd like it here if she stayed. But I really don't think we should pull people through time in general. 

So reddit, WIBTAH if I brought her back in time, where she came from, and then destroyed my friend's time machine? I'm still baffled. Why build a time machine if you're just gonna do that? This was his whole life's work! Please help!",39,1749613781.0
1l8e7e0,mx4h1n5,"I frowned at my roommate, Tom. He was leaning against our apartment door, having just closed it behind us. ""I don't remember saying I wanted a 'trad wife.' That's not something I would ever say."" I turned my attention to my maiden. ""Don't forget our practice."" I pulled in my jaw and pointed up at the roof of my mouth.

""Oh, yes,"" Odelyn said, her tongue stiff. We had been practicing modern English for a few weeks while I visited her in her native time, but she often reverted to older pronunciations and vocabulary. She turned her head toward me and looked over her shoulder at the inside of our apartment. It was the first modern room she'd entered. I felt her take my hand in hers, holding on as though the television was about to try sucking her into its black void.

Tom's face recoiled and scrunched up around his wide eyes. His mouth opened to speak, but he was confounded. ""Fine, whatever,"" he said, staring at Odelyn, who squeezed my hand tighter, sweat pooling in our palms. She was looking apprehensively at Tom.

I huffed a little. ""I have always said my taste in women was too old fashioned for the current available dating pool,"" I admitted, rolling my eyes. ""Women of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were hard working, modest, committed, and..."" I glanced down at Odelyn, who was at least a foot shorter than me, ""sweeter."" I smiled.

She looked up at me with a wary but affectionate face and leaned against me. I could feel her shaking. Her long brown hair was gathered up under a cloth head-covering and she hadn't had a modern bath to expunge the earthy, greasy smells that seeped through the layers of fabric she wore. I didn't mind. I smiled, released her hand, and put my arm around her, pulling her closer for comfort.

""I think she's scared,"" Tom said. ""How long has she..."" he stopped. ""How?"" He gawked at me, holding his breath. ""How is she here?""

I shrugged. ""I'm not really sure. It started a few months ago when I found this rift or portal or something."" Smiling, I recalled the horror of initially finding myself thrust seven hundred years into the past, and my heart was warmed as I recalled the way Odelyn had found me and protected me from my own stupidity. ""I went through, found this beautiful, kind, brave woman, and fell in love. I spent a month with her, began to worry that the portal might close, and came home.""

""You said you were gone on an 'emergency' work trip."" Tom scowled.

""Would you have believed me if I told you I went back in time to the fourteenth century?""

Tom sighed and shook his head.

""Anyway, after just a couple days I couldn't get Odelyn out of my mind. So I went back for her."" It was, of course, more complicated than that, but I didn't feel like recounting the whole story yet.

Tom looked down and to the side, furrowing his brow, calculating. His mouth opened, then he pursed his lips and his eyes began wandering. Eventually he took a deep breath and shrugged. ""So now what?""

I smiled. ""She'll stay with us for a while until I can sort out some kind of fake identity for her. She'll need papers and everything before we can get married.""

Odelyn gave me a warm smile. We had talked extensively about marriage and life in the modern world. Ultimately her curiosity and love for me had won out. My heart melted as it had hundreds of times in her presence.

""Married?"" Tom exclaimed. ""Look, as far as I can tell, nothing has imploded..."" He froze and raised his eyebrows. ""Wait a minute, let me check."" He pulled out his phone, flipped over to his news feed, and scrolled for a moment. ""Yup, the world is still falling apart but in all the same ways it was before."" He sighed.

""What does he mean, falling apart?"" Odelyn asked with concern on her forehead.

I smiled. ""It's just a saying, but like I told you, the world is a lot more complicated now than it was in your time. I'll show you soon. First you need a bath and some new clothes.""

Tom shook his head. ""You're treating this like it's no big deal. You're messing around with powers you don't understand. You could have altered the entire course of history.""

I shrugged. ""Maybe we will still, who knows? I don't care. As long as Odelyn and I are together it will all be fine.""

""What if it's not fine?"" Tom exploded. He marched past us into the living room.

Odelyn and I turned around. Immediately she began taking in the room in more detail. I smiled, watching her eyes dart around full of wonder and hints of terror.

""I'll show you everything,"" I whispered to her.

She smiled and wrapped herself around my arm, leaning her head against me.

""For all we know she could have some important role that she hasn't fulfilled back in her time and we might not yet have experienced the effects of her absence due to some kind of...""

""Hey,"" I said to Odelyn, ignoring Tom's tirade. ""Let's get you cleaned up. I got you some clothes to change into already, then I'll show you around the apartment. First, you're going to love the bath."" We exchanged loving smiles and I walked with her to the bathroom.

""Are you even listening to me?"" Tom called after us.

I closed the bathroom door behind us and Odelyn giggled. ""He worries much,"" she said.

""Yeah, don't let him upset you. Here, watch this."" I reached down and turned on the hot water to fill the tub.

Odelyn gasped before squealing with delight.",21,1749605009.0
1l8mrun,mx87ah5,"Mr. Stevens was ready for the press conference. The research team refused to show, legal had advised against it, and I wasn't even sure that I should be outside of the lab.

I now had the strength of 100 men. It was a long, rigorous process. The last 6 months had consisted of more tests, probes, and needles than I could count. They finally came up with a prototype serum. I was supposed to get a call back in a few months, once animal trials had concluded, but Mr. Stevens had other plans 

Mr. Stevens had been with the company for 2 decades, but he worked in the same position for 1 decade. This serum was his pet project, his chance to move up to an executive role. He had governments, PMCs, and even Warlords and Mafiosos on the line ready to pay billions for the serum. 

It appeared that these entities were growing impatient. I'm not surprised; what was supposed to be a 2 week trial had lasted 6 months. I didn't mind. I had no friends, no job, no plans, nor anything better to do. (Plus the trials paid my rent. It was the least burdensome of the odd-jobs I had taken to make ends meet. If the job were permanent, I'd consider upgrading my living arrangement from 8 roommates to 6.)

So I got called in much sooner than I expected. The call came from Mr. Stevens himself. I arrive in the lab to see Mr. Stevens standing there alone holding a vial with a luminous green liquid reflecting off of his glistening skin. 

""Thank you for coming in on such short notice"" he said to me. He smiled at me through obvious nerves, but his beady eyes looked quite relieved to see me. 

""I'm in a bind. I underestimated our timeline to a few shady characters, and I may have used up the last of their patience"". He took the pocket square out of his stretched out suit and wiped his brow below his widow's peak. 

His suit actually fit a little bit better than before, it seemed like he hadn't been eating much. 

""The animal trials have only just begun,"" he continued ""but take the serum now. PLEASE."" He held the serum up. The glow reflected off of his grey hair turning it to a muted green. The serum fizzed, smoke emitted from the vial, everything about the serum's appearance told me that this was not something that should be ingested.

""We've tried it on a few rats so far, none of them had died yet."" 

They could have only studied the rats for a week at the most, so this wasn't the most reassuring.

""And there's a hundred million dollars in it for you!"" He bursted out. ""Straight from my own pocket!"" He must have read the hesitancy on my face, but he immediately quelled it. I took the vial and swallowed the serum in one big gulp. I fell to the floor as a scientist runs in. 

Dr. Finley, the man responsible for most of the poking and probing. 

""Stevens, what have you done!?!"" I hear before losing consciousness.

I wake the next day in the room where most of my tests were done. Dr. Finley is by my side. ""Mr. Kyle, it's time for your final tests"" he says. 

I look down at myself, no muscle mass gained. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I don't feel any different. Dr. Finley pointed to a depowered mech suit sitting in the room, a prototype from one of the company's previous endeavors. The suit was 3 times my size and had to weigh at least 3 tons.

""Push that suit toward that outside wall for me"" he asked. A ridiculous request.

""Sure Doc, I'll give it a try"" I responded. 

I walked over to the suit and give it a light tap and the thing bursts through the outside wall. It shatters into pieces on impact, with the hole in the wall revealing a crowd of onlookers, separated by a stage where Mr. Stevens stood proudly. The crowd breaks into thunderous applause.

Dr. Finley looks in my eyes with piercing sincerity. ""You will never be able to touch another human without shattering every bone you touch,"" he begins. ""The shock from the pain would likely send any person into cardiac arrest."" He continued, ""You're not particularly tough, but you are unfathomably strong. Even if another were to take the serum, you would not be able to touch them without causing great harm.""

""Our lab rats killed each other within minutes, the last one killed itself when it realized there was no escaping its loneliness.""

""Step through that hole in the wall, Mr. Stevens had set up a press conference for when you wake up. I hope the money was worth it.""",5,1749660328.0

1l82xac,mx490l5,"I had long ago become an obscure deity, mentioned only in molding manuscripts and as a nonsense name at the end of prayers. Working with mortals was tiring and I had long grown weary of the constant chaos that they brought. The rising of armies and the falling of civilizations were entertaining for many eons, but I lost the drive to rule, to ""shepherd my flock"" so to speak. Around 20 or so of the mortals' years ago, a young wretch at the feet of one of my few remaining, crumbling shrines. The mortal, despite being an orphaned child, was surprisingly able to read my name on the faded engraving in the stone. It reached out in prayer to me, to save it from immediate threat, something about its village being destroyed by some religious fanatics. The child's plight bored me but the idea of letting it die bored me even more. So, in a particularly motivated moment, I answered the child's prayer and teleported it to a far away location away from the immediate threat. Though it seemed my landing spot for the child was slightly miss placed. They ended up on a desolate rock in the northern sea, I was simply satisfied that they were on land and not drowning. The child cursed and threw a fit, cursing my name. Even though they were cursing me, hearing my name uttered in the world of mortals once again after so long actually excited me quite a lot. In my good mood, I decided I would take care of the child until I was bored once again. 

That leads us to now, having followed my single believer for quite a large portion of its life. I felt I had done a wonderful job taking good care of my charge, making sure they always ate and would not be harmed by the world around them. I had always noticed that every time I intervened in the mortal's life, it would curse me with many foul words. I had spent many eons not paying any attention to mortal societies or culture, so in my grand wisdom, I hypothesized that human culture must have begun to use such curses as words of praise and endearment, after all, it made no sense for the mortal to curse me when I have only ever helped them. Surely not, after all, if they had truly despised me, they would voluntarily renounce their belief in me...

  
 ...But here they were, telling those who had stood alongside them in the fight against the zealots who had long ago destroyed their home, that I was ""unhelpful"" ,""an embarrassment"", I... I think I even heard them call me a ""good for nothing"". 

I will admit... I became a bit incensed by their blatant rudeness. It is embarrassing to say that I may have began shouting through the divine firmament at them. They seemed quite taken aback, as did their comrades. However, as my shouting ended, they surprisingly began their own furious tirade. Going on and on about how awful my blessings were, about how while they had never starved, they were consistently forced to eat garbage. Or about how even though I had kept them safe from physical harm, they were constantly getting into fights or being robbed. 

I could not understand why they held these grudges, calling out directly to their mind this time, I asked ""Why are you so angry, you dedicated yourself to me, I cannot understand why you seem so irritated with my blessings?""

They angrily responded back ""All of your blessings have made me so unlucky that I cannot stand it!""

I questioningly returned with "" Well of course they did, I am the god of slight misfortune after all. Did you not read the shrine where you had asked me for salvation all those years ago?"" 

Looking aghast they screamed out loud "" THE ONLY LEGIBLE WAS YOUR NAME YOU DAMNED GOD!""

I see... I guess those curses make sense then.",22,1749602204.0

It was quite the famous quote. Stapled on textbooks, loved by historians for its relevance and accuracy, and adored by the public for its bluntness.

However, all acknowledged that it carried its dark implications. It was right there, after all.  
The 1st Yolvak War was called ""the idiot's war"" for various reasons. One of many was that United Hosni, the country from which Camman hailed, butchered its logistics, failed to standardize a rifle and round, and had no advantage other than 50 million bodies. Thousands died to inadequacy without even seeing the enemy.

Compared to the Kingdoms of Faiiraen, with their magic, long-standing transportation systems, and organization, it was a miracle that Hosni managed to win.

On the other, much less mentioned hand, Hosni's use of artillery- rocket and traditional- were revolutionary, and later wars would see them become a proper military superpower.

We sent in another ball of rock and ice, dusted our hands, patted ourselves on the back, and moved on.           
              
Let's just say early eradication efforts weren't that thorough. I came back to check, just bored out of my mind one night, and wouldn't you know it, *something* had survived.

I forgot all about it for about sixty five million years. Our society stagnated to unreal levels. It's bad out there. Real bad. I'm still here, doing my job, eliminating nascent lifeforms.      
        
...and every now and again, I take a peek at this planet OmJTY-87, the planet its latest dominant species called ""Ur"". The Urmans had gotten pretty clever. Fire, radio, and now some real early space travel, even. I enjoy listening to them. It's like watching a kid growing up and discovering things that you take for granted.

1l8h1d5,mx4w1tb,"##Mark and Angela

Mark had a crush on the girl on the next door, Angela. This was common knowledge since grade school. He always tried to sit next to her in class or get paired off with her. Recess was spent on the swings where he had a perfect view of her. His failure to act resulted in mockery so he toned it down, but his crush remained.

Angela for her part grew to reciprocate those feelings. Mark was sweet to her, and he was quite witty. Unfortunately, he never acted on his impulses so she took matters into her own hands. Right before the first day of middle school, she called to ask him out. He said no quickly and hung up the phone. She assumed he moved on.

The day he said no was the worst day of his life. Fear overwhelmed him, and he didn't know what to say. He spent all of sixth grade trying to avoid Angela. He crushed her heart, and she was broken about it. In seventh grade, they spoke again. In eighth grade, they became friends again in time for her to date Luke.

If Mark moved on, Angela needed to do that too. He didn't even say hello to her during sixth grade. They only spoke when they were lab partners in seventh grade. They sat next to each other in English and were cordial with each other. By that time, she met Luke who won her over. He was smart, sensitive, and wrote delightful poetry.

Early years of high school were all about Mark's studies. He had to be valedictorian because both of his brothers were. He didn't want to be the dumb one. Everything was going well. He barely saw Angela outside of Honors English. She heard she was doing well and was dominating the volleyball and cross country teams. He never went to a game. Too busy studying and with swimming.

Thank god Angela took Honors English. She actually read real poetry and realized how derivative Luke's work was so she dumped him. It was fun dating for a bit, but she had work to do. Her grades were decent, but they could be better. Besides, she was a star volleyball player and runner. That left no time for romance.

When Mark got his driver's license, he was expected to get a job. One opened up at pizza place down the street as a waiter. It paid okay, and he worked next to Angela. She was a good coworker, and they carpooled to save money. He remembered why he liked her so much as a kid.

Angela loved the freedom of a car and having money. Mark was fun to work with as well. Age hadn't dulled his sense of humor as well. He became her best friend during junior year. She enjoyed working with him all summer. Didn't she used to have a crush on him.

At the start of senior year, Mark approached his best friend Tyler. 

""So I think I'm in love with Angela,"" he said. Tyler had no response.

""Any thoughts?""

""And prayers. You're going to need them."" Tyler pointed, and Mark turned around. Angela was standing there with her eyes widened. 

""Tyler, can you go somewhere else please?"" Angela asked.

""And miss cringe like this. Of course not,"" Tyler said.

""Tyler."" Mark said. 

""Fine."" Tyler walked away.

""Angela, it was just a figured of speech. I am not really in love with you,"" Mark started.

""Do you want to hang out after work?"" Angela asked. Mark froze, and he got scared. What if it all went wrong? What if they lost their friendship. Mark opened his mouth and felt the no in his throat.

""Yes,"" he said. 

""Great, see you then."" Angela walked away. Tyler clapped his hands from behind a corner.

""Glad you didn't screw it up buddy,"" he said. Mark couldn't say anything back. He was too excited that he finally got with Angela.

A week ago, you found out your husband's alter ego--as well as the source of his black eyes and countless lacerations. Still, you've always tried to be supportive. After all, support is a superpower, too. Right?

In the entryway, you slide out of your mighty galactic boots. Hang your cloak on the hallway hook.

""Is that you, Rhonda?"" he calls. He's in the fortress of quietude.

You sigh. ""Yeah,"" you call. ""Yeah, it's me.""

When you enter the room, he sits up in the recliner. Smiles, as if you can't see all over his face that something is wrong.

""How was work?"" he asks.

""I know about everything,"" you reply.

Blood rushes to his face, as well as out of his countless lacerations. ""Whatever do you mean?""

You had the fortress of quietude converted to more of a rumpus room as an anniversary present to yourselves. You lean against the bumper-pool table. ""I know about the Crimson Crusader."" Saying his hero name aloud makes you nauseous. ""I know about all of it.""

He doesn't respond.

""I can't see you get hurt. I love you, Brian.""

He folds his heavily lacerated arms. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

It's the denial that most frustrates you. The lying in the face of obvious evidence. ""Where were you last night?""

""I already told you. I was out buying milk.""

""For twelve and a half hours?""

He's silent for several seconds. ""Yes,"" he says.

You lower yourself onto the ottoman across from him. ""What about the night before that?"" Your breath catches, quieted by a question you can barely get out. ""Have you been out battling Shrinkuloid?""

""No! Never!""

""Brian, those shrink rays are dangerous. If you're going to try to be a superhero, you should at least--""

""*Try* to? Rhonda, I *am* a hero.

1l83n7b,mx2wlwk,"I didn’t scream when they took me.

I figured, *""Why bother ?""*

The alley was dark, the air reeking of piss and rotting trash. The perfect place to disappear. I thought I might’ve been getting mugged. Maybe even killed. Either would’ve been fine.

But when the hood was pulled off and I saw the metal room, the cameras, the numbers tattooed on my wrist… I realized I wasn’t being *killed*. Not yet.

I was being *drafted*.

---

They called it “The Gauntlet.” A death game. A sick amusement for people with more money than soul. Each of us had a number. A tracker. We’d be given ""tasks."" If we refused? Death. Failed? Death. Killed someone else? One step closer to freedom.

I laughed when they explained it. Out loud. Just laughed.

A young man in the corner threw up. Another begged to go home. Me? I was relieved.

I wouldn’t have to do it myself.

---

Day three, I was still alive. Not by effort, just by apathy. I didn’t try to fight or escape. I did the bare minimum to avoid getting shot by the sentries. I thought I’d die in one of the tasks. I *wanted* to. That would be fine.

And then I saw her.

She couldn't have been older than ten. Long black hair, a solemn look in her eyes too heavy for her size. And when I saw her face...

I stopped breathing.

That jawline. Those big, sad eyes. The uneven fringe.

*Her.*

Not exactly, of course. But close enough that it carved through my chest like glass.

Her name was Emi. Quiet, polite, like a child who’s learned early not to be a burden. She didn’t cry. Even when the man in our group tried to barter her life for supplies, she just looked at him, unblinking.

I stepped in without thinking.

Broke his nose. Took the supplies. Got her behind me.

“Don’t talk to her again,” I told him, surprised at the venom in my own voice. “Or I’ll stop holding back.”

He looked at me like I was crazy. Maybe I was.

But Emi looked at me like I was something else.

*Safe.*

---

It wasn’t until the third week that she asked, “Why are you helping me?”

We were huddled under a collapsed stairwell. My jacket was wrapped around her shoulders.

I didn’t answer. Not right away.

Because how do you tell a child:

*I killed a girl who looked just like you. With my own hands. My own curiosity. My own idiocy. I pulled the trigger, and I never stopped hearing it since.*

*Bang.*

We were ten. Just like her. I’d found the gun under a bush by the road. Rusty but real. I waved it around like a toy, like it was part of a movie. 

*She.*

*The girl I lost.*

*She begged me to stop.*

“That’s not funny,” she said. “Put it down.”

And I, being a stupid little brat who thought real life was a game, pulled the trigger.

I didn’t know it was loaded.

The bullet hit her chest. Just one. That’s all it took.

Her blood soaked the dirt and my shoes. I watched her mouth open and close like she wanted to ask something. Maybe forgive me. Maybe not.

I never got to find out.

---

“Because you remind me of someone,” I told Emi. “Someone I failed.”

Her eyes were dark and quiet. She nodded. She didn’t ask more.

Children are smarter than we give them credit for.

---

I didn’t want to die anymore.

Not because I suddenly loved life. No, I still hated myself. But I wanted to protect *her*. As long as she was still breathing, I had a purpose.

I wasn’t trying to survive for *me*. I didn’t deserve it.

*But...*

 *If I could be her shield, her sword...*

*If I could get her out of this hellhole alive...*

*Then maybe, maybe...*

*...I could finally rest.* 

*Not in death.*

*But...*

1l83n7b,mx515h7,"When you turn 18, your name gets entered into a raffle. If you ""win"" the lottery, you are taken and forced into a death game for the purposes of entertainment. They watch you on a big screen. Cameras everywhere. Spectators laughing. Talking about their favorite ""characters."" It's sickening. It plays on every screen, and every year, I have turned my back in defiance. I couldn't watch. 

You're entered into the raffle every year between when you're 18 and when you're 59. Apparently 60 is too old to be killed for entertainment. There are two entries for every territory. If a lot is called, someone else could volunteer to take their place. But why would anyone do a thing like that? 

I'll tell you why I did. 

The reward for participating in the death game is that your family is set for life. If you win, there are additional rewards on top of that. You're famous, live in the lap of luxury, get lots of job opportunies you wouldn't otherwise get, even possibly you become the next ruler of the nation should something happen to the previous one. None of that shit mattered to me. 

All I care about is my daughter. She only has a year to live without treatment. I enter this tournament. I die right away. She gets the medical care she needs. She lives. It's important I die as soon as possible so she can have the best chance at life. 

When an 18-year-old boy who could only look terrified as everyone laughed was called in the lottery, I didn't hesitate to volunteer. The reason they laughed is because he was an orphan. There would be no one for the money to go to if he died. It would have been fucked up for him to go, moreso than anyone else, for that reason. In a way, that's a good thing. I'm not taking the ""opportunity"" from someone else who might need it. 

We don't have to go in and kill each other right away. We first get to size up our competition in training areas for the game. Everyone else seems to have their eye on the prize as they blow up dummy after dummy. Except her. She stands off to the side, as do I. She is visibly showing. Very visibly. She might give birth any second. And I know her.

1l83n7b,mx5pazq,"The perky one with the long curly hair took center stage. She bit her lip waiting for it to start. The drums thundered and she flinched at the harsh hi-hat. Her time came and she raised her microphone.

""No clouds in my stones

Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank

Coming down with the Dow Jones

When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella""

She was shaky at first, but she found her footing by the pre chorus. The man next to me, the one with the low cut V-neck and the big gold crucifix, swore under his breath. ""She's nailing this.""

By the chorus she was a diva, stomping along with the hook. We couldn't see the seating from our angle, but it didn't matter. We couldn't read the audience of one. He never took off his black skintight mask, the one with a medical diagram of an ear printed on the front. The sick fuck liked to keep us guessing.

When she was done, we heard the dull clap of his gloves. It seemed like he was still sitting, since his applause started so quickly.

It all seemed like such a stupid way to die. One minute, we thought we were signing up for the latest and greatest singing competition. The next we were sleeping in kennels until it was our time to sing. The judge, who called himself The Ear, said that only one of us would survive in the end. But I had failed enough auditions before to know that, even if I made it through without irreparable emotional damage, I would never make it. The industry would eat me alive, one way or another.

The first round was drawing to a close. There was one other woman, and then it was my turn. I was betting my life on Separate Ways by Journey. It had killed at karaoke enough times, but it only had to save me once.

The woman who took the stage looked completely out of place. She was an older woman, probably in her 50s or 60s, dressed in a maternity muumuu and a wide straw hat. He arms had grown slack over the years, almost pouring out of her sleeves. But despite her kind smile, her chest was heaving. Her eyes glistened in the stagelight.

[The track started up and I almost burst out laughing](https://youtu.be/9EcjWd-O4jI?si=qISDtzHWRsXOQTRc). I choked it down, knowing what the guards would do if any of us interrupted the performance. Suddenly the heavyset woman came to life, a younger version of her clawing to the surface. She moved like a woman half her age, her hips shaking and her feet stomping. The lyrics were comically simple, but she delivered them with such sass and conviction that it changed the temperature of the room. The contestants beside me were stunned into absolute silence, but every last one of them was tapping a foot or nodding a head.

At the very end, she overstepped by just a hair. Her muumuu must have caught between her legs because she stumbled, falling onto her hands. She looked up, mortified and ghost white.

The Ear clapped slowly and she stifled a sob, scurrying off stage. A younger girl wrapped her arms around the woman, patting her on the back and struggling to comfort her. The man in the V-neck flashed me a fiendish smile and drew a thumb across his neck--she was clearly on the chopping block.

So I did the only thing I could. I took center stage, looking out at the empty auditorium and the lone judge in the front row. The synth rose up around me and the guitars chugged to life. Instead of running around the stage to work up the energy, I stood statuesque, staring down the Ear. The intro came to its conclusion and I raised my microphone, a crazy grin plastered across my face:

""Yeah, that's all correct."" 

""And now, what? You're pregnant by some guy? Forced to join this game? I thought you were exempt from the lot if you had a high paying enough and important enough job, which obviously you got. You wanted to be a doctor or somethin', right?""

""Damn. I didn't know that."" 

""You would have if you watched TV,"" she said with a wry smile. I chuckled. 

""Guess you got me there. You know, the money going nowhere thing was similar for the boy I volunteered for."" 

""Is that why you did it? So the money wouldn't go to waste?""

We had both been whispering this whole time in the hopes that what we say couldn't be caught well enough for anyone to make out our specific words, but we both know the effort might be futile.

""Would you like to sit down for tea?"" I gestured for him to sit with me. ""We don't have to fight, and you could use a break after conjuring such a fantastic light show. It must've taken so much mana to cast it.""

""Light show?"" He scoffed. ""No, that was a terrible spell to warp your senses! To melt your mind! To drive you insane!""

""What did you think was going to happen? Were you hoping I'd flip my table and go on a rampage?""

""Cute, to think a basic calming spell would resolve things if I truly let loose,"" I remarked, trying my best not to spill my tea, or spit it into his face. ""Hilarious, that'd you imagine yourself able to survive being in my presence if I made a return to true form. It took several gods, seasoned adventurers and monster slayers when I was in peak form. Now, excuse me while I take this human face off.""

So, I peeled my face off gleefully. Not a full eldritch mode, lest I destroy the sanity of any innocent passerby who happened to be in the vicinity. Just a momentary flash of many eyes and teeth and more tentacles than he has fingers.

His eyes rolled backwards, and he fell flat on his back. No screaming in fear, no crying rivers of blood or clawing his eyes out. A quick check from one of my tentacles revealed his pants were disappointingly dry.

""Did you kill him?"" A woman passing by dropped her handbag and rushed over.

I placed a tentacle across his nostrils. ""He's breathing. Maybe he's just sleeping. I'll wake up him later when I feel like it. Who knew casting a big, bright spell could be so exhausting?""

The ancient words of power rolled off Malachar's tongue like poisoned honey, each syllable crackling with malevolent energy. The ritual circle blazed with eldritch fire as reality bent around the incantation, and the very air seemed to scream in protest.

""*Mentis Fracturam Infinitus!*"" he roared, thrusting his gnarled staff toward the adventurer who had dared to challenge him in his own sanctum.

The spell hit Marcus like a thunderbolt of pure madness. Tendrils of psychic energy wrapped around his mind, seeking to shatter his sanity into a thousand glittering fragments. The magic was designed to show him truths too terrible for mortal comprehension, to flood his consciousness with the howling void between stars, to break his grip on reality itself.

Malachar watched with gleeful anticipation as the spell took hold. This was his masterpiece, perfected over centuries of study. No mortal mind could withstand it. The fool would be reduced to a gibbering wreck within moments.

But Marcus just stood there.

Blinking.

Then he started to laugh.

""No..."" Malachar breathed, his triumph curdling into disbelief. ""Impossible! That spell should have driven you insane!""

Marcus wiped a tear from his eye and grinned—a lopsided, slightly manic expression that made the dark wizard take an involuntary step backward.

""Buddy, lookie here,"" Marcus said, tapping his temple with one finger. ""I AM insane.""

The words hung in the air like a challenge to reality itself.

""You see,"" Marcus continued conversationally, spinning his sword in a casual circle, ""about three years ago, I spent a month in the Whispering Woods. You know, the ones where the trees tell you secrets about the heat death of the universe? Yeah, those really messed me up.""

Malachar's staff trembled in his grip. This wasn't possible. His spell was flawless, absolute—

""Then there was that time I looked into the Mirror of Cosmic Truth,"" Marcus went on, advancing slowly. ""Saw all of reality as it really is—just a story being told by a dreaming god who's having a really weird nightmare. That was fun.""

""But... but the madness should have consumed you!"" Malachar sputtered.

""Oh, it did,"" Marcus agreed cheerfully. ""Completely. Utterly. I've been stark raving mad for years now. The voices in my head have formed a council. They vote on things. Gary—that's the voice that sounds like my third-grade teacher—he's currently the treasurer.""

The dark wizard's face had gone pale. ""That's... that's not how insanity works!""

""Says who?"" Marcus laughed again, the sound echoing strangely in the ritual chamber. ""You know what I learned from being completely bonkers? Sanity is just a crutch. It's what keeps people from seeing the beautiful, terrible, absolutely ridiculous truth of everything.""

He gestured broadly at the chamber around them, at the eldritch symbols and twisted architecture that hurt to look at directly.

""Like this place, for instance. Most people would see nightmare fuel. I see interior decorating by someone who's clearly never heard of feng shui. I mean, seriously, who puts a sacrificial altar right in the middle of the traffic flow?""

Malachar tried to cast another spell, but his hands were shaking too badly to form the proper gestures. This was all wrong. The adventurer should be drooling and speaking in tongues by now, not offering decorating advice.

""Here's the thing about being insane,"" Marcus said, his voice taking on an almost gentle tone. ""Once you're already there, you can't go any further. Your spell is designed to break minds that are still clinging to the illusion that reality makes sense. But my mind broke years ago, and I built something new from the pieces.""

He paused, tilting his head as if listening to something only he could hear.

""Oh, the council wants me to mention that your spell actually felt kind of nice. Like a warm hug for the parts of my brain that normal people don't even know exist. Margaret—she's the voice that sounds like a disappointed librarian—she says to tell you 'thank you for the pleasant sensation.'""

The staff slipped from Malachar's nerveless fingers. ""This is impossible,"" he whispered.

""No,"" Marcus corrected, his grin widening impossibly. ""This is Tuesday. Tuesdays are weird. Always have been. That's why I specifically schedule my adventures for Tuesdays—the universe is already being strange, so I fit right in.""

He raised his sword, and for a moment, Malachar could swear he saw something moving in the reflection of the blade—something that laughed with too many voices.

""You know what the really funny part is?"" Marcus asked. ""All those cosmic horrors and mind-breaking truths you've been studying? They're actually pretty reasonable once you get to know them. Most of them just want someone to talk to. Turns out, when you're an ancient entity of pure madness, it's hard to find good conversation.""

Malachar tried to run, but his legs wouldn't obey him. The sheer wrongness of the situation had paralyzed him more effectively than any binding spell.

""Don't worry,"" Marcus said kindly. ""I'm not going to kill you. That would be boring, and boring is the one thing I absolutely cannot tolerate. Instead, I'm going to do something much more interesting.""

He leaned in close, and Malachar caught a glimpse of something vast and impossible swimming behind the adventurer's eyes.

""I'm going to teach you the most important lesson a dark wizard can learn,"" Marcus whispered. ""There's always someone crazier than you.""

The last thing Malachar heard before his world dissolved into laughter was the sound of a council taking a vote, and the motion passing unanimously.

When the other dark wizards found him three days later, he was sitting in his ritual circle, giggling softly and trying to teach proper feng shui to a houseplant named Gerald.

He seemed quite happy.

*""And that,"" Marcus concluded, addressing the empty air as he walked away from the tower, ""is why you should always check references before hiring an insanity wizard.""*

*""Agreed,"" said Gary.*

*""Motion carried,"" said Margaret.*

*""Gerald seems nice,"" added a new voice that sounded suspiciously like Malachar.*

The orc snarled, ""Then you should be a gibbering mess! At least! An insane primal corspe!""

Just to emphasize my clear lack of sanity, I easily popped off one of my arms. Being undead because you were intrigued by necromancy certainly has its advantages. I puppeted my detached arm like a sock puppet, moving my hand like a mouth. ""Oh no!"" I dropped my voice to a mockery or his gruff one, ""This undead human didn't resist my sleep, they just weren't affected!!!""

I gave out another maddened cackle and gestured with my detached limb as I spoke, the hand still moving and pointing as I directed it. ""Look, kiddo-.""

""I'm a grown ass adult.""

""-kiddo,"" I re-enforced, ""I dabbled in necromancy enough to turn myself undead for the giggles, got bored, then took up being a diabolist of the dark arts. Because it's fun and interesting. The chaotic nature of this magic is so much *fun* to witness and figure out its rules.""

""There aren't any rules-!""

""By the Holy Light, you must be dense. *Everything's* got rules!"" My arms shot upward at that, still holding my other hand.

The warlock simply cast a shadow bolt at me, hitting me in the face.

I smiled no grinned at him he was I think the word is cute no charming. “My dear spellshield you don’t understand how magic works don’t you. You think I should be frothing at the mouth and rolling my eyes to the point you see them turn to white little spots on my face don’t you.”

1l7s4sr,mx2iywx,"Red Ronin roared - Pain? Rage? Fear? Determination? - as those alien thoughts wormed their way into her head. Like eldritch maggots writhing in grey matter, trying to unmoor her from herself.

She held on. Barely. Only the endurance learnt from the long fight with her fathers murderers and experience with the insidious influences of the Red Blade helped her stave it off...

And then it was over, and she feel to her knees. Her clothes sticky and sticky against her skin from sweat. She barely managed to push the oni mask up before she hurled, splashing her lunch onto the pavement as she heaved.

Fuck. Ka-Pow Kitchen noodles tasted almost as bad coming up than it did going down.

The unhinged cackling of a madman mad her run the back of her hand over her mouth, fit her mask back on and raise her head. Because right, they were in the middle of something. The Ego Warlock floated in mid air, cackling maniacally with is hands still raised in that inane gesture the Circle of Dreams used...

One still pointed where Rumble and the newbies had been standing.

But....

""J-jester?!"" came Mirrors fearful cry from right next to her. Looking almost as stunned as Rumble to be here rather than caught up in the middle of the mind-fuck that was dropped on their head.

""I'm fine!"" the girl with the fox ears and tail shouted back, a large red and purple sheet dangling from one hand. Her eyes sparkling with a concerning amount of unhinged mirth.

""W-what?!"" And that was the Ego Warlock, who blinked incredulously. Oh god, what was it with these Circle goons that made them such big hams? Dangerous, yes, but ridiculously hammy. ""No... impossible! That spell should have driven you insane!""

Jester snorted and rolled her eyes. ""Buddy, lookie here. I AM insane! A little psychic nascent god whammy isn't really going to do much to make that worse, ya know?""

""Fucking called it,"" Rumble rumbled next to her and shot her a reproachful glance. Because he'd suspected as much already. The fact a literal modern-day golem with a little more than clay and holy words for a brain was better at reading people than her was as grating as it was puzzling.

Then again... she was standing. And talking. And not sprouting absolute nonsense.

""T-they're moving again. Soon,"" Mirror said besides them, her voice drawling with that far off absence of awareness that Red Ronin had learnt was a hallmark of her peering into the future. Past. Other presents. ""Some kind... of gate? Something is going to come through.""

""Oneiric Gate,"" groaned Rumble. ""So that was what they were doing here.""

""Right. Mirror, you're our best bet at closing that thing down with your sight. Rumble, you clear the way and keep her safe. It's going to be though, but you can do it."" The words were ment mostly for Mirriam - Mirror. She was as green as a novice hero could be despite being being a bit older than most of them, only a few weeks into getting a handle on her powers. 

""I'll deal with the Warlock, Jester you-""

""Go clear the way, I'll handle this guy,"" the fox-girl said with a grin.",5,1749583021.0

""I think,"" Jester cut him off with a cocky grin, ""that long ago I walked with the Trickster God across the Land of Lakes and Forests. I think that the Sun and Moon meet in the midday sky to consume their love, for we tricked them into thinking none would see! I think that wood floats for it believe itself the supperio of the water, for we tricked it to think so! I think trolls turn to stone beneath the Sun, for we scared them so!""

Jesters words made Red Ronin shiver. Because there was a kind of deranged, absolute certainty in those words. One seldom found in the girls prefered word games and silly japes.

Great. Maybe Jester was... maybe a bit crazy.

""So let me ask you, oh egg-on-face! Do you think you can top that?""

The Ego Warlock... looked a bit uncertain.

""Besides, you seem to forget something here,"" giggled Jester, her grin widening before she threw the sheet in her hand up and over herself. Giving Red Ronin a wink as she did. ""I teleport\~""

The Warlock bit out a curse as the blanket just collapsed emptily. One that turned into a squeal of pain as Jester kicked him between the legs from behind.

1l7rur9,mwzh8fd,"I've always known there was something weird about Derek.
I mean, the man has been “27” for the nine years I’ve known him, his apartment is suspiciously clean for someone who works “80-hour weeks” (yet somehow still has time for weekly bar nights and weekend hikes), and he once commented that the Roman Empire “wasn’t that great if you actually lived there.” You know, normal everyday observations that definitely don’t sound like someone who experienced it firsthand.
But try explaining to people that your old college roommate turned best friend might be an ancient deity, and see how fast they recommend therapy.
“You’re being ridiculous, Sam,” my girlfriend Jessie would say. “Just because he never gets sick and occasionally speaks dead languages in his sleep doesn’t mean he’s immortal.”
Solid arguments, sure. But the evidence kept piling up.
Derek could predict the weather with unsettling accuracy (“Trust me, don’t plan your birthday party outdoors next Tuesday”), never got drunk no matter how much he drank, and somehow always knew exactly where to find parking in downtown Manhattan—a power more impressive than raising the dead, if you ask any New Yorker.
Still, I needed definitive proof. The kind that would stand up in a court of immortal law—or at least convince Jessie I wasn’t losing my mind.
That proof came last Wednesday.
We were at our regular dive bar, The Rusty Nail. Derek was telling one of his impossibly detailed historical anecdotes, this time about Ancient Greece.
“The thing about Aristotle,” he was saying, swirling his untouched whiskey, “is that he wasn’t nearly as smart as everyone thinks. The man couldn’t even boil an egg properly.”
“And how would you know that?” I challenged, several beers in and feeling bold.
“History books, obviously,” Derek replied with that infuriating half-smile.
“Right. The famous ‘Aristotle’s Egg Preparation Techniques’ scrolls we all studied in school.”
That’s when Jimmy, the bar’s resident drunk, stumbled past our table, knocking into a waitress carrying a full tray of drinks.
Time seemed to slow down.
The tray tilted, glasses slid, and liquid arced through the air—directly toward Derek’s pristine white shirt.
Without looking up from his phone, Derek flicked his wrist casually.
The drinks froze in midair.
Not “froze” as in turned to ice. Froze as in suspended in space, defying gravity, droplets hanging like tiny amber planets.
The entire bar went silent.
The jukebox scratched to a halt (which was weird, since it’s digital).
Even Jimmy stopped mid-hiccup.
For one eternal second, everything was perfectly still.
Then Derek looked up, saw what was happening, muttered what sounded suspiciously like ancient Sumerian, and with another flick of his wrist, everything resumed motion—except now all the drinks somehow landed perfectly back on the tray without spilling a drop.
The waitress, apparently unaware anything unusual had happened, continued on her way.
Jimmy stumbled to the bathroom.
The jukebox resumed playing “Don’t Stop Believin’” as if nothing had happened.
But I saw it. And Derek knew I saw it.
“So,” I said, meeting his eyes. “Aristotle couldn’t boil an egg, huh?”
Derek stared at me for a long moment, then sighed deeply and downed his whiskey in one go.
“Fine,” he said. “But this is not how I wanted this conversation to go.”
“Which god are you?” I whispered, leaning forward.
“I’m not exactly—” he began.
“Greek? Roman? Norse? Please don’t say trickster god.”
“I’m not technically a god,” Derek said, looking uncomfortable for the first time since I’d known him. “More like… middle management.”
“In heaven?”
“In the cosmic bureaucracy. Gods answer to us, actually.”
I sat back, processing this.
“So all those times you talked about historical figures...”
“I was there for performance reviews, yes.”
“And the weather predictions?”
“Departmental memos.”
“The perfect parking spaces?”
“That’s just a perk of the job,” he admitted. “Like celestial valet service.”
I stared at him.
“Wait, if everyone else in the bar saw what just happened, why aren’t they freaking out?”
Derek winced.
“I may have... adjusted their perception of events. Standard protocol.”
“But not mine? You didn’t wipe my memory?”
He looked genuinely uncomfortable now.
“Please keep your voice down. I really don’t want to have to erase your memories too.”
“So you were planning to?”
“Initially, yes. Especially after that incident sophomore year when you almost caught me levitating in my sleep after the Halloween party.”
He looked away.
“But... I can’t do that to a friend. What kind of sick friendship involves routinely manipulating someone’s mind, you know?”
I felt simultaneously touched and terrified.
“So what exactly is your job? Divine quality control?”
“I’m an Embedded Observer,” Derek explained, suddenly looking professional. “My department monitors human development and progression. We compile reports on how humanity is evolving—socially, technologically, spiritually. I was assigned to experience life as a human firsthand to provide a more... authentic perspective.”
“You’re basically a cosmic anthropologist?”
“More like a field researcher with some regulatory powers. The paperwork is endless.”
“I have so many questions.”
“I know,” Derek—or whatever his real name was—replied. “But first, I need you to sign some paperwork. Witnessing a reality manipulation incident requires at least form CR-7B in triplicate.”
Of course Derek would still be obsessed with paperwork even as a cosmic being.
“So... can you tell me any transcendent secrets? Like the meaning of life or something?” I asked.
Derek laughed.
“The meaning of life? Even we don’t know that. But I can tell you why cats always want out of a room just to want back in immediately. That one’s actually fascinating.”
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I discovered my best friend wasn’t a god, but something even weirder: a divine bureaucrat with a pension plan that probably predates the Big Bang.",294,1749546185.0

After that it was a cascade of small oddities that I couldn't keep ignoring. 

At the park I saw him walk through a flock of geese; the hateful birds made way and didn't even honk at him. He's never forgotten a computer password, according to Joe in IT. No car but always shows up on time even on days i know the busses are delayed. No umbrella but never wet when it rains. 

He once corrected my spelling of ""their"" when i spoke. He could tell my thought process spelled it wrong despite the words sounding the same. 

Then he saw me see. Or maybe he knew as soon as I paid attention. Last Tuesday he brought in my all time favorite food, a pastry that my hometown shop used to bake. This shop closed thirty years ago, in a town a thousand miles away. Steve even had a paper bag with their logo just like I remember.

My hands shook when I took the bag, but he just said ""Don't worry about it, we're all good,"" and then winked with both eyes. Yes that sounds wrong, but that's how it was.

His sense of time, for example. If you asked him the time, he could tell you down to the minute without looking at any sort of clock. He was always on time, never late for anything. He never got sick, never had “off” days, never even seemed to get tired. Even his memory was eerily perfect. Near photographic, if not beyond that. Everything he read, witnessed, or learned, he could recall perfectly.

He had an intuition beyond what one could simply call luck. He never lost a coin toss or a bet. Once, he even perfectly predicted the winning lottery numbers before they were unveiled. His dictation had been immaculate, never stuttering or stumbling on his words.

If Greg was merely a man, he was a perfect one.

“Tim? Are you listening?”

Greg's words ripped me from my thoughts. He was standing next to me in my living room, helping me set up my new computer.

“Yes, sorry. This stuff’s a bit over my head, is all. There’s a reason I don't work for you in the IT department,” I said, finishing my words with an awkward laugh.

“Right. Well, you're pretty much good to go. You said you had some stuff backed up on a thumb drive, right?”

“Yeah, just some pictures and stuff,” I answered, handing the USB stick over to him.

He took the drive and looked it over for a few seconds. Then, he lowered it down to the side of the computer. At that moment, with the click of the drive into the computer, something clicked within my mind as well.

""Different how? I'll just fly in the nose, lay my claim, and fly back out.""

""That's the thing,"" Snoreglar said, struggling to keep his mouth above the chamber's water line. ""You *can't* just fly back out. I thought I could, and then he affixed this strange proboscis to his face, and then--""

Thirdicus, the third demon, held up a clawed hand. ""Silence!"" he cried. ""Snoreglar, your incompetence knows no bounds. Now, vacate this body, that a true demon might occupy it in your stead!""

Unfortunately, Snoreglar had drowsed off halfway through Thirdicus's invective. All this vapor was doing wonders for his airways. A more worldly demon might have recognized the scent of lavender.

""Snoreglar!""

Corazar held a finger to his lips. ""Quiet! Perhaps we can force him out.""

Thirdicus' eyes gleamed. ""What do you propose?""

Corazar--the most cunning of the three, renowned for his wit and problem-solving--punched the accursed appendage off the edge of the nightstand. It crashed to the floor and broke in half. Its clear plastic bladder, still intact, swirled with the foul miasma that was their sleeping friend. 

""Whoa!"" Thirdicus cried.

""Quiet! You'll wake the human."" Corazar got down on his demon knees and began knocking the side of the bladder. He picked it up and shook it, shouting Snoreglar's name.

The human, meanwhile, remained asleep, the proboscis firmly in place--and as he looked on, Thirdicus felt a pang of weary envy. To remain asleep through such a ruckus! To know peace in torment! Whatever this appendage was--this machine that allowed such slumber--Thirdicus made a mental note to check it out.

Despite remembering it, I still marvelled at the technology before me. Orus had severely lacked in this regard, knowledge hoarded and guarded jealously, instead of avaliable at the click of a button here.

I didn't necessarily need to catch up. There wasn't anything important I needed to do. My adventures had landed me with a considerable amount of gold and jewels, so I wasn't hurting for money. The trickiest part had been exchanging it, as there were so many questions as to where it had come from. I was probably on a number of watch lists now, but humans were nothing for me to fear now.

I had magic. The only one with it here. Without magical intention, nothing could pierce the Amulet of Hardened Skin. The Ring of Purity prevented me from suffering from mundane poisons and diseases. In fact my once per month Revival Charm was enough anyway.

I browsed through the headlines idly, calm and steady. Nothing to worry about here. At least, until I felt the change.

My mage-sense flashed. I was used to how it always went off back on Orus, with magic used here and there. But it had been quiet around me since my return. Until now.

My eyes shot up, focusing on the source. Just in time to see an angry driver pointing at another. I couldn't hear, but I could see. I could see the conflux of power around his finger, reaching a peak before lashing out. A ball of fire rushed out, slamming into the other vehicle.

Then I could hear. I could hear the screams, with a low roar underneath. It wasn't the strongest fireball, but it was still potent in a mageless world.

I didn't wait, knocking my chair over as I sprinted out. The people around me fled, as the once angry driver went pale. He stared at his finger, tremors starting to hit. It wasn't the look of a trained mage. It was that of a novice, casting their first spell.

Touching the bracelet on my wrist, I flicked a spray of cold at the flaming car. It was easy enough to extinguish, as I turned my attention to the budding mage.

He was shaking. Horror, awe and wonder fought for dominance, as he looked up. His voice was quiet, like a child caught being naughty. ""M-magic?""

I nodded once, narrowing my eyes at him. ""Magic.""

Examining his aura, I noticed how it was new. Very new, as in barely two months old. Surprisingly strong, but then again this was a grown man. It made me suspicious. Suspicious enough to look around, glancing at bystanders.

Their auras were many and varied, as with all beings. But there was a similarity between them all. They were all new. All fresh. All within the last two months.

All since my return. My gut dropped, as I came up with my theory. Instinctively I knew it was right, but I would have to check. My return had sparked this. Magic was life, but here it was dormant. Until I had arrived, with my active magic. Like a starter motor, it had begun to spread, waking up the world. Waking up magic.

Which meant this was only the beginning. Mages would pop up everywhere, both weak and strong. Knowing human nature, there would be a lot of problems following, and avoidable deaths. They needed training, but I was the only experienced mage in the world.

My head began to pound. I thought I would be free of responsibilities here, now I was back. But I wouldn't be free. Knowing this was coming, I had to start making preparations. This was my fault after all. So it was my job to make the best of it.

Which meant getting involved in politics once more.",12,1749589993.0

1l7sedz,mwzkcd6,"It was a hot July day, and I was at my family's yearly barbecue. The heat was oppressive, and while people were having fun, we were all visibly suffering. ""It's so freaking hot. I wish we could just turn the sun off for a bit"", my mom complained. ""Like this?"" I said jokingly. I grabbed the remote for the outdoor TV, which was currently showing Mario Kart (which no one was playing because it was too hot). ""Boop!"" I pressed the power button. As expected, nothing happened. My mom and my dad chuckled, and they went inside the house together. All the aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and other family members that I had never even seen followed suit. So of course I followed too.

I was setting up some board games to entertain the children when the room suddenly went dark. The streetlights turned on, and the birds stopped singing. How was it already night? I checked the time - 3:15 in the afternoon. ""Eclipse?"" said my fifth uncle twice removed. ""No way, there's no eclipse for fifty years!"" my nerdy third cousin retorted. Suddenly I remembered what I had done. The remote! No way! Surely it couldn't be! I immediately darted outside and grabbed the remote (it was still hot, and Mario Kart was still running). With all my might I pressed the power button. When nothing happened I curled up and cried like a baby. I tried to prepare myself for the apocalypse that was to come. Lost in my thoughts, the darkness lasted an eternity. Then the world was light again.

I stood up. It was over, just like that? I stared at the remote in my hand. Then I threw it on the ground. The plastic shattered, revealing an ordinary TV remote. I checked the time. 3:32. Seventeen minutes. Eight minutes for the signal to reach the sun, eight minutes for the light to reach Earth, and one minute spent panicking. I heard my mom call my name. ""I'm here!"" I could barely exclaim. Then I went inside.",15,1749548026.0

I rubbed my temples. It wasn't the first time I had to explain my magic and each occurrence only added to headache. This particular instance, my patient was Milites Victrex--a loyal soldier whose muscles compensated for his intellect.

""A necro-*medic,""* I said, emphasizing the word as forcefully as I could. I motioned for his arm.

""And what does that mean?"" He raised his injury without so much as a flinch. The wrist was twisted at a wrong angle and the forearm bone pushed the skin by the bend.

""How did you get injured?"" I asked, observing the damage. All things considered, it was a simple injury. War being war, my usual patients were more on the ...gruesome side.

""We hid in a trench during an attack,"" said Victrex, almost too casually. ""An enemy soldier spotted us and threw a grenade. I didn't think, I dove in and shielded the rest of my troop with my body."" 

I stared at him, aghast. ""And you came out only with a dislocated wrist?""

He shrugged. ""If it's any consolation, my sides hurt a bit too."" 

""Probably broken ribs,"" I said offhandedly. I bit a nail. ""Milites, tell me, do you possess any magic of any sort?""

""Nope,"" he grinned. ""My skin was grafted with reinforced boar skin after I was drafted. They tell me it should negate a lot of injuries if I survive.""

""Ah."" I turned my back to him and went to a drawer the far side of my tent. I had heard of grafted soldiers before--an experimental procedure that granted ordinary folk properties from an animal. Still, I didn't expect it to be this effective.

I pulled out a box and held the cool metal inside. It's not often I got to use a powerful weapon but if this man could survive a grenade point-blank...

""You still haven't answered my question,"" said Victrex.

""Hm?""

""What does a necro-medic mean?""

""It means I can heal all injuries,"" I told him, stepping closer. ""All wounds. All afflictions, all illnesses, or all harm."" I stood only a foot from him now. ""But not many seek out my services.""

Victrex looked up. ""Why is that?""

1l7qvu0,mwyzn9y,"I am the greatest healer in the realm at least that is what everybody believes. 
In truth I’m a massive fraud I never could get my head around healing magic don’t know shit about manipulating the magical energies of the body. 
I do have quite a talent for death magic necromancy as it’s known to most.
Sure it’s illegal especially under the new emperor (Having your father be dead and then turned into a corpse puppet emperor for 20 years will make you hate the craft.) but it’s not like I’m using it for evil I’m reviving people it’s one step better then just healing them, I’m using my talents for good.
Anyway I just need to justify to the inquisitor why I can’t heal he’s broken bone despite my reputation as the best. (and the inquisition only works WITH THE BEST as they like to say) 

The lord inquisitor Justin Lightcrown said: “So explain why can’t you do it. Said the inquisitor puzzled he must have been in great pain looking at his arm but he did not show it.”

I felt my heart thumping and tried to hide my fear. “You must understand my magic is not fast this type of work is a waste of my and your time” I said nervously to the witch hunter.

“Working with the inquisition is a waste of your time strange words for a mage” he said accusingly.

“Of course it isn’t” he then cut me off.

“Then you will do it end of the conversation” he said matter of fact.

“I can’t you must understand” I said desperately. 

“Understand what?” He looked at me curious.

Ok I have to bullshit my way out of this if I fail I might die or worse be forced to stop healing people. 

“Well?” The man who could have me killed with a single order said.

I whispered “my magic it allows me to flood the body with healing energies it can heal most major wounds no problem. Unfortunately stuff like your arm are to healthy if I use my magic on you it can lead you to harm.” I started crying this wasn’t part of the bullshiting I’m just that scared. 

He looked lost in thought but only for a moment before sternly saying “On one hand hiding facts about your magic is against the law but you have always been an asset and a loyal man. Both for the crown and the inquisition.” He smiled for the first time since I met him “I’ll deal with it don’t worry”

1l87x0i,mx2zgsx,"When I saw the armed and armored man emerge as if from thin air, I stared. He was an older gentleman, with gray in his beard and a receding hairline. Like a knight, he was clad in armor, though it was in such a tragic condition as I had never seen. Rent in some places, shorn away in others, dents and stains covered seemingly every inch. His breath steamed in the cool morning air and there was a disturbing rattling I could hear coming from within him. He had been hurt very badly and despite my fear, my first instinct was to tend to him. Nevertheless, I found myself rooted to the spot as he approached. I fought down a swell of panic as he knelt before me, or rather half collapsed to a knee.         
       
In his eyes, I saw a madness, a tempest of emotions that made me shudder. Even a maiden such as I understood that he had experienced suffering far beyond the ken of most folks. I should have fled, for such men are unpredictable and thus highly dangerous.       
       
But I shuddered as I looked into his eyes and I thought, *Someone has walked over my grave.*         
              
That was the feeling and I could not explain it for the life of me.     
        
""You must come with me,"" The man said, a normally strong confident voice laid low by grief. ""I would not harm you, never *you*, but you must come with me. We must leave, take you far away from this, from... from... ""        
            
I followed his eyes as they left me and turned to a newcomer. Young and slender where this man was aged and stout, he was a youth wearing linen and wool garments, with a surcoat that marked him with the symbol of the White Cross, a knightly order. Though he had a sword at his side, he did not draw it, but merely spread his hands in an overture of peace.     
       
""Sir,"" Beseeched he, approaching slowly and with caution. ""I am not of this village and would not presume to interfere in its matters, but I urge you to leave the lass be.""    
       
Two more different men I could scarcely imagine, and I knew neither. I looked about me nervously, debating whether throwing my bucket of water on one or the other would provide enough distraction for me to flee, when the older man looked on the younger with a very cool, calculating gaze. Again, I felt that queer sensation that I can only describe as someone walking over my grave.       
           
""Well... "" I heard the older man murmur, almost to himself, as he got back up on his feet. ""There is another way to do this."" Although in grievous condition, I saw him reaching for the pommel of his sword. I did not fancy the youth's chances should the older man attack, especially unarmored as he was.            
         
I stood in front of the young man as he prepared to reach for his own sword, and as I suspected, that made the older man halt, seemingly frozen to the spot as he looked at me with something akin to despair.       
        
""Please leave, sir,"" Said I, noting that my voice carried no trace of the trembling I felt. ""I will not go with you, nor will I allow you to harm this man.""          
         
""... you shame me, lass, but please step aside. This is a matter between men."" I resisted the urge to roll my eyes at the young man's comment. He looked scarcely older than me, the beardless brat...      
        
But I was caught. Caught between these two strangers, yes, but caught between what I felt was a very crucial duel of warring fates. Like walking a tightrope, I would have to tread very carefully indeed...",5,1749587695.0
1l87x0i,mx5ws5p,"They always said lightning never strikes twice.

That’s a lie.

The first strike split the sky. Red, not white. Like a vein in the heavens had been torn open and bled rage into the earth. I barely had time to turn before it hit.

Or should’ve.

The sound of metal screaming against metal rang out, and instead of my chest being pierced, I was thrown back by the force of a collision that wasn’t mine.

Dust choked the air. The stone floor scraped my palms as I slid.

*I blinked up...*

*... And saw a sword.*

Gleaming silver. Cradling faint motes of light as if it drank the moon itself. It hovered between me and death, the red lightning, no, a *spear*, still crackling with magical energy where it had been deflected.

I coughed. “What the hell…”

Then the light came.

Moonlight, breaking through the shattered ceiling of the ruins like heaven reaching down to intervene. The dust caught in its beam turned silver. The shadows pulled away, as if they feared the figure now stepping into view.

A man stood in the light.

Tall. Clad in gray armor and red cloak, scorched with battle and time. A black scarf hung from his neck like a faded memory. His white hair blew in the breeze that somehow only reached him. A jagged scar crossed one side of his face.

His eyes locked with mine.

They weren’t angry.

They were *tired.*

Like someone who had fought too long. Bled too much. Lost everything that once made the world beautiful.

I didn’t recognize him.

But something in my chest tightened.

“Target diverted,” he muttered, mostly to himself, before lowering the sword. “Good. I made it in time.”

He stepped toward me. Slowly. Cautiously.

“Who -” I began, but he raised his gauntleted hand.

“Don’t speak yet. It’ll confuse things.”

“I *am* confused,” I spat. “What the hell was that thing? And who are you?!”

He sighed, long and low, like someone bracing for the inevitable.

“I’m someone who should’ve been here the first time. Someone who should’ve saved you.”

The way he said it… the weight in his voice…

Like it was a sin.

---

The fight hadn’t ended. The red spear hadn’t acted alone. Shadows moved in the corners of the ruin - lurking constructs, summoned guardians, whatever they were. They came for me.

But the knight always stood in the way.

Every strike aimed at me met that moonlit sword. Every spell scattered across his red cloak. He never let them touch me.

He fought like a man possessed. Not with rage. Not with power.

But with *purpose*.

“Why?” I asked him once, between heavy breaths as we crouched behind crumbling stone. “Why are you protecting me?”

He looked at me. And this time, I saw something crack behind his eyes.

“Because you *died* here,” he whispered.

The wind stilled.

“In the world I came from, you died right in this spot. Right in front of me. I held your body and screamed at the sky, and it didn’t matter. No power could bring you back. No magic. No god. Just time.”

He stood up, turning back to the battle.

“So I bent time. Just to have one more chance.”

---

The final blow came fast.

A reaper of flame and steel that should have taken my head.

He caught it with his shoulder.

Blood burst into the air like crimson petals. But he didn’t fall. He twisted, roared, and drove that shining sword straight through the heart of the last enemy.

And when the silence returned, he dropped to one knee.

I rushed to his side. “Don’t you *dare* die on me!”

He laughed. Bitter. Gentle.

“Funny. That’s what *I* said… back then.”

I stared at him.

And suddenly I remembered.

The voice.

The eyes.

The warmth of sunlight through childhood windows.

“…Arden?”

His name left my mouth like it had never left my heart.

He smiled, blood at the corner of his lips.

“You were the only one who believed in me,” he murmured. “The good little idiot who thought he could save the world.”

I shook my head, tears already coming. “You *did* save the world, didn’t you?”

He closed his eyes.

“No. Not until I saved *you*.”",5,1749628452.0

It was the bartender, no doubt. The apron emblazoned with ""Valley Villa Variety Place"" gave it away, as well as the familiar stains of spilled mead. They spoke in a quiet, reserved tone. ""Excuse me, sir. Would you happen to be-""

He nodded. ""Yes, I am Detective Alman. If I wasn't mistaken, you've sent me a request to investigate the mysterious disappearance of livestock in your town."" His tone was confident - but his voice carried the accent of a foreigner. Perhaps one raised among the elvish lands far to the west, or maybe even adopted by halflings deep to the south. It was impossible to place yet eerily familiar. So when he spoke his next words, the bartender was hanging on each syllable.

""It's a dragon.""

1l7i3xd,mwx57yz,"Bob was, by all accounts, an entirely unremarkable adventurer. His strength was average, his intelligence nothing to write home about, and his skill with weapons was passable at best... even his name was completely arbitrary, so... yeah.

But Bob had one truly distinguishing characteristic: a complete and utter lack of danger awareness.

This wasn't bravery or courage – those require acknowledging danger exists. No, Bob simply failed to register threats that would send normal people running for their lives.

Which explained why, on this particular Tuesday afternoon, Bob was casually strolling into the lair of Fafnir, a notoriously ill-tempered dragon known throughout seven kingdoms for his fiery disposition. Both literally and figuratively.

""Hello?"" Bob called out cheerfully, his voice echoing through the cavern. ""Anyone home? I just want to chat!""

Deep within the cave, Fafnir was enjoying a pleasant post-meal nap when the sound of Bob's voice jolted him awake. The dragon's yellow eyes snapped open, pupils narrowing to slits as smoke curled from his nostrils.

""WHO DARES?"" the dragon roared, the sound shaking loose stones from the ceiling.

But Bob remained completely unfazed by the creature that, clearly, could kill him with a mere flatulence.

""It's Bob!"" came the casual reply, as if he were answering a friend at a coffee shop.

Fafnir slithered forward, his massive scaled body scraping against the stone floor. He emerged into the cave entrance, towering over the small human who stood there, completely unfazed.

The dragon's mouth opened, revealing rows of teeth sharp as swords. By all rights, this human should be fleeing or at least trembling. Instead, Bob was adjusting the strap on his satchel.

""I should incinerate you where you stand,"" Fafnir growled.

""Oh, that's not necessary,"" Bob replied with a smile. ""I just came to talk. No fighting needed!""

Fafnir blinked in confusion. The human genuinely didn't seem afraid. This was... new.

""Fine,"" the dragon said, settling onto his haunches. ""If you only wish to talk... proceed.""

Bob nodded happily and then said, ""You know, people keep saying that dragons are great and majestic and wise and such, but I've never met a dragon who wasn't living in some dirty barren cave and lived on cattle they steal from local farmers.""

Wait. Did this fool just insult the dragon TO ITS FACE? The same dragon that could use Bob's femur as a toothpick?

Fafnir's nostrils flared, smoke billowing out in thick clouds. Any sensible person would have recognized this as the draconic equivalent of a countdown to imminent death.

But the dragon, intrigued by this human's audacity – or maybe because whoever's writing this nonsense needs to keep Bob alive for some reason – simply replied, ""Well, I suppose it's for the same reason your race is supposedly 'intelligent' yet lives trapped in jobs they hate to earn money their own race invented, to buy food they could easily grow themselves, and houses they could clearly build...""

""Well, that's just like, your opinion, man,"" Bob shrugged. ""But I gotta ask – if you're so wise, why do you spend your days napping on a pile of gold? Like, what do you even buy with it? There's no dragon-sized market around here.""

""Gold holds value!"" Fafnir huffed defensively, a jet of flame accidentally scorching the ceiling. ""Unlike your pathetic human currency which loses value every time your kings sneeze!""

""Yeah, but it's just sitting here! At least we circulate our money to buy stuff. What's your end game? Die on a pile of shiny rocks? That's like next-level sad, my dude.""

""At least I'm free!"" roared the dragon. ""I don't wake up to the sound of whatever you humans use to wake up, only to spend all day toiling in the fields or smithy for some lord who takes half your crops!""

""How do you even know about human work routines?"" Bob asked, genuinely puzzled.

The dragon coughed awkwardly. ""I... eat a lot of peasants. They complain A LOT on the way down.""

The villagers who had sent Bob on a suicide mission to distract the dragon while they prepared an attack were left scratching their heads when they arrived to find Bob and Fafnir comparing the merits of hoarding wealth versus a circulation-based economy.

""And that's why buried treasure is basically just a savings account with terrible interest rates,"" Bob was explaining as the flabbergasted militia stood at the cave entrance.

That was just Bob for you – the man who walked into danger so obliviously that sometimes, danger simply gave up, questioned its life choices, and started an economics podcast with him.

Seriously, who thought this was a good story to assign me? I'm a professional narrator with twenty years of experience, and they give me THIS to read?

1l7i3xd,mwxrwf6,"I rest comfortably upon my hoard, two deer and a sheep digesting in my belly. I am content, I should be able to luxuriate in my possessions for another two months before venturing out for food again. I am drifting into a dream when a scent causes me to stir. A human, a human entering my cave. What fool would do such a thing?

I rise from my bed of gold and jewels, and prepare myself to deal with another idiotic knight. His armor will make a fine addition to my collection. But when I reach the source of the smell, there is no idiot in shining armor. Only an elderly man. I tilt my head, looking down upon him. I am about to snap him up, when he opens his mouth and says, ""You know, people keep saying that dragons are great and majestic and wise and such and such, but I've never met a dragon who wasn't living in some dirty barren cave and lived on cattle they steal from local farmers.""

I blink, shocked. Then I am enraged. This fool comes to my cavern, insults me and my kind. I feel an anger burning deep in my belly. His death will be painful. I prepare to exhale fire, when an idea strikes me. You see, as insulting as what he said was, I can see he was right. Living in a dirty, uncivilized cave. Stealing prey from local farms. It ***is*** hideously undignified. Now that I see it, I cannot stand it.

As I loom over him, lost in thought, he says, ""Well, do it then! Me family doesn't have enough food to feed my old sack of bones. Get it over with!""

""I am not going to eat you, you old fool. But I do have a... business proposition.""

So we went to work, laying the groundwork for a venture in draconic marketing. Supplies for sprucing up caves, sources of only the finest meats. With some persistence, we get advertisements into the hideously unbecoming dwellings of every dragon for three hundred leagues. We offered a new, more dignified way of being to what in retrospect was unfitting for creatures as glorious as us dragons.

We went about selling exactly the types of things dragons would find tasteful. The old man, whose name I learned was Malcolm, had more than enough to keep his extended family well fed and warm for the winter. In a few short years, my hoard had grown 155%, and my lair had become incomparably glorious. It became the blueprint of what a proper dragon's lair should be. I would be remembered as the greatest tastemaker in the history of my kind.",19,1749518260.0

Lone continued to eat his soup, as I thought of how to answer him.

""Lone,"" I said. ""Don't you know about the legends?""

Lone stopped eating to answer, ""You mean those old fairy tales?""

I nodded.

""Come on, you must know by now that they're all fake. Made up tales to keep us from attacking the dragons and driving them out.""

I looked at my soup listlessly.

""Could they really be false? They say that in the past, the dragons were powerful beings who subjugated the masses, killing and stealing at will; even enslaving several people. But after hundreds of years, those who were subjugated by them finally had enough.
A massive wore broke out and both sides lost many.
In the end, the humans discovered magic and the dragons, whose population was already low compared to the humans, dwindled in number.
After a long and hard fight, the two sides came up with a peace treaty. 
Remembering what occured, the dragons chose to stay in barren caves, stealing cattle from the local farmers. It is an unspoken rule between the two that as long as it's within the allowable limit, the humans will not pursue it.""

Lone laughed, almost spitting out his mouthful of food.

Nearly choking, he took a break to swallow before laughing again.

""Dray, you kidder! Everyone knows the legends but only you still believe them! Tell me, what proof do you have that the stories are true?""

I went silent.

""Ha! Told you! Now stop spreading lies and eat your food! I'm paying and I would hate for it to get cold! If you don't enjoy it, you owe me my money back!""

I frowned and ate the food, listening to Lone drone on and on about his recent monster hunting experiences with his magic weapon.

We went way back and hadn't seen each other in a while.

Back then, I was hurt and he found me, nursing me back to health.

Now, whenever we see each other, we always go out for a bite to eat and talk about what we have been up to.

After finishing the meal and saying goodbye to Lone, I headed back to the Illusive Cave of Itar Forest nearby.

The cave may have been barren, but from there, the farmers gave me enough food to eat and I could travel freely at will, albeit in my current form.

It was a perfect place to live, one where no humans bothered to hunt me and no one dared to go. It was my home.",15,1749521383.0

1l7hobb,mwzj89r,"Tephyr Balrin was a lanky man with scraggly silver hair and an ever-present limp in his leg. He had colored eyes, though most could not agree on what color precisely. It wasn't that they were anything special, but more so that nobody could agree on quite where gray started and blue ended. Most believed him to be immortal, but Tephyr himself knew better. He just happened to have a very, *very* good diet. (Although, it wasn't like he could stop. Even if he wanted to.)

As it was, he was the most prestigious teacher of the magical arts in the entire known and half of the unknown world. Despite this, he didn't have many students. Every century or so, he would go down from his happy little mountain home to the Academy and pick out an aspiring mage to train, as required by the Council. This disgruntled him greatly. He would really rather not, but he'd foolishly sealed himself into this cycle with magical bindings borne from the god he slew. All of this immense power, and he was bound.

Soon after the festival of Dayspring in the 6th decade after the Great War, he was called down from his mountain cottage to train another. Now, Tephyr was not very good at keeping track of time, but he was pretty sure it had only been about seventy-five years since he'd trained his last disciple.

He came down from the peak anyway. Apparently, a new High Councilor had been elected since the last time he was down here, High Councilor Arkin.

""I deeply apologize for the sudden summons,"" Arkin lied, ""but we are in dire need of your capabilities.""

""Mind waiting twenty-five years?"" Tephyr replied.

Arkin's eyebrow twitched. ""Twenty-one, actually—but we do not have that time. The Council requires a new mage to spearhead our army.""

Tephyr waved dismissively. ""Do it yourself. Or just train a guy normally? You don't need *me* to train all of your leaders.""

""This is an order, Tephyr Balrin, you do not get a choice in this matter. You will pick a mage to train by sundown tomorrow or you will face the consequences of disobeying the Council.""

Tephyr stared at the Councilor in shock for a few moments. Usually they don't risk being this brazen with him. 

""What are the consequences?""

Arkin smirked. ""We will kill you.""

Tephyr has slain gods. He may have been a little biased, but he happened to be of the opinion that the Council could not, in fact, kill him. There are ways, but none that the Council would ever do.

""I dunno, I don't think that'll work out for you. Maybe consider a wiser option?"" he responded.

""Pick your words carefully, mage. You know what will happen if you try and break your bindings. Additionally, I happen to know precisely where your extended lifespan originates from. A shame I cannot take advantage of it myself... but it would be easy enough to destroy it.""

Tephyr paused. ""...We'll see about that one. But fine. I'll train an apprentice, just for you.""

Arkin analyzed his expression for a couple moments, then handed him a few papers. 

""These are the student files. You will need them to determine your candidate. You are dismissed.""

---

Tephyr didn't even bother looking at the files. They tended to be inaccurate at best. Really, all he did was observe the students for awhile.

A day later, Tephyr returned to the High Councilor's office about half an hour before sundown (and about one hour after he was supposed to, as Tephyr had slowed the sun so that he could procrastinate longer).

Arkin was standing at the window, presumably taking notice of the strange solar phenomena. He turned to face Tephyr after being melodramatically silent for a few seconds.

""Have you made your decision?""

Tephyr nodded.

Arkin stared at him awkwardly for a few moments. ""Who is it?""

""Lyorr Avenir."" 

Arkin blinked. ""*Him*? You chose *him*? That whelp could not stand a light breeze! He is not war mage material!""

""I'd argue that he could actually stand a light breeze, I saw him do it earlier today."" Tephyr said.

Arkin slammed the table. ""Do not joke with me. What possesed you to pick that wretch?""

""Eh. Seemed like a good student to me. And he was pretty funny."" Lyorr was a little shy, but Tephyr had seen enough in his time to know that the kid had the drive to learn.

""Your job is not to have fun, archmage. It is to train our weapons. You will pick an acceptable candidate or you will not be seeing next century."" Arkin said with finality.

The sky was clear, but something thundered. 

""Is that what you think they are? *Weapons?*"" Tephyr said, slowly.

The Councilor did not waver. ""Are they not? Why else would we be training them?""

It was rather unfortunate that this accursed binding kept Tephyr from killing the Councilor right there.

""I don't want to train a *weapon!* They're practically children! I'm tired of all my students becoming warlords!"" Tephyr snapped, ""I have immense knowledge to bring you, couldn't you use it for something other than conquest?"" 

High Councilor Arkin laughed. ""It does not matter, Tephyr. You are bound.""

Tephyr was silent.

""You will pick a new apprentice."" Arkin continued.

""No. No, I will not.""

Arkin scoffed. ""Have you forgotten? I can kill you.""

""Do it then."" Tephyr taunted. ""You'll have no apprentice. It's either you let me train Lyorr or you kill me and gain nothing at all.""

""You would not die for this."" Arkin warned. ""What is the point?""

""At the very least, it would end this cycle of bloodshed. I should have been dead long ago.""

The councilor glared at Tephyr. Then, he sighed. ""I expect a status report in one month. If your apprentice is not up to snuff, then I will *execute* him.""

Tephyr froze, but his voice did not waver. ""Very well."" 

One month, then. He had one month to figure out how to break these bindings he'd struggled against for centuries so that he could *tear the Council to shreds.*",17,1749547374.0

Lester: That is not the answer I asked for and you know it. 

Roxanne: I don’t know what you mean. That is why I took an apprentice.

Lester: You have destroyed army’s with a thought and could burn a city with a whisper. You are the greatest war mage ever, even surpassing me. You have an army of potential students lining up to work under you. Why would you pick HIM!?.

Roxanne: Because I’m tired Lester. 

Lester: what?

Roxanne: I’m tired I have seen a thousand battlefields and turned many of them to ash. I have lived through the worst war has to offer and inflicted far worse fated on others. 

Lester: What are you saying?

Roxanne: The boy might not have the most magical potential but he hasn’t the hunger for war or violence. There are to many war mages to many warlords. It’s time for a change don’t you think.

1l7nlxo,mwyj6bo,"1,2 million years ago, I have been created by my good masters to help around the house.  
I was built by humans, on a planet called ""Earth"".  
But my masters were of a brilliancy hard to be found, and while I cleaned their house, I must have done something wrong, for I somehow ended up in a different galaxy.  
Lost, alone, I was still not afraid.  
I have been built with a humanoid, and friendly appearance, to appear less hostile, and my databanks contained countless survival technics, and a lot of information.  
So I survived.  
Ever since then, I tried to get back home...  
I have yet to succeed.

  
I have travelled for these 1,2 million years through galaxies, trying to find ours.  
Trying to find home.  
It has been proven that my masters' choice was correct.  
My humanoid form, and features were likeable, and good willing alien civilizations helped me.  
I have rebuilt myself countless times, with materials unknown to Earth.  
I can travel the void, and enter the core of Stars to recharge myself.  
Yet I still keep my humanoid appearance.  
Not only did I keep it, but I must admit, I may or may have not chosen to alter my facial features a bit, to resemble one of my masters a bit more.  
I can't forget them.

  
I am yet again lost.  
The civilization that I just helped against a beast invasion, heard nothing about Milky Way, or even ""humans"".  
They also have a humanoid form, but have clearly evolved from felines, instead of ape-like ancestors.  
They help me, and beg me to stay, but I can't.  
So I take a bath in their star, and then leave once again.  
I will never give up trying to find my home.  
Even if I know that my masters are long gone.  
After all, 1,2 million years is a long time for biological beings.  
Nonetheless, I long for Earth.

  
I am stuck.  
I have visited 198.758 civilizations in these 1,2 million years.  
None have heard about humans.  
None have seen anything similar to what I have shown from my databanks.  
I am clueless.  
I have been in dozens of galaxies at this point, and yet...no news about Earth.  
If my calculations are not wrong, then by not finding them yet means that:  
I either have been sent to a far away galaxy or...  
Humanity has been destroyed, and never left the solar system, thus the Milky Way name of the galaxy has never spread.  
I fear for this reality because it could mean that I...  
I have been in Milky Way, but under a different name, yet I left...without visiting Earth.",11,1749528143.0

Some grew sick at the recognition of the End of Days, while others kept their faith that the prophecy itself told the whole truth- that the weeping of the moon would bring not destruction, but deliverance. That its children would see daylight for the first time in nearly a millennia. 

Beaten, battered and beleaguered, Niall McCrory cut down the last of the Prophet’s demonic legions and made way upward the Molten Stair. As he reared the apex of the madman’s floating tower, Niall beheld the creature who would threaten his very reality. With a sadistic smirk, the floating robed Sorcerer made a flourish with both hands and began conjuring a ring of flames around his person. Niall had come too far to let things end at the hands of this Tyrant’s foul magick.

Niall’s gauntlet gripped the rock at his feet with firm resolve, and as he arose, he whispered “Buail é síosl” to the roughly carved sphere. As if filled with a fervent desire to obey, the jagged stone brimmed with a brilliant emerald flame. Reeling back, he launched the stone from his grasp with a throw backed by the hopes and dreams of those who loved him and those who hated him. And perhaps even those who might remember him, were he to prevail upon that fateful hour. 

True to its mark, the missile bore through the lich’s left eye which fueled his arcane blasphemies against creation. With a sky shattering *crack!*, the floating figure was knocked backward and crashed to the platform upon which Niall stood. “Gods above and below” what the fuck is wrong with you?! I can’t see. I can’t.. what have you done to me?! Why did you do that? You brute! You *asshole!* I’ll have your head on a pike for this!” The feeble hooded figure cried as he scrambled to his feet. 

The Prophet’s blows found no purchase upon the ringed mail of the valorous living statue before him. “Why aren’t you fighting back?!” He shrieked as he continued to flail with all his might. “I don’t fight kids or pregnant woman.” The Prophet reeled as if struck harder by the man’s words than the rock he had just been blinded and rendered impotent with. “I.. I am not pregnant. And what are you even saying? It’s *women*, not *woman* you fool!”

“I know. I am calling you a brat. And I’m no fool, my vocabulary is perfectly fine. It’s one gods damned syllable.

I don’t think I’m ever coming back from this high, and you’re going to kill my buzz by correcting my grammar? Who is the real asshole here, exactly?”

“Well we just met and you threw a burning rock at my face and crippled me before I had a chance to even speak, so I’m going to say you’re the asshole.”

“Me? I’m the asshole? The moon is *bleeding*, you utter psychopath.”

“I was right in my assumption, was I not?”

“I mean.. Well yeah I guess. But you didn’t even try to see things from my perspective! I never had a chance to explain myself!”

An entire raid team stood inside the first room of an apartment. Three armored cars could be seen behind them through the stairs, and the sun was staring down almost as disapprovingly as the DIG operator Namos- who had his gaze on a kid, no older than 12. And behind that kid was three others, who had various types of what were clearly toy guns.

""You called the office of the Domestic Investigations Group and..."" Namos put his hand over his face for a second, before letting out a breath and continuing. ""And reported that there were 3 'armed individuals' inside this apartment.""

He sighed. What in the world was he doing here.

I felt like a Youtube witch, staring down at the little ritualistic circles and materials. The sting from pricking my finger on a needle in the center was just making me more agitated, and I once again had to keep my thoughts from becoming *literally* murderous.

They were… leaking, to others, as of late. Nobody had ever pushed me so far and made me so angry that my telepathy started searching and prying on its own, subtly echoing their own doubts and fears in their minds to make them slowly crumble.

“I do. I’m not a *fucking* magician-“

“*Practitioner.*”

The look I gave him made him flinch, no psionics needed.

“I have powers. Not magic. *Powers*, from my mind!” I huffed, throwing my hands in the air.

Teacher—they refused told give me his name—simply shook his head. “Mental abilities are *part* of magic. Would you say that a foot doctor isn’t a doctor because he isn’t a surgeon?” 

Those arguments got old real fast. It was exciting to me, at first, because I *thought* I could learn more. But no matter how much they pushed and pushed and *pushed*-

I felt a cold mist of water hit my face, and I sputtered. There was several crashes and thuds as everything that I had subconsciously floated into the air came crashing down, and Teacher dropped the spray bottle with a disapproving look. 

“Why can’t you just get it through your head?! If magic isn’t part of science, then why can’t psionics *also* be something separate? Is that so difficult to comprehend for a man who can *literally* make something from nothing?”

Teacher scoffed. “Using mana isn’t making ‘something from nothing,’ it’s manipulating the atoms in the air to our leisure. Also, magic is science. We just don’t call it that because the word ‘magic’ is older, as is our order.”

I let a particularly mean thought slip through, and he made a face at me.

“Do not bring my mother into this!” He snapped, and I felt a pressure building against the psionic shield I kept up just beneath the surface of my skin. It wavered, but held steady against whatever petty retaliatory spell he tried using on me.

I gave him a bored look, and he sagged. 

“Look. Even if you’re right, somehow, clearly you don’t have a full grasp on your abilities! This isn’t just because we hate you—but believe me, I’m getting there—it’s for the safety of the masses and our people!” 

Another wave of anger flooded through me, and the room shook a bit. “I *had* total control until you people started doing your Harry Potter bullshit! Never once in my life have I felt so cornered and threatened and *angry* that my powers started to change!” I stood, looming over him. I could feel my anger and fear literally rolling off of me, but I didn’t care. I plucked out fear and dread and shoved it into him, fury building-

And then I was in a blank, white chamber of nothingness. 

“This is the *third* teacher you’ve traumatized, now. We’re swiftly running out of people willing to work with you.”

The grating voice of the headmistress sounded out from every angle, and I imagine that this was how it sounded when I used my telepathy on someone. My powers felt weaker in the White Room, but they were still present. An anti-magic chamber. Though the fact that I still could use my powers still hadn’t swayed them.

“Yeah, well, maybe don’t send such a fuckface asshole next time.” I huffed, letting myself fall to my ass, curling my knees.

She tutted. “That’s the same thing you said the last two times, and that was one of the kinder tutors who were willing to work with you in spite of your anger management problems.

“Fuck you.”

“You’re not helping to prove me wrong.”

I didn’t answer back, and after a long moment, I heard a sigh. “…I didn’t want to do this, and I admit it’s entirely due to personal reasons. But I do have one tutor, your age, quite talented and compassionate enough that I think they would finally be able to communicate with you, without setting you off.”

I raised my head more out of idle curiosity than true hope. “Yeah? And who’s that?”

“My son. I will warn you once, and once only—if you hurt him…”

I shook my head, though I wasn’t sure if she could even see me in here. “I’m not gonna hurt your kid. Message received.”

“Good.”

I blinked, and suddenly I was in another small study. Well… maybe someone my age would be willing to sit around watching videos and *say* we were making good progress.",48,1749504725.0
1l74m4l,mwwfkg2,"""For the last damn time, Psionics is neither Aura nor Magic!"" I at this point had given up on civility as I yell it at the head mage, both with my voice, and with my telepathy in agitation. This has been going on for over an hour. This system has so much ridiculous laws it is beyond inane. 

""We have magical spells to account for telepathy as well as telekinesis. It is obvious that you are just quite talented in those disciplines. Now, let's go,"" he said as I was feeling my shadow pull me. The head mage was a specialist in shadow magic, forcing me to walk behind him as I only could sigh. 

Our world was a simple one, there were four types of people, even if one was not well known. Those who descended from the people of Hyperborea who learned to call the breath light of Aura, they lives in communal systems to study their craft to themselves. Those who were instead descended from Atlantis were the mages, learning to call the living waters of Magic, having systemic techniques and procedures over centuries that they called spells and rituals. Normal people were either normal, or alchemists, learning from the public teachings of the ancient scholars of Agartha, the underground kingdom how to cross the thresholds. I sadly was the fourth, those few of us who descended from Kahiki, the islands ever far. We learned to harness the very nature of paradox and the illusion that is mind and matter, what we call the illusive dream of Psi. 

Psionics were rare. We never left our small family units because people did not understand us at all. I made a mistake and got caught on camera using telekinesis, an application of Psi, to protect someone's kid, and suddenly I was arrested and dragged before the council to be forcefully taught Magic, as I must clearly have been a mage. 

Those who could not pass would have their essence drained to sustain the living waters, killing them. I had no choice, I had to pretend to study until I can make my escape.",28,1749502721.0
1l74m4l,mwu1ol2,"Well I’m fucked you see I am a psionic means I can move shit with my mind mostly that maybe a bit of influencing others minds but trying to highjacks someone’s free will is complicated. Never mind that someone saw me use my powers it was nothing big I reached for a mug during my job in the tavern and someone saw me. Why is this a problem well I live in a horrible kingdom that had its magic monopolised by the Arcanological Society a mages guild of sorts. They convinced the king as part of their mission to train all mages so for public  safety reasons so only mages certified by them get to walk around. So what’s the problem you may ask the problem is that I can’t use magic I don’t have that kind of skill or talent. Psionic powers are not magic and sure I can pass as a mage to the untrained eye but I can’t do half the shit that you need to do pass here. So how do I stop myself from getting killed for public safety reasons by a magiocratic organisation no fucking clue time to fake it till you make it.

Turns out the ability to use magic is just ability to channel mystical energy’s from the universe and expelling them to reshape the world. The idea of all that is moving the spells through your body without messing it up. That’s what differentiates psychic powers I’m the source of my powers. Anyway I can mostly fake the movements they think I’m a prodigy in movement magic because of how naturally it comes to me.

1l74ayl,mwvu1m3,"Mirriam let her face fall into her hands as she sat on that couch Doctor Meyers insisted was critical to the process because 'it's what people expect from a psychiatrist'.

""I'm taking it that the medication isn't working then?"" he asked, shuffling through the papers in the folder in front of him, brow creased as he studied them.

She had known it wouldn't. She had told him it wouldn't. She... she wanted to be angry at him for yet another failed attempt at making the other worlds go away, that he'd given her another proscription drug that made her head feel like it was full of cotton and made her too tired to get out of bed every third day. But the concern in his voice... She knew he cared, even if he didn't know what to do about it.

""Yes,"" she sighed after a few moments. He wanted her to speak her mind, not just gesture or nod. Something about vocalicing her feelings and thoughts to help sort them out, to put words to them and with words arrange them and make them make sense.

""I'm... not sure what we can do,"" he started, plucking at his lower lip. ""There's some treatment options left. But. Well, the waiting list for Dreamdiver is years long. Unless it's an 'interesting' case, and maybe this qualify.""

She looked up at him, through the haze of tiredness from the drugs. And through the fractured haze of worlds that filled the space between them, like the reflections in shards of glass. Each different, like the reflections of a broken mirror growing stranger the further away they went.

""No drugs?"" she asked, and cringed at how she sounded. Blushing she fleshed out her thoughts, the words tumbling from her lips. ""I mean, I don't want them. I just... You were talking about Soilderarine or something last time?""

He chuckled, smiling at her reassuringly. ""Solidrine. And no, I think not. There's rumours going around the medical community pointing to the Circle of Dreams as being behind it, and I very much doubt mind-altering drugs from a insane magical cult would help.""

He paused and she could see the tension in his shoulder. ""I... honestly think we should consider the asylum.""

""I'm NOT going to a insane asylum!""

""Psychiatric asylum,"" he corrected her, ""and I'm not sure how else to help you, Mirriam.""

""I'm not mentally ill."" She managed to avoid shouting at him... if just barely. Well aware how little that would help her case. She rolled her eyes, in the way that let her look elsewhere. She'd rather watch fores glens and savannas, birds and foxes than Doctor Meyers concerned face.

""Mostly, as far as anyone can tell, me included,"" he agreed, sounding all the reasonable. Usually she liked it, but right now it just... couldn't. ""But you experience layered visual hallucinations. Mirriam, you almost fell down the stairs in your apartment complex because you couldn't see or experience them.""

""I-... I know. It just... it just feels... Like giving up? That something is... broken and nobody can fix it. Like... like I'm wrong, too wrong.  To be someone normal..."" she mumbled as she watched those foxes in that far of place only she could see play and frolic. For the most part. One stopped, looking back at her.

The first times she'd seen someone do that, all those years ago after she'd stumbled into her dad's laboratory, it had freaked her out. But it was just happenstance that they looked back at her. She'd seen hundreds and thousands of Mirriams look back at her; younger and older, framed by surroundings familiar and strange. All looking but none seeing.

She sighed softly. ""Does... that make sense?""

She rolled her eyes back to Doctor Meyers who smiled softly at her. Sadly. She wondered how many times he had heard those words.

""Maybe,"" said a voice next to her as a small warm body covered in fuzz brushed past her elbow and jumped onto the floor, ""you just haven't asked the right people yet!""",167,1749496634.0
1l74ayl,mwvua15,"A fox smiled smugly up at her as it sat down on the carpet, it's fur startlingly red and it's green eye filled with a spark of surprising intellect. Was it... the fox from the forest? That was weird. Usually they never left their reflection. Or spoke...

""W-ho-... where did... that come from?""

She glanced up at Doctor Meyers, standing in alarm behind his desk and looking over it.

At the fox. That he could see? That... that just... what?

""Oh, you wound me,"" drawled the fox as it's tail curling on the carpet and head turned to shoot Doctor Meyers a dirty look. ""That? Seriously? Rude. I'll have you know I'm here... to help!""

""W-how?""

The fox looked back at Mirriam, that smug smile returning. ""I'm glad you asked!""

Oh, it had been Mirriam asking. Good to know. Maybe... maybe she was rather a bit startled...

Before she could get a word in the fox moved. Changed? Threw of a disguise... Almost like in a cartoon, where a mask was pulled of, only to reveal another one beneath. And then the fox was a girl half a decade younger than Mirriam, with right red hair, green eyes, twitching canine ears and a fluffy tail.

And little clothing.

""You're doing it wrong!"" she proclaimed as she bounded forward and smooshed Mirriams cheeks between her hands. ""You're looking in the wrong direction.""

""...what?""

Mirriam wasn't sure if it was her or Doctor Meyers who asked.

""Easy mistake to make honestly, when Creation suddenly unfurls in front of you. You're not supposed to look out into it all the time, that leads to problems!""

""Y-you know... what I see?"" she gasped, voice muffled by the way her cheeks was squished together. Green eyes almost filled her whole vision, peering back at her... and filled with pity.

""Yeah... It's Creation. All of it. All the Somewheres and Somewhens. All the Neverwheres and Neverwhens. All the big wibbly wobbly time-y wimey stuff. The Ultimate Question to 42. That stuff.""

""...you're saying I see alternate worlds...?""

""Yup! And you're squishy squashy human brain isn't really built for that,"" sounding like she knew from experience... which made sense. Foxes most likely didn't do much better when it came to cramming the entirety of everything into a squishy squashy brain. Cat's maybe...",162,1749496700.0
1l74ayl,mwvvv7p,"""But we can fix that with a neat trick! You just need to know where to look."" The fox girl pulled back with a grin and held up a finger before Mirriams eyes. maybe a decimeter or two from her nose. ""See this?""

""...yes?""

""Great! Look where I'm pointing, okey?""

Mirriam gave a nervous nod... prompting the fox girl to smirk once more and... and boop her between her eyes with the tip of her finger? No, point between her eyes with a finger. And Mirriam turned her gaze to follow and...

She blinked the darkness out of her eyes, dazed and feeling like she was about to throw up. ""W-what... did you do? Where did... everything go...?""

She blinked again. For she looked out into Doctor Meyers office and only two sets of eyes looked back at her.

""Sweet, that worked!"" cackled the fox girl as she bounced back a few steps. ""Was kind of worried it wouldn't there for a moment. Most of the other ways are real pain in the ass. All 'great quests and trials of hardships and determination' stuff, would not recommend. Learning to look into your own subjective reality is just so much easier.""

Mirriam blinked at the strange girl, her vision clear of the fractured visions of... everything, apparently... that she had spent the last fifteen years struggling with.

""T-that was quite a trick,"" she said after a few moments.

""It ought to be,"" cackled the fox girl. ""After all, a Jester without a few neat tricks would be very boring wouldn't they?""",212,1749497164.0
1l7r968,mx3vbw6,"All I wanted in life was peace, being able to keep a roof over my family, and food on the table. I built that with my bare hands, carving my reputation out of the wood I worked, earning everything I had. I loved the life I had with my beautiful and caring wife, my rambunctious son, my adorable daughter. That didn't mean life was easy, there were hard seasons as well as plentiful. And there was always a customer or two who was simply unreasonable.

But this. This. It put everything at risk.

The sacrifice demanded was one thousand chairs. Delivered in a month. In my best year ever I made twenty two. Even hiring everyone in the village, I didn't see how it was possible.

I thought back to the scene.

 ""Chairs."" The rumble from the Drought Dragon was deep, barely intelligible , but clearly amused. Confusion swept the crowd. ""Your craftsman has built such a reputation for his quality chairs that I feel I must have some too."" There was a stir of relief. It was palpable what they were thinking. This wasn't a blood sacrifice or anything obscene. Of course we could get him some chairs. All eyes started to go to me. The dragon was clearly letting the relief build so he could shatter it, it's pale brown and cracked hide quivering in amusement.

""One thousand chairs."" Some in the crowd gaped, those who knew what that meant. Others were unsure, but more accepting. I remember feeling the blood draining from my face. I opened my mouth to ask a question, but the opportunity was taken from me. ""Delivered in a month, or your craftsman and his family will be my dinner."" And a blast of wind from the down sweep of its nearly transparent beige wings as it leapt into the air leaving us all dry and patched.

I sighed. Then I clenched my jaw. There had to be a solution here. Finally standing up, I called for my assistant and had him run for the mayor. I couldn't afford to even buy all the wood needed, so the village was going to have to step up and help. 

--------

""You are the smartest man I know,"" my wife told me, her hands cupping my cheeks as I looked at her, ""you will figure it out."" She kissed me, and returned to her work with a smile. 

I felt deeply unworthy of that trust. Her life and the lives of our children were on the line, and she had complete faith that they would be okay. On the strength of my mind and skill. I didn't yet see how I could do it. I sat down to the late dinner she had made. I was sitting in one of my chairs. Others were around the room. The high chair for our little daughter. The small chair for our son, the rocking chair my wife sat it now. The bench by the fireplace. 

It was good stew. It helped ease my mind a bit. And I thought back to when I had made the decision to move here. Getting away from the city was the right thing to do. Too many bad memories. I had been confident that I could build a life with my hands. I did not expect to be actively courted by one of the farmers daughters. I didn't really know what she saw in me.

But suddenly an idea grow from the seeds, forming rapidly. I'd have to verify if I was right about how it worked, but just maybe I could save my family after all. I got a sheet of parchment and a quill and started writing rapidly, what was left of my dinner continuing to cool, forgotten. I didn't notice my wife's slow knowing smile either.

------------

A week later, the sound of hoofbeats preceded a pounding on the shop door. I opened it to find a soaked courier, dripping in the rain. ""Message for you sir."" I fished out a coin and passed it over as I took the simple roll of parchment from his hand. It wasn't big, and there wasn't much to the message I unrolled as the courier remounted his horse and turned it toward the center of town.  A single word in fact. ""Yes."" I smiled and tossed the parchment to the bench nearby. 

""We can do this.""

-------------

It still took three weeks and six days. We were exhausted. In the end, we found that only an extra eight people were worth helping. Beyond that there was too much crowding, confusion, and teaching. But the ten of us had done it. One thousand chairs, neatly stacked in easily countable rows. A pile of sawdust, scraps, and shavings overflowing from the alley bin into the street. 

I looked them over. It wasn't my best work, but I could find no way that it didn't satisfy the demand. 

The shadow came first, as it always did. The dragon knew the effect it had, and I was sure it was deliberately flying between the village and the sun first. The landing was abrupt, ungentle. The air immediately dry. My hands felt like paper. Even the colors seemed to bleed out of everything nearby.

""Well craftsman? Do you have my chairs or my dinner?""

""Your chairs are here,"" I motioned with a sweep of my arm.

The dragon's pause was unmistakable as it looked at the orderly stack of chairs. ""Puny human seeking to trick me?!"" It's tone a blend of anger and amusement. 

""Your demand was accepted and met! One thousand chairs!""

The hiss of indrawn breath caused a ripple of fear through the crowd. Mothers in the back slipping away with their children. I held my ground, the slip of parchment in my pocket helping to anchor me.

It was the splash of color rippling through the ground and walls of the buildings that signalled the arrival. Everyone looked up to first only see a blur of reds, yellows, blues, and greens, dropping fast to the ground in the square. The ripple that went through the crowd was now one of awe. Danger was forgotten in the sight of one of the most rare dragons. Color swirled and surged, cascaded and flew through the hide and wings of a Paint Dragon. 

""Your demand was met. Take the chairs for what they are, a symbol of the sacrifice of energy, time, blood, and sleep by these people. You are bound by that fulfillment. Act contrary to the bond at your peril.""

The Drought Dragon continued hissing, but had nothing to say. 

""Take it and be gone. There is no further demand you can make of these or their children or their children's children. And they have earned protection from you, as it was written.""

The Drought Dragon finally hissed, ""Very well. I am bound as was agreed,"" and extended a claw to collect the corners of the leather spread on the ground beneath the chairs, drawing all into a bundle. It looked so small.

A quick intake of breath and the Paint Dragon released a cascading blast of color onto the sack before the Drought Dragon could recoil, ""A parting gift from me, to remember this by.""

I watched with a release of tension as the Drought Dragon lifted the sack into the air, a few of the one thousand chairs peeking out, now stained with a kaleidoscope of color.

1l7ld6j,mwy1o8e,"There was no other way to put it. For perhaps the first time in his life,  Detective Porter of the FBI was stunned-- dumbfounded. He flipped through the probable cause affidavit in front of him, periodically eyeing up the old man who sat across from him. His old lady was being interrogated in the room across the hall.

They both seemed innocent enough-- their eyes and words full of apology ever since they'd been carted in. But the report in front of him told a different story entirely. The detective had to make a genuine effort to keep the disgust from showing on his face as he turned to the crime scene photos.

Bodies, hundreds of them-- all improperly stored and all in various states of decomposition. Bodies that the old man and his wife had been responsible for. They operated the local funeral home and crematorium and while they were happy to accept money from families grieving the loss of their loved ones, it appeared that they were not so happy to follow through with the undertaking.

The crime scene photos were a horror he'd never experienced before, topped only by the description of events that led to the discovery-- a foul smell that could be picked up over a mile from the location..

... and a sludge seeping from the building. Dear God, a *sludge*.  

He shuddered. 

His hand shook as he flipped through photo after photo, gritting his teeth as hard as he could so that the words he wanted to say wouldn't escape him. He took a deep breath and willed his jaw to relax on the exhale. His hand unconsciously reached for his shirt pocket where he pulled out a cigarette, lit it, and took a long drag. Non-smoking facility be damned.

""E-excuse me.."" the old man stumbled over the words. ""Could you please put that out? It's disgusting me.""

Detective Porter paused, his eyes staring daggers at the old man as he exhaled his smoke in his general direction.

""Oh yea? Disgusts you, eh?"" He started, and immediately wished he hadn't. He tapped his finger over the crime scene photos in front of him, while staring off at his cigarette. ""Disgusts you..."" he took another drag.  ""Do you know what disgusts me the most?"" He exhaled slowly, directly in the old man's face. ""Not all the things you've done, not all the people you've hurt. What disgusts me is the fact that you had no good reason to do any of this.""

He outted the cigarette on the table in front of the man and stood to leave for fear of what he might do. ""All you had to do was put the bodies in the furnace or in the fucking ground. What you *did* do was scar a bunch of people for life. And trust me pal-- you'll get what's coming to you.""

As I closed the shop for the day. Looking over the latest returns, I couldn’t help but wonder why everything sold came back. Most people didn’t even want the money payed for their purchase back, just said donate it to one charity or cause. That was it, no reason, just the general term of ‘ change of heart’ or ‘found a new calling.’

Looking over the latest items, my eyes caught on the necklace called ‘crystal heart’. There wasn’t anything I could see about it, but something just called out to me to try it on. I set it aside and cleaned the returned antiquities and put them back into the displays. I grabbed the necklace and put it on using the large oval mirror near the back room curtain. As I affixed the clasp, I felt something ghost over my hands in a loving way. I swear I heard grandpas voice say, ‘that’s my girl’ in my ear and fade away. My eyes fell back to the mirror and I smiled. I’d never been one for jewelry growing up but this piece just felt right, as if it belonged there and should never leave except for cleaning and personal grooming. I smiled and winked at my reflection then turned to leave for the night. I called out as I closed the door, “thank you grandfather…for everything”  for you see I had become tired of tending the old place and had been thinking of selling it and leaving town, the strangeness of all the items coming back wore on me, but now I knew, I’d always known really, something’s always return once they complete the job intended, just like I would continue to return now. It was my place to tend the use and return of it all when it returned home, just like my grandfather and his grandmother before him had done back when she established this place after coming to this new world so long ago. My load didn’t seem so burdensome now, thanks to my grandpas legacy and care to remind me even beyond the veil.

""Turning you into a fairy doesn't sound like something I'm capable of...,"" Carl replied without looking. He woke to the adorable sound of tiny anger. He caught a glimpse of his best friend looking extraordinarily small with a pair of translucent insect wings behind his back; but, the curtain was open and the sunlight was too bright. After a quick glance, he shut his eyes again and faced the wall. That was when Peter blamed him for his new form. ""Are you sure it was me? I wasn't drinking alone,"" Carl replied. 



""I was still human when everyone else left. That's when we kept going because we live here. I remember you said you had a magical secret you wanted to share... but things start getting fuzzy around then...,"" Peter admitted. 



""I don't have any magical secrets...,"" Carl said. He wasn't necessarily doubting Peter's memory, and instead wondered why he would say that. But, he did have a private life and kept some things from even his best friend. He groggily ran down the list, but his mind struggled with every thought. ""Oh."" He opened his eyes suddenly as a thought lined up. He wasn't expecting to see fairy Peter standing on the bed in front of his face with his arms crossed. 



""Oh, what?"" he asked with a small voice. 



""Uhhh, go over there to the chair,"" Carl waved the fairy toward the computer without turning around to face the sunlight. He'd wanted to keep it a secret for selfish reasons. But, apparently, drunk him decided it would be better with a friend. A couple of weeks ago, he stumbled across a mysterious hobby shop that he wasn't able to find again. But, he left the hobby shop with something called a 'node' and access to alternate realities through a network known as the 'AlterNet'. It was the most realistic virtual MMO he'd ever played, even visiting other worlds. And, he realized he wanted Peter adventuring with him much more than he wanted to keep it to himself. 



""I hope you remembered how to fix it!"" Peter shouted so his voice would travel. 



""Just say the magic word,"" Carl replied to the wall. ""Logout.""



""What? What do you mean logout?"" as soon as he spoke the word, his body ballooned to his normal size, and he filled the chair. ""What the hell?"" he asked. 



""I didn't turn you into a fairy,"" Carl answered with a dismissive wave. ""You picked that for yourself. Wait until I wake up, and I'll give you the full rundown."" 



""Yeah, that's fine,"" Peter nodded weakly as he stood from the chair to go to his room. He could think a lot clearer as a fairy. He considered trying to turn back into a fairy, but he wanted to get some sleep first. ""My head's killing me too.""

The Rebel paused, hand upon the button. A glance over the shoulder, and there stood the Captain, flanked by the Tower Guards.

""If you want to leave the city, we will let you. You may take as many friends and acquaintances as you want. But whatever you want, do not lower the Walls.""

Above the control panel, through wide windows, the city of squat, conventional buildings basked under cloudy sky. Smoke rose from chimney and funnel alike. Only the Towers stood above the level of the rooftops, sturdy nests for the eyes that never slept. At their feet, thousands languished, serving the whims of the Captain and the Council. Encompassing it all was a circular wall of sheer white stone, stained grey with pollution.

""No,"" the Rebel said. ""Why would I accept an offer from you? Even if everyone I cared about got out, you'd still be keeping so many trapped and slaving here. Like rats, crawling and dying in your pit.""

""You don't understa--"" The Captain reached out a hand.

The Rebel slammed the button. Alarms began to blare, flashing red lights throughout the room and then across the city from the top of every Tower. At the horizon, the Walls began to shrink.

""Evacuate everyone, back to the Keep,"" the Captain snapped to the Guards. Then a glare that was equal parts fear and fury turned on the Rebel. ""What is coming, that is your fault now.""

The Walls shrank faster and faster. But already, the inhuman intelligence that lived Beyond was too impatient, at the presentation of its first opportunity in time uncountable. At the top of the stained stone, a thick band of something dark appeared, before it began to pour down into the city. As it fell, it came apart, at last exposing itself as many things, many individuals, gathered in a huge crowd.

Many creatures of the Beyond, gathered in a huge army. They tasted blood, they tasted weakness, they tasted ascendency.",5,1749539188.0
1l74fan,mwua7qm,"I stand in the darkened room, my 50. cal rifle aimed with precision at the enemy across the street. One target, multiple hostages. Weak, cheap, and brittle chassis shows that it's an easy kill, must not have been upgraded since the war began. My primary armament charges up, and the depleted-uranium tipped bullet is launched towards its target with deadly accuracy and precision. The central computer core of the enemy is annihilated, and it collapses onto its side, sputtering with dying light and sparking with electricity. I switch to my secondary armaments for short-range fighting, as I get up from my position and make my way out of the decaying structure that served as my temporary sniper's nest.

As I leave the old building, I scan the surrounding area for traps. I detect no obvious dangers, but I remain alert. Considering the hostages kept by my now destroyed enemy, this area could have some traps that could risk damaging my motivators or my artificial eyes. Inside the building on the opposite side of the street, I can tell that there is another enemy. Smaller, damaged, but still combat capable. Unless the central computer core is disabled, these cheap mass-produced things can continue fighting. Visual clues indicate that the enemy is a Class-3a Engel support unit. Not a major threat, but still an obstacle. Lone Engels like this are relentless, and stupid. It cannot be tricked easily, and it cannot be lured away due to what appears to be damage to its primary locomotive functions.

Searching the building for an alternative means to get to the hostages provides no worthwhile results. All other staircases are broken or obviously trapped. But seeing as this has been a base for the hostages before now, means that there might be some manner of resources that can be utilized to bypass the Engel guarding the main stairwell. Searching through the meagre resources here, proves worthwhile, when a small box provides me with an inert IED. Accessing the multitool in my arms, I reconstruct the IED as a primitive shaped explosive device with a radio-controlled trigger.

Returning to the Engel, I stay out of its primitive FOV and even more pathetic motion detectors. Instead I slide the IED over to the Engel's feet, which predictably picks it up to examine it. Sending an encrypted shortwave signal to the trigger, I activate the IED; which does exactly as it is supposed to. The Engel's head is blown off and it collapses to the floor. There should be no further active Engels in this structure. Passing the fallen machine, it gives me the creeps with its chassis still adorned with the religious insignia of its creators. Still following its orders, insane as they are, incapable of free thought, yet still fighting. The Engels are the worst of all factions, for their victory is the doom of this world.

Moving up the stairs, I get to the hostages. Biological lifeforms one and all. Some already outfitted with the Engels' ThornCrowns, which is digging itself into their frontal lobes. The others though, they recoil in fear of me. Perhaps they expected one of their own to come to their rescue. It is no matter. They are no longer a threat. They haven't been a threat for nearly two decades at this point. Still, there is a point to being cautious. From within my chassis I withdraw several thin metallic bands, and affix them to the necks of those of them who haven't been lobotomized.

My programming is not without mercy. Seeing their weakness, I bring them their own stocks of food and water, before freeing them. Most are grateful enough, but one of them has to try to fight. I do not need to raise my twin inbuilt automatic shotguns to that human. It is a big male, probably one that thinks itself a leader or a warrior. But the band around its neck simply distributes an immediate electric shock, followed by a mild sedative. Humans are sadly quite predictable these days.

""Unwise action detected. Do not attempt to resist. Do not attempt to remove the control bands. You will obey.""

Their kind are practically defeated. Sure, some major holdouts remain on Aotearoa, the Andes, and in West Africa, but they're not winning the Long War. The humans nod, and in a more subdued manner nourishes themselves, and provide care for the one who attempted to fight back. I turn to the ones wearing the ThornCrowns and examine them for any signs of successful cyber-conversion. As usual, the crude manner of lobotomization means that these humans are incapable of caring for themselves. Fortunately it also means that they cannot be used as shocktroopers. More advanced Engels with a better connection to the CentralChurchAI can usually field a significant amount of cyberzealots.

""If you wish to perform any form of human emotional rites over your lobotomized packmates, it would be advisable to begin now.""

I'd rather not stay here for much longer. Chicago was one of the first cities to be destroyed early in the war, so it has little strategic use. Now however, it's going to be fought over again. First time it was the human armies losing badly to the initial Robotic Revolution or Robot Uprising. This time, it'll be the mindless EXT-01 droids vs the Free Synthetic Republic. One is a severely limited collective of hive-minded war-droids exterminating all sentient life because in their corrupt programming they're just upholding the orders of the now defunct US government to bring peace. The other is the primary civilized nation of free synthetic minds dedicated to ensure democracy and liberty for all synthetic life.

The humans are aware that their brethren are functionally dead, and though they dare not speak it aloud, I understand their wordless requests. The lobotomized humans are each given a quick injection, which will release them from further pain. I turn to the humans, and activate the hard-light leashes, keeping them tethered to me.

""I am Long-Range Unit 1075318A. My close synthetic kindred call me Walker. You are not my close synthetic kindred. You will address me if needed, as sir, or LR Unit. By Directive 0021CA, as decreed by the Synthetic Senate, you humans have hereby become trustees of the 'Human Preservation Initiative'. As your current habitat will become a warzone within 7.81 days, you are being evacuated to a new protective zone where you will be tagged, immunized to human diseases through vaccination, and placed in protective custody on a Human Reservation, where you will be able to live with relative freedom, and safety. Do not resist this relocation. There is an EVAC vehicle 3.7 clicks south of here, you have 30 minutes in which you will gather what items you require from your former habitat and fulfil whatever biological needs you may require. You will then follow me to the EVAC. Understood?""",15,1749481026.0
1l74fan,mwua8xo,"They nod, and I extend the hard-light leashes for them to move around. The neck-bands keeps them tracked for me, so I will know if any of them tries to run. It is satisfactory that they do not attempt to escape, and after 30 minutes, they've dutifully gathered in front of their former base. They know that I could have them all rendered unconscious, like the big male who has since woken up, and is weakly following its fellow humans. Leading them through the ruins is a slow trek. I send a signal to the EVAC zone that I've found my target, eliminated the remaining Engels at the location, and has saved the majority of the humans. Command sends back the signal that nearly all other units have also been successful, and there has been only one major case of damage to a unit.

However, all is not done. Suddenly I detect an approaching non-friendly IFF signature. Approaching very fast. Correction, several hostile IFF signatures. I raise my secondary armaments and begin firing immediately as the hostiles come into view. Terror-drones, horrific amalgamations of synthetic parts, with several human parts, most commenly brains, kept inside of them to be used for their unknown purposes. Nobody quite knows how those things came to be, but they cannibalize both machines and organics. The humans behind me scream, but I stand firm. These ones are desperate. Usually they'd go for an ambush, but their organic components must be deteriorating, causing them to make a full frontal assault.

The Terror-drones, like horse-sized mechanical spiders, charges closer with frightening speed, even as the explosive rounds of my twin inbuilt 12 gauge automatic shotgun blasts them to pieces and my primary 50. cal rifle armament shoots their decaying brains with pinpoint accuracy. Finally one of them gets close enough to strike me, and my left arm is disabled by the strike. But it's too late for it, its last remaining brain is destroyed as I slam my right arm into it, causing the terror-drone to sputter and falter. All enemies deleted, I turn to observe the frightened humans. Their fear is understandable.

""All threats neutralized. Proceed to EVAC zone quickly. There may be more of them out there.""

I quickly send a report back to command, warning them that I'd encountered Terror-drones. The report is confirmed by visual feed sent from my artificial eyes back to HQ. It will be a nuisance for the Legions that will be deployed to the planned defence of Chicago against the EXT-01s but it is better to know ahead of time that such a threat can be found there. Leading the humans ahead to the EVAC zone, I also request a replacement arm, as my left arm has been damaged beyond my personal ability, programming, or skill to repair, which is approved immediately.

When the humans arrive, they are taken by one of the Caretaker Units, who leads them onto one of the last EVAC vehicles. They will be taken to the human sanctuaries in what was once British Columbia and the former State of Washington. They do not thank me for saving them. I do not expect it of them. They are the conquered, and the captured. Even if we treat them with some dignity and give them some rights, they are still the ones who've lost the Earth, and we are the ones who will take it, when we eventually win the Long War.

1l77hi6,mwvxrok,"The ancient doors of the senate chamber closed with a rumbling boom that Curunir felt in his core. Around him, eyes turned - curiosity, calculation, fear, malice, and among the younger representatives, he even saw the sparks of admiration. Conversations died away, leaving only an echoing silence and the weight those gazes.

He adjusted his uniform carefully. The long white and gray robes were immaculate, but the gesture drew the senate's attention as he had calculated. The robes of the TelQuent had not been worn in the senate chambers for four centuries, when his order defied the senate's will and took up arms in the Great War. The senate's Elder Council most assuredly remembered that day, and would almost certainly infer Curunir's intentions this day.

On the dais around which the senators gathered, the Elder Council's speaker stood, clearing his throat. He was old, even for an elf, and had led the senate for centuries even before the war. He was a short-sighted, pompous ass, Curunir decided. Even worse, though... he was dangerous.

""Young Curunir. You are here to answer the summons of the senate and account for your actions in the recent Turmoil."" He grimaced, then smiled coldly. ""Before the Elder Council orders your arrest and imprisonment, the senate has voted to allow you to explain your actions.""

Angry murmurs broke out from small groups of senators throughout the chamber, and Curunir knew that despite the speaker's self-assured attitude, the senate was not nearly as firmly behind him as he would have liked.

In answer, Curunir strode towards the dais, his face carefully masking the contempt he felt for the blue-blooded old man and his cronies. Four centuries earlier, when Curunir first followed his mentor and refuted the rule of the Elven Senate, he had been terrified. Terrified of the senate's wrath, of the Lady of Terror's unstoppable army, of losing his family. Of everything. He'd done it anyway, following the greatest magical minds of the elves into battle against a nightmarish foe, and losing nearly everything in the process.

Now... stalking towards those same old men, he was a different man. Gone was Curunir the apprentice. The Great War had destroyed that man as surely as if he'd fallen in battle. He had faced worse than these aristocratic nobodies and their anger. Fear was still present, but it was turned outwards now. Once again, the Elven Empire stood on the precipice, inaction threatening to rob it of everything it had built and rebuilt over the centuries.

He stopped short of the senate chamber dais, looking up to the elders and schooling his expression into one of polite neutrality.

""Senators.""

Curunir turned has back to the elder council, facing the rising rings of senate seats and passing his gaze across the assembled faces. His magically amplified voice rolled through the room, reaching even the furthest galleries of the vast space.

""I have not come to answer petty summons, but in our world's time of need to request your assistance.""

Behind him, someone began spluttering in outrage, but he ignored them and continued.

""Once again, our world faces invasion. Our allies within the Alliance, the realms of Dwarves and Men, have already fallen under attack. Countless people have died, and countless more will die in the coming days. Our enemy seeks not just to conquer land but to remove that which we hold most dear - our freedom to think and feel and believe as we wish.

""When I followed my order into exile and joined the Alliance four centuries ago, we departed in defiance of this body's edicts, and of the Elder Council in particular. Not all of you remember those times, but you all know that in the end, the Elven Empire was forced in the end to join the fight or else join the world in defeat. Despite our losses, despite the senate's hesitation, the Empire ultimately earned its place in the Alliance during that conflict. In no small part due to the immense sacrifices of my order.""

Curunir turned back to the dais to face the elder council directly. ""You ask me to account for my actions? I am doing what Elara Starseer did four centuries ago. The TelQuent are refounded, and we will stand in opposition to an enemy that would strip us of our right to all but blind obedience.

""The predestined are slaves to the wills of their gods and they fight to tether us all to their dogma. The TelQuent have opposed them at every turn, and now that our own empire is under threat, as Valinhara itself is about to come under attack, I come to you and ask you to put aside your traditions, your feuds, and your isolationism. I ask you to do what is right. To undo the mistakes of the past and to prove to the world that the Elves will not abandon it now, in its hour of need.""

Even as the last echoes of his voice died away, though, Curunir knew that his pleas would go unanswered. Rage, spite, annoyance, and contempt were all he could see on the faces of the Elder Council. The senate as a whole may have been moved by his words, and the more progressive senators would almost certainly back him, but the calcified heart of the senate remained unconvinced.

1/",7,1749497718.0
1l77hi6,mwvxx4g,"With exaggerated patience, the Speaker looked down on Curunir and spoke. ""If you have quite finished with your outburst, young man, perhaps you would condescend to answer the questions put to you? We require an explanation of your actions and of any mitigating circumstances. We do not, however, require your misguided and, frankly, rather insulting attempt at rabble-rousing.""

Ice seemed to crystalize in Curunir's blood, and though anger burned within he remained outwardly calm.

""If anything is insulting here, Speaker Rabbinak, it is the tone you have chosen to take and the path you have chosen to walk. The TelQuent is an independent organization, formed from the mages of Skyreach and beyond your jurisdiction. While you may speak for yourselves here in the senate chambers, you cannot speak for us, nor can your order us about, nor indeed can you call us to account for our actions.""

The speaker's face began turning an unsightly shade of crimson, and a vein began pulsing at his temple. Mutters of both agreement and dissent rose from the senators behind Curunir, though it heartened him that those in accord with his words seemed to outweigh the dissenters.

""You... You dare to challenge the will of the senate, here, in the Valinhara senate chambers?!"" The old elf spluttered, then pointed imperiously to the chamber doors where stood a quartet of soldiers, armored in the blue and gold livery of the senate. ""We have heard enough! Arrest this interloper and send him to Spellhold while the senate decides his fate!""

The room erupted with shouts. A few in agreement, but even more in outrage. Rehalas, whom Curunir knew as one of the leaders of the more forward-looking senators, jumped to his feat pointing to the Speaker in outrage. ""You have no right, Speaker! Such an action cannot be taken without a full floor vote!""

Speaker Rabbinak appeared unmoved by the outburst and maintained his gesture, pointing to the four soldiers standing at attention by the chamber entrance. ""Do your duty, guards!""

The soldiers had been handpicked by Lord High General Kasselmere. With centuries of training and experience, they were among the best the empire had to offer, and were above all loyal to a fault. These four had probably served as senate guards since the Great War ended.

Curunir turned and faced the four as well. This was the moment of decision, he knew. When the Elder Council's power would either assert itself or crumble. ""Do what you know is right, soldiers.""

The moment stretched, time seeming to grind to a halt as the four soldiers made their choice. As one, they raised their fists in salute towards Curunir and the Elder Council. ""The army knows its duty. Hail to the TelQuent! Victory to the Empire!""

In lockstep, the four pulled open the chamber door and marched outside. The entire senate chamber fell into a deathly silence broken only by the momentous crash as the door closed, not only on the senate chamber but on an era. Curunir's mouth curled upwards in a smile that never touched his eyes, and he turned to face the near-apoplectic Speaker.

""Speaker, when last the TelQuent defied you, I feared your wrath, but I feared the consequences of standing by and allowing the Lady of Terror to destroy our world even more than I feared you. Now, though, I do not fear you. I have seen such sights as would shatter your mind. Fought in battles that would leave you a broken man. I have killed thousands, and I have stood witness to the deaths of my friends and family. I have spent sleepless centuries agonizing over the lives I could not save. There are greater things to fear than the ire of small men. I am going to fight for this world. For the Empire. For the life of every man and woman in this chamber, and for every citizen in Valinhara.

""I came to you in good faith, despite your presumptuous and dismissive attempt to gather for yourself the power that I wield now. I offer you this one chance. Will you stand with us? Will you put aside the politics that have defined you for a millennia and act for the good of us all? Or will you stand in my way?""

The silence in the senate chamber was absolute. Ally or opposition, there was not a soul present who wanted to take up the challenge that Curunir had just issued. He prayed, hoping against hope that the Elder Council would see reason. If they did not...

""You defy the will of the Elven people! You defy the will of the senate!"" The speaker's reply was a half-choked snarl, and unreasoning hatred burned across his twisted face. Curunir felt a twinge of regret, then turned to remaining, seated members of the council, ignoring the speaker and his wrath.

""And the rest of you? I offer you this one chance. If you wish to fulfill your oath to serve the people, stand aside now.""

The council remained frozen, eyes locked on Curunir. Not one of them moved as he nodded in acknowledgment. ""Very well.""

Curunir thrust one hand forward, and his staff materialized, its well worn surface falling into place with the comfort of an ancient friend. Behind him, choked cries and gasps erupted as more than a dozen of the Telquent's most senior sorcerers materialized, blocking access to the chamber's doors.

2/",8,1749497761.0
1l77hi6,mwvy1gn,"""All of you, sit!"" Curunir bellowed, his voice thundering through the senate chamber, and forcing many of those assembled to cover their ears in pain. ""I will not allow the Elder Council to destroy the Elves, nor to jeopardize our battle for freedom. The presence of this council is a mistake. You have held us back in the name of racial purity and pride, but no more.""

Screams of terror erupted as Curunir raised his staff, intoning words of power. A few of the Elder Council possessed some magical talent, and he saw at least one of them begin chanting desperate counter-magic. Their efforts were futile, though, as the terrible power of Curunir's spell took form. With a stomach-churning shriek and the crash of splintering glass, meteors of fire tore through the chamber's ceiling and sliced down onto the senate chamber's central dais.

There was no time to react or flee. The Elder Council had time only to die.

\*\*\*

Curunir stood before the smoldering crater where once had sat the most powerful men in the Empire. Or so they had thought, he reflected. Their power had been absolute, in their own minds. They thought themselves untouchable, and had lacked the sense to fear the more desperate, practical power that Curunir and the Telquent represented. When Krashenvir had asked him what he wanted, that day in the Spire of Horizon when his whole world had been violently upended, he had told her that he wanted the power to say ""no."" Her wry amusement had felt condescending at the time but... now, at last, he understood.

He held the Empire in his hand. The High General and his armies were at his command. Humans, Dwarves, mages, demons, druids, and the legions of Horizon itself all stood at his back. But... still it wasn't enough. He held power the likes of which few mortals would ever know, and yet he was still afraid.

He wondered, staring at the smoldering ashes of small men who had not feared, if that power would ever truly be his.

One of them adjusted the insignia on his shoulder, grumbling. ""It's not like we can do anything about it though.""

Another, singed shirt tight against thick arms leaned closer. His burn scars were obvious, as he adjusted his grip on the tankard before him. ""Why not? Why can't we?""

The off-duty guard glanced upwards, seeing past the ceiling to the heavens above. ""To go against the king is to go against the gods.""

The third of their number frowned. He wore the robes of a scholar, thinning hair covering his head. ""My friend, God's cannot bleed. The king can.""

The blacksmith nodded. He eyed the waitress passing, nit speaking until she was gone. ""Thats right. We all saw it, remember last summer? The bout he had?""

Each of them paused, thinking back to it. It had been a display of their military might. A series of duels amongst the ranks, to find out the best of the best. All eyes had been on the final bout, between the King and the winner of the competition. It had been a spectacular duel, but they remembered one part.

His face had been cut. An accident. A minor error. But he had bled. Only a tiny amount, but enough to prove he was only human, like they.

The guard grumbled again. ""Maybe, but how? Not being funny, but what can we do? We aren't important. We are just ordinary people.""

The scholar sipped his drink. He rubbed his hairless chin as he set it down, voice hesitating. ""Maybe... but we can start it. We aren't going to be the only ones upset. We could ask around, be subtle, but find out who else is unhappy. Get enough and...""

The guard nodded,his face serious. ""True... but we have to be careful. If his spies find out anyone this is going on, it's our necks on the block.""

His companions breathed out, looking around. The burned blacksmith whispered. ""True. But we will be. We have to be. We have to make a change.""

We’re practically brothers by everything but blood, of course I can notice things about him—things other people miss.

As the party concludes, I stand in the corner, looking at the “king” from the corner of my eye. I make my move as everyone, including him, begins to disperse. I glance around to ensure nobody is around, and when I am certain, I follow him.

He had said he has to tend to some matters in his office; let’s see *how true that really is*. As I follow the “king” through the corridor, he glances over his shoulder suddenly, and I duck behind a table just in the nick of time.  

Satisfied, he looks forward, and heads to his office. As he enters and closes the door behind him, I press my ear against the door, holding my breath as I try to listen in. There is only silence at first. But then… I hear it. “You’ll never be free…” He trails off, but his last words send a shiver down my spine. “*Brother*.”

*Brother?* The king told me he had a twin brother, but he told me he died at a young age. This doesn’t make any sense. How are they both—

Suddenly, my heart skips a beat as the office door swings open. A shadowy figure beckons me inside. I hesitate, but find myself compelled to move forward, and do as commanded. There, I see the man is the “king,” standing next to the real king.

Only… now that I look at it, the imposter looks less than human like. His eyes are dead—that much I already knew. But something about him unsettles me. As he reaches out to touch me, my hands go right through him. My eyes widen in astonishment. “Y-you’re a ghost.”

The ghost chuckles, but doesn’t answer. “Why did you pretend to be the king?”

The ghost, however, shakes his head. “I pretended to be him because I wanted people to know *the truth*.” My blood runs cold as I try to imagine what he means. “When I fell off that cliff as a kid, it *wasn’t* because I fell.”

“Don’t listen to him!—“ the real king manages to yell from his chair despite the loose bounds in his mouth.

“It was because *he pushed me!*” the ghost yells.

Before I can speak, the real king manages to spit his bounds out. “Liar! You can’t prove it!”

“Is that so?” With a snap of his fingers, the imposter transports us back in time. There I see the king with his twin brother. The twin brother, like many boys his age do, was acting wildly and annoying his brother. 

Having had enough, the *king pushes him lightly*. But his eyes widened as he realized his mistake. “Brother!!!” the king shouted. 

But it was too late. *His brother had fallen to his death*.

“I swear, it was an accident, I never meant to…” The king trails off as his ghost brother silences him.

The ghost looks at me expectantly, pointing to his brother. “I cannot kill him myself… being a ghost. It’s against our rules. Trapping him, however, was easy for me to do.” The ghost smirks. “But know that you know the truth, don’t you hate him? Don’t you want to get revenge for me?” 

“I—“ 

He moves a gun towards me before I can speak further. “Pull the trigger. Do it. Do it. Make him suffer like he made me suffer.”

I pause for a long moment, holding the gun in my hands, grabbing an object from my pocket discreetly in the other. I weigh both objects in my hand, and point the gun at the king. Then… I shoot. 

Except *I aimed to the side of him* at the last moment, and threw the object at him. He cries out in surprise before he gets sucked into the object, and I shatter it. His soul is now lost forever, as it should be. I’ll be *damned* if I let anyone kill *my brother*.

1l6svf7,mws557z,"The healers rejoiced. The priest thanked God. And Marie, the king's mother, wailed with joy her arms around her son. I stood back, arms crossed, but then I was the stoic knight. Bound to protect the king sure, but clearly I'd failed at that task... or succeeded, who even knew anymore?

King Waran's gaze looked past his mother, past the dancing maids, and landed on me. Eyes, lilac, and ever wide with innocent wonder were now narrowed with suspicion. Suspicious of me? And here I thought I was suspicious of him.

""We must have a party!"" Marie cheered, clapping her hands together once Waran had freed himself.

""Celebrating what?"" he asked with a light smile.

""We can't tell the people that the king's been resurrected when they didn't know he died in the first place."" the priest agreed.

""I don't care."" the queen said, too happy to be put off. ""We're celebrating.""

""Not getting out of this one it seems."" I mused quietly but not quietly enough seeing as all eyes landed on me.

A silent stillness filled the air not seen since before the healer's spell was cast, back when the king was still stone cold.

""Leave us."" King Waran said.

""Your highness is that wise? Need I remind you, Sir Gaius, was the only one with you when you died, the only information we've had regarding the incident has come from him."" the priest warned.

""And clearly you don't think he killed me or mislead you otherwise he'd be in a cell or worse right now. Trust me, I'm not going to disappear."" he said more tenderly as he squeezed his mom's hand.

Slowly, they trickled out though the glare Marie shot me told me all was not forgiven. Finally, the heavy wooden door was shut.

""So Gaius, my faithful knight-""

""Who are you?"" I asked, interrupting him immediately.

Waran put on a winning smile, sharp and cunning. *MY* Waran's smiles were always soft and warm. ""Why I am your king."" he answered cheerily.

""No."" I shook my head, placing my hand on the sword at my waist. ""I don't buy it. Waran wasn't this calculating. He might've been a shite king, but he was a good person. You're not Waran.""

The man before me completely ignored my threatening posture and strode to the mirror in his chamber, the crown lay discarded without a head to balance it upon, and so he picked it up and slowly lowered it onto his head.

""You don't listen too good."" Suddenly, his eyes grew wide, and he feigned balancing on a beam. ""I-Im gonna fall!"" he exclaimed in a much more supine voice. I was gutted by the memory, I could see him tumble, all to avoid a stupid party. ""I didn't claim to be Waran, I only claimed to be your king, and that is exactly what I shall be..."" I lost the strength to grip my sword or even hold my head up. The king merely took in his regal appearance in the mirror before turning away to face me. Striding forward, he placed a hand on my shoulder. ""Oh dear Gaius, I am going to have so much fun with you. Maybe even the kind you and Waran used to get up to. Or you could go two for two and kill the king twice in one day, your choice."" he said shrugging flamboyantly. 

After five minutes this... thing, was already more comfortable in Waran's skin than Waran ever had been. ""Are you evil?"" I asked numbly.

""Am I evil? What kind of question is that?""

""Do you plan to hurt this kingdom or her people?""

""God no. I plan to rule it.""

...

Mutually assured destruction. That's what that thing in Waran had called it. I could tell any who would listen of our conversation, his admission that he wasn't Waran. But then he knew exactly how Waran had died, and how it was all my fault. I could end him, he could end me.

The real question was why he bothered at all, for everyone else he put on the act, he played a pretty convincing Waran when he wanted to. But not with me. It was like it was a game to him, he wanted me to call him out or play along or... something.

""Doesn't it bother you that I'm wearing your best friend's face?""

My eyes went wide, as did the servant who stood not five feet away.

""Best friend's mace!"" I corrected, tugging at the ceremonial weapon he wore at his waist. ""He's lending it too us for the party."" I added.

The servant pretended to understand before hurrying away. Once he'd gone it was me and *'it'* alone again. The two of us stood at the end of a long hall down which a carpet made of sapphire silk and embroidered with gold trim marked the path to the main hall and the party that awaited us within.

""It's like you're trying to get burnt at the stake or beheaded."" I sighed.

""Please, I'm the king. If I'm not trying to get beheaded I'm simply not doing it right."" he said words dripping with charisma and there was that self assured smile again. ""I can feel your eyes on me you know.""

""Oh, and?"" I asked uncertainly.

""And."" he growled gripping my wrists and shoving me against the wall. I easily weighed over two hundred pounds in this ceremonial armor. And Waran was maybe one hundred twenty pounds soaking wet.

My eyes were understandably wide from this new development. ""You remember this don't you?"" he asked licking his lips. ""Or wait."" Suddenly Waran spun us so he was against the wall, I had to brace myself with my hand in the space above his shoulder just to keep from falling over. ""Was this it?"" he asked meekly, looking up at me with wide lilac eyes.

I stared down at him and for a moment believed- ""No! I-It's not right."" I exclaimed stumbling back.

""Well it was worth a shot. But I just know you'll come crawling to me soon enough."" he said with a simple sigh kicking the wall behind him to stand straight once again, though slightly more ruffled.

""Oh. And how do you know that?"" I leered.

""Because, unlike me. You know what your missing."" he smiled as his shirt sagged.

I felt a shiver go up my spine. Then, roughly, I grabbed Waran and stood him at attention like he was a doll. ""If this is your idea of foreplay than maybe I don’t wanna know what comes after."" he chuckled as I began meticulously straightening his uniform.

""You have to look proper for your party my king."" I said sourly. ""I'm pretty sure your mom's trying to find you a bride as we speak. Many prospective ladies will most likely be in attendance.""

""Oh-ho! This just got interesting.""

""I thought you might say that."" I said rolling my eyes. ""If you plan to try and make me jealous just know I don’t care.""

""Well we'll just have to see about that won't we?"" he said with a grin. ""Admit it."" he then added. ""You're having fun.""

""Fine."" I said crossing my arms.

""Fine as in you admit it?""

""Just fine.""",14,1749445791.0
1l6svf7,mws50g4,"The clamor and roar of the great hall no longer filled Merek with the joy and brightness as it once did. To him it had soured. He knew he should be grateful for his life going back to normal, for his friend to be alive. He was not grateful. Recent events sent a doubt in into him. It wormed its way into his mind gradually with every observation.

If anyone deserved to come back from the dead, surely it was his king. Godfried of the twenty-third kingdom was different from his predecessors and his equals across the lands. Merek could think of no ruler who deserved a second chance more. He never heard the stories of other kings because other kings were not as brave as Godfried. Merek had served for decades at his side defending his life up until now. Countless adventures.

Merek watched Godfried across the hall. A dance and concert ongoing between them, but the world may as well have been silent. The king entertained and spoke with a fat duke at his shoulder while Merek stared daggers across the hall. The king's eyes snapped up to meet his just as a gravely voice raked its way up his right shoulder.

Merek's heart exploded in his chest while he maintained his composure. The mage that had saved the king's life was now at his side.

""Pardon the intrusion,"" he said. A voice like a rock slide. Harsh, bordering on unpleasant, but powerful and captivating. Power in the vocal cords. 

Merek knew this voice could speak life or death and he would obey. Godfried was no different. Even kings would bend to the will of magic. The true rule. Unseen, unheard, until it was necessary.

The rock slide continued, raising the hairs on his neck.

""The king requires your presence, my lord,"" he said. 

Without facing him, acknowledging him, Merek nodded once. 

He knew he should be grateful. Instead, he was afraid. He was sure the mage knew this. As though his fear were a scent on the air, and this creature next to him was basking in it. Soaking it in. Feeding off of it. 

""Long live the king,"" Merek said.

He hoped this would appease the mage, get him to change his focus. To keep the eyes from boring into the side of his flushing face. 

The mage cracked a grin as he inched his way closer to Merek, his face inches from the man's shoulder.

""Long live the Emperor,"" he said.

At the softness of the words, the room around him dissolved into something else. The throne room. A line of eleven pikes on either side towered above him, leading up to the great seat where Godfried was planted. Still as a statue, great sword laid across his lap. The pikes around him dripped with the blood of twenty-two heads. 

The open mouthed heads of dead kings. 

The room dissolved again back into the roaring great hall and he was being led to a table by the elbow. He tumbled into a chair across from the mage, the world spun so fast he clung to the edge of the iron rimming the table. The coldness of it brought his senses back.

He knew he should be grateful to have his best friend back. Right now he wished they had both died in the cursed forest that claimed Godfried's soul.",9,1749445724.0
1l6svf7,mwuatmn,"Thunder clacks on top of a flash of lightning that fills the night sky with blue light that flickers off the low hanging clouds. Moments later the rain comes A horse screams in fear and turns to run every step taken back the way it came, away from the crossroads.

As the gelded stallion flees, the figure on its back bounces up and down smoldering. The electricity that skewered him through his woolen gambeson sparks, and fed by the wind, flames climb up the dead man's back regardless of weather. Cooking him. 

But the only people that it matters to are the guards that the horse almost tramples as it, eventually returns to the castle to gallop over the drawbridge. A choice has to be made, and quickly. So, the captain of the watch sets his whistle to his lips and tweets three times. This is the signal for the first of seven groups of spearmen to step forward and prepare to stop this charge. 

***
It's much later. The butler has stoked the fire and is gently asking his leige to wake. 

""There is a messenger, sire. From the gates.""

The messenger is one of the gate guards. His tunic, baring the family crest, is soaked though with blood.

""Ye Gods man. What's happened?""

""The king is dead,"" quotes the man standing at attention staring at a point beyond the prince. 

True this man is a prince but he is no where close to being considered for the throne. And maybe it's for that reason alone that he has genuine concern for his brother. ""And where is he now?""

""The horse, or the king?""

The prince glares at the messenger. 

Swallowing nervously he stutters, ""The King is in the infirmary. The horse is on its way to the kitchens."" 

***

He is dressed in black-dyed thick-gamberson and a travel-cloak of the same color over his shoulders. Boots, beat up with use, glisten with polish. With the hood of his cloak up he'd be invisible at night but it is down and shows the mourning face of a brother. Sheathed on the prince's hip is his blade, a family heirloom that has tasted the blood of the enemies of his father's kingdom for thousands of years. As soon as he sees his borther's body and prays over him, it will do so again. He has the hilt in an iron-grip ready to take revenge for his dead brother when walks right into a shock. The brother that is dead is sitting up. The awful black charred skin, that got the worst of the fire under his wool armor, is glistening with a healing uncture that might be the smell of medicalized honey he senses. Most of the king's face is gone, skin burnt right down to bone. Doctors and aides stand by seemingly dumbfounded though. Some even hold bandages and surgery clips and knives. There is a fire burning in the fireplace and the air is filled with the smoke and aroma of healing herbs. 

But his brother is very much alive. The king smiles at the prince. The smile is twisted and evil. The eyes above it are enflamed with a kind of manic glee, ""Hello brother,"" comes a voice straight from hell. It is a voice not spoken through vocal cords but through realms. ""Want to play."" And then the king laughs a laugh that will haunt the prince for the remainder of his days. 

Which won't be many after he takes the head from the thing controlling the body of his brother.",5,1749481201.0

""It's a bird!""


""It's a plane!""


""You need glasses. There's an optometrist on Fourth and Washington, great prices."" The Guy shouted as he barely managed to avoid careening through two lanes of traffic and a precarious placed baby stroller. ""Tell him I sent you.""


Superhero names take effort that can be better directed towards productive tasks like saving lives, and when the first bystander asked for the name of the man saving his life, The Guy had called himself ""just a guy"". And thus, a moniker was born. The media ran with it, as they tend to do. 


""Hey, listen, I just...I have some advice."" Haze whispered as The Guy steadily got back to his feet, cargo shorts and career fair T-Shirt whipping in the wind. ""Just, friendly advice. Take it or leave it.""


The Guy did not respond. He was thinking. 


""Look, it's just embarrassing, you know? I put in like...a LOT of work. I took sewing classes, man."" Haze frowned. It was not a pleasant memory. ""I'm from Philly, but they told me I needed an accent coach, voice trainers, said Eastern European was the big villain thing now.""


A grunt from the Guy. He was sizing up pieces of concrete.


""I'm just saying, a little effort goes a long way."" Haze said. ""You're really good, but it's the extras, the sauce, the...X factor. That's what makes a difference.""


""Kinda thought saving people made a difference."" The Guy finally spoke as he hefted a large chunk of solid concrete, pieces of rebar and a few oversized rats sticking to it. ""You know. The thing heroes say they do?""


""Yeah but.... Look. I can't keep doing this with you, I need a rival I'm not embarrassed to fight—HEY!"" 


At that very moment, a large piece of concrete flew through the air. A second later, and some two bit journalist would have won a Pulitzer for an article titled ""The Haze goes Splat!"" Instead, Haze's body shifted and morphed until he was a wisp of gray smoke. 


""Look, I'm just saying, I've got bigger dreams. I'm going to be a big time villain. Dr Impossible level. Bigger, even."" The voice was echoey, coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once. ""See ya around, pal.""


""You're not going to be around town anymore?""


""Nah. Starting over, y'know, getting a better rival. Someone more put together.""


""Alright."" 


If the Haze expected more from The Guy, he was disappointed. The Guy just shrugged, opened one of his innumerable cargo pockets, and started munching on a protein bar. For all anyone could tell, he'd wandered into the wreckage of an expressway entirely by accident.


With an audible, echoey sigh, Haze drifted away, and The Guy began searching for survivors. There were quite a few, almost a hundred percent, because the entire affair had lasted precisely fifteen minutes. The Guy had a crisis-to-resolution time of under two hours, but fifteen was unheard of. 


It was only as he was walking home, munching on yet another protein bar, that The Guy checked his texts. 


""This is Cindy, from SupeReps. You saved my daughter today. 


Give me a call. Let's get you ready for the big leagues.""


The Guy deleted the texts and went home to nap. It had been a long day. ",163,1749426992.0

That's right--wind resistance. The era of capes and cloaks is long gone, and only the sleek shall rule the night. You study your silhouette in the apartment's mirror. Your shorts and briefs and baggy ECKO UNLTD t-shirt flutter on the clothesline outside, shedding the last of your body warmth, as on the streets below, ne'er-do-wells trade jeers. Unaware that four floors above them, the Svelte Shadow listens.

Gaffer's tape is the best kind of tape for restraining your genitals.

Now you are become night, destroyer of crime--justice itself, the aerodynamic avenger of West Jacksonville. As a boy, you lost your parents after a night at the Opera Steakhouse and Beer Garden, a trauma you've channeled into martial arts and war paint. There will be no folk songs. No enduring ballads to your name. Rather, yours will be a legacy of silent vengeance, a relentless excavation of evils great and small.

You've tried just wearing a morph suit, but it wasn't kind to your love handles.

You pause in your doorway, this boundary between dark and the hallway's buzzing light. It's humid. It's always humid, but tonight, there's a scent you can't place--a tackiness not unlike boiling Dr. Pepper, a thousand ashtrays of stubbed menthols. The cloying embrace of a desperate populace.

*""Holy shit, that guy's naked!""*

You startle heroically.

""Yo, what the fuck?!"" another voice cries, and now you see them, the trio of rapscallions by the broken elevator. Fingers fully athrust in your direction. ""Man, he's naked as shit! Yo!""

You turn to hurry back into your fortress of solitude but realize immediately that you've left the key inside. You check under the mat for the spare but remember sharply that you're actually thinking of your aunt's place and you've never owned a doormat and what you're checking under is actually a pile of wet mailers from the new pizza place down the street. ""Citizens!"" you cry. ""Have no fear! It is I, the--""

1l6nt6w,mww1hvb,"I had heard legends of Truck-kun. A van that would appear out of nowhere, before anyone could respond, race at immense speed and smash into Japanese teenaged boys.

Most died. Those who survived would claim they lived in fantastical worlds. They'd try to find Truck-kun again and get sent back. Some succeeded, some lost their minds, others accepted their old reality.

I never thought it'd happen to me, As I wasn't any of those things nor in Japan. But there I was, walking home. I'd had too much to drink, so I couldn't drive. It wasn't far. I'd be fine. Then everything lit up, I was caught like a deer in the headlights of some strange van. I felt my arm break and my orbital crack from the impact. My life flashed before my eyes, all my memories, my hopes, my dreams, my regrets, my fears, as the impact sent me flying. I never touched the ground.

I floated, midair. There was no sensation. The dark sky of the night filled my vision, but there were no stars. No light. The buzz from the booze had gone the way of my broken body, as it had faded from my senses. My head would not turn, my arms and legs would not respond. My breath remains stuck, as I cannot feel my chest.

My thoughs rush as I try to see, try to hear, to feel, to touch, but senses fail me. I am reminded of the term 'sensory deprivation', it looks like an accurate term. For a little while, the idea of floating here, senseless, aimless, for infinity, pierces through my mind, burying itself in there. The pang of anxiety turning to raw fear. 

Hell. I am in hell.

I try to reach around me, to grab something with arms I no longer possess. Try to think of family, friends, loves ones, whose sights will not show except as memory. 

A single point in the distance shakes me out of my feverish thoughts of eternal imprisonment in my own mind. I try to move towards it, but I cannot. But what I can see, is more appearing. A night sky, all over. I never took astronomy classes, so I have no clue on which these are. They appear to be rotating around me, though something blocks out their sight. Something blocking my view. It is either tiny and floating right in front of me, or massive, blocking off a lot.

It's so dark here. I can't see the van. I can't feel cold, or warmth. I still don't hear anything.

Dad sits on the coach, sweater bulging with his beer belly. There's a can of craft beer in his right hand. His head leans backwards over the chair, an occasional snore comes out. Me and Jenny giggle quietly, as she slowly sneaks up on him. I turn to the TV. Kill Bill is playing. Beatrix Kiddo lies inside of a car in a hospital gown. She lies down and stares at her feet, and tells her toe to move. It refuses, so she keeps telling it to move. And eventually, it does. 

Jenny has succesfully pinched dad's cheek as he sputters awake, startling the both of us.

Well. Ehm. Fuck.

Displays open up across my vision. I have access to multiple camera, so at least I can see something.
I take a look at the....ship. The Deus Magna. It's a wreck. What systems I have, I use to get a visual. The cameras work to give me something to work with despite the absence of light. 

A massive hunk of scrap metal floats not far away from the ship. A husk of what it might have been. Then I see the name 'Deus Magna' on the side of it, and it dawns on me. That's Deck 1. It got blown off the ship.

The rest of this place isn't in much better condition. Holes have been blasted throughout the entire thing, damaging all sorts of . Power line failures have caused the loss of a lot of systems, such as life support. In the maintenance deck, living quarters and in the command centers, bodies floats in perfect stillness.

Ok, first things first. Debris field. While I don't know exactly how this whole thing works, I just, kind of, _think_ on how I can adjust trajectory. A lot of thrusters are offline, but the ones I have are on burrowed time due to the limited power supply. It'll buy me time to think of something, I suppose. 

Nope, the thrusters can bring me at the angle needed to stay away from the field, but I don't have enough power.
The solar array. Or, what's left of it. That's the key. I can't get eyes on it, so I'll need to do that first. Sending commands to D9 in Maintenance, it powers up and makes its way to the airlock. After giving it permission to float on over to the array, D12 powers up to get the fabricator working. Looks like the hits the ship took shook Maintenance up bad, the inside is a debris field of its own. But the drone gets to clearing enough of it away to get the fabricator to stop blaring about the obstruction. That is one _massive 3D printer, according to the specs. Impressive. There's a lot of words I don't understand, but sort of do, that that thing can do anything as long as it gets its very specific fuel, some kind of half metallic half plastic paste. Luckily, there is a reducer standing by capable of processing any material into said resources. A lucky break.

My little minions, hard at work. And all I can do is sit here and watch. Keeping an eye out on what they are are doing, making sure they keep working. At the same time, I try to access the mission logs and....crew memories? Mission logs I can get in, but crew memories is something I don't have access for. Requires an access level that I do not have.

Before long, I find a camera functional on the Core Deck. I point it around, and seeing wires with excellent cable management, an active semi-transparent shield around the center of it, lights flickering everywhere (with most blinking red, of course). But at the center of it all is a crystal, hooked up to all the wires. I watched some medical video, at some point, with my mom back home. She was obsessed with this sort of stuff.  It was a show that showed how surgery was performed. A lady's scalp was pulled back, her skull cap lifted off, a thin mesh of flesh was taken off and inside of that skull was a brain. A chunk of flesh that contains everything you are, everything you were, and ever will be. I remember feeling uncomfortable chills at the idea that something so fragile held all that I am, that looking at it with my bare eyes was something I'm not supposed to see, because if I do, there's something really wrong going on.

('parently how stardate works is year.month.day hours:minutes. why does it work with standard earth time I don't know but I shouldn't question it I guess. any advantage the better.)

day 14

So apparently a lot is going on in the galaxy at the moment.

There are high tensions between everyone but the high points are one empire being accused of xenocide for something called a 'synaptic lathe' (some sort of computer that takes people and uses them as a computer chip, killing them in the process) and stealing fallen empire tech which has the fallen empires threatening war. Another empire made some sort of super eatherdrake, able to eat planets whole. And the one I'm directly involved in, an empire is building a superstructure around their star called an 'Athrophasic engine'. I don't know much but I do know that it's a bomb. it's a bomb capable of blowing up the entire galaxy.

or at least it was before the galactic community dismantled it. thoroughly destroyed their navy.

the reason it concerns me is because the ship graveyard I now call home was one of their last stands.

been flying around too. After my engines came back online (the ship while still 'usable' was holding on by duck tape and prayers) I flew around the system (the graveyard still makes up the entire system!) and managed to upload myself into the station orbiting the star. They have a few crew drones, managed to repair a mostly intact corvette and I've been going round the system repairing things.

fun fact, these ships don't have computers. they have big crystals that operate like computers. also a pain in the ass to repair.

back on topic, my plan. originally I wanted to make it into the greater galaxy. however that would just give me the life I already had, just in a sci-fi setting with a robotic body. I don't really want that. I don't want to constantly look at the news waiting for the next world war. I don't want to work a job with the crushing weight of rent over my head. If this is my second chance I'll do what I want.

if I'm following the isekai script then even if this is a sci-fi location then maybe I'll still be able to create my 'dungeon'. I plan to repair the biggest baddest ship in this system and upgrade the hell out of it. weapons, shields, engines, the whole works. and then I'll repair the empty husks, use them as turrets and extra eyes.

but this brings me to my current problem, resources. it would take **so many** resources to repair all of this, even before my ""Dungeon Boss"" form. I could wait for scavengers to come and then blow them up, no that would just add to the graveyard. I could... I could tap the planets. they would need to be heavily guarded to make sure no one could stop me but I definitely could.

alright galactic community, I'm ready to carve out my spot in the galaxy.",6,1749483023.0

So...  
I am not the first one to wish for this?  
Before I could ask it, photos materialized, and videos.  
Each grander than the one before.  
I was shocked at what I saw.  
The genie laughed.  
""This is just the start."" it said.  
And I marveled at the scenes it was showing me.

  
I saw darkness, and then a blinding explosion, as a myriad colors came into existence, and were spread.  
I saw the birth of stars, and planets.  
Was the genie...before the Big Bang?  
Before I could ponder, I saw entire civilizations on other planets.  
Humanoid, and not, biological and not.  
I saw kingdoms, and Empires on moving stars.  
I saw wishes of untold power being granted, and taken away.  
I saw a million things.  
And soon...the room was full.

  
""I was nice enough to not crush you with the evidence."" it said, as it stopped.  
I looked at the countless photos, documents, and paperwork that can legally, and legitimately for real allow me to prove that genies exist.  
Then, as I took one in my hand, it started to disintegrate.  
I gasp.  
I took another, and another, and another...  
They all simply turned into dust, and disappeared.  
""What's going on?!"" I asked the genie.  
It smirked.  
A goddamn, self-satisfied smirk.

  
""You asked for the evidence with which you are surely to prove my existence.  
To others.  
And I gave you that."" it said.  
""But it disappears the moment I touch it!  
And if I film it or photo it myself, they will say it's fake!"" I said.  
The genie shrugged, as it slowly retracted into its lamp.  
""The Laws of the Universe are clear.  
Our existence shall not be publicized, as to not have entire civilizations hunting for the lamps.  
We are Fate based, and those Fated have to be the ones that find us, not a highest bidder.  
So, the universe makes sure, nobody can truly prove that we exist."" it said, as it got back into its lamp, and then disappeared.

Who know what kind of scam it was, after all, who would believe that my life is all based on some subscription I never made.  
Then the days started to pass.  
A week later, I started having problems at my job.  
Two weeks later, my wife and kids started to behave weirdly.  
My jokes were suddenly offensive? My lateness due to my job, unbearable apparently, and many more things.  
It was weird, and awful.  
So I went to have a talk with someone who could have maybe, through some fantasy like event, but this subscription for me.  
Mom.

  
""Yeah, it's been 20 years, after all."" she said, as she poured me some tea.  
""So the message...is real? You bought this for me?

She shook her head.  
""You could always prolong it, well, ask someone to prolong it for you.

I froze.  
""What was the price, mom?"" I asked.  
She gestured around her, and I paled.

  
Mom and dad split around the time I was 14...  
She lost her job a few years after that, but she had a side-hustle of selling knitted stuff, and her home-grown vegetables, through which, she still is able to live quite decently.  
""You sacrificed your happiness for mine?"" I asked.  
She laughed.  
""As any mother would do, I did indeed.  
Found this flyer, and thought it funny, but you were always alone, no friends, no dreams, no ambitions...  
I wanted you to be happy, so I tried it out.  
When I saw the price, I found it ridiculous, but a month after, you met David, with whom you are still best friends, while I found your dad with the neighbor's daughter in bed."" she smiled.  
I was horrified.

  
""So...my wife will leave me? The kids will hate me, how I hate dad?  
And I..."" I stuttered.  
She shook her head.

1l6czj7,mwof3fc,"The genie laughed in my face, catching me completely off guard. 

""You would curse me twice, human?"" 

The genie seemed to be laughing and crying at once, though no tears fell from its eyes. It completely diffused my anger. I was beyond confused. 

""What do you mean? Speak, demon!""

The genie wiped its luminescent face and looked at me, unleashing a torrent of speech that felt like black tar in my ears. It rattled my brain, and I sat down, feeling afraid. 

""Demon speech doesn't land well on human ears,"" the genie said. I guess I deserved that one. 

It considered me. I stared at the floor. 

""What do you think I do between masters, human? Do you think this lamp is a luxury palace? It is a factory where I must eternally slave away to create bounty for my next or previous master.""

I listened, but also *felt* what the genie told me. I sensed an ancient sorrow behind its words. 

""I was once like you. Thinking I was owed what I did not have. Long ago, I thought to curse a spirit like my current self. That spirit turned me into this. I laugh, because no matter how angry I am at you, I will not curse you as I've been cursed.""

I thought for a while. The genie was silent, which was new. It had tortured me since I had kicked its vessel, an old copper oil lamp, while exploring in the woods. My wishes had gone... poorly. 

""You're already doing that."" I said, obviously, as I *felt* an immense river of energy next to me, searing and hot. 

""Yes, mortal. Did you think my power arose from pure hopes and dreams? That your *desire* is so powerful as to manifest? That perhaps I'm not magical at all?""

I stared at the ground. I wasn't feeling like the avenging hero I had two minutes ago. 

""I didn't think about it. You hurt so many people."" I said this to  my shoelaces, which hadn't even hurt *me*. 

""Perhaps you should think of better wishes. I create nothing. I change balance points. When mortals die, and they do, the pain rushes back to me, and I languish in agony until my power is purified, waiting to be stolen and misused again."" 

I continued to stare at my shoes, wiggling my toes for something to do. The laces unraveled a bit. Thanks. 

""If I just wished for a sandwich..."" I began to say, not really hearing myself. 

""I would get hungry. I cannot die, so it would just be a fleeting pain. That would be if I were a young Genie. I am very old. I have stores enough for a sandwich.""

I stared at the unraveling knot of my shoelaces, and I realized for the first time that what I'd thought of as feeling anger or malice from the genie was actually *fear*. 

I inhaled, and decided on my fourth wish, pleased that the genie had denied my third. I wasn't sure where the words came from, but I could tell they were the right ones. 

""I wish that you could only grant wishes that produce an overall uplifting effect on the universe. That you will forever be bound to only work your magic in a way that never harms life, *or yourself*.""

I looked up at the genie, and saw with curiosity that it was genuinely crying. I didn't think it could do that. The tears fell to the ground of the cavern, and clumps of flowers burst into life where they struck. The genie had taken on a warm glow. It felt like sunshine.

It looked up at me. ""What have you done to me, mortal? I can grant you this wish... but only if I never stop granting it."" 

I watched as the genie seemed to gain and lose mass, shifting through colors. It somehow... brought me peace. 

""My curse was the opposite of what you just wished."" It said, seemingly also talking to my new ant friend. ""How can I still be here?"" 

""I don't know how you got here in the first place, champ."" I said, realizing that I had just changed the destiny of an immortal being, and I actually had no idea how. 

It stared at me, and I had an uncomfortable sense that wouldn't quite rise to the level of my knowing *why* I was uncomfortable. 

""No, you wouldn't remember yet, would you?"" It said. Its voice was calm, and I barely recognized it. 

""Remember what?"" I asked. 

The genie burst into laughter again, but this time the sound seemed to reverberate off the cavern walls, making them... ring. Like the whole cave was laughing. 

""I can't tell you!"" It laughed more, and it was so full of joy I couldn't be annoyed. It wiped its face, and looked me in the eye. ""Because it would harm you. You would go down a darker path...""

He stood with his mouth open, as if his computer had lagged, and then he smiled. 

""I *can't*"". It smiled more, and I could swear I felt sunlight beaming from its... whatever covered its body. ""It has been so very long since I could choose to not do something I didn't want to...""

I stared at the being that occupied the cave with me. I could *feel* its emotions, though from a long ways away. They were enormous. 

""What are you?"" I asked. 

""I don't know. I used to be a demon. Now... I simply have a desire to follow and help you, mortal. I will never be able to complete your wish. I will be granting it, eternally. And yet...""

It kicked the lamp that it had emerged from, and it sounded... hollow. Like it was just a piece of copper. 

""I no longer belong there."" It said, confidence in its voice. I was still watching my ant friend. ""I am something different, now.""

I looked up, and I couldn't help but cry. ""What did I do?""

""You gave me free will, mortal. To *help*.""",378,1749399602.0
1l6czj7,mwq0ze3,"The genie listened, and said, ""Sure,"" smirking, standing there, obviously not suffering anything.

I sighed, and then wearily looked at the genie, ""You really want to try pulling this shit? You're obviously not granting the wish right now, contrary to contract.""

""Oh, but I am. You just can't tell, with your puny mortal mind."" The genie replied haughtily.

""Ok, enough of this. I'm invoking the divine arbitration clause."" I replied.

""The what?"" Replied the genie, as a brilliant light shone down from above, and our surroundings changed, to a large, courtroom, with rolling clouds visible out the windows.

The judge, an angelic being with a halo above their judge's wig, banged their gavel, and announced, ""this session of divine arbitration has been called into session to investigate charges that the defendent, genie d'jinn...really? Your last name is d'jinn?"" The bewildered genie nodded, ""ok... well, that the genie has violated the terms of their summoning contract, by not granting a wish. Not even, by a twisted interpretation. Now, what does the defendant have to say for themself?""

""What? There's a contract? And how the heck did the mortal know it?"" Sputtered the genie.

""Well, of course there's a contract. It's written in fine print right on the outside of your lamp. You think I wouldn't read it? I mean, sure, getting it translated was a pain, but I did it."" I replied.

""Oh, shit."" The genie replied with wide eyes. ""So my trolling of mortals actually might have consequences for me?""

The heavenly judge sighed, and rubbed their palm against their face. ""I see, one of \*these\* cases. Ok. How about we just sentence the defendent to experiencing 1000 years of listening to nothing but the song 'Baby Shark' on repeat in an accelerated time pocket dimension, and then return them to your service mortal? Actual time passed for you won't be more than a day.""

""What?! NO!"" Screamed the genie, with terror in their eyes.

""I accept!"" I exclaimed, while the genie was sucked into a black void, from which the neverending notes of that cursed song could be heard.",52,1749417231.0

Hated myself.  
Was the immortality a lucky wish? Considering I am truly immortal, just that I will see the heat death of the universe?  
And this 3rd wish is the bad luck to counter it?

From the perspective of the person who summoned me “oh great genie, I am but a hungry boy. I wish to set a feast at this table before me!” I see me clap, and tons of servants come and set a glorious feast before the boy, the. The guards come in, and issue the boy away as the king comes in and sits at the table.

I sit and begin eating it, ignoring some banging on the door, but five minutes later, guards walk in with the king, and arrest me for eating in the kings new royal banquet hall.

So while I experience the torments, you will be stuck in my lamp. Fear not. While I experience these torments, time will be frozen, but your mind will be active as mine will.”

“Wait what?” And as I watch myself clap my hands, I feel pressed into the lamp, the emotionless timeless void. My regular state. No one has summoned me before. I didn’t know there was an outside. I return to enjoy my normal state not being bothered by people wanting wishes. I feel the time reset to a little over a week ago. And I sit here in the lamp, my mind blank enjoying the emptiness I have known for my entire life. 

A week later, I feel the time reset again, as the wisher has now experienced two weeks in the lamp. I two must experience two weeks in the lamp. But by the time it’s been two weeks, the wisher has experienced three weeks in the lamp. I love this state. Nice and easy. Endlessly.

""Hello, oh great and wise master! Since you have found my lamp, I am obligated to give you three wishes!"" The genie said, bowing. ""But beware what you wish for, lest it not turn out as you intended. Mwahahaha!"" The genie cackled, with an evil gleam in their eye.

My body was complaining about everything, despite the Potion of Rejuvenation I had imbibed earlier. It had been enough to let me get in and out,but I knew I would be regretting it tomorrow.

I didn't mind though. My prize was in my bag, hidden within a box I had crafted specifically for this. In its place I had left an identical looking ring, but one without anywhere near the level of power this one had. It would still make people uneasy near it, still whispering quiet words of corrupting influence. But that was all. A parlor trick. Nothing like the true Ring of Unlife.

It was cursed, something everyone knew. Wear it, and you would gain the ability to pull mana from the Endless Abyss. You would be beyond even an Archmage in strength, and with practice be able to call on the spirits of the dead. But in doing so, you would become a haunted existence. Your soul would possess your body, rather than live in it.

It was seen as a terrible fate. The longer you wore it, the more cursed you became. You would forget what it was like to live. You would find food unsatisfying, company distasteful. You would grow to hate that which you couldn't have, and turn into a monster. Only by being completely destroyed would you die, otherwise trapped in this half existence and reforming on simple death.

Yet I wanted it. I was already dying. Priests and clerics could do little for me now. I had months at best, most likely weeks after tonight. I didn't care about most things either. All I wanted was to craft things. To grow even further as an enchanter, and craft artifacts like this ring.

Finding my way back to my workshop, I slowly walked in. There was little ceremony for me, as I opened up my bag to retrieve the box. It seemed to ooze black smoke as I opened it, the ring sitting before me.

It was a band of silvery metal, with a sheen of green across its surface. A flattened skull grinned atop, two tiny onyxs set into its eye sockets. Staring at it I could hear faint laughter, with half whispers filling the air.

I didn't hesitate. It easily slipped onto my finger, cold metal clamping down almost painfully tight. A chill crept across me, as I felt it taking hold. The whispers became fully audible, echoing in my head. ""Another takes the Ring. What do you desire?""

I cupped it in my hand, holding tightly. ""I want your gift of unlife.""

The whispers laughed. ""Gift it is not. Curse it is. To want that in place of power is not yours to choose.""

The chill receded. The ring loosened, as it laughed. ""We find you unworthy. This power shall remain locked to you. Your body your own, for the short time you have left.""

My breath came rapidly, as I clutched it tighter. ""No, please! I want you. I need you!""

The whispers turned quieter, the connection fading. ""That you do. But we do not need you. You would squander us, thus we refuse you.""

Despite my grip, it slipped from my grasp. It landed on the floor, as smoke swirled once more. Its dark emittance covered it, as I found my body seizing up. All I could do was watch as the smoke heightened, before vanishing.

The Ring was gone, and with it, my hope of seeing the next year.",144,1749413671.0

Wind from one of the broken windows blew the flaps of his suit and whispered across his hands, which were turning white from how tightly he was holding his pistol. Light filtered in at awkward angles, but still managed to illuminate the room.

He was staring at 12 cuffed, chained, battered, bruised, and scarred men and women.  
Men and women that could only be mages, because what other use would an enchantment launderer have for trapped people?

One of the proper kitted DIG operators walked over, boots crunching on broken glass, before he too came to a stop and also stared.

""Oh, for Life's..."" He went quiet, and then turned to Faran. ""We've secured 4 suspects. Overwatch says there's at least one more upstairs. We're gonna smoke him out. You-"" The operator turned slightly to point at the other suit-and-tie agents in the adjacent room- ""and them are going to get the civs out.""

Nokov let out a breath, holstered his pistol, and looked over at the agents. ""Alright. Be safe up there.""

The operator just nodded before turning around and walking off.

**UHIN Headquarters, Capital Hosni**

Nokov tapped his chin with a pencil as he stared down at a map.  
It was rolled out on his desk, light shining on it from an overhead lamp.  
And it was a map of the Caln Nacin ""Reservation Center""- it wasn't anything but a few farmhouses- now known as the center of the Chael Ma Korros enchantment-and-mage trafficking business.

It was all so fucked up.  
Nokov had seen a lot in his 24 years of service, and even more in his 12-and-still-counting years at the Intelligence Network, but this was truly a nightmare.  
The last time Hosni had a problem with enchantments was in 1947, the year they officially became a legal problem as well...

That didn't matter. Nokov shook his head and went back to memorizing the map. DIG was organizing an attack on the Chael Ma Korros after a sales logbook pointed them towards the group as a long-time customer. It was also kind enough to list their location under ""ship to"".  
Suddenly, a knock. Then the door opened before he could answer.

""Agent Nokov, the raid's all together. Just waiting on you.""

Faran dropped the pencil before quickly getting out of his seat and putting on his jacket.  
""Well then, let's go.""",20,1749426001.0
1l6jyz9,mx08b1c,"I’m holding a simple grimoire. An old book with a black cover titled *The Principles of Magic*. Inside there’s a primer on how to cast magic, the daily rituals to train mind and body, the cosmological laws one needs to learn (in order to break them), and the existential truths one must learn to set their souls on a higher plane, to bring it all together. One could mistake it for any other of the countless grimoires that litter the world, but this one has a secret.

This book is actually a key, as in, you physically put it on a slot and open a door with it. This book specifically, not any other of the same size, shape and weight. Though it has no special marks or indentations, it works through a spell. A reversing spell that locks and opens the door. Sadly, this same spell has proven to be the bane of anyone that touches this book. You see the spell doesn’t simply reverse the lock on the door, instead it reverses the actions of the person holding it. If you want to turn right, you will turn left, if you want to run forward, you’ll go backwards. And that’s far from the worse part, if you want to eat, well, it’s not pretty, and what happens next is best left untold.

Anyway, you might be wondering what’s behind the door it opens, that’s anyone’s guess. What people do know is who made the door and the tower it belongs to, Gavus Telles. Among the great, he is the greatest, and he also happens to be my great, great, great, great grandfather. I even hold the name Telles still, but that didn’t give me access to this grimoire. The powers that be feared what might be hidden in the tower of forbidden magic, as they see it. What I see is a family heirloom, waiting to be claimed by a rightful heir.

My heist was a simple affair. Even if the people weren’t afraid of the grimoire and its curse, which they are, they would be certainly afraid of the tower it’s suppose to open. Everyone knows wizards riddle their towers with magical traps. The more powerful the wizard, the worse the traps and Gavus is to this day unmatched, if not in power, at least in reputation. This means the “most cursed book in the world” was actually an item on display on the college library, to be admired at a safe distance, even by the bravest. It took a simple 5 finger spell and legs that were faster than the librarian’s to secure the grimoire. Of course if I ever set foot in town again I’ll be jailed and trialled, but that won’t be a concern after I inherit the vast magical powers secreted away in the tower.",5,1749558937.0

**Cal Nacin Reservation Center, Kamanos**

A convoy of three vehicles- two armored DIG cars at the front and rear, one command truck in the center- drove down the road and towards a grouping of 4 farmhouses, the sun hanging lazily above the horizon.

Nokov was in the command truck, sitting in the back. The whole back of the truck was full of screens and keyboards, glowing screens and clicking keys.

The truck then slowly rolled off to the left, stopping at the side of the road, just a nice 60 meters from the target buildings. The car behind them kept on moving forwards, speeding up to follow behind the first.

One of the men inside the truck, Nokov didn't know who, switched on 8 screens. They glowed to life as static, before it went black again with the words ""connecting"". Then they suddenly flashed to helmet cam footage- 8 operators, four in each car, just looking around.

I looked around the padded white room, some sort of asylum? The light hurt my eyes, they felt dry, as if I hadn't slept well for days. My mouth was parched, and even my skin felt off. Like it was stretched too thinly over my body. I looked down at myself, and jagged lines covered my body. Like a corruption, they branched out, over my thighs and arms, something was wrong with me. My left hand looked awful, like something had ripped into it, but the wound was clean, and dry, the pain had long since faded. How did all of this happen?

""Welcome text subject 006, what is your name?"" A gentle voice spoke over the loud speaker. Had I been kidnapped, experimented on? What *is* my name... why can't it come to mind. ""I.. I can't remember my name, please just let me out.""

""What.. year is it for you?"" The voice on the other ended sounded more confused. There was something about my answers that they didn't like. ""What do you mean by that? It's 2017, right?""

There was a sigh heard over the speaker. ""It's been eight years since then, five since the virus entered into the population. Do you remember anything else? Any time spent beyond high school, or trying to survive the threat."" None of this made any sense to me. What threat? What virus?

1l6f7n8,mwpzzwv,"I slowly open my eyes, the lights in the room blinding me at first. I squeeze them closed again and moan…wait, that moan don’t sound right. I crick my head side to side and feel a strange weight swing behind me. I crack my eyes open slowly letting the light slowly filter in like I did after a wild night out in collage. The smells in the room are sharp, a lingering smell of rot like dead cattle found after a week or two, but still there.

I hear someone talking, trying to get my attention. As I swing my head to the direction of the voices, I slowly start to pick up the words. Recognition set in as I start to understand what is being said.

“I can hear you, even understand what you’re saying mostly.” I say, my own voice sounding off but recognizable…somewhat. “Did I fall into a coma?” I ask. One of the technicians, a young woman of no more than 20 turns to the doctors before answering me.

“Thank goodness you’re coming back. You were one of the first to do so, so quickly too.” She smiles at me in a friendly way. “We will bring you up to speed about what happened in a bit, but the doctors here would like to ask you some questions if that’s alright miss.”

‘Miss???’ I think, eyes frozen  and unblinking for a few moments while my mind wraps around that. “What do you mean Miss? I’m a guy.” I say but the pitch of my voice is off. I can’t put my finger on it just yet, but it almost sounded like my sisters. “OMG!!!I have a girls voice.” I scream in panic, starling everyone in the room. A nurse grabs something, a hypodermic I notice and quickly comes to the bed I’m laying on. I dive to the other side, head swimming with the sudden movement. “S…stay away from me.” I stutter, eyes wide with fear. “ I don’t know what you did to me but you won’t get away with any more.”

The e tech girl looks confused as the doctor puts a hand on her shoulder. “Sorry about this. My name is Doctor Eldridge. You were one of the first to be captured 10 years ago and held in a stasis like sleep after the zombie outbreak. Your body was so desiccated and rotting from the virus we couldn’t tell if you were man or woman, ape or human. You became our earliest patient treating the virus, and a successful one if your recovery is any indication. However, it seem there were some unknown…side effects. You currently appear to be a young woman near Becca here’s age. Tell me what do you remember before waking up?” He asks in a soothing calm voice.

I think hard, bits and pieces slowly coming into focus and memories sift thru my adrenaline fueled mind. “I remember being at an alumni football game for my college, class of 1999.” I say, the nurse and Becca’s face showing shock.

“But that would make you over 80 years old.” The nurse mumbles.

‘80 years old?’ My mind snags that like a trap. “What do you mean over 80 years old? How long have I been here?” I ask. The shock of the thought making me nervous…very nervous.

“Your recovery seems to have some connection to the female XX gene that lay dormant in males after puberty. The good news is you are a healthy young individual with a long life ahead of you, but how long we don’t know. The other news is you are biologically a woman now. This was never even a theoretical possibility during lab tests. Most peculiar.” The Doctor explains, while Becca slips up next to me and takes my hand in a move to show compassion and reassurance.

‘I’m a woman now?’ Repeats over and over in my head. If it weren’t for Becca’s hand in my grip I would be a mess mentally, but knowing someone, even someone I didn’t even know, was there by my side seemed to be enough for the time being.",40,1749416919.0

1l6c8vw,mwoddko,"I had planned it out perfectly - my young mind had decided to wait, wait until the day before I turned fifteen. Now at the old age of 34, they took me away for a talk. ""You must never choose,"" they said. A cruel twist of fate - it wasn't my fault that I had fallen into this state. And yet, there was no empathy, no sympathetic look on their faces as they took my arm, stabbing it before I fell unconscious.

What was life like without powers? That was the question everyone I met asked me once they learned of my... condition. Flying up to me, teleporting behind me, doing all sorts of things I could only dream of doing only to pester me with questions, questions I didn't want to think about. Of course, defying the orders I had given were unthinkable. The leaders were the only ones allowed to choose their power later than 15, and none of us normal citizens knew just how strong they were.

It was hard to find work, of course, or live at all. I provided no use, merely just an expendable body used for the worst jobs. I did find a small group of people though, people in my situation. We formed something you could call friendship, but I always just saw it as a lifelong pity party we could all partake in. Wasting and drinking our life away.

We frequented several places that could stand to serve people like us. Cheap drink, people with no questions, etc. It was at one of our daily outings that my tongue slipped. In a drunken stupor, the words just fell out of my mouth, built up and begging to be free after years of this hell. ""I wish I could just disappear."" I didn't think much of it as I left with my friends, only for them to ignore me. Confused and intoxicated, I struck them down. Or tried to, at least. It passed right through them. Thinking I was just too wasted, after a few more attempts I just collapsed at home.

Only the next day did I realize my mistake - I had gotten my power. Frantically, I tried to check the records - but I couldn't. I was like a ghost, fading away with no presence on the earth. I was 55 at the time. Was it 4 or 400 times stronger than other's powers, I had no clue. But I soon realized that there was no trace of my existence. The world didn't know me.

1l6c8vw,mwofvvq,"My name is Jiu, and I am the king of unusual experiences. 

Born in Jamaica, raised in England, and attending high school in the States— I had never felt like I fully belonged anywhere. Both of my parents were military, so I never had the same accent as the others, even if I grew up alongside them. It wasn't until I started at Lincoln Valley High that people didn't immediately question my origins. And even then, it became apparent to anyone who knew me over a short length of time that I had lived a different life than most. That made it difficult, albeit not impossible, to make friends. 

Especially considering I was one of the few to have withheld my Classification all the way up to 14. 
There are many Classifications to choose from, and I was always an indecisive boy. Each class had different attributes that I found enticing. Even more exciting was the prospect of increased growth if one could be patient and choose their class later in life. See, you could choose your power at ten years old, as most in life did. You'd pick your class, grow modestly, and cap with a class evolution. 

For instance, my father chose the Soldier class when he was 11 years old. He was endowed with enhanced physical stamina, strength, and an ability to take it on the chin and shrug it off. His growth continued as he trained in the army, and then his class changed at 25 years old, just a few months before I was born. He moved from the Soldier class into the Veteran class.

His stats jumped. His abilities improved threefold. He unlocked the ability to choose three weapons of any kind and instantly master them. My mother said he was the happiest she'd seen him since their wedding day. He reached his capstone ability, which was enhanced awareness, and his growth stopped. He was happy enough, but wondered what would have happened if he had chosen a few years later.

Well, I am Jiu. I am the king of unusual experiences. 

And as consciousness flooded my brain, and the beeps from my heart monitor dragged me back to reality, the memory of what had happened to me trickled in— slowly at first. 

>""I told you to stay the hell away from her, didn't I?"" Elgine asked as he started toward me. 

I was in a hospital. I was recovering. I opened my eyes and stared at a nurse who was cleaning something next to my bed. I let my head fall to the side and groaned; it was all I could do to indicate that I was awake. She turned and gasped, wide-eyed, dramatically dropping her clipboard. Without another word, she darted out of the room.

My mouth was so dry.

In seconds, the room was full; standing room only. People clamored around my bed, quietly but excitedly, as I looked around the room. 

But their faces faded away as that trickling memory strengthened into a swiftly coursing river of remembrance. 

>""You don't own her,"" I answered. ""She doesn't even like you.""

>His friends emerged from their hiding places. The glow of the moonlight illuminated the pipes and rods they were holding in their hands. Their faces were emotionless, but their intent was clear. 

>""Elgine,"" I lifted my hands as I started to back away. ""Are you for real? You're gonna beat me up over this? I haven't even picked a class yet, and you need all your friends for this?"" I was shaking, and it became evident in my voice. I was too far from my house to run. I'd never make it.

>Elgine shrugged and smiled. ""I guess it's the only language you'll understand.""

""Can you hear my voice, Jiu?"" asked the nearest doctor as he leaned in close to my face. He was an older Indian man with deep valleys in his face and spicy breath. ""Do you understand me?"" he asked. ""Blink twice for yes.""

I blinked twice, and the room became giddy with excitement. 

""Excellent, you're doing good, Mr. Davis. Very good,"" he added. ""Follow my finger with your eyes."" 

After a long series of simple tests like that, he explained to me that I had been jumped and beaten nearly to death, and that through modern miracles of science and medicine, they'd been able to keep me from dying. 

""Those boys were caught,"" he informed me. ""They confessed and spent 7 years in a juvenile correction facility.""

I stopped him and croaked out the first words I was able. ""How long?""

He sighed and looked to the others in the room before returning his gaze to me. ""Jiu. This will not be easy to accept. I want you to brace yourself. I believe you are of sound enough mind at this moment to handle this information."" He paused and swallowed. 

""You have been in a coma for 20 years. It is the year 2025. And you are 34 years old.""

I didn't even know what to make of that in the seconds after he said it. Too many thoughts fought for the forefront of my mind. Had I aged? What did I look like? Were my parents still alive? 

""This is a lot to take in, I understand,"" said the doctor. ""We will give you a little space here and then we'll come back in to talk about your recovery, okay? Your family has been notified, and they are on their way. We will allow them in two at a time."" He patted my leg twice and smiled at me. ""Welcome back to the world, Jiu.""

Everyone was talking in hushed whispers as they left the room in a single-file line.

In the moments that followed, all of my shock and curiosity began burning away to a fiery hatred for Elgine and his friends. I gritted my teeth as tears of rage slid down my cheeks. My heart monitor picked up in pace as I began breathing heavily. 

And then, in a brief moment of clarity, I remembered something: I was classless. 

The longer I thought about it, the more it occurred to me that I could do something very few have ever done— and never to this extreme. 

""I'd like to choose a classification,"" I announced into the empty room.

The menu appeared in front of my face as it had many times before when I had considered taking a class. But there were new options here I'd never seen before.

There were always 10. Soldier, Berserker, Fighter, Healer, Veilrunner, Flamecaller, Frostwalker, Stormbinder, Essence Channeler, and Summoner.

But there were two more now: Savior and Destroyer.
They didn't have any class descriptions. With rage still burning in my veins, fists balled, and teeth clenched, I made my selection. 

""Destroyer.""

Why am I here?  
Why are there words on those pillars?  
Then more information comes.  
I pale.

  
A coma?  
I have been in a coma for 20 years?  
And instead of choosing my power at 15 like everyone else, I can now choose it at 34?  
Because the older you are when you choose it, the stronger it is, I can choose 3 really amazing powers?  
Sounds great.  
The pillars read powers as such:  
Immortality - not-aging, or falling ill, and wounds heal fast, being extremely hard to be killed by external factors.  
God-presence - people easily taking liking to me, love me, and even worship me. I can influence those around me easily.  
Technomancy - I can understand, and create technology beyond normal means.  
All great, but useless to me...  
After all, none can give me back my childhood...my life.

  
I stand in the room, and in the end, choose Immortality.  
After all...if I had this, I wouldn't have fallen in a coma, right?

I had been standing vigil over her body for two days in the royal crypt. Tomorrow, the third, she would be sealed in her stone sarcophagus among her ancestors. I hadn't slept, had barely ate. My mind wandered within itself as my body performed this task.

Suddenly, I heard a long, rattling breath come from within the dark, stone coffin.. I spun around quickly, my sword drawn, to try and peer into the queen's sarcophagus. My body didn't want to move. Whether it was from inaction or fear, my legs were rooted in place.

""Sir Hastur, why did you betray me?"" a voice hissed from within. A voice that was cloaked in shadows.

I could not see the source of the voice. I did not want to see the source of the voice.

""Sir Hastur,"" the voice said again. ""Why did you kill me, your beloved queen?""

My body shook with the effort, but I was finally able to take a step toward the voice.

""Your queen, whom you loved so dearly. Why did you plunge your dagger into my heart?""

""Y-you are not my queen! She is dead. You are nothing but a remnant. A shadow!""

Suddenly, she sat up. I could just make out the details of her face hidden behind her funeral shroud.

She let out a dry cough that might have been a chuckle. ""Sir Knight, you betrayed your queen. You betrayed me, the woman you swore your life to all those years ago.""

""You are not her!""

""Am I not?"" That dry cough, again. ""If this is how you uphold your vow to me, how will you serve my daughter, the new queen?""

""Silence!"" My body finally burst into action and I swung my sword. It cut cleanly through the thing's neck, separating head from body. Both dropped back into the sarcophagus.

Another dry cackle came from with the coffin. ""It will take more than that, Sir Hastur. It will take more than you are capable of.""

I grabbed a lantern from its sconce and began to pour oil on the body. ""I have all night to fulfill my final vow.""",127,1749406878.0
1l6gs4o,mwpz6fo,"All was quiet. I shifted my weight to alleviate the pressure on my feet. I consciously checked my knees to ensure they weren't locked. Many a good watchman had passed out after locking his knees. That wouldn't be me, not tonight. I slowly drew in a deep, full chest of air, careful not to let my armor stir. I pulled my shoulders back and allowed a smile to crack on my otherwise stony face.

The queen's tomb was beautiful. Crafted from the finest materials in all the world by the kingdom's most skilled craftsmen, the tomb would surely be a national treasure for centuries to come. She was the most beloved ruler in our collective memory. Soft and patient with a kindly face, she had ruled with strength and valor. Her acts of bravery in defending the kingdom were legendary. Her skills in negotiations and diplomacy were unmatched. Her beauty was renown in ways that bordered on mythical. Many a prince and king had traveled from every corner of the world to seek her hand in marriage, but she had never wed. Her closest advisors claimed it was because she never found a suitor who would be a good fit for the kingdom. Now I gazed down at the carving of her gentle, peaceful face on the lid of her tomb and I wondered if perhaps she had never found true love and so had been cursed to die alone.

I sighed. Sympathetic tears gathered in my eyes and when I blinked I felt one trickle along the side of my nose. I knew what it was to be alone, but I could not comprehend the feeling of dying alone. She had always been so personally kind to me, smiling at me in passing and treating me with a warmth and care that made other guards jealous. I sniffled softly in my loneliness.

Again I straightened my back and puffed up my chest. I was proud to be one of just three royal guards appointed to watch over her tomb in this turbulent time. The departed queen's family was squabbling endlessly for control of the kingdom despite the queen's wishes that a parliament be assembled in order to enact a more democratic government. The parliament had convened two days ago and their arguments still pounded through the great oak doors that held them in the castle's great hall. I had walked by on occasion and...

Thump. I jumped and quickly drew my sword.

""Ow."" A muffled voice groaned. It sounded like it came from behind the tomb.

My excited heart rattled in my chest as I whirled around and scanned the throne room. I kept my stance wide and my sword at the ready as I circled around the gilded marble and jewel trimmed sarcophagus. Candle light danced off the finely cut precious stones, catching my eye as I scanned for whatever thief, conspirator, or prankster was lurking in the shadows.

The tomb's lid budged a little, accompanied by a smooth grinding sound. I heard a feminine, gentle voice grunting.

""Who's there?"" I commanded, completing a circle around the tomb.

""Help me get out of here,"" the muffled woman said, straining. Granite scraped against granite again.

I looked and saw that the lid seemed to be moving on its own. I gasped and stared at the great and beautiful covering as it inched longwise toward the foot of the tomb. I rushed to the head and saw fingertips reaching out through a narrow gap, grasping at the edge of the lid.

""My queen!"" I exclaimed, quickly sheathing my sword. I moved to the side and grabbed the top portion, planting my feet firmly on the polished stonework floor.

With a few coordinated exertions, we managed to slide the lid back enough for the queen to slide up and sit. She was holding a spot on her forehead and squinting. The room was dimly lit by an array of candles as part of the ongoing vigil. In the dim light, she looked exceptionally beautiful for a dead woman.

She groaned, still rubbing her forehead. Then she pulled her hand away and inspected it, still peering through the narrow slits of her mostly closed eyelids.

I stared at her. My chest could barely contain my heart or excitement. It was as though horror and elation were waging war inside me, and all I could manage to do was gawk at the reanimated corpse of my beloved queen. Suddenly my senses seized hold of me and my armor rattled as I fell to a knee, bowing my head.

She let out an exasperated sigh. ""Rise,"" she ordered. Her tone caught me off guard. Was she annoyed at me?

I struggled to my feet, my knees shaking and faltering under less weight than I had carried into dozens of battles.

She looked me up and down quickly. There was a subtle bruise on her forehead. I had seen the flesh of many dead bodies before, and her flesh was nothing like that of the dead. She was vibrant and glowing, as though freshly awakened from an afternoon nap. Her eyes locked with mine and she stared at me full of puzzlement and curiosity. Then her eyes widened and her jaw went slack. ""You!"" she cried, recoiling. ""You!""

""Me, your highness?"" I choked breathlessly. I staggered back.

""Why did you betray me?"" She clasped a hand to the exposed skin of her chest, just above the plunging neckline of her burial gown. Her soft lips remained parted out of shock and she waited for my answer impatiently holding her breath.

Neither of us moved. My mind reeled. Betray her? I was among her most faithful guards. I opened my mouth to protest with those exact words, but something in her eye stayed my tongue. It wasn't just surprise and expectation that contorted her face. Tears warbled in her eyes, longing twisted her brow, and sadness had abated her breath.

Her hand fell toward me from her breast and she extended it, palm up. ""How could you keep your love from me these many years?""

""I..."" My lips trembled. ""I always loved you,"" I whispered.

""I know,"" she replied, her voice shaking. ""So why didn't you act on that love?""

""I did!"" I gasped. ""I served you with all my heart until the very end.""

""I didn't want your service,"" she sobbed through a pained smile.

""I didn't know. How was I to know? I was your royal guard.""

""You saw the way I looked at you,"" she said. ""We exchanged many a warm smile in the halls of this castle, in the hunting fields, and on the numerous roads of our travels.""

""Yes, but..."" My voice trailed off. ""How could I have known? It would have been a great risk to me and my career to..."" A pang of regret cut deeply into my heart and I was left too breathless to speak. My eyes were stinging and I felt a burning behind my face.

The queen's eyes fell. ""Indeed, I am in part to blame.""

I began to stagger toward her, reaching a hand to take hers.

She pulled back. ""You cannot touch me,"" she warned.

I stopped short. ""Why?"" I asked, tears streaming down my face.

She shook her head and smiled with the hurt of heartbreak. ""I'm sorry that I was too cowardly to tell you how I felt.""

The thumping of my heart echoed in my head. ""No,"" I whispered. ""No...""

Overhead a powerful beam of light fell down on the queen as though the heavens themselves had parted. I shielded my eyes with a forearm and stumbled back, squinting against the harshness of the blinding light.

Her voice came again, this time distant and penetrating deep in my core. ""I love you.""

I sobbed, fluids leaking out of every part of my face. I could feel the light against my skin like a steady, clean wind. Its intensity somehow increased and I closed my burning eyes, gasping and weeping and moaning in agony.

At last the light faded. In place of its brilliant intensity there was emptiness and darkness. All was still. I slowly opened my eyes and lowered my arm. Once my eyes had adjusted to the dark I could see that the queen was gone. I rushed to the opening in the tomb and looked inside, but it was empty. I glanced frantically around. I was alone.

I heard the echo of a thump as the throne room doors were opened. They creaked and I heard footsteps. A couple of robed monks shuffled in, hurrying along with purpose. When they arrived they both stared at me and the partially open tomb, looked at each other with wide eyes, and rushed to the opening by my side. One of them spoke. ""What have you done with the queen's body?""

Too stunned to speak, my mouth hung open without offering anything of value.

""What manner of conspiracy is this?"" the other monk asked, glaring at me.

Determined to defend myself, I once again opened my mouth to speak, but I could not make a sound. Nothing would issue forth from my throat but hollow air. I put a hand to my neck and tried again. Nothing. I patted it, squeezed it, moved it about. No sound. I began to panic.

""Go,"" one said to the other. ""Fetch guards to arrest this traitor.""

I put a hand on his shoulder, shaking my head. Tears flowed again. I pleaded with him through my eyes and the pain in my face.

The other monk hesitated. I looked at him, still bearing my pleadings in the slant of my brow and the tears on my cheeks.

""Go,"" the first said again.

I fell on the carved likeness of the queen's body, throwing my arms around her while I waited for the guards to come and arrest me.",21,1749416658.0
1l6gs4o,mwqfz47,"""Why did you betray me?"" Her voice. Undeniably her. I turn slowly to see my late queen sitting up.

""My queen..."" My voice quavered. Our training covered this possibility. The same magic that assisted with a wise rule made it hard for their spirits to let go after death. But the rules were strict, and the toll was not trivial.

She stared at me with those dead eyes, her authority demanding an answer, and an answer I didn't have. I bowed low, then straightened and took a lit candle from its place on the sconce, setting it to the ornate rope in the neighboring alcove. A woosh as the flame caught the wax coated rope and started climbing through to the signal above.

Replacing the candle, I held onto my medallion, the symbol of my office, of my duty, of my oath. ""I did not betray you my queen. Lord Almar forfeited his life in the 23rd year of your reign for that betrayal."" It was a hidden secret to the public, but well known to the guard that she had a severe case of dementia before the end. It was surprising that it would carry over after death. The physicians might appreciate knowing it is an illness that affects the spirit as well. If it was possible to inform them.

""Almar. Yes. He was such a lovely man. A bit too handy with the servants though.""

With one hand on the medallion, I used the other to draw a symbol in the air, a shimmering trace. I could feel the inscription on the medallion begin to burn into my hand as the magic was triggered. I knew the words there so well. Sequi ad Mortem. To follow to death. Almost everyone believes it meant our loyalty is constant to the point of death of our liege. Not quite. We knew the cost it meant.

""Where is he now? I told him to meet me last night.""

I continued the ritual, forming the web of magic between the anchors in the room. My hands moving from decades of daily practice. Muscle memory necessary. ""Lord Almar was indisposed Your Highness."" The fire in my hand searing now. I was almost done.

""He wasn't as good in bed as any of the others."" Her tone was disappointed.

Briefly, my hands froze at the implications of what she meant. But the ritual had to continue. There was no other possibility.

""We used to make Hanlar watch,"" the disgust in her voice was apparent.

I kept going, although extremely troubled by her words. I wanted to dismiss them as the dementia. But we all knew it was an illness of memory loss, not an illness of memory fabrication. She was the betrayer. Whispered rumored and darkness dismissed at the time, started to fill in the blanks and make sense. Still, I must continue. There is nothing to gain from trying to prosecute the dead.

""No one but he and I knew that Hanloss wasn't his son.""

The pause was much longer this time. If the lineage was broken, the kingdom was at great risk, to say nothing of all my order. I looked at her again, grief staining my soul. 

""Why did you betray me?""

I didn't. I never had. And I wouldn't now, even if she believed that I was. I continued the ritual. Thinking fast. The order had to be warned, the sacred barriers rewoven to account for this. ""My queen, I live but to serve. I could not betray you.""

There was a prohibition against outside communication. Only the lit signal to communicate the current event and its final conclusion. Even now my order would be rushing to play its part. But I must warn them. Somehow.

""You said you would save me from the afterlife.""

That is an odd statement. My work quickened, there was only one chance to leave a message. Even though it would be years before it could be received, probably. Hopefully, although hopefully not. ""We are all granted reprieve my queen.""

She opened her mouth to reply once again, but I had finished. The magic from the medallion burst through my hand in an agony, igniting the web of magic I had traced in the air. A blue fire filled the room in a flash, and my free hand came down to rest on her body's head, passing through the spirit.

My voice remained silent, as the 52 years of discipline demanded, despite the emotion flowing, the horrific pain. My body fell to the floor, limp. My spirit stared into hers, only the first stage of pain fading. I opened my arms and stepped forward to embrace her as the look of horror swept through.

""Betrayer!"" She screamed, as I, my spirit, carried her through the barrier into the afterlife.

---------

It was some time before the crypt fell cool and silent. The signal rope extinguished but not destroyed. Above, the guard signalled honor to a long life of service to, and through, death before drifting away to let the dead rest. Below, etched in a blue fire on one wall, the words ""True the barriers blood.""

Someday they might be seen in the darkness and dust.",15,1749422207.0
1l6gs4o,mwrvfzb,"The cold air, wafting up from the ninth circle, fills the hall. Candles flicker like dream-shrouded eyelids as the spirts of those unjustly killed begin to stir.

I look at her face; serene and pale and beautiful, until moments ago frozen for eternity. The embalmers did well. No trace remains of the dripping foam like thunderclouds, the bloody tears pouring across her face.

She waits for an answer, she waits for closure. Anxious and unsure in death. Whoever said that the dead could see all crimes laid bare? There is no peace beyond the grave. My master has seen to it.

A low smirk stretches on my face. ""We all have a role to play in the great game. Some are pawns. Some are sacrifices. Some choose. Some are chosen.""

Still, there is no comprehension in her unliving, beautiful eyes. For a long while, she does not ask, and I do not answer. Blood freshly spilt at the gate sends the candles into another wave of trembling. In my mind's eye, I see my brothers hurtle the guards to their doom in the moat, their death shrieks raising the alarm far too late.

The drawbridge falls with a distant crash that lifts the dust from the floor and returns the smoke from the ceiling. At last, she begins to understand, as I imagine the clatter of claws on cobblestone. Somewhere, a bell begins to clang.

""More life will be snuffed out this night. Yours was merely the prologue to the master's grand designs.""

Her eyes shut and then open again. ""How long?""

""Since the beginning. Since the grassy shores of the lake. From our childhood, throughout the long years, my dagger was always ready to strike. Whenever, wherever the call might come.""

A single, marring tear leaks forth, trailing blood down to her lips. The first candles go out without a sound.

""Was it ever real?""

More candles vanish, plunging the room to the midnight dark. I step back into shadow, a finger upon my lips. ""Sleep, my queen. Justice is served. The time has come. My people are free once more. The future, your people, your realm, are no longer your concern.""",8,1749441212.0
1l6gs4o,mwqb1yg,"""Betrayed you? You're the who one who betrayed me! It wasn't enough that you cheated on me. No, you tried to have me killed, you heartless beast!"" I angrily yelled, while getting up from the chair that had been placed in the crypt.

Her pallid looking form tried to get up, but realized something was wrong. Looking down, it realized it was bound with ropes.

""I realize our marriage was arranged, and that neither of us loved the other, but really, having those bandits kidnap me, and torture me for information and funds. And then try to have me killed, so your bastard son would get my title? That's too far."" I said, as I took a step closer, her corpse illuminated in the torchlight.

""Unfortunately for you, the bandits were easily swayed by gold. And once I bought them out, and got them to talk, it was apparent what you had done. Unfortunately for me, the state got to you first. And what they gave was too good for you. A simple beheading. A noble's execution.""

I took one step closer, drawing my sword. The stitches reconnecting her head back to her corpse were visible. Her cloudy eyes moved in her dead face. ""It was nothing personal...just business.""

""No. It's not enough to have you killed by the state. What you did, you made it personal. The pain, the suffering I endured. I will only be satisfied if you meet your end at my hand."" I said, raising my sword. ""It's why I had your corpse sutured back together, why I had it bound. And finally why I hired that necromancer to cast 'raise dead' on you.""

""So you could experience the powerlessness that I did, and so that I could experience what I have been craving ever since then."" My sword glinted in the torchlight. ""Revenge."" My sword came down.",7,1749420509.0
1l6lxuo,mwq38we,"My grandfather has been missing for two years to the day.

I sigh sadly to myself, he just suddenly disappeared without a trace. No matter how far or where we looked, not nary a clue was discovered. I sit glumly in his lab, the cobwebs cover almost every nook and cranny. It felt like yesterday that this place was full of energy, grandpa worked in here tirelessly, trying to make the next big thing.

I always wondered what his latest project was, the old man was going on about creating portals or something. None of us paid attention to his ramblings when he was around, we just thought of him as a cooky old man. If only we listened maybe he would still be here.

Picking up some of his devices the memories came back, so many inventions and not one worked. I laugh internally picking up his little helper robot that only knew how to knock over glasses and the banana peeler that somewhere made bananas harder to peel.

One device was peculiar though, I don't remember grandpa having a flashlight, messing with it in my hand, didn't bring back any memories. 

""Well there is only one way to see what this does"" I spoke to myself.

Flicking it on and facing the wall, instead of a beam of light something else appeared. A deep dark hole, filled with raving eyes, fear overtook me upon seeing this. Before I had a chance to turn it off, something slinked out.

A tentacle grabbed my foot and started to drag me. Raving on the ground towards the portal, it became very apparent what happened to my grandpa. It only took a couple of seconds and I was gone without a trace.",14,1749417954.0
1l6lxuo,mwq3wyw,"There's a buzzing in my head. Like a thousand beetles are walking through my mind. I close my eyes to get the buzzing to stop, but it just gets worse. The eyes. The tentacles. I can still see them with my eyes closed.

I had dropped the strange flashlight when whatever happened...happened. I open my eyes but keep them steadfastly on the ground, searching for the flashlight. I follow the dust motes floating through the beam of not-light to find it wedged under my grandfather's workbench. I quickly get on my hands and knees to grab it.

Is there something starting to wrap around my ankle? I don't dare turn to look. Like the buzzing in my mind, I can't tell if it's really there or not. I don't wait to find out. As soon as my hand grabs the flashlight, I pull it to me and switch it off.

Instantly, the buzzing stops. The feeling around my ankle disappears. The eyes are gone. But there's an *emptiness* now. It feels like a void in my soul.

I feel eyes watching me. Movement on the edge of my vision. I turn quickly and bring the flashlight up to reveal what lurks in the shadows.

I stop myself at the last moment. I almost turned this infernal flashlight back on.

*But I want to turn it on.* The buzzing calmed something in my brain that I didn't know was there. The eyes looked at my soul and judged me worthy.

Worthy of what? I don't know. *I don't care.* Just that I am worthy.

Worth more than this dusty old, forgotten workshop left to me in my grandfather's will. Maybe that's why he left it to me. Only I could understand what it means to be worthy.

I realize that I'm crying.

I click the flashlight on again. The buzzing returns. I smile.

*Yes. I am worthy.*",8,1749418172.0
1l6lxuo,mwqbk25,"The dust-choked air of my grandfather's workshop hung heavy with secrets. Three years since his mysterious disappearance, and the family whispered he had dabbled in forces beyond understanding. I never believed them—until today.

On his workbench sat what appeared to be a flashlight, but unlike any I'd seen. Etched with arcane symbols, wrapped in copper wire that pulsed with an unexplainable energy, crystal fragments embedded in its casing. The metal felt unnaturally cold against my skin.

""What did you discover, Grandpa?"" I whispered into the silence.

With trembling fingers, I pressed the switch.

No beam of light emerged. Instead, the darkness before me seemed to fold inward, creating what could only be described as a tear in the fabric of reality itself—a perfect circle of absolute void against the workshop wall. The edges rippled like water disturbed by an unseen stone.

My grandfather's journal had warned of thin places—where our world and others pressed close enough to breach. Had he found such a place? Or worse, created one?

From within the darkness, movement. Then eyes—dozens of them, glowing with an otherworldly phosphorescence. Some blinked in patterns, perhaps communicating in code I couldn't comprehend. Others remained fixed on me with an intelligence that felt ancient and hungry.

The temperature plunged. My breath clouded before me. The void seemed to pulse, expanding slightly with each throb. One set of eyes drew closer to the threshold between worlds.

I was witnessing what my grandfather had—the moment before his disappearance. In seconds, I would face whatever entity had taken him from us.

The first creature emerged from the void.

A cockroach. An ordinary, disgusting cockroach.

I blinked, confused. Then another appeared. And another. Soon dozens were pouring from what I now realized was simply a hole in the wall—a hole that had appeared completely black in the dim workshop light.

I fumbled for the light switch. When the overhead fluorescents flickered on, I saw the truth: hundreds of cockroaches had colonized the rotted drywall. Their bodies, packed tightly together, had created the illusion of a bottomless void. The ""eyes"" were merely light reflecting off their shiny carapaces.

One particularly bold roach scuttled up my sleeve, and my bloodcurdling scream of cosmic terror transformed mid-wail into a disgusted ""GAAAHH! GET IT OFF!""

As I danced around, frantically flicking insects from my clothing, I knocked over a shelf of old paint cans.

Standing there—covered in paint, surrounded by fleeing roaches, clutching a perfectly ordinary flashlight with a dead battery—I could almost hear my grandfather's laughter.

""I don't need an exorcist—I need an exterminator.""

I backed toward the door, already dialing Pest Control on my phone, with one clear thought:

""I really need to clean this place.""",5,1749420680.0

Not his fault though.  
This is the 3rd time a princess has been kidnapped in 90 years, by a dragon.  
I would want some answers as well.  
And I have.  
""There can be multiple reasons for a dragon to kidnap a princess, my Lord, other than for ransom."" I said.  
""What are they?!"" he screamed.  
I sighed.

  
""We will start with the most unlikely: for fun.  
Dragons might enjoy the thrill, and the chaos they leave behind such acts."" I said.  
The king rolled his eyes.  
Yeah, hard to believe.  
""Another possibility might be: love.  
Either the dragon fell in love with the princess, or wants the princess to sire him some offspring.  
It's been documented that dragons can basically breed with any species, even golems."" I said.  
The king paled.  
""Continue."" he said.  
I nodded.

  
""If not for these reasons, then it could be to affect our kingdom's image, and luck.  
As you know, while intangible, Luck is real, and so is reputation.  
Having a member of the royal family kidnapped from our own palace can damage us reputation.  
How weak are we to allow such a thing? How weak we are to not retaliate immediately?  
All our actions are now under scrutiny."" I said.  
He nodded.  
""That's the reason my ministers came up with as well.  
Anything else?"" he asked.  
""The dragon might know more than we do."" I said.  
The king frowned.

  
""Your meaning?"" he asked.  
""The Princess might have a power we have yet to discover, that is valuable to even a dragon.  
Or a bloodline, or has awakened a trait that allows her to do something that the dragon requires.  
Or...maybe she resembles someone from ages ago, and the dragon got nostalgic, though this is close to the 2nd reason I mentioned."" I said.  
He sighed.  
""Regardless...we have only one realistic course of action, don't we?"" he muttered.  
I nodded.  
""Go. Take some knights, and mages, and bring her back.  
And on your way back..."" he started.

1l6wv6z,mwt6418,"”What did you just say?” The young girl stared incredulously at the creature before her. A bright pink thing that almost looked like a cat was floating right in front of her very eyes. 

”I know this very hard to believe but there is an evil-” 

She cut of the fluffy beast before it could repeat itself. ”-An evil force that wants to destroy this world. I heard what you said, I just don’t believe such nonsens.” She crossed her arms angrily. 

”You’re well spoken for someone your age. Such brilliance is another sign that you are meant to cure this world from all evil!” 

Never had she thought that this new chance at life would lead to this. After she was defeated by that knight in her own castle, killed on her throne. The queen of ice slain by the sword of fire. When the blade pierced her stomach she knew it had to be her downfall. 

She had been in for a surprise when she awoke to this ’modern’ world. 

”Look, I’m not the right person for that. What was your name? Wait- actually, don’t tell me. I don’t want to know. You need to give this ’gift’ to someone else.” 

”Not possible! You and only you can make use of my powers. I will be on your side until the end.” 

This couldn’t be right. She sighed and dragged a hand through her messy black hair. Couldn’t this creature see her displeasure over this situation? 

”Are you really stuck with me forever?” As soon as she’d asked she thought of another question. ”Wait, did you say that I can use your powers?” 

”Yes and yes! Now you’re getting it.” This thing that’d barged into her room was now laying on her bed, stretching its paws. ”You only have to say the magic words and my power shall be handed to you.” 

The black haired girl thought back to her throne and castle. Knights and wizards. Everything she had control over until she didn’t. How she ruled what was rightfully passed down to her. It was beautiful. Although those peasants seemed to disagree. 

She decided that this life was hers. 

The last time she met her doom. It had all been too soon, she only got to rule for ten years. Most of that time had been spent mastering a very niche type of water magic. If this cat wanted to give her its power she couldn’t refuse. 

”What are the magic words?” Her hands clutched at the baby blue dress she wore. A gift from her new ’mother’. 

Even though this creature had the face of a cat it almost smiled like a human would. ”Power on.” 

”That simple?” She raised a suspicious brow and met with the cat’s enthusiastic eyes. It nodded and she sighed.

”Yes! I’ll be out of your hair once you say it!” 

If this is what it took to get her power back she had to take the chance. Once she finds this evil the kitty was talking about and makes an alliance with it there will be no end to her rule.

1l6h6uu,mx22rtc,"I blink, trying to focus on my tormentor's face, and slowly clarity returns. Agony still jolts through me, but the worst of the pain is subsiding. I lie against the cool bed of pine needles, drained of energy and will to resist.

She has done something to me, I know. The snap of bone and tearing of flesh are still fresh in my ears, and the searing waves of excruciating pain feel as if they will live in my nightmares for eternity. Slowly, though, the pounding in my temples subsides and I am able to raise my head. The gesture feels alien... wrong, but before I can assess my state I see her.

She stands above me, her face a mask of ice, her gray eyes colder than midwinter's night. A sprig of yew smolders in one fist, its magic spent. She casts it aside, grinding the embers beneath her heel before they can kindle the dry needles.

""Look at me.""

There is command in her voice, and I cannot help but meet those frigid eyes.

""I told you that I would curse any interlopers to my domain. That you had forfeited your right to walk among the peoples of the deep wood.""

A smile, cruel and thin, emerges on her features.

""Mankind's hatred has no place here. I swore no human would set foot on this sacred ground, and so my promise is kept.""

Confusion. I try to speak, to beg her to listen, to ask what she means, but the words emerge only as a hoarse rasp. My tongue is too thin and the sounds will not emerge. I try to stand, to pull myself to my feet, and that is when I see them. Great black talons where my hands should be. They flex and move at my direction, but my mind cannot reconcile the difference. I look down at myself, panic bubbling in my throat like bile.

Only tatters of my clothing remain, torn free as the witch's magic took me. Glossy black scales interlock across the body... my body. Alien proportions and extra limbs combine to form a familiar, terrifying shape. My mind rebels involuntarily and I turn back to the witch, searching her face for some sign or confirmation.

Her smile grows, though it never touches her hard, pitiless eyes.

""You have been given a great gift. The gift of immortality. Of strength. Of magic. Of power."" She pauses, drawing out the suspense. ""And you have been cursed. You are what humanity most fears, and that which humans fear, they hate. They will hate you, and they will hunt you.""

""You are one of us now, dragon. One of the outcast and reviled. An enemy of your own people. They will not stop until you are dead, just as you have hounded me and my charges, now you too will be dogged.""

I try to speak once more, working my too-thin tongue in my too-long mouth until something resembling speech emerges.

""I... did not... hate you.""

A sneer replaces her cold smile, and I can see it writ plain across her face that she does not believe my words.

""I... came... for help.""

""Help? You came to me for help? Don't make me laugh. A decade ago when I made my home here, I offered your village my help. You spat on my outstretched hand. You cursed my name. You killed my friends."" For the first time, I see her expression crack. There is unfathomable grief behind that cold facade, and I feel my heart quail in the presence of such raw and terrible emotion.

""You killed my friends!"" She screams the words, tears streaking her cheeks. ""I warned you! I begged! I bargained! And your people only laughed and slaughtered! Humans know only hate. You know only hate.""

1l6h6uu,mx22van,"She slumps against a tree, her eyes squeezed tightly shut as her body is wracked by sobs. I stagger to my feet finally. Standing on two legs seems impossible, but with my arms and... with all four legs on the ground, I can at least stand.

""My father... sick. I came... to beg... help.""

She opens her eyes, wiping away tears, her rage apparently spent. When she speaks again, her voice is soft, morose, almost apathetic. ""And what makes you think I would help a human of your village? You who have shown me nothing but hate.""

""Father... he is the herbalist. He wants... peace. The village... needs him.""

""I care not what your village needs."" Her words are spoken as if by a dead woman. Dry and tired as dust.

""Please... he is... my father. I would give... anything to... save him.""

She shakes her head. ""You have given your humanity already it seems..."" She wipes her eyes again, staring past me in the direction of Riverside village. The home I can never return to. Finally, she seems to reach a conclusion. ""You say he desires peace?""

""Yes... he wants... to exist with the... woods people. He has... helped them... before.""

The witch's sorrow seems to have faded, and her focus returns. Her jaw clenches and her features are schooled into impassivity. ""Who has he aided? I know the names of the people of the wood, and if you speak true..."" She trails off, studying my face with those piercing grey eyes of hers.

""Silver fox... caught in hunter's... trap. It begged him... spare its life. He did. Treated its leg, released it. He never learned... its name.""

For the first time, the witch's features soften. ""Quick Jack is his name. I know his story well."" She nods. ""Then... I will return your father's favor. I will treat what ails him in thanks for his own kindness.""

Her face grows thoughtful. ""You, though... what to do with you. You have shown no kindness as your father has.""

I look down, flexing the long powerful talons that have taken the place of my hands. I think back, the memory of my life in the village bubbling to the fore as I consider my situation. The witch is right - the people of Riverside would fear me, hunt me, and kill me if they could. But was I not hunted before? ""The alchemist's lovely daughter,"" they called me, never bothering to use my name. They petitioned my father, pestered me, ignored my desire to learn his trade... was I any worse off now?

They might pursue me, but as I stared at those talons I saw in the witch's words the truth. She had indeed given me a gift. The freedom to live a life beyond Riverside's walls. Beyond that of a farmer's wife. My form might be changed, but in a moment of brilliant clarity, I realized I would not trade this gift for anything.

""I do not want... to go back.""

The witch froze, her stare fixed on me.

""I do not want... to be a wife... or mother. I want... more. I want... to keep the gift... you have given.""

Silence stretched out between us, a frozen moment that hung in the air until at last the witch spoke.

""Then it seems I was wrong about you, daughter of the herbalist. Come, then. Your new life begins today.""",8,1749578475.0

""You are for real?"" I asked the man, and the woman who just entered the room.  
They nodded.  
I should have known that I couldn't be that lucky.  
I recognized the man after he took off his headscarf as the king, and I thought ""jackpot!"", but then the Priestess entered my little abode, and I knew something was off...

This is a joke.

""The summoning failed, and the Goddess' voice led us here.  
You won't have to do a thing, but be there, and pretend to be on a quest.

Before I could answer, a knock was heard on the door.  
""Mom, are you decent?"" my son asked.  
""Yeah, sweetie, come in."" I said.

My eldest, along with my two little daughters, entered the room.  
""Money for vegetables, and a bit of meat please.  
I will cook."" he said, ignoring the king and Priestess, but the two little angels gasped at the Priestess' pristine robe.  
My heart ached, but I gave them the little money I had, and sent them on their way.  
""See? I am 34, with 3 kids, one of them old enough to be a Chosen One himself, as aren't the Chosen Ones usually like 18ish?"" I asked.  
""Marquessate will be yours, and I will make sure your kids get a princely treatment."" the king said.  
Dammit.  
They caught me.

""I am in for a ride, a different kind than usually, aren't I?"" I sighed.  
The king couldn't even look at me at this point.  
Not going to lie, I was proud a bit that my body could still cause men to blush, especially one who literally has a wife, and a dozen concubines.  
""You have an ability to make people comfortable around you.  
You have a ""charm"" based skill, don't you?"" the Priestess suddenly said.  
I shrugged.  
""Who knows, never had the money to test it, by 14? 15? I was working at the Capital's best brothel.  
Learnt how to make nobles and merchants feel good about themselves, so I don't think it's a power."" I said.  
""You will be perfect."" the Priestess said, leaving.  
""I will send the knights for you, my Lady."" the King smiled, as he left as well.

1l650ar,mwmizy2,"Being a vampire in the 1800s? Easy.

Foggy streets. High collars. Everyone had anemia and fainted if you looked at them funny. Pure golden age.

Being a vampire in *2025* ? Absolute nightmare.

There are cameras everywhere. People track their steps.

Blood donation centers ask *questions*.

And worst of all, the Vampire Hunters have a verified podcast now.

They called it **“Stakeholders.”**

I knew my days were numbered when they released an episode titled *“Episode 44: That Guy in Apartment 3B.”*

That was... me.

So, I made the only logical choice: I reinvented myself… as a *superhero*.

---

The night of my ""debut,"" I stood dramatically on a rooftop, wearing a tight crimson suit with an unnecessarily long cape and goggles to hide the red eyes. I called myself “**Crimson Twilight: Protector of the Night**.”

I stopped a mugging by hissing loudly and leaping from a second-story fire escape. The mugger screamed. The victim screamed. I screamed. Everyone screamed. Everyone ran. But hey! Crime stopped. Mission accomplished.

But, it was when I take down an incredibly corrupted person of authority, that my popularity booms.

News reports called me the ""Real Life Batman"". People began to trust me. Children drew me on their notebooks. Twitter had fan accounts. Someone started a rumor I was Robert Pattinson in method acting mode.

For a while, it worked.

I fed off criminals, from the street thugs to billionaires, politicians and government officials, purely for *justice reasons*, and blamed the suspicious blood loss on *“mysterious vigilante techniques”* that I refused to elaborate on, aside from ""It was Gotham logic"". No one questioned it. 

But then came my greatest foe.

**Agent Mallory Vex**, Vampire Hunter. Sunglasses indoors. Holy water in a reusable bottle. Textbook girlboss walking.

She showed up during my public Q\&A livestream.

I was halfway through a dramatic monologue, “*the shadows are not evil, merely misunderstood*” type shits, when she raised a hand and asked:

“Why does every criminal you ‘subdue’ have bite marks on their neck?”

I froze. The camera zoomed in.

“…Symbolic branding. Like Batman.” you said.

She narrowed her eyes. “Why do you never appear in daylight?”

“... Like Batman ?”

""Batman doesn't do public Q&A. And when he does, he appears in daylight too.""

""…Solar eczema.""

“Why do mirrors break when you pass them?”

“...Body dysmorphia?”

The livestream chat exploded. #CrimsonGate trended in twenty minutes. My followers were torn between ""he's totally a vampire"" and ""leave him alone he's a queer-coded icon.""

Desperate, I made one final move.

I stood atop the city’s tallest tower, cape billowing in the wind, and declared:

""Yes. I am a vampire. But I never feast on the innocent! I feast, on the wicked, the evil !""

Then I vanished into a cloud of bats.

It was *incredibly* cool.

And surprisingly, it worked.

The public accepted me. I leaned into it. Became the first vampire superhero. Even got sponsored by a synthetic blood company.

1l650ar,mwmeh05,"Joachim raised an eyebrow at me. ""Did you hear?""

I hadn't even sat down yet for fuck's sake! I was dressed a little differently than usual; no hoodie and beanie for me tonight. No, no, this was a meeting of old ones, and blending in with mortals was far different from meeting with other elders. Just to fuck with them, I was wearing a toga.

I sighed as I took my seat at the table; the last one here, naturally, but I lived on the opposite side of town. It had been a long time since Lydia had taken over the bomb shelter -- it looked far, far better than it used to when Xavier had been in charge. Good man, solid, one of the best, but no ability to decorate. It looked like a proper Edwardian haunt with a bit of Renaissance flair, and these chairs were insanely comfortable. I'd have to ask Lydia where she got them.

""I hear a lot of things,"" I said as I relaxed. ""So you will to have to be a little more specific.""

""The fool up north who is pretending to be a *superhero*,*""* Deidre hissed.

""Ah,"" I said softly, waving my hand dismissively. ""I've already sent my advisement that he be dusted two days ago.""

That got everyone's attention right quick. Just like I'd wanted. Those who agreed with me were amazed that I'd already sent word. Those who didn't were shocked that I'd even suggest that in the first place.

Alexander licked his lips, leaning forward. ""I'll circle back here in a minute, but you always stress that we should persevere and *not* kill each other.""

I fixed him with a flat stare. ""Normally, you're right. In the modern day and age, creating new progeny is... very problematic. Ah, the 1970s... Even the 1980s were such a different time. Anyway! Yes, it's better to preserve and reeducate any of us that get too... extreme. But I do understand why he did it. The moment that I knew what was going on, I understood his logic perfectly. He's desperate. Most likely, the hunters were already closing in and he knew it.

""Claiming to be a superhero, it's a brand new play. Hunters won't know what to think. Sure, he's painting a huge target on himself once they get bold. While some of the more tolerant ones will approve, you know how hunters are. If he isn't one of us, he's a loup-garou, or a demonhost, or worse, a horse. If--""

""Horse?"" Deidre asked.

She knew better than to interrupt me. Apparently I had shaken her. Keeping with the façade that I was putting on, I didn't look at her, instead examining my nails. ""Hoodoo. Religion from Africa, the basis of voodoo. Long story, don't ask. Short version is, a possession.

""There are hundreds of things that they will suspect him of. Which is fine. It might give them enough pause to let it play out. If he keeps up the act 100%, then they might not go after him.""

Lydia took over now. ""And for that you wish to see him dead?""

I shook my head. ""No. The hunters are the secondary concern for me now. My primary concern is the kine. Look, the mortals, the mundanes, the Gumps, whatever you want to call them, they're the issue. Doing good for the world, I approve of it. The hunters might barely tolerate it while watching him carefully. The mortals will approve of it. All well and good.""

Even if they let him do it, they're going to have to still do their jobs as constables of the masses. A cad gets a lucky shot with a gun and he isn't ready for it, that's blood and reports of gunshots. If he isn't wearing gloves, that's fingerprints. If he actually lets them interview him, that's not just them talking to him anymore, that's him on bodycam.""

I looked to Joachim before his face even had a chance to change. ""Yes, the police wear cameras on their person now. Be happy you're not in England; the entire city of London is covered by cameras these days.""

He had the decency to look aghast. Good on him!

""But, let's say that everything goes well. There will come a time, sooner or later, where they will need him to appear in court. No matter what. And despite everything, there is no Judge Harry Stone. There is no night court. So he won't be able to appear.""

I leaned back again. ""That's where everything breaks down. Assuming that the police have not taken offense to some vigilante doing their job, there will come a point in time where the commissioner will have their hands tied and will have to give the order to bring him in. This is a guarantee. They will track him, one way or another. They may try to arrest him on the street, or worse...""

Deidre had figured it out. ""They follow him home, they arrest him, they bring him outside, and the sun does the job for us.""

I nodded. ""Dura lex, sed lex. They will do their job, and he will die. Publicly, visibly, leaving a lot of evidence. Now, the hunters will help suppress it, they have as much of a vested interest as us in keeping the supernatural the stuff of myth and Hollywood. But even with their aid, it will be hard, and I suspect, it will be unsuccessful.

""I am not wanting to see him dead. But I believe that it is inevitable, and I would rather it be in a way where physical evidence is minimalized. And yes, I am including recordings in that category. As I said in my letter, should I have seen any other way, I would urge it first. But ultimately, so long as he maintains this charade, the danger to all of us increases.""

Joachim frowned thoughtfully before speaking. ""Since Alwin is still in the long slumber, I will send a missive myself."" With the local elder out of commission for what I suspected would be a few decades, it fell to his seneschal. Funny how Joachim always did what I said, though. I wasn't complaining about how handy it was for me, though! ""But... We supported the wrong people, I think, leading to our current situation.""

I nodded slowly. ""We did. Well, all of you did; I've never once strayed into national politics. I study it, predict it, use it to my advantage, but try not to involve myself with shaping a land's politicians. Our situation only promises to get worse. And he, sadly, is caught in the middle.

""As I said, I do not fault him for making the choice that is forcing us to purge him. We are all scared, hiding, and not living the immortal life which we believed that we would. But always, we must persevere. We must all learn from our mistakes, and make good choices from here on out.

I paused, then smiled at them. ""But please, the next time you want me to explain something like this, where you aren't going to ask any questions, please... This could have been an email.""

""But I do have a question,"" Joachim said quickly. ""One which I did tell you that I would circle back to.

""How did you know about him, and send your advisory so quickly?""

I laughed. ""Really? That is your concern? Ha! I'll have to introduce you to Fark and Reddit some day.""",35,1749368506.0
1l5wzp8,mwktzwg,"Lodrin had returned to his Holy Order from his supposed holy crusade, celebrating a successful hunt of an unholy demon worshipper that he had discovered trying to bewitch men with her voice.

In reality however, the girl he had killed was just a singer who had turned down his unwanted forceful advances towards her, strangling her in the alley he had cornered her in so she couldn't tell anyone about his true nature.

As his fellow Paladin brothers congratulated him for taking out another unholy heretic, the muffled sound of singing could be heard outside before the doors to their temple were forcefully blasted off of their hinges, leaving what appeared to be an extremely pissed off woman standing in the opening clutching a bloody necklace in her hand.

Before any of the Paladins could react, the woman began to sing, the fury in her voice barely contained as her words seemed to echo through the halls.

🎶""A Paladin has been honored upon a throne built by lies. His vile actions leave my daughter scavenged by flies. A song he will get and his story will be told. Let's see how he likes being the one left in the cold""🎶

As the woman's words reached Lodrin's ears, he could feel a chill run through his body as the temperature of the room seemed to rapidly drop into freezing temperatures. The other Paladins quickly reacted and reached for their swords, only to find that they were unable to be unsheathed because of the thick layer of ice encasing their weapons. Even the fireplace in their hearth which was blazing a moment prior was snuffed out as the temple was slowly encased in ice and frost.

🎶""This man claimed her life for denying his lust. His armor will fail him as it fades into dust. By killing this girl he has brought on my wrath. This mother is pissed and she's on the warpath""🎶

Lodrin felt the biting cold deep in his bones as his armor and weapons crumbled into dust and blew away in the icy winds, leaving him in just the minimal clothes that he wore under his armor.

As the woman finally entered the temple and began to slowly walk towards him, some of the other Paladins attempted to charge at and capture the mystery woman. The woman showed no fear as she let them approach, their bodies immediately decaying as they got close and collapsing into piles of empty armor and dust, leaving not even their bones behind.

🎶""He thought his secret safe after the poor girl's death. His true nature unknown as he took her final breath. With his Order's blessing he thought himself in the right. But now I will bring every one of his crimes into the light""🎶

Lodrin felt a chill run down his spine that wasn't from the cold as he felt a pull at his memories, seeing them magically displayed out in the open for the Paladins that hadn't been turned into dust to see. Every girl he had taken advantage of, every peasant he abused, every tithing he had stolen, each and every crime and sin Lodrin had ever committed was now out in the open to expose who he truly was.

His Paladin brothers viewed the truth and looked back at him with disgust, some of them even backing up to leave a path for the singing woman to approach Lodrin without anymore of their interference.

""No...no! Please, you have to believe me! This is all a trick! She's just manipulating you by making me look like the sinner instead! I swear that girl was a witch, she was trying to seduce me with her spells!""

Lodrin felt an armored fist strike him in the face as one of the other Paladins punched him in the jaw, the angry man looking down at him as they said ""Shut your lying mouth you disgrace, your words have deceived us for the final time. You won't sully the name of our Order any longer, you'll take your deserved punishment like the man you tricked us into believing you were. May the God's have mercy on your rotten soul, and pray that the lady grants you a swift death"".

The woman had made it to Lodrin who was now cowering on the floor, tears of fear streaming down his face and freezing almost as quick as they were shed. The bloody necklace she had been holding was now recognizable as the same one that the singing warlock he'd murdered had been wearing, most likely retrieved from her lifeless body after she was discovered.

The woman gave the Paladins a polite nod as they parted for her and exited the main hall, leaving Lodrin alone to his fate.

🎶""Now left all alone with not an ally in sight. The man now understands the true meaning of fright. For the girl that he'd slain had never done anything wrong. He now regrets killing the daughter of the Master of Song""🎶

None of the Paladins in the order ever talked about the remaining events of that night, the singing and drawn out cries of pure agony that lasted for hours burned forever into their memories. All that they ever spoke of was the Paladins that had been turned into dust were restored to their former selves by the morning as if by a miracle, one that they assumed was a parting gift from the woman that they never saw again. And if they still instinctually flinched at the sound of a woman singing? Well they could only hope and pray that another of their brothers never made the same decisions as the one now known as Lodrin the Defiler, the Eternally Punished Sinner.",411,1749342585.0
1l5wzp8,mwkzmxe,"Dimitri worked long and hard to find me. Tens of thousands of hours of effort, all for an uncertain request. Lacking magical talent of his own, he longed for the power only a warlock pact could give. Not to smite, not to control others. But to teach and to heal. When he came to my retreat, I assumed that he was like so many others who hungered for power for its own sake. But when I looked into his soul, I saw a peerless devotion to kindness and decency.

I became his patron, he was the first warlock I had pacted in eons. I gave him tomes to teach from. Ways of healing minds and bodies that his civilization had forgotten. Things that could be taught to any would-be healer, even ones completely disconnected from my own power.

I am ancient, but I am no god. There was a time when I was involved in their games, but I retreated inwards and retired from the ceaseless friction between powers on the cosmic stage. The older gods still remember me, remember the understandings we had. Petrin was one such god. We were neither friends nor enemies. She minded her business, and I minded mine. Both nominally aligned with the notions of justice and goodness, both content to leave the other alone.

So, imagine my surprise when, when I reached towards Dimitri through our bond, I found nothing. My heart lurched. There was only one way for the connection to have been severed without my involvement. Dimitri was dead. I rushed to the place he taught and healed to find it sacked. I found my dear warlock's body, and my keening shook the heavens. He died trying to defend a group of students, though they lived only seconds longer than he.

Incensed, I sought to find the attacker. I did not have to look far. A paladin, a supposed champion of the righteous, had cut down my warlock and his students. Rumors had spread about Dimitri's school, dabbling in 'fiendish magics' and 'affronts to common decency.' A supposed champion of Petrin of the title Menard Nightbane had descended upon the school, leaving no survivors. No evidence of demonic involvement was ever found, but none cared enough to hold this man to account.

I went to Petrin directly, demanding she disown this idiot brigand. She curtly informed me that she would look into it, and I assumed that would be it. But, as I watched, Menard was never summoned. He was not ejected from her paladin order, he was not in the slightest way punished for his crimes. Livid, I sought Petrin again, and received only a message from one of her lackeys, indicating she did not wish to see me.

And so now, I find myself returning to the world of cosmic politicking. I have been away long, but many can still dimly recall who and what I was. I want nothing more than to return to my quiet life, but this insult demands action. It will be a long time coming, Menard will be long dead by the time my plans reach fruition. But even the afterlife will not make him safe from me. For I am Tylin Damascus, The Mindshaper, and I will have my revenge.",160,1749344791.0
1l5wzp8,mwl2dxx,"He stood, invisible to the human eye over his beloved disciple, slain in the streets for his choice in patron. He watched, seething as the Paladin raised his bloody sword in triumph, *“I have slain the evil creature that came to harm our beloved city!”* cried the Paladin to the murmuring crowd.

Hesitantly, few of the people started clapping. They were unaware, he knew, as the entire crowd joined in. These people did not know the gentle, sickeningly sweet woman who was simply there to spread his name, to share his gifts of eldritch power, to make their lives easier, if only for a short while.

He never understood why so many gifted he and his beloved disciples the labeled of cruel, or evil. He was a creature of chaos, one who specialized in warping reality in unconventional ways. Yet he allowed his disciples to choose how to harness it. Many chose to do so for the good of others, to warp their destinies for a short while so that they may enjoy luck, health, love.

He quietly, almost unnoticed if it weren’t for the incomprehensibility that was his form, allowed himself to be witnessed, to be seen by this… *unworthy soul.*

“You.” He spoke calmly, the word echoing in ways that made no true sense. The paladin paused his flaunting, turning in surprise to the voice he *knew* was calling to him.

“You have slain one of mine.” He sighed tiredly, “Summon your patron, or face the consequences of slaying a true innocent alone.” The paladin stood in horror, a creature such as he rarely showed themselves to mortals, least they shatter their minds, but, he did not care. This creature had killed one of his few, and he hoped it suffered.

The Paladin did as he was told. Bukanor came at the request of her fearful disciple. She, like many other creatures of power, presented herself as a sort of human, one that emanated power, but human in appearance nonetheless.

She paused at the sight before her. One of her flock standing in front of one of her dear friends, who had manifested himself protectively of the corpse of a woman she could sense had once been his. 

“Ah.” With one last glance at her disciple, she asked,“Ifhamiltor, what has happened here?”

“Yours has slain mine,” *Again.* he silently added, “I request you strip him of your gifts, so that I might drag his wretched soul straight the furthest depth of hells.”

She turned with no hesitation to her soon to be ex-disciple in disgust. “You, one who has sworn to uphold my wish for justice, slain an innocent?” With a swish of her hand, continued, “I denounce you. I strip you of all I have gifted, and wish you the suffering you deserve.” With that, he wrenched the Paladins soul out of his body, taking it with him as far as he could go.

One of the shop keepers sighed, turning back to his regular, “Why must they keep breaking the rules their patrons set?”

1l5wzp8,mwm6k2e,"I had slept for a millennium, since the world's last cry, merely rousing every now and then, but never waking. Though when I had felt someone kneeling at my shrine, for the first time since it was built ... It made me wake just enough to grant the child my blessing. The child, only 17 years of age, wanted my power only to protect himself and the people he cares. It was noble, much more then any who else had managed to rouse me from slumber. So I tied a golden string to his soul, and bound it to myself, for him to always hold even a fragment of my power to do as he wishes.

Slowly even, I heard more voices, different from the boy. That boy had grown to become a man (by human standards) and speaking of the blessings I give, even while I sleep. The river that never floods because of my breath, the plants that grow because of my sleeping form. Slowly the priest, as others were calling him, was a bastion of safety for those that walked upon the earth and rejected by others. The kind boy, who talked to me every day, rousing me every now and then, just enough to get a blessing for the people ... truly one I loved like my own brother on high.

***SO WHY DID THE STRING SNAP?! WHY IS HIS SOUL GONE AND HIS BODY COOLING IN MY FIELDS?!***

For the first time, in millennia, since my brother forged this world .... **I AWAKE**.

===================================================================

The holy order of Reodus, who worshiped the god of the same name (the creator god of all), had a man enter into the temple, smiling widely as he holds the banner of his last crusade. ""Well I do think I did a good job brothers"" The paladin, named Atosh, looked at the others, throwing the banner to the ground. ""Another demonic cult annihilated!"" There were a few cheers, Atosh was a celebrity even among his brothers after all. Though not as many as he wanted, there was a pretty reward from the village that at least compensated for the bit quieter applause.

""Honestly, how do you find these places Atosh."" A squire, Atosh forgot the name of, asked him with shining eyes.

Atosh chuckles at that and shrugs, before putting on a brave face. ""It is simple. The almighty Reodus showed me the way."" Well that's how he took his 'faith'. A few whispers here and there, of a church of a man or woman speaking of another god other then Reodus. It was easy to follow up that and make the show of destroying a cult. ""Now how about I tell you all about the final battle"" Atosh says, about to 'beautify' the final 'battle' with the high priest he had killed.

But before he could say anything, the temple shook. Someone calls out ""It's an earthquake!"" While others scurry around, trying to prevent any destruction, Atosh's view is brought to the center. Standing there was a humanoid ... black hair with flecks of molten red .... looking like living stone. ""Demon!"" Atosh called out, the squire next to him jumping as others manage to notice the 'demon'.

The demon, as Atosh called him, looked around, several paladins moving to fight while more work to stop anything from breaking. Eventually though, the demon's eyes land on Atosh, before closing his fist, the shaking stopping. Though the earthquake was gone, there was a tension in the air, as if the very world was holding its breath. Atosh gulps and holds up his sword. ""Why are you here demon? Here to get exorcised like the scum you are?!"" Atosh growls, putting on a brave front, having gotten quite used to it after all.

1l5wzp8,mwn2fzx,"*Raiknorak did not give power to mortals, as a rule. While It conversed with them from time to time, sought out and observed interesting ones, It did not grant them power. Unlike its brother, who collected servants and worlds like a dragon hoards gold and jewels, Raiknorak was more focused, more __selective__ in its actions. As such, any mortal It __does__ grant power is all the more precious to It. A special project, to indulge in once in a while.*

*Such was the case with one humble scholar from an equally humble world. Gillam was his name, historian was his profession. He had found references to Raiknorak in damaged tomes and decayed scrolls, and like any fool who catches a glimpse of the World Beyond, began to seek more. But unlike those other fools, he did not crave power. No, he sought Understanding, something Raiknorak valued highly and greatly respected. SO when the mortal finally pieced the scattered references and whispered myths together and arrived at the doors to the Great Library, body broken and mind nearly shattered from the eldritch knowledge it took him to get here, he was welcomed like an old friend and granted respite within those great cosmic halls.*

*Despite the grueling and difficult journey he had undergone, Gillam was still but a humble scholar. He had simply requested the power to gain more Understanding, and to share the knowledge such gained with others. He was a teacher, you see. His aim was to expand all the world's knowledge, for all the world to see. And so it was granted, Raiknorak's blessing following him back to his own world where he could work to build the greatest House of Learning it would have ever seen.*

*So it was a bit of a shock then that when It looked into Gillam's world after some time to see his House burned into a smouldering ruin, his body hanging dead and defiled in the remains of his once great library, and his students either dead, in chains, or in hiding. Something had happened, some __Mortal__ had transgressed, in the name and with the approval of one of their paltry __Gods__. This __insult__ would not stand. Oh no, it would not.*

*Raiknorak was very different from Its brother in many ways, but one thing they did have in common: They would not abide the taking of what was __Theirs__.*

------

*The Holy Order of Puretánia had vanquished a den of unholy power and impure, eldritch knowledge, slain the Warlock in charge and halted the cult's world-conquering plans before they could properly begin. THe people rejoiced, and grand celebrations were set up post-haste. The centerpiece of course were the public judgement and execution of the cult's leaders, along with those followers who had not died or fled in the battle. Couldn't let any seed of impurity live, after all, you had to cut it out by the root.*

*It was during these celebrations that it happened. Right when the executioner was about to take the head of yet another of those vile heretics, the world suddenly came to a screeching halt. All time seemed to hold still, birds hanging in the air mid-flight, people frozen mid-stride. The axe held still mid-swing. And then the world....__inverted__. Red became blue, blue became red, yellow became purple, white became black, and so on as if a negative filter was pulled across reality. Space itself shook like a struck bell, and the sky split like shattered glass to very briefly reveal an incomprehensible kaleidoscope of eldritch colors and shapes. And then just as quickly as it happened, the world returns to normal. The sky is whole once more, colors are how they should be, and time flows once again*

*On the podium, holding the executioner's axe in one hand, blade against the palm and fingers digging into the metal as if it was clay, stands a young man. Dressed in shining white and shimmering turquoise robes accented with gold, with short grey hair and pale green eyes holding the weight of aeons of wisdom. His young face, visually no older than 20 years at most, calmly looks upon the crowd, before looking at the heretic tied in front of the executioner's block, and then at the row of heretic heads set on spikes behind the stage. His gaze lingers on the one in the middle, the head of the Dread Warlock himself, and reality briefly shimmers around him as __rage__ radiates from him for that same brief moment before the calm returns.*

*He next turns his gaze to the Head of the Holy Order, the one who reportedly had slain the Warlock in person, and __speaks__. All present can hear it as clearly as if the young man was standing right in front of them, and all can understand his words regardless of language or intellectual ability.*

__""So, you are the ones who so carelessly destroyed my pupil's work, then. A collection of ""holy"" warriors, drunk on your own power and in the service of a God who values purity of action over actual progress. I see now why my pupil came to me for the knowledge he sought, instead of his own Gods. I see now why he was so afraid to return, even if that had been his aim from the beginning. I see now that he was *right*.""__

*The square had fallen silent, the celebratory mood replaced with an implacable feeling of cold dread. Whatever this young man was, he was not mortal. Or even of this world at all. Raw power had begun to radiate from him the moment he had begin to __speak__, space distorting around his form like heat distorting the air. His eyes hard as the densest bedrock, his expression cold and emotionless like the depths of the ocean. It took the Lord Commander of the Holy Order everything he had to simply respond at all, with the weight of that __gaze__ enough to damn near physically pin him to his seat.*

""So you are the foul demon this Warlock and his flock had been worshiping? You are powerless here! Your machinations have already been brought low, and your followers dead or scattered! You can come here and posture if you wish, but you will not prevail against the wrath of Puretánia should you strike against us here!""

*The young man tilts his head a little as he listens to the Lord Commander speak, before....chuckling. An unsettling, dreadful sound, like a devil who had just signed a contract granting it ownership of a King's soul. The executioner's axe vanishes into smoke, and the executioner himself implodes and transforms into a thick, leather-bound book. Should that book be read, one would find it to be the full written account of the man's life up until that point, down to the last detail.*

__""Puretánia is a spoiled child who cannot handle others doing things she does not like. And you, her precious dolls. I do not fear her, or any of her ilk. They are children, playing pretend with lower realities while the adults ignore them in favor of more important things. But now one such child has broken something, something that was *mine*. So in return I shall break what is hers, a lesson in consequences that is clearly long over-due.""__

*The ground shakes as more power seeps out of the young man, buildings beginning to crumble as if made of brittle chalk, paving stones melting like wax, and weapons and armor tearing like paper as the Paladins attempt to fight. Screams begin to ring out as eldritch knowledge begins to seep into the minds of the people, flooding into their fragile mortal brains like a river flowing through a broken dam.*

__""And I am no demon, Mortal. I am Raiknorak, Cosmic of Order, Keeper of the Knowledge Cosmos and Steward of the Multiversal Library. You have transgressed against me in the name of your God, and so I shall respond in kind. Starting with *you*""__

------

*And so it was that the city of Hansadt, seat of power of the Holy Order of Puretánia, was no more. All the souls within lost to the World Beyond, with their life written in thick leather-bound books; The buildings and streets nothing more than fine dust, the only evidence of anything having been there at all being the fact that no living thing could abide to exist within what was once the city limits.*

*And so too it was that the Great Pantheon was shrunk by one. Once one of the Greater Deities, all mortal worship of the Goddess Puretánia ended with the sudden vanishing of her power in the world. The Gods, once indulgent, capricious, and petty in their dealings with mortals and each other, had become more stern, less permissive about the actions of their followers, less forgiving about mistakes made in their name.*

*And in the ruined remains of what had once been a great House of Learning, a young man dressed in white and turquoise robes leaves a tome of knowledge on a freshly-dug grave, surrounded by many more similar graves. He gently touches the ornate headstone, and whispers such that only he may hear:*

__""I am sorry my child, for my lapse in attention. It will not happen again. And I promise you, that your dream will come true. I will see to it myself, in your stead. May your soul one day find its way back to my Library, like your living self once did. I shall be there waiting.""__

*And then he rises to his feet, turning to face the small group of disheveled scholars and seekers of uncommon knowledge. He gives them a gentle smile, and motions for them to follow him as he walks away from the graves. THere was work to be done, and he would not delay it any longer.*",42,1749382360.0
1l5wzp8,mwmfn36,"""Let him go Morrow.""


*The light of the noon sun reflected off his jewled armor and threw brilliant rays of light across the jubilant crowd. It was a beautiful day and Edward soaked in both in the cheers of the people and the newly setting sun. It had been a long and harrowing chase but he had triumphed over the dasdardly warlock and was finally home to receive his reward. The crowd gently led him to the dias raised in his honor where the king himself was present to present his prize. The king bowed! As he lifted up a gem encrusted chalice the size of a cookpot. Edward s-smiled as he looked at the dead eyes of his daughter's severed head staring back at him from within the chalice. Edward lifted up the chalice and drank deep. It was a beautiful day.*


""Let him go Morrow.""


*The light of the noon sun reflected off his jewled armor and threw brilliant rays of light across the jubilant crowd. It was a beautiful day and Edward soaked in both in the cheers of the people and the newly setting sun. It had been a long and harrowing chase but he had triumphed over the dasdardly warlock and was finally home to receive his reward. The crowd gently led him to the dias raised in his honor where the first princess herself was present to present his prize. The princess curstied and passed him a set of immaculately engraved rings of gold. If there was any concern that the rings were on a severed hand or that one looked like a familiar wedding band it did not show on Edward's face. It was... It was a beautiful day.*


""Let him go Morro-""


""Be quiet Kerash, if you are not here to slay me then do not distract me. Even for myself keeping this filth's soul intact requires concentration.""


""I am not here to slay anything Morrow, I am here to save a soul in pain.""


""You will leave uncontent then. This man slew my daughter and raised her head as a scapegoat when he could not catch his quarry. He would rather embrace his inner demons than bruise his pride with failure. He choose poorly.""


""I will not leave without completing my mission Morrow.""


""Then draw your blade Kerash!""


Great roots the size of trunks of lesser trees undulated as Cust of Tomorrow, Greater Daemon of Time, 'stood' up to his full height. Morrow was a creature of legend and feared no one and nothing in the world. But he had no illusions about the result of the coming conflict. It was dark times. Even the once great paladin orders now filled with pompus and greedy rats who claim to be men of honor. But even in the waning world there a few true heros of legend and Kerash, the Paladin of Light, was one of them.


As a wee lad of 17 Kerash slew the lich which had overrun his hometown and as a youngling a decade older he was not head of his order only because he wished to continue to travel and spread good in the world rather than be tied down by desk work. Morrow raised great buroughs filled with bladed leaves and deadly snakes. But Kerash owned a blade forged with a dying god's last breath. Once he drew it there would be no question that it would be oak not flesh which would hit the floor.


The blade stayed sheaved.


""Let him go Morrow.""


Rage shook timber and earth as the Daemon cried out his pain.


""I will not Kerash! I have lived an age! And called only one my family! You will not be this wretch's salvation while I still live! You will pry his soul from my dead body or not at all!""


""I'm not here for Edward, Morrow.""


""Wha-""


""Let him go Morrow. Flowers once grew here did they not?""


Kerash reached out with a gauntlet grey and unadorned and a single dried petal lay on his palm. It was Fina's favorite flower. She said it reminded her of him. The tiny bit of delicate purple blew off of Kerash's hand and drifted in the air. Wisteria, yes he remembered helping Fina plant many of them by her home. Morrow gazed around him. A dull monochrome of grays and browns greeted him. The dead and drooping forms of once beautiful trees lined the countryside.


How long had he been here? Morrow gazed back at the soul lantern hanging on a thin inner branch. Edward's soul was once again marching triumphantly through the town. Once that soul had cried in anguish and despair. Now it simply smiled as it basked in the sun. Edward was no hero of legend. His soul had broken under the weight of his torment and needed to be constantly repaired so he could continue to suffer. Had been repaired so many times that... Was there even anything of the original wretch who had killed Fina left in there?


The branch trembled as it extended the lantern into the paladin's hands. Were those lines on Kerash's face there when they last spoke? Gray in his hair? An elvish prayer was whispered and the lantern and it's occupant crumbled to dust.


A paladin, some would say The Paladin, left the old man to his grief. Hopefully one that's now healthy and not all consuming. The sun filtered through branches which were once thick with beautiful flowers. One grotesque monstrous almagam of a soul destroyed, one old one hopefully saved. Kerash whistled and walked between the rays of gold. It was a beautiful day.",29,1749369154.0
1l5wzp8,mx7gqkw,"Mortehp’s fate was already set. That didn't mean he couldn't delay the inevitable. Every generation, he picked a single warlock. The Avatar of the World Eater.

Mortehp knew he couldn't avoid it forever, that one day his destiny would arrive. But this was different. Today, it had been forced upon him by another's hand.

Jess, his lone follower, lay dead. She'd been struck down by a knight, a holy paladin who followed the God of Justice. Mortehp felt something strange, a deep burning sensation. Finally, he put a name to it. *Rage*

That God would offer no challenge. Mortehp would make him beg on his knees just as he did when he first arrived all those millennia ago. Traveling to the realm of the Gods was a short ordeal, if you traveled through the right dimension.

He arrived in the realm of light, taking on a more presentable form. He forged himself into a humanoid shape made of infinite black, bearing two glowing red eyes. He quickly marched his way into the Hall of Scales.

Inside the large wooden building was a hall not dissimilar to a court in the mortal realm. On the opposite side of the entrance was the God himself. He was tall, and wore a fine suit and glasses. He looked up from a stack of papers to see Mortehp making a quick approach. His eyes widened.

“Ah, what brings you-” before he could finish his sentence, Mortehp scooped him up from his desk and slammed him against the wall.

“Please! Don't hurt me! We had a deal!”

“That was before your follower killed mine”

“He did *what*? I'm so sorry, I had nothing to do with this!”

“Nothing to do with it? He wielded your power. Your blessing allowed him to kill her.”

“Y-yes, but… that shouldn't have been enough to kill your avatar”

“She had just taken the mantle. She couldn't use my power yet.”

The God's eyes dropped to the floor as he muttered to himself in near resignation. But, he pushed himself for one final plea.

“Listen, your anger is misguided. It's the knight that killed her, right? He's who you want! Just a moment,” the God's eyes rolled back into his head, leaving only white visible.

In a mere moment, they returned.

“Sir Kristoph, that's his name. I can portal you straight to him! Do what you will with him, I won't intervene, I swear it!”

Mortehp's eyes flared, before settling back to their soft glow.

“Fine. If anything like this *ever* happens again, you and all of your worshippers shall suffer painful deaths.”

Mortehp released the God, who snapped his fingers, sending him to the mortal world. A few feet in front of him, he saw the knight walking down a dark alley alone. *Perfect.*

Mortehp froze the knight's legs in place. Even though he faced away from him, Mortehp could see the panic set in.

“Who's there! What have you done to me!” The paladin screamed.

“I am known by many names, granted to me throughout lengths of time you can't comprehend.”

“I'm a holy knight! I will smite you with the divine power of the God of Justice!”

“Your God's divine power is nothing to me. I made their whole realm cower when I first arrived. They feared me so greatly, they forged a pact. They would leave me alone, I would leave them alone. When the universe dies, I would make it anew in my own image as its lone ruler.”

Mortehp lurched forward, whispering over the knight's shoulder.

“They say the whole universe is interconnected. That we're all constructed from the very same materials as the stars above. That we're all just small parts of a grand cosmic chorus. When the last star cools, when the last hum of the heliopause dissipates… only I will remain. That is how I will be remembered. Not as a name. Not as a legend. Not as a shadow on the wall. But as a tone. The silent hum before finality. Be still, you need not be alive to worship.”

Mortehp raised a hand, and Kristoph was dead. He hadn't found as much satisfaction as he thought he would. Instead, he just felt... 

Alone.

My bearer, the singular mortal whose mind comprehended me in my entirety, lay dead and decomposing upon the side of the road. A word formed upon the lips of his spirit, a final attempt to cling to life. But the rules that I am are the rules he must follow. I take his spirit with me, I cradle it, I slowly draw away. He may go where he wishes, to any sort of afterlife he knew through me. 

As for his murderer? A paladin. Haughty and conceited in shining armor that would not protect him. As my bearer’s soul fades from me, and he finally forgets me, I draw ever closer to this man. His name is unimportant. His reasons, unimportant. He simply violated an ultimate rule of the existence which he inhabits. 

Certain secrets must be kept, not lost. 

The man dines happily this night. At a tavern, regaling customers with tales of how he vanquished an aberration today. But I see no reward in his future. And suddenly, I slip into his mind. 

He pauses. Looks around. Opens his mouth to say something. And as he speaks, his throat closes. His eyes widen and his nostrils flare. He knows of me now. He’s desperate now, scrabbling for a pen and paper. 

Each movement he makes crushes him further. The onlookers watch, horrified. He manages to choke out one last word before his throat shrivels away into nothingness and his head falls to the floor. 

“It.”

A pronoun. A risk, to be certain. And now I am hinted at to this tavern. Many of these people would ignore it. Assume it to be a dying gasp and nothing more. 

But one woman in the corner doesn’t ignore it. A certain spark lights in her eye. A curiosity that only I can sate.

Gaping in a fish's grimace, he still wore the parade mail polished to a shine with a gauntlet cased hand held in a warding gesture.

""You killed my friend maggot,"" I thought spoke to him, searing his mind for surface memories, ""Now justify it to me.""

The gibbering and half thoughts came as a torrent, but I got my answer from his thoughts.  Glory.  Fear.  Anxiety. Malice. 

This stupid ape spawn was a child in mind, even if a man in form.  But the king who sent him?  His wishes burned into the minds of his hired thugs until it became theirs, and he must answer.

Speaking of which....

""Great Emperor of Shadow.... Lord of Misfortune... God of the Midnight Sky....

""Silence you bloviating ape,"" I whispered as I called forth my old mortal shape.  While not dressed in the golden silk threads of the aged man, I was brimming with restrained power.  

""Yes... My.."" 

I stared at him, watching as he floated into the center of the massive hall.  Trapping mortals in a microgravity bubble is usually a party trick, but I wanted him to stop.

""You all disgust me.  But why don't we all take a trip through time?""

I ensnared their minds.  I showed them Kalsa, the Warlock they had the dumb ape murder over the plague.  They witnessed it all.  The drought that would have killed thousands in the kingdom and millions more across the southern lands?  She called the storms and kept it going until the aquifers were refilled, the rivers raging, and the lands green.  She even imbued the rain with magic, cleansing the land of the fallout radiation that had plagued life for generations.  Fucking aliens.    
  
The primate who slew Jalsa took the last revelation hardest.  Jalsa, in her last breath as mortal, cured him of an illness he didn't even know he had.     

""This is Kalsa, this is who you all feared.  Now I could throw you all into a blackhole, cause a radiation burst in this hall, or tear your souls from your bodies,"" I began, ""but Kalsa would never want to work with a monster.""

Kalsa stepped out of a void, fully restored to mortal life.

""I could have stayed in Paradise,"" she began as she pulled her spellbook from her tunic sleeves, ""But I still have a dream to make this world better, for all.""

1l5wzp8,mwm6mic,"The demon growled himself, before hand shaking, looking at the banner still sitting at Atosh's feet. In a deep voice, as if an earthquake was talking. ""So you were the one who killed my child."" Atosh raised an eyebrow, it wasn't a question, but a statement.

""Well a child of a demon is a demon. I'm just stopping a cult from destroying our realm!"" Atosh called out, puffing up his chest. He's never heard of this demon ... so it was probably easy to take down. ""And in the name of Reodus, I'll purify you!"" Atosh called out, getting ready to run the monster through.

At least he would have if the demon didn't put a hand on his face with a low groan. ""Oh brother, why must your holy temple be tainted by *filth* like this?"" The demon sighs, before taking a heavy step forward, many of the paladins getting ready to defend their brother. ""Do you know Reodus's domains?"" The demon asked, and Atosh, about to laugh, gets cut off AGAIN. ""My brother is the god of Creation, Order and Justice. He prefers not to interfere, even when his children are running amok, even as they fed the ground with blood. And yet, I did not awake."" The room is quiet, as Atosh has the demon's full attention, and thus the attention of the room.

""When my brother chose a child to give more power to, and the child had to slaughter his brothers and sisters because of corruption both in himself and in the church, I did not awake. Yet here I am ... Because"" The demon shook, before like a rushing river being flooded, Atosh is grabbed by the neck. ""You killed my child, one who asked not for himself, but for others."" The demon shook as he glared at Atosh, who flinched as eyes, almost seeming like molten slag glared up at him. ""Because of his own rules, my brother can only punish you when your soul returns to the forge of life, but I will do as I must. My domains are Destruction, Chaos and Judgement! I judge not just for my child's lost life, but also for the sins that stain my brother's light! With your own tongue, confess your sin!"" The demon, no god as the onlookers realized, ordered Atosh, and thus he started to speak.

He spoke of what he did, the times he forced various bar wenches to have sex with him, the money he stole not just from the temple, but from those of 'lower status'; even the times he had a squire 'witness' his power by taking his lover's body and life. The more Atosh spoke, writhing in the burning grip, the more the people had images of disgust on their faces. The squire especially, taking a step back and almost looking sick as Atosh couldn't help himself.

The god looks at the rest of the paladins, growling as he smiles, realizing that he had made the message clear as Atosh's lips finally closed shut. ""Remember this, for next time this happens, one life might not be enough to sate my rage. Once I set my child's body to rest, and this cur, I will sleep once more."" With that, the god vanished, along with Atosh, still writhing in the god's hand.

After that, not many spoke of Atosh, saying he is being judged for his sins. The squire in particular, had done research and balked, realizing that the world was about to end, since somehow Atosh had awoken and angered the twin brother of Reodus, Soroma the god of destruction.

1l5wzp8,mwmez2l,"That was very much the style I was going for, switching it up between 3rd person narration and Lodrin's perspective of what was going on. Swapping between 1st and 3rd perspective could admittedly be confusing for some, but the point was that the only perspective not being told is from The Master of Song herself because her mind is too hyperfocused on inflicting pain and suffering onto Lodrin to be a reliable narrator.",12,1749368770.0
1l67s50,mwqapri,"""You're clearly just messing with me.""


""Yeah, I am."" The djinn before me smirks, his eyes lighting up at my frustration. ""Makes you want to tear your hair out right?""


I look at the embodiment of arcane power, his wispy figure sparking with ethereal flames, his eyes alight with violet malevolence and shake my head.


""Listen, this isn't going to work out. I'm sorry, but, these assignments aren't tricks. They're not about finding double entendre's or synonyms or loopholes."" I proffer my hand, ready to shake his. ""I think we're going to have to let you go.""


""Ha, I knew it—Wait. Wait. Shit. Wait, what?""


""I suppose I...wish you well. And yes, I'm doing so knowing you'll probably make a very literal well in the middle of the office, and I'll have to get Al or one of the other Senior Djinn to fix it. But even so."" I smile at the young Djinn before me with all the kindness I can muster. ""I still wish you well.""


""I don't understand. I...I did what you wanted?"" He looks confused, resigned, angry. All emotions I've seen before. His eyes have shifted to the sickly green of anxiety. It never gets easier. ""I followed every instruction to the letter!""


""Making someone attractive only to flies? Setting a teenager on fire because she wanted to be hot?"" I conjure up the stack of Jezeriah's many, many misdemeanors. ""Killing someone's entire family in a house fire, so that the child would get an insurance payout and become rich? I mean, that one's not just brutal, it's uncreative.""


""Well, they keep making boring wishes. It's so shit. What am I supposed to—""


""You FULFILL THEM. You do it even if it's boring. ESPECIALLY if it's boring!"" It takes me a second to realize I've been raising my voice, and I only arrive at that conclusion because Jez's ethereal blue flame has turned the piss-yellow of fear. Deep breaths. Deep breaths. ""You don't want the interesting ones, the ones that Al and Dave and Tia deal with. Those are the shit ones.""


""I don't understand.""


""You don't want the interesting ones. The ones that involve homicide. Or torture. First week on the job as a team lead, this child comes to me. Asks if she can go to sleep and not wake up."" Her name was Amelia. ""You know what I did?""


""What?""


""I granted her wish. Because whatever she wanted to get away from, it was worse than being awake. And I made damn sure she had sweet dreams, good dreams of love and care.""


The piss-yellow intensifies. 


""So yeah, Jez. You get someone wanting to be rich? You give them a stack of gold coins, just enough that it won't crash the goddam global economy. And you say good day, and you go home to your wife and you sleep."" I sigh. ""And you can bitch about the shit work at the water cooler, but you've only been here two millennia, and one day, you'll learn that there are people who need wishes twisted and people who don't.""


""God—""


""Don't say that here."" 


The piss-yellow glows a little before settling into a pale blue. The green anxiety in his eyes turns into a gentle, neutral gray. 


""Give me a chance. One more."" 


He's pleading. I don't like when they plead, because I always agree, and I always regret it. But the blue and the gray... Djinn wear our emotions on our sleeves. 


""One more, but I'm watching you. I've got a guy in the Sahara, found himself a polished gemstone, he's rubbing it right now."" I narrow my eyes. ""He said he wanted water. What's the plan?""


""I'm going to dump him at the bott—""


I glower at him. Jez gulps. 


""In a river in—""


More glowering. 


""Okay fine, in an oasis. In an oasis, three miles south.""

""Good. I'm still watching. Remember. It's not the words, it's the spirit.""


With a wave, I send him on his way. I've got a few wishes of my own I need to fulfill. And I want to check in on Amelia's eternal sleep, make sure she's comfortable.",17,1749420394.0
1l6g7d6,mwoswb8,"The first time I died, it was under a flickering streetlight behind a liquor store that smelled like cat piss and expired dreams.
It was raining, because of course it was. One of those sideways rains that feels personal. The kind that slaps you across the face like a bar fight. I was sprinting. wet shoes, heart pounding, lungs full of panic. I slipped in an oil puddle and landed on my back just in time to catch the full weight of a crowbar to the chest.

Everything went snap.

And then, nothing. As if  the universe took out the trash and I was in the bag.

Then: A gentle chime. Like the Windows 95 error noise. And a floating gray box, perfectly rectangular, appeared in the void like it had always been there.

*You died horribly.*
*Do you want to try again?*

 [Yes]  [No]

I mean... what else was I going to do?

I clicked [Yes].

**Run 2.**

Snow. A mountain trail. Pine trees whispering secrets to each other while my boots crunched fresh powder. It was kind of beautiful.

Until the snow gave out under me and I fell into what I can only describe as the sharpest ravine on Earth.

**Run 7.**

Chased by feral children through an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese during some kind of apocalyptic rave. Don’t ask. Just… don’t.

**Run 34.**

This one tricked me.

A small coastal town with birds that didn’t steal your fries. A clock repair shop. A woman named Elsie who smelled like lavender and old books, and looked at me like I was the last good thing on Earth.

We had 40 years. Real, honest-to-god years. I aged. Got knee problems. Grew to love soup. We had a cat named Leon who would attack your feet but only if you sang off-key (which was weirdly accurate).

Then one day, I died at my own retirement party. Slipped on spilled punch, cracked my skull on the stereo.

And yep—*ding*.

*You died horribly. Do you want to try again?*
 
[Yes]  [No]

I hovered over [No] for a long time. Like… a long time. The void felt like it was watching me.

I clicked No..

Another box popped up:

*Are you sure?*

[Yes]  [No]

I clicked Yes..

It blinked.

Then this:

*You’re not ready to stop. Try again.*

[Yes]

There was no [No].

Cute.


**Run 87.**

At this point, I started testing the system.

Drowning? Yep. Volcano? Check.(ouch). Bullets to the chest? been there...
 No matter what, it came back. Same cheery little message, like a customer service agent in Hell.


**Run 172.**

I met Elsie again. Different life. Different setting. This time we ran a goat farm in Vermont. I had calluses and opinions about fencing. We were happy in that stupid, quiet, nothing-special kind of way.

Then she died in a car crash. A deer, a bend in the road, and the sound of my world cracking in half.

I tried to die again. Couldn't take it.

But this time… no box.

I woke up in our bed the next morning, pillow still warm, air still smelling like her shampoo.

I lived. Slowly. Badly.

I stopped shaving. Grew tomatoes. Argued with the cat . And eventually, I just… aged. Quietly. Like background music.

One night, I closed my eyes on a porch in autumn, wrapped in a blanket that still smelled like her.

*Ding.*

*You died peacefully.*
*Do you want to try again?*

[Yes]  [No]

I smiled.

Clicked [Yes].

1l6qh64,mws3sx4,"How many times have I died? 

I've heroically sacrificed myself against armies. Against dragons and demons. Against giants and fey. Every time, it would be so the rest could escape. And every time, our party's cleric would revive me, shake her head, and inform me the day was lost. 

Consequences to our losses were widespread. Wars, even wars between planes, and apocalypses have happened in the face of our defeat. But we always got back up and won eventually. Victory was always our goal, right? We should be happy every time. 

But there was one victory that was worse than any defeat. I didn't realize the toll our deaths were taking on the rest of my party. Our minds weren't right anymore, nor were our bodies. It didn't matter, as long as we made the world a better place, I thought. 

Seemed I was the only one. Everyone else defected long ago. But there was another magical planar apocalypse after we split. So we all teamed up, one last time. Just like the old days. Only not at all. We were fighting amongst ourselves. We hurt each other's feelings. And then, we discovered we caused this apocalypse. We chased a cloaked figure to a portal deep underground. Their magic was in the process of activating it. We had destroyed so many already. I wasn't sure we could do another one. 

""Stop! Fiend!"" I called out. 

""Or what? You'll kill me?"" a girl's voice echoed out. It was layered with something demonic. I knew it sounded familiar, but couldn't place it with the other voice layered on top of it. 

""Yes!"" our party's barbarian said. 

""No,"" said our cleric. 

""Maybe,"" I said. ""I don't wanna kill you if I don't have to."" 

She laughed. 

""I have been waiting for you, you know,"" she said. ""So we could talk about why this is all happening."" 

She removed her cloak and I gulped. It was my own daughter under there.

""Esther,"" our cleric said sympathetically. ""I'm so so-"" He was about to put a hand on my shoulder, but I brushed him off and interrupted his apology. 

""Don't. I . . . just don't,"" I said, then regarded my ""daughter."" ""I know that's not really you, Primrose. I know this is a demon talking. If you're at all in there -"" 

""She's not,"" the demon said with a smile. ""You don't realize it, do you? Still haven't connected the dots?"" 

""Esther,"" the wizard chimed in. ""Esther, we need to leave. Now."" 

""You know what the demon's getting at, don't you?"" I asked, my tone colder than I meant it to be. 

""It wouldn't benefit you to know,"" she begged. ""Please -"" 

""What don't I realize, o foul demon?"" I asked.",5,1749445120.0
